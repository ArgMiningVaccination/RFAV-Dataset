Being in its vegetative state--the plasmodium-- the slime mold configures its protoplasmic network to optimize its geometry with relation to patterns of attractants and repellents . The slime mold's adaptability, polymorphism and aestheticism inspired artists and architects . It has been seen as a self-conscious liquid form continuously changing its shape in response to external stimulation and due to interactions of thousands of micro-oscillators in its body . Elusiveness is a magic feature of the slime mold . One moment it gives you a solution to a mathematical problem by a shape of its body, the next moment it changes its shape and the solution disappears . Slime Mould in Arts and Architecture presents a set of unique chapters written by leading artists, architects and scientists, which resulted from creative translations of slime mold behavior into forms and sounds, unconventional investigations and sensorial experiences and the slime mold ability to remove boundaries between living and artificial, solid and fluid, science and arts . The book gives readers unique tools for: designing architectural forms and creative works; understanding how pro- cognitive living substrates can be used in everyday life; and sparking new ideas and initiates further progress in many fields or arts, architecture, science and engineering .

Biochips have already made a profound impact on various application domains such as clinical diagnostics, DNA analysis, genetic engineering, and drug discovery, among others . They are capable of precisely manipulating micro-/pico-liter quantities of fluids, and provide integrated support for mixing, storage, transportation, and sensing, on-chip . In almost all bioprotocols, sample preparation plays an important role, which includes dilution and mixing of several fluids satisfying certain volumetric ratios . However, designing algorithms that minimize reactant-cost and sample-preparation time suited for microfluidic chips poses a great challenge from the perspective of protocol mapping, scheduling, and physical design . Algorithms for Sample Preparation with Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip bridges the widening gap between biologists and engineers by introducing, from the fundamentals, several state-of-the-art computer-aided-design (CAD) algorithms for sample preparation biochips .

Bhandari Getting the Climate Science Facts Right - The Role of the IPCC discusses climate change science with reference to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) . Addressing climate change is the most important public priority of the 21st Century . Unlike many issues, however, this one is being driven by both science and its interface with politics . The main institution for bridging this division between science and international politics is the IPCC . As such it is the main source of the facts from which climate change policy is developed . This book describes the ways in which the IPCC arrives at these facts and so can be sure they are complete and evidence based . Seldom in history has science had such a direct relationship with politics . The negotiation of an international policy regime requires, at its outset, an agreement on the facts . In this case, the facts are scientific, complex and contentious . Governments have recognized this and have, by using the IPCC, set up institutional machinery to provide facts from a source and in a manner that they can accept . The way in which the IPCC functions is unique in that it melds the way in which science achieves consensus with the way governments does at the international level . Starting with a process to examine, review and debate scientific findings leading to a consensus about scientific fact, usually expressed as probabilities that the findings will hold over time, the IPCC then concludes by using the kind of consensus-development mechanism that the United Nations typically uses to achieve agreements leading to the formation of policy regimes .

Bhandari This second edition of the book Green Web-II - Standards and Perspectives from the IUCN Program / Policy Development in Environment Conservation Domain: investigates the IUCN's role in global biodiversity conservation policy as well as in national program development in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh . It explores how nature protection priorities and approaches are promoted or addressed by IUCN, and how environment conservation policies are created and maintained in states of South Asia with different capacities . It also evaluates IUCN's competency in biodiversity, climate change, nature conservation and environmental policy formulation at the global, regional and country levels . This book adds to our knowledge firstly by contributing to a small but growing body of work on the sociology of international organizations . International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), have previously been mainly the subject of political science . Secondly, it critically explores one of the largest and most active nature conservation organizations in the world . Thirdly, it also explores how IUCN actually goes about building protectoral programs with individual member nations . Finally, the research also shows the historical development of global institutions and IUCN's activities with member nations in helping to define or redefine the concept of global governance . The outcomes of this research will also be beneficial for global collaboration, networking, and for the identification of common concerns among the many environmental and conservational organizations at the international and national level . In this broader sense, the research outcomes might be beneficial to constituencies of the global North as well as global South because of the nature and coverage of IUCN and its role in conservation policy formation . This effort may serve as a model for additional research on international organizations . THE AUTHOR: Medani P.

Bhandari and Shvindina Hanna The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of global goals that meet some of the most pressing challenges facing our world today . Goal 10 concerns reducing global inequalities . Inequality is currently seen in the social, political, and economic structures of communities at both the national and international level . The United Nation's approach to sustainable development is to create a set of goals and targets to try to minimize the accelerating gaps of inequality . The book presents new insights for evaluating the progress on SDGs (especially goal 10); it also boldly sets new economic, social and environmental targets for reducing inequality . Using case studies, this book encourages readers to view economic development through the lens of growing inequalities and disparities . Such inequalities are clearly becoming more obvious as the world is better connected, and information is quickly shared . The book's main aim is therefore to direct the efforts of scholars, practitioners and policymakers to swiftly find the balance between the three pillars of sustainable development . The main challenges and focus of each chapter are different and collectively they give an integrated understanding of the phenomenon of sustainable development and its diverse aspects .

The classic solution to maximizing a well's productivity is to stimulate it . The basis for selecting stimulation candidates should be a review of the well's actual and theoretical IPR . Low permeability wells often need fracturing on initial completion . In low permeability zones, additional post stimulation production can be significant to the economics, however, the production engineer needs to make management aware of the true long term potential or else overly optimistic projections can easily be made . The main purpose of stimulation is to enhance the property value by the faster delivery of the petroleum fluid and/or to increase ultimate economic recovery . The aim of reservoir stimulation is to bypass near- wellbore damage and return a well to its \"natural\" productivity/injectivity, to extend a conductive path deep into a formation and thus increase productivity beyond the natural level and to produce hydrocarbon from tight formation . Hence, to improve productivity of the well matrix stimulation and hydraulic fracturing are intended to remedy, or even improve, the natural connection of the wellbore with the reservoir, which could delay the need for artificial lift .

It consists of a series of vertical shafts in sloping ground, interconnected at the bottom by a tunnel with a gradient flatter than that of the ground . From the air, this system looks like a line of anthills leading from the foothills across the desert to the greenery of an irrigated settlement . In a traditional realm, qanats are embraced by a socio-economic system which guarantees their sustainability . The facets of this socio-economic system operate closely together and make it possible for the qanats to remain into the future . Veins of the Desert shows that digging a qanat requires a variety of sciences and technologies, though at a glance a qanat is just a horizontal tunnel which drains out groundwater . A qanat is a feat of technology left from our ancestors\u2014hidden underground, but its technical importance is apparent and not less valuable than such surface structures as bridges, castles, towers, etc . A qanat enjoys extended structures and sometimes its length reaches tens of kilometers . It passes through geological formations and faces different conditions and obstacles; this has led to the accumulation of knowledge in terms of qanat construction over time, which has been handed down from generation to generation . A qanat is one of the most complicated traditional technologies, which requires knowledge on nature ranging from groundwater to management . This indigenous technology is used to bring water efficiently from tens of kilometers away to the thirsty lands . This book also gives insight into the cultural and social heritages which have crystalized around this technique, still influencing the social life of the people living in such regions as the central plateau of Iran where qanats have been the only means of supplying water . This technology is the focal point of the genesis of a particular civilization in the arid and semi-arid regions of Iran . Thus, the qanat is not only an irrigational means, but it should be seen as a technical and cultural legacy which deserves more attention . This book is a small encyclopedia on the qanat system, providing readers with easy answers to their questions about different aspects of this ancient technology .

They are \"systems of collaborating computational elements controlling physical entities .\" Cyber Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) are considered \"The Next Computing Revolution\" after Mainframe computing (60's-70's), Desktop computing & Internet (80's-90's) and Ubiquitous computing (00's); because all aspects of daily life are rapidly evolving towards humans interacting among themselves as well as their environment via computational devices (often mobile), and because in most cases systems will employ their computational capabilities to interact among themselves . CPSoS enable the physical world to merge with the cyber one . Using sensors, the embedded systems monitor and collect data from physical processes, such as the steering of a vehicle, energy consumption, or human health functions . The systems are networked making the data globally available . CPSoS make it possible for software applications to directly interact with events in the physical world, for example to measure and react to changes in blood pressure or peaks in energy consumption . Embedded hardware and software systems crucially expand the functionality and competitiveness of vehicles, aircraft, medical equipment, production plants and household appliances . Connecting these systems to a virtual environment of globally networked services and information systems opens completely new areas of innovation and novel business platforms . Future CPSoS will have many sophisticated, interconnected parts that must instantaneously exchange, parse, and act on detailed data in a highly coordinated manner . Continued advances in science and engineering will be necessary to enable advances in design and development of these complex systems . Multi-scale, multi-layer, multi-domain, and multi-system integrated infrastructures will require new foundations in system science and engineering . Scientists and engineers with an understanding of otherwise physical systems will need to work in tandem with computer and information scientists to achieve effective, workable designs . In this tutorial, basic and advanced issues on the design of the future heterogeneous CPSoS are presented including relevant Blockchain technologies, reconfigurable systems, advanced sensor interfaces and human-centered design processes . Certain advanced tools for the design and implementation of the cyber parts of the CPSoS (i .e . FPGA design tools from Xilinx) are also covered .

Since mobile terminals inherently operate on batteries, their power budget is severely constrained . To keep up with the ever increasing data-rate, an ever-decreasing power per bit is required to maintain the battery lifetime . The RF oscillator is the second most power-hungry block of a wireless radio (after power amplifiers) . Consequently, any power reduction in an RF oscillator will greatly benefit the overall power efficiency of the cellular transceiver . Moreover, the RF oscillators' purity limits the transceiver performance . The oscillator's phase noise results in power leakage into adjacent channels in a transmit mode and reciprocal mixing in a receive mode . On the other hand, the multi-standard and multi-band transceivers that are now trending demand wide tuning range oscillators . However, broadening the oscillator's tuning range is usually at the expense of die area (cost) or phase noise . THE EDITORS: Masoud Babaie is at Delft University the .

Apart from being spectrally efficient with overlapping subcarriers, the OFDM system enables simplified equalization at the receiver and effectively combats the inter-block interference with cyclic prefix . For achieving low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in the uplink, single carrier frequency domain multiple access (SC-FDMA) is used for fourth-generation (4G), long term evolution (LTE) . SC-FDMA achieves low to OFDMA using discrete transform (DFT) precoding . This book introduces both OFDM and SC-FDMA, similarities, and differences between their transmitter and receiver operations, time- frequency representations, and low complexity joint equalization and CFO compensation (JECC), etc . Advanced as OFDM, FBMC, GFDM, etc . are also introduced . To improve the throughput of existing mobile communication, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system configurations based on OFDM are also covered . Essentially, the performance of both the OFDMA and SC-FDMA is very sensitive to the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO) arising from synchronization errors, Doppler, and manufacturing defects . This is because the multicarrier structure and the channel decomposition at the receiver based on DFT lose its optimal performance in the presence of CFO . This book discusses an elegant time-frequency signal processing tool for this purpose called fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) . A discrete version of FRFT (or DFRFT) employing a chirp basis in place of the complex exponential basis of DFT can easily replace the existing multicarrier modulation/demodulation and channel decomposition . A detailed performance evaluation of the DFRFT based OFDM system that can significantly outperform the conventional DFT based OFDM system is also given . The study presented involves a detailed interference analysis of the DFRFT based OFDM system in the presence of CFO . This inter carrier interference (ICI) analysis is then used to devise Low complexity JECC for DFRFT based OFDM . Through the study and result presented in this book, the use of the DFRFT based OFDM system is motivated for wireless mobile communication especially in the presence of CFO . THE AUTHORS: Vinay K.

Consequently, there are challenges that need to be tackled for the future generation of WSNs . After giving an overview of the WSN protocols and IEEE 802 .15 .4 standard, this book proposes IEEE 802 .15 .4 Medium Access Control (MAC) sub-layer performance enhancements by employing not only RTS/CTS combined with packet concatenation but also scheduled channel poling (MC-SCP) . Results have shown that the use of the RTS/CTS mechanism improves channel efficiency by decreasing the deferral time before transmitting a data packet . Furthermore, the Sensor Block Acknowledgment MAC (SBACK-MAC) protocol enables more efficiency as it allows the aggregation of several acknowledgement responses in one special Block Acknowledgment (BACK) Response packet . The throughput and delay performance have been mathematically derived under both ideal conditions (a channel environment with no transmission errors) and non- ideal conditions (with transmission errors) . Simulation results successfully validate the proposed analytical models . This research reveals the importance of an appropriate design for the MAC sub-layer protocol for the desired WSN application . Depending on the mission of the WSN application, different protocols are required . Therefore, the overall performance of a WSN application certainly depends on the development and application of suitable e .g ., MAC, network layer protocols .

The main aspects of these types of systems are Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Cloud and Communication Networks . The data which needs to be disseminated from multiple sources to the destination base station, or sink, is of vital significance . There are many problems which can occur when data is conveyed to the sink . The sink is connected to the cloud via a communication network . The congestion, reliability, delay, fairness, etc . are all of main concern . These can be treated as Quality of Service (QoS) parameters that govern the performance of the CPS . Above all, energy consumption is the main constraint for WSN node . It is extremely difficult to obtain good QoS by keeping energy consumption low . Even the response of one of QoS parameter depends on the many other QoS parameters . Care must be taken on all QoS parameters in order to improve the performance of the wireless sensor networks . This Quality of Services may improve the application base of the CPS . With the QoS parameters the data dissemination along with energy optimization is affected . The performance of the WSN needs to be regularly checked against the QoS metrics for different data inputs . This may contain the periodic- or non-periodic data, event based data, transient or busty data .

Philips Semiconductors faced this problem when they needed to connect many ICs together . The automotive industry faced the same problem when it needed to connect tens of microcontrollers in each car . Recently, with smart homes, the problem has started to be part of each home . For instance, you may want to build your smart home with accessories from different manufacturers and you want the devices to \"speak\" to each other . Added to that, you may want to control them from a central App or voice assist . Solutions for this problem started with the introduction of Inter Integrated Circuits (IIC) and Controller Area Networks (CAN) . Both solutions are wired networks that allow ICs and microcontrollers to be connected in a network to communicate together . In smart home automation, a number of common smart home automation protocols that allow different devices to speak and communicate together have appeared during the last few decades . Some of the smart home protocols come under the umbrella of what is called the \"Internet of Things (IoT) .\" The proposed protocols can be grouped into wired networks e .g . X10, UPB; wireless or radio networks as ZigBee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth; or dual (wired and radio) such as Insteon . This book introduces the reader to some of the most popular microcontroller and smart home networks . THE AUTHORS: Dawoud Shenouda Dawoud is at International University of East Africa, Uganda .

To connect any device to the bus, an external device must be used as an interface which will put the message in a form which fulfills all the electrical specifications of the port . These specifications are called the \"Standard .\" The most famous such serial communication standard is the RS-232 . In IT technology, communication can be serial or parallel . Serial communication is used for transmitting data over long distances . It is much cheaper to run the single core cable needed for serial communication over a long distance than the multicore cables that would be needed for parallel communication . It is the same in wireless communication: Serial communication needs one channel while parallel needs multichannel . Serial Communication can also be classified in many other ways, for example, synchronous and asynchronous; it can also be classified as simplex, duplex and half duplex . Because of the wide spread of serial communication from home automation to sensor and controller networks, there is a need for a very large number of serial communication standards and protocols . These have been developed over recent decades and range from the simple to the highly complicated . This large number of protocols was necessary to guarantee the optimum performance for the targeted applications . It is important for communication engineers to have enough knowledge to match the right protocol and standard with the right application . The main aim of this book is to provide the reader with that knowledge . THE AUTHORS: Dawoud Shenouda Dawoud is at International University of East Africa, Uganda .

With the advancement of new generation mobile communication systems, directed beams save a substantial amount of RF-power, and improve the noise immunity . In this regard, beam-forming circuits, namely, digital phase shifters constitute essential parts of the antenna arrays . Therefore, this book is devoted to design of digital phase shifters for various communications systems . In the good old days, phase shifter design requirements used to demand narrow bandwidth with no physical size constraints . Nowadays, they must be compact and suitable for Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits (VLSI) or Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuit (MMIC) implementation with Wide Phase Range (WPR) and Wide Frequency Band (WFB) . Since the 1980s, the author has been designing digital phase shifters for various applications . He started to work with loaded lines phase shifters, and then employed branch line couplers to achieve wider frequency bands . In order to reduce the physical size, he used a 3 element Symmetric LC ladder based T or PI configurations . In order to achieve broad frequency band with large phase range, usage of LC lattice structures is inevitable . Lately, the author has designed phase shifters using both lowpass and highpass LC ladder and lattice based switched-structures, which are suitable for monolithic implementation . In the course of design, MOS transistors were employed as switching elements . This book includes several novel digital phase shifter topologies, which provides wide phase range and wideband operation . For each topology presented, explicit design equations are provided and programs to assess the electric performance of each topology is developed in a MatLab environment . It is expected that the reader will be self-sufficient to design and implement the digital phase shifters topologies presented in this book .

HAPs are quasi-stationary aerial platforms that carry a wireless communications payload to provide wireless communications and broadband services . They are meant to be located in the stratosphere layer of the atmosphere at altitudes in the range 17-22 km and have the ability to fly on demand to temporarily or permanently serve regions with unavailable telecommunications infrastructure . An important requirement that the book focuses on is the development of an efficient and effective method for resource allocation and user admissions for HAPs, especially when it comes to multicasting . Power, frequency, space (antennas selection) and time (scheduling) are the resources considered in the problem over an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) HAP system . Due to the strong dependence of the total number of users that could join different multicast groups, on the possible ways we may allocate resources to these groups, it is of significant importance to consider a joint user to session assignments and RRA across the groups . From the service provider's point of view, it would be in its best interest to be able to admit as many higher priority users as possible, while satisfying their quality of service requirements . High priority users could be users subscribed in and paying higher for a service plan that gives them preference of admittance to receive more multicast transmissions, compared to those paying for a lower service plan . Also, the user who tries to join multiple multicast groups (i .e . receive more than one multicast transmission), would have preferences for which one he would favor to receive if resources are not enough to satisfy the QoS requirements .

Popularity of localization technology began when the GPS became open for commercial applications in early 1990s . Since most commercial localization applications are for indoors and GPS does not work indoors, the discovery of opportunistic indoor geolocation technologies began in mid-1990s . At the time of this writing, received signal strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi localization is dominating the commercial market complementing cell tower localization and GPS technologies using the time of arrival (TOA) technology . Wi-Fi localization technology takes advantage of the random deployment of Wi-Fi devices worldwide to support indoor and urban area localization for hundreds of thousands of applications on smart devices . Public safety and military applications demand more precise localization for first responders and military applications deploy specialized infrastructure for more precise indoor geolocation . To enhance the performance both industries are examining hybrid localization techniques . Hybrid algorithms use a variety of sensors to measure the speed and direction of movement and integrate them with the absolute radio frequency localization . Indoor Geolocation Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary book that presents the fundamentals of opportunistic localization and navigation science and technology used in different platforms such as: smart devices, unmanned ground and flying vehicles, and existing cars operating as a part of intelligent transportation systems . Material presented in the book is beneficial for Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Robotics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other disciplines who are interested in integration of navigation into their multi-disciplinary projects .

This superlative growth of data consumption has come about due to several reasons, such as evolution of the consumer devices, the types of telephone and smartphone being used, convergence of services, digitization of economic transactions, tele-education, tele-medicine, m-commerce, virtual reality office, social media, e-governance, e-security, to name but a few . Not only has the society transformed to a digital world, but also the expectations from the services provided have increased many fold . The last mile/meters of delivery of all e-services is now required to be wireless . It has always been known that wireless links are the bottleneck to providing high data rates and high quality of service . Several wireless signaling and performance analysis techniques to overcome the hurdles of wireless channels have been developed over the last decade, and these are fueling the evolution of 4G towards 5G .

Digital technologies for data processing and communication underlie high-impact innovations including the Internet of Things, wireless multimedia, artificial intelligence, big data, enterprise platforms, social networks and blockchain . These digital innovations not only bring new opportunities for prosperity and wellbeing but also affect our behaviors, activities, and daily lives . They enable and shape new forms of production and new working practices in sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, logistics and supply chains, energy, and public and business services . Digital innovations are not purely technological but form part of comprehensive systemic innovations of a sociotechnical and networked nature, requiring the alignment of technology, processes, organizations, and humans . Examples are platform- based work, customer driven value creating networks, and urban public service systems . Building on widespread networking, algorithmic decisions and sharing of personal data, these innovations raise intensive societal and ethical debates regarding key issues such as data sovereignty and privacy intrusion, business models based on data surveillance and negative externalization, quality of work and jobs, and market dominance versus regulation . In this context, this book focuses on the implications of digitalization for the domain of work . The book studies the changing nature of work as well as new forms of digitally enabled organizations, work practices and cooperation . The book sheds light on the technological, economic, and political forces shaping the new world of work and on the prospects for human-centric and responsible innovations .

Areas like smart cities, manufacturing, retail, finance, software development, environment, digital media, among others, can benefit from the collection, storage, processing, and analysis of Big Data, leveraging unprecedented data-driven workflows and considerably improved decision-making processes . The concept of a Big Data Warehouse (BDW) is emerging as either an augmentation or a replacement of the traditional Data Warehouse (DW), a concept that has a long history as one of the most valuable enterprise data assets . Nevertheless, research in Big Data Warehousing is still in its infancy, lacking an integrated and validated approach for designing and implementing both the logical layer (data models, data flows, and interoperability between components) and the physical layer (technological infrastructure) of these complex systems . This book addresses models and methods for designing and implementing Big Data Systems to support mixed and complex decision processes, giving special attention to BDWs as a way of efficiently storing and processing batch or streaming data for structured or semi- structured analytical problems .

Due to this, manufacturers could not make complex profiles or shapes with high accuracy . As a result, the production rate tended to be slow, production costs were very high, rejection rates were high and manufacturers often could not complete tasks on time . Industry was boosted by introduction of the semi-automatic manufacturing machine, known as the NC machine, which was introduced in the 1950s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . After these NC machine started to be used, typical profiles and complex shapes could get produced more readily, which in turn lead to an improved production rate with higher accuracy . Thereafter, in the 1970s, an even larger revolutionary change was introduced to manufacturing, namely the use of the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine . Since then, CNC has become the dominant production method in most manufacturing industries, including automotive, aviation, defense, oil and gas, medical, electronics industry, and the optical industry . Basics of CNC Programming describes how to design CNC programs, and what cutting parameters are required to make a good manufacturing program . The authors explain about cutting parameters in CNC machines, such as cutting feed, depth of cut, rpm, cutting speed etc ., and they also explain the G codes and M codes which are common to CNC . The skill-set of CNC program writing is covered, as well as how to cut material during different operations like straight turning, step turning, taper turning, drilling, chamfering, radius profile, profile turning etc . In so doing, The Authors cover the level of CNC programming from basic to industrial format . Drawings and CNC programs to practice on are also included for the reader .

Due to this trend, resilience creation is becoming more important to system managers and decision makers, this to ensure sustained performance . In order to be able to ensure an acceptable sustained performance under such interconnectedness and complexity, resilience creation with a system approach is a requirement . Mathematical modeling based approaches are the most common approach for system resilience creation . Mathematical Modelling of System Resilience covers resilience creation for various system aspects including a functional system of the supply chain, overall supply chain systems; various methodologies for modeling system resilience; satellite-based approach for addressing climate related risks, repair-based approach for sustainable performance of an engineering system, and modeling measures of the reliability for a vertical take-off and landing system . Each of the chapters contributes state-of-the-art research for the relevant resilience related topic covered in the chapter . THE AUTHORS: Kanchan Das is at East Carolina University .

The invariant form of equation is necessarily related to the possible system of coordinates with reference to which the equation remains invariant . The primary purpose of this book is the study of the invariance form of equation relative to the totality of the rectangular co-ordinate system in the three-dimensional Euclidean space . We start with the consideration of the way the sets representing various entities are transformed when we pass from one system of rectangular co-ordinates to another . A Tensor may be a physical entity that can be described as a Tensor only with respect to the manner of its representation by means of multi-sux sets associated with different system of axes such that the sets associated with different system of co-ordinate obey the transformation law for Tensor . We have employed sux notation for tensors of any order, we could also employ single letter such A,B to denote Tensors . THE Sanjay Kumar Padaliya, S .G .R .R .

It metamorphosed with bulk outsourcing and computer- based decision support tools, and easily coupled with low-cost PC hardware which has created improvements in the productivity of people, resulting in reduced numbers . Managers of today manage the results expected of the position rather than managing to get things done as it was expected . In the physical sciences, academia leads the industry while in social sciences like management, marketing and economics, industry leads academia . To bridge the knowledge gap that exists between theory and practice, two practitioners from the industry have authored Managing People at Work: A New Paradigm for the 21st Century .

Each of the listed properties is the subject of cybernetics research and each subsequent feature makes sense only if there is a previous one . Cyber resilience is the most important feature of any cyber system, especially during the transition to the sixth technological stage and related Industry 4 .0 technologies: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud and foggy computing, 5G +, IoT/IIoT, Big Data and ETL, Q-computing, Blockchain, VR/ AR, etc . We should even consider the cyber resilience as a primary one, because the mentioned systems cannot exist without it . Indeed, without the sustainable formation made of the interconnected components of the critical information infrastructure, it does not make sense to discuss the existence of 4 .0 Industry cyber-systems . In cases when the cyber security of these systems is mainly focused on the assessment of the incidents' probability and prevention of possible security threats, the cyber resilience is mainly aimed at preserving the targeted behavior and cyber systems' performance under the conditions of known (about 45 %) as well as unknown (the remaining 55 %) cyber attacks .

Morrow In reading this book, there are key themes that are constant such as the notion of identity and identity sets; e-sovereignty and privacy and most importantly the function of an Internet that is inclusive, not \"controlled\" by a few organizations for their own profitability . Certainly, \"enterprising\" the Internet has been a process over these past years, and there is no intent to set judgement here but rather pause for a moment and reflect on the impact of these technologies to individuals . Yes, this is The Humanized Internet . These tenets may sound libertarian, but in fact, we are speaking about core principles to guide the development and perhaps the return of the Internet to the people, especially those who are underserved . \"Do No Evil\" should not be a company motto but rather foundational to the development of any technologies that do impact us as individual consumers of these technologies and corresponding products . Indeed there is a polarity between an Internet that is used for mass empowerment and one that can be used for mass destruction . Privacy, security, and the management of your digital footprint should be done by you . With the progression of Human and Machine interaction due to advances in Biotech and Brain/ Computer Interface Cloud, Virtual and Mixed Reality, we need to understand the impact of these technologies to identity overall . Do we require a new definition of identity? What is e-Sovereignty and its application moving forward if we posit that the institutions that exist today may indeed no longer be relevant in their current structure? We have read about the abuses when your data falls into the hands of other entities, intentionally or not . The Humanized Internet is therefore a call to action, your action .

Today's current cybersecurity systems provide an effective defense mechanism against known cyber-attacks but are not so good when it comes to defending against unknown attacks . This book describes the possible development and organization of self- healing computing based on cyber immunity techniques and aimed at working in the new realm of Industry 4 .0 . Industry 4 .0 is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include cyber-physical systems (CPS), the internet of things (IoT), industrial internet of things (IIOT), cloud computing, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence . The book describes the author's research and development of cyber-immunity systems that will prevent the destruction of critical information infrastructure by future unknown cyber-attacks and thus avoid the significant or catastrophic consequences of such attacks . The book is designed for undergraduate and post-graduate students, for engineers in related fields as well as managers of corporate and state structures, chief information officers (CIO), chief information security officers (CISO), architects, and research engineers in the field of cybersecurity .

It is time to show the world that cybersecurity is an exciting and diverse field to work in . Cybersecurity is not only about hackers and technical gobbledygook . It is a diverse field of work with a lot of collaboration with other disciplines . Over the years, security professionals have tried different awareness strategies to promote their work and to improve the knowledge of their audience but without much success . Communication problems are holding back advances in the field . Visual Communication for Cybersecurity explores the possibilities of visual communication as a tool to improve the communication about cybersecurity and to better connect with non-experts . Visual communication is useful to explain complex topics and to solve complex problems . Visual tools are easy to share through social media and have the possibility to reach a wide audience . When applied strategically, visual communication can contribute to a people-centric approach to security, where employees are encouraged to actively engage in security activities rather than simply complying with the policies . Cybersecurity education does not usually include communication theory or creative skills . Many experts think that it is not part of their job and is best left to the communication department or they think that they lack any creative talent . This book introduces communication theories and models, gives practical tips, and shows many examples . The book can support students in cybersecurity education and professionals searching for alternatives to bullet-point presentations and textual reports . On top of that, if this book succeeds in inspiring the reader to start creating visuals, it may also give the reader the pleasure of seeing new possibilities and improving their performance .

Cyber-criminals are continuously shifting their cyber-attacks especially against cyber-physical systems and IoT, since they present additional vulnerabilities due to their constrained capabilities, their unattended nature and the usage of potential untrustworthiness components . Likewise, identity-theft, fraud, personal data leakages, and other related cyber- crimes are continuously evolving, causing important damages and privacy problems for European citizens in both virtual and physical scenarios . In this context, new holistic approaches, methodologies, techniques and tools are needed both to cope with those issues, and to mitigate cyberattacks, by employing novel cyber-situational awareness frameworks, risk analysis and modeling, threat intelligent systems, cyber-threat information sharing methods, advanced big-data analysis techniques as well as exploiting the benefits from latest technologies such as SDN/NFV and Cloud systems . In addition, novel privacy-preserving techniques, and crypto- privacy mechanisms, identity and eID management systems, trust services, and recommendations are needed to protect citizens' privacy while keeping usability levels . The European Commission is addressing the challenge through different means, including the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation program, thereby financing innovative projects that can cope with the increasing cyberthreat landscape . This book introduces several cybersecurity and privacy research challenges and how they are being addressed in the scope of 15 European research projects . Each chapter is dedicated to a different funded European Research project, which aims to cope with digital security and privacy aspects, risks, threats and cybersecurity issues from a different perspective . Each chapter includes the project's overviews and objectives, the particular challenges they are covering, research achievements on security and privacy, as well as the techniques, outcomes, and evaluations accomplished in the scope of the EU project .

Supercomputing and parallel coding have made MI programs feasible and the theoretical base of MI has matured . Graphical Processors (GPs) have found new life as carrier for low-cost supercomputing . The road towards lower cost and size leads to embedding systems, such as self-driving cars and intelligent houses . Machine intelligence has not only opened many disruptive venues but given simultaneously a lot of anxiety . Compared to the many accidents in the early days of automotive traffic, the few problems with the TESLA cars are already sufficient for major concern . Evidently, research is still required to bring MI on the appropriate safety levels that rule the type tests for acceptance on the European automotive market . In the ACM Turing Award 2018, Hennessey and Patterson prophesize the breakthrough of Domain-Specific Processor . A typical example is the modern vision hardware in the automotive domain . Such applications bring collectively self-driving in reach for safety concerns . It features a domain-specific mix of hardware and software . Hardware can be correctly designed and manufactured and will not change afterwards . Software can be formally proven but efficiency requires to keep it close to the platform . Robust Embedded Intelligence on Cellular Neural Networks makes the reader familiar with the mathematical and electronic techniques to turn a data-driven problem into a safe embedded solution . In particular, it treats aspects on Cellular Neural Networks (CNN) for reliable visual recognition in a wide range of practical applications, highlighting vein feature extraction and license plate recognition .

Hasnain, Mohsin Jamil and Ali Imran The subject of Signals and Systems is enormously complex, involving many concepts such as signals, mathematics and filter design that are woven together in an intricate manner . To cope with this scope and complexity, many Signals and Systems texts are often organized around the \"numerical examples\" of a system . With such organization, students can see through the complexity of Signals and Systems, they can learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the communication system while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together . From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such approach indeed works well . Based on the authors extensive experience of teaching and research, the book is written with such a reader in mind . The Book is intended for a course on signals & systems at the senior undergraduate level and above . The authors consider all the requirements and tools used in analysis and design of discrete time systems for filter design and signal processing .

Agbinya The emergence of huge amounts of data which require analysis and in some cases real-time processing has forced exploration into fast algorithms for handling very large data sizes . Analysis of x-ray images in medical applications, cyber security data, crime data, telecommunications and stock market data, health records and business analytics data are but a few areas of interest . Applications and platforms including R, RapidMiner and Weka provide the basis for analysis, often used by practitioners who pay little to no attention to the underlying mathematics and processes impacting the data . This often leads to an inability to explain results or correct mistakes, or to spot errors . Applied Data Analytics - Principles and Applications seeks to bridge this missing gap by providing some of the most sought after techniques in big data analytics . Establishing strong foundations in these topics provides practical ease when big data analyses are undertaken using the widely available open source and commercially orientated computation platforms, languages and visualization systems . The book, when combined with such platforms, provides a complete set of tools required to handle big data and can lead to fast implementations and applications . The book contains a mixture of machine learning foundations, deep learning, artificial intelligence, statistics and evolutionary learning mathematics written from the usage point of view with rich explanations on what the concepts mean . The author has thus avoided the complexities often associated with these concepts when found in research papers . The tutorial nature of the book and the applications provided are some of the reasons why the book is suitable for undergraduate, postgraduate and big data analytics enthusiasts . This text should ease the fear of mathematics often associated with practical data analytics and support rapid applications in artificial intelligence, environmental sensor data modelling and analysis, health informatics, business data analytics, data from Internet of Things and deep learning applications .

Rao and Humberto Ochoa Dominguez Video is the main driver of bandwidth use, accounting for over 80 percent of consumer Internet traffic . Video compression is a critical component of many of the available multimedia applications: being necessary for storage or transmission of digital video over today's band-limited networks . The majority of this video is coded using international standards developed in collaboration with ITU-T Study Group and MPEG . The MPEG family of video coding standards began in the early 1990s with MPEG-1, developed for video and audio storage on CD-ROMs, with support for progressive video . MPEG-2 was standardized in 1995 for applications of video on DVD, standard and high definition television, with support for interlaced and progressive video . MPEG-4 part 2, also known as MPEG-2 video, was standardized in 1999 for applications of low- bit rate multimedia on mobile platforms and the Internet, with the support of object-based or content based coding by modeling the scene as background and foreground . Since MPEG-1, the main video coding standards were based on the so-called macroblocks . However, research groups continued the work beyond the traditional video coding architectures and found that macroblocks could limit the performance of the compression when using high-resolution video . Therefore, in 2013 the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) also known as H .265, was released, with a structure similar to H .264/AVC but using coding units with more flexible partitions than the traditional macroblocks . HEVC has greater flexibility in prediction modes and transform block sizes, also it has a more sophisticated interpolation and deblocking filters . In 2006 the VC-1 was released . VC-1 is a video code implemented by Microsoft and the Microsoft Windows Media Video (VMW) 9 and standardized by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) . In 2017 the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) released a call for proposals for a new video coding standard initially called Beyond the HEVC, Future Video Coding (FVC) or known as Versatile Video Coding (VVC) . VVC is being built on top of HEVC for application on Standard Dynamic Range (SDR), High Dynamic Range (HDR) and 360\u00b0 Video . The VVC is planned to be finalized by 2020 . THE AUTHORS: K. R.
