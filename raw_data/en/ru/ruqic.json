I have contemplated, isn't wellness our inherent nature? Why do bacteria, parasites, cancer etc. affect some and not others? My journey has been to understand what I could truly give to help others be well. In vet school, I thought it odd that no one had really studied what \"well\" was and how to attain the highest state of wellness. Conversations about \"preventative medicine\" based on vaccinations, flea protocols and prescription diets seemed to fall short. We learned plenty about disease and how to treat with medications and surgeries, but why were these animals getting sick? Sometimes there never seemed to be a cause. Something just didn't seem right. The preventative medicine conversations didn't seem adequate. Do those things, vaccinations, flea control, dentals and commercial diets really, statistically keep animals well? It never seemed so, I knew plenty of animals that received all the preventatives and slowly over time got sick. It became apparent that the logical approach to wellness is twofold: 1.) Use food (and herbs) as medicine, as nature intended, and 2.) Treat the body as a whole, not just individual symptoms. Utilizing what is here naturally (wholesome, minimally processed food and herbs) is seemingly essential to obtain a much higher wellness than relying solely on man-made remedies (processed food, medications and surgeries). It also makes sense that body has to work together as a whole system. As I began treating the body, finding ways to support or detoxify organ systems and functions, I found a higher level of wellness. However, even this approach of natural rearing misses the mark in all cases. Two things have then occurred to me. Through reading, I strongly feel balance is key. A balance of all three components of life - body, mind and spirit. Body is the physical component or strength (diet and environment), mind is the intellectual component or wisdom (move away from fire, drink clean water or filter if necessary, etc) and spirit is the emotional connection or space to hold love instead of negative emotions and thoughts. Ever wonder where thoughts come from? What wells up inside us from nothing? Secondly, I have come to realize that we are all energy. Science has not been able to identify matter except as a probability. I have heard of native Americans and others' ability to shape shift. I read about monks that \"could fit in a conch shell\" to avoid the pelting hale storms. Miracles occur everyday around healing or averting death. By reading telling books such as Behaving as if the God in All Life Matters by Michaelle Small Wright, A Mutant Message Down Under by Marlo Morgan, and Hands of Light by Barbara Ann Brennan in my early years, and most recently The Ringing Cedar Series by Vladimir Megre and The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ by Levi, I am beginning to realize that yes, we have the ability to transcend matter. But how? The answer I get over and over is 'through meditation'. Once this state is achieved to maximum potential, then it seems naturally that the body and material world can easily be transformed, the illusion transcended. On this inquiry, the work of Joel Goldsmith solidified my understanding of being the healing possibility. He explains the foundational principles of his work in The Infinite Way. He has been a prolific author and teacher in the mid 1950's and has helped hundreds if not thousands of people often with terminal disease to be well. Recently, I was also introduced to Christian Science. This path is somewhat of a precursor to Joel's work, that still has significant relevance in the daily lives of many today as I am also finding the profound relevance in my own life. Now, my questions and postulated answers are as follows. How can we describe turmoil in the world? Possibly it is up to each of us being and knowing this Spiritual existence of Love that we are and dispel all that we recognize as not Love in every moment and every thought that we can. Possibly without us being that, it (Love) does not exist. Our pets may be our guides on that journey. It may be that we will do things for our pets that we would not do for ourselves alone. They certainly provide love in infinite ways. It is apparent that turmoil exists when God or Love does not. How did Christ heal? Through the power of the Holy Spirit ... and I am beginning to understand how. Ultimately, we really have no control over this Spiritual power on the human level - we cannot petition this great force. As I understand though, we can attain. We can aspire to know Ourselves through inquiry - contemplation and meditation. It is through this avenue, as it best suits each one of us to walk that path individually, of seeing or constantly choosing the thoughts that are of support. It is up to us to stand strong and be that Love in the face of animosity or disagreement, and then healing will occur. So many of us may not have had opportunity to experience this Love as youngsters when we were learning and needing it most. But we are adults with free choice - and we can choose to grow and expand in whatever way we can or stay small and shrink. It is always up to us. We can carry thoughts that choose life or thoughts that choose no life; thoughts that choose love or choose no love. Here is something extraordinary: Joel explains that we can literally choose dis-ease, sickness, death, and suffering OR life and Love! Moment by moment, thought by thought, intention by intention. It is in the brilliant light of this infinite Love that IS - it just exists, and is the only real thing that does exist - where pure brilliance, life, health, wellness, ease and perfection is experienced. In this pure light, darkness cannot exist. There is no disease, suffering, discord, darkness or death in the brilliance of this pure, infinite Light to which we are all One. ('The kingdom of God is within us','on Earth as in Heaven'). This is the space I would like to explore and invite others to join me. This is a brief introduction to the Spirituality of healing. Each of us can then utilize what we gain together for the rest of the week in our individual lives. We may continue meditating and contemplating as it becomes something to which we may strive, knowing that the quality of our life may shift for the better in ways we could never even comprehend. I am inspired to share space with others on their path of understanding this Universal nature so we may all grow and benefit from such knowledge and understanding.
