The Department's claim is classified and paid as a debt with preference as defined in Section 15-03-805, Idaho Code. Debts of the deceased recipient which may be deducted from the estate prior to satisfaction of the Department's claim must be legally enforceable debts given preference over the De partment's claim under S ection 15-03-805, Idaho Code. (7-1-96) 22. Interest on Claim. The Department's claim does no t bear interest except as otherwise provided by statute or agreement. (7-1-96) 23. Excluded Land. Restricted allotted land, owned by a deceased recipient who was an enrolled member of a federally recognized American Indian tribe, or eligible for tribal membership, which cannot be sold or transferred without permission from the Indian tribe or an agency of the Federal Government, will not be subject to estate recovery. (7-1-96) 24. Marriage Settlement Agreement or Other Such Agreement. A marriage settlement agreement or other such agreement which separates assets for a married couple does not eliminate the debt against the estate of the deceased recipient or the spouse. Transfers under a marriage settlement agreement or other such agreement may be voided if not for adequate consideration. (7-1-96) 25. Release of Estate Claims. The Department shall release a claim when the Department's claim has been fully satisfied and may release its cl aim under the following conditions: (7-1-96) a. When an undue hardship waiver as defined in Subsection 025.26 of these rules has been granted; or (7-1-96) b. When a written agreement with the authorized representative to pay the Department's claim in 1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 29 thirty-six (36) monthly payments or less has been achieved. (7-1-96) 26. Purpose of the Undue Hardship Exception. The undue hardship exception is intended to avoid the impoverishment of the deceased recipient's family due to the Department exercising its estate recovery right. The fact that family members anticipate or expect an inheritance, or will be inco nvenienced economically by the lack of an inheritance, is not cause for the Departme nt to declare an undue hardship. (7-1-96) 27. Application for Undue Hardship Waiver. An applicant for an undue hardship waiver must have a beneficial interest in the estate and must apply for the waiver within ninety (90) days of the death of the recipient or within thirty (30) days of receiving no tice of the Department's claim, whichever is later. The filing of a claim by the Department in a probate proceeding shall constitute notice to all heirs. (7-1-96) 28. Basis for Undue Hardship Waiver. Undue hardship waivers shall be considered in the following circumstances: (7-1-96) a. The estate subject to recovery is the sole in come-producing asset of the survivors where such income is limited; or (7-1-96) b. Payment of the Department's claim would cause he irs of the deceased recipi ent to be eligible for public assistance; or (7-1-96) c. The Department's claim is less than five hundred dollars ($500) or the total assets of the entire estate are less than five hundred dollars ($500), excluding trust accounts or other bank accounts. (7-1-96) d. The recipient received MA as the result of a crime committed against the recipient. (7-1-96) 29. Limitations on Undue Hardship Waiver. Any benefi ciary of the estate of a deceased recipient may apply for waiver of the estate recovery claim based on u ndue hardship. Any claim may be waived by the Department, partially or fully, because of undue hardship. An undue hardsh ip does not exist if action ta ken by the recipient prior to his death, or by his legal representative, divested or diverted assets from the estate. The Department shall grant undue hardship waivers on a case by case basis upon review of a ll facts and circumstances, including any action taken to diminish assets available for estate recovery or to circumvent estate recovery. (7-1-96) 30. Set Aside of Transfers. Transfers of real or pe rsonal property of the r ecipient without adequate consideration are voidable and may be se t aside by the district court. (7-1-96) 026. CONDITIONS FOR PAYMENT. 01. Recipient Eligibility. The Department will reimburse providers for medical care and services, regardless of the current eligibility status of the MA recipient in the month of payment, provided that each of the following conditions are met: (11-10-81) a. The recipient was found eligible for MA for the month, day, and year during which the medical care and services were rendered; and (11-10-81) b. The recipient received such medical care and services no earlier than the third month before the month in which application was made on such recipient's behalf; and (11-10-81) c. Not more than twelve (12) months have elapsed si nce the month of the latest recipient services for which such payment is being made. Medicare cross-over clai ms are excluded from the twelve (12) month submittal limitation. (11-10-81) 02. Time Limits. The time limit set forth in Subsection 026.01.c. shall not apply with respect to retroactive adjustment payments. (12-31-91) 03. Acceptance of State Payment. By participating in the Medical Assistance Program, providers agree to accept, as payment in full, the amounts paid by the Depa rtment for services to Medicaid recipients. Providers also 1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 30 agree to provide all materials and services without unlawful ly discriminating on the grounds of race, age, sex, creed, color, national origin, or physical or mental handicap. (3-22-93) 027. -- 029. (RESERVED). 030. THIRD PARTY LIABILITY. 01. Determining Liability of Third Parties. The Department will take reasonable measures to determine any legal liability of third parties for the medical care a nd services included under the MA Program, the need for which arises out of injury, disease, or disability of an MA recipient. (11-10-81) 02. Third Party Liability as a Current Resource. In determining whether MA is payable, the Department is to treat any third party liability as a current resource when such liability is found to exist and payment by the third party has been made or will be made within a reasonable time. (11-10-81) 03. Withholding Payment. The Department must not withhold payment on behalf of an eligible MA recipient because of the liability of a third party when such liability, or the amount thereof, cannot be currently established or is not currently available to pay the recipient's medical expense. (11-10-81) 04. Seeking Third Party Reimbursement. The Department will seek reimbursement from a third party for MA when the party's liability is established after MA is granted, and in any other case in which the liability of a third party existed, but was not treated as a current resour ce, with the exceptions of absent parent without a second valid resource, prenatal, EPSDT, and EPSDT related services. (2-4-91) a. The Department will seek reimbursement for MA from a recipient when a recipient's liability is established after MA has been granted; and (11-10-81) b. In any other situation in which the recipient has received direct payment from any third party resource and has not returned the money to the Department for MA service received. (11-10-81) 05. Billing Third Parties First. Medicaid providers must bill all other sources of direct third party payment, with the exception of absent parent (court ordered) without secondary resources, prenatal, EPSDT and EPSDT related services before submitting the claim to the Department. If the resource is an absent parent (court ordered) and there are no other viable resources available or if the claims are for prenat al, EPSDT, or EPSDT related services, the claims will be paid and the resources billed by the Department. (2-4-91) 06. Accident Determination. When the patient's Medi caid card indicates private insurance and/or when the diagnosis indicates an accident for which private insurance is often carried, the claim will be suspended or denied until it can be determined that there is no other source of payment. (11-10-81) 07. Third Party Payments in Excess of Medicaid Limits. The Department will not reimburse providers for services provided when the amount received by the provid er from the third party payor is equal to or exceeds the level of reimbursement allowed by MA for the services. (11-10-81) 08. Subrogation of Third Party Liability. In all cases where the Department will be required to pay medical expenses for a recipient and that recipient is entitled to recover any or all such medical expenses from any third party, the Department will be subrogated to the rights of the recipient to the extent of the amount of medical assistance benefits paid by the Department as the result of the occurrence giving rise to the claim against the third party. (11-10-81) a. If litigation or a settlement in such a claim is pursued by the MA recipient, the recipient must notify the Department. (11-10-81) b. If the recipient recovers funds, either by settlement or judgment, from such a third party, the recipient must repay the amount of benefits paid by the Department on his behalf. (11-10-81) 09. Subrogation of Legal Fees. (11-10-81)1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 31 a. If an MA recipient incurs the obligation to pay attorney fees and court costs for the purpose of enforcing a monetary claim to which the Department is subrogated, the amount which the Department is entitled to recover, or any lesser amount which the Department may agree to accept in compromise of its claim, will be reduced by an amount which bears the same relation to the total amo unt of attorney fees and court costs actually paid by the recipient as the amount actually recovered by the Departme nt, exclusive of the reduction for attorney fees and court costs, bears to the total amount paid by the third party to the recipient. (11-10-81) b. If a settlement or judgment is received by the recipient which does not specify portion of the settlement or judgment which is for payment of medical expenses, it will be presumed that the settlement or judgment applies first to the medical expenses in curred by the recipient in an amount equa l to the expenditure for benefits paid by the Department as a result of the paymen t or payments to the recipient. (11-10-81) 031. MEDICAID COST RECOVERY FROM PARENTS. The Department intends to recover from a child's parent, all or part of the cost of Medicaid services to the child in a Nursing Facility (NF), in an Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded (ICF/MR), in a Personal Care Services (PCS) provider's home under twenty-four (24) hour care, or under Home Care for Certain Disabled Children (HCCDC). The child must be under eighteen (18). Recovery is from the child's natural or adoptive parent. Recovery is made under Sections 32-1003, 56-203B, and 56-209b, Id aho Code. Upon application for Medicaid, the applicant assigns to the state of Idaho his rights to recover paymen ts for his medical expenses from any liable third party, including a parent. Recovery will not be made for a child receiving adoption assistance under Title IVE of the Social Security Act, or under the State Ad option Assistance Program. The Examiner must tell the parent(s) of a child applying for Medicaid help with NF, ICF/MR, twenty-four (24) hour care in a PCS provider's home, or HCCDC, that he may be required to share in the cost of Medicaid services for the child. No eligible child will be denied Medicaid services if a responsible parent fails to pay the assessment. Medicaid payments to providers will not be reduced if the parent fails to pay. (7-1-97) 01. Parent Gross Assessment Income. Parent gross assessment income is the parents' adjusted gross income as reported on the last calendar year's state inco me tax form 40 (Total Adjusted Income) or 40EZ (Adjusted Gross Income). Parents who did not reside in Idaho for the entire year must use the federa l income tax form 1040 or 1040A (Adjusted Gross Income). (7-1-97) a. Parents living together and filing separately must use their combined income from both individuals' tax returns. Where the child's parent lives with the child's stepparent, the amount on the line entitled \"Total Adjusted Income\" or \"Adjusted Gross Income\" on either tax form must be adjusted by subtracting the stepparent's income. (7-1-97) b. Parents who have not yet filed a tax return must provide an estimated adjusted gross income amount. The tax return must be provided to the Department when filed. (7-1-97) c. Parents who claim this year's income is substant ially different from their previous adjusted gross federal or state income must provide proof of their actual income. (7-1-97) d. Parents whose adjusted gross income includes a substantial proportion of non-liquid earnings may petition for an adjustment to their gross assessment income. Such adjustment may be granted following a contested case hearing, at which the burden shall be upon the parent to show by clear and convincing evidence that it would be manifestly unfair to assess the full amount of the adjusted gross income. Any present adjustment to the gross assessment income shall include the recapture of any deferr ed amount at a time when the non-liquid portion of the parent's earnings are or become subject to liquidation. The am ount to be recaptured may be required to be secured by an appropriate instrument. (7-1-97) 02. Stepparent Income. Where the parent's spouse is the child's stepparent, the parent's community property interest in the stepparent's income is not income to the parent for calculating the parent's assessment income (AI). (7-6-94) 03. Two (2) Parent Assessment. Where the child's pa rents are living apart, each parent is separately 1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 32 assessed. The assessment of each parent is lowered, if neces sary, so the total assessment fo r the child is not more than the Medicaid payments made for the child during the assessment year. (7-6-94) 04. Family Size. Family size includes the child's natural, step, or adoptive parents if living in the home. Family size also includes natural and adoptive siblings if living in the same home. Family size does not include the child's step siblings. The Medicaid child under HCCDC is incl uded if living in the home and is counted twice in the calculation of the family size. (7-1-97) 05. Annual Assessment Calculation. The annual asse ssment is based on the AI and family size. Calculate the annual assessment following the steps in Subsections 031.05.a. through 031.05.d. The Third Party Recovery (TPR) unit calculates the assessment based on information provided by the parent. (7-1-97) a. Step 1. From the parent's AI, deduct all payments for court-ordered child support. (7-6-94) b. Step 2. From the AI, subtract two hundred percent (200%) of the Federal Poverty Guideline (FPG) for the family size. The FPG is published annually in the Federal Register by the federal Office of Management and Budget. The annual FPG change takes effect the following July for calculating the assessment. (7-6-94) c. Step 3. Multiply the result from Step 2, up to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), by ten percent (10%), between fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) and sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) by twelve percent (12%), between sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) and seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) by fourteen percent (14%), and multiply the remainder over seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) by fifteen percent (15%). (7-6-94) d. Step 4. Add together the results of each calculation in Step 3. Add the tota l to the amount calculated in Step 2. This is the annual assessment. (7-6-94) e. Step 5. From the amount in Step 4, deduct the an nual amount paid for health insurance premiums if this insurance covers th e Medicaid child. (7-6-94) 06. Monthly Assessment Amount. The monthly assessment is determined by dividing the annual assessment calculated in Subsection 031.05 by twelve (12). Where the child is living in a nursing facility or ICF/MR and is not receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or other income, his thirty dollar ($30) personal needs allowance is deducted from the monthly assessment. (7-6-94) 07. Initial Assessment. The parent(s) will be identified by the Field Office when a child applies for or receives Medicaid help in the cost of NF or ICF/MR care or applies for HCCDC Medicaid or twenty-four (24) hour care in a PCS provider's home. The Field Office will provide this information to the TPR unit. (7-1-97) 08. TPR Contact. The TPR unit will notify the parent(s), in writing, of their legal responsibility to share in the cost of NF, ICF/MR, HCCDC, or other Medicaid services for the child. The notice will be sent within thirty (30) days of the date the child's Medicaid application is approved. Income and expense reporting forms will be provided to the parent(s). The parent can provide his IRS income tax forms for the previous year in place of an income report. (7-1-97) 09. Noncooperation. A monthly assessment equal to the average Medicaid reimbursement rate for the child's level of care, as published by the Department for the previous year, is used if a parent fails to provide income information; provides false or mislead ing statements; misrepresents, conceals or withholds facts to avoid financial responsibility. (7-6-94) 10. Notice of Assessment Amount and Hearing Rights. The TPR unit sends the parent(s) written notice of the assessment amount within ten (10) days of the date the assessment is calculated, and notice of the parent's right to a hearing in accordance with Subsection 031.20 of these rules. The noti ce shall include the following information: (7-1-97) a. The notice shall inform the parent of the amount calculated as the monthly assessment. (7-1-97) b. The notice shall inform the parent that he or sh e may request a hearing to contest the Department's 1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 33 calculation of the assessment amount. The notice shall incl ude information that a pre-hearing conference may be scheduled prior to a hearing. The notice shall include the time limits and instructions for requesting a hearing. (7-1-97) c. The notice shall inform the parent that if he or she does not request a hearing within the time limits TPR Unit will be used. (7-1-97) d. The notice shall inform the parent that only a pa rent who owes an assessment amount may request a hearing. (7-1-97) 11. Assessment Year. The first assessment year is the twelve (12) month period beginning with the effective month of the child's eligibility for Medicaid. Subsequent assessment years are twelve (12) month periods beginning the same calendar month as the first assessment year began. (7-1-97) 12. Assessment Limit. The total assessment for an assessment year will not exceed the Medicaid payments made for the child for the assessment year. (7-6-94) 13. Interim Adjustments. The assessment amount can be adjusted up to four (4) times during an assessment year, if the parent asks for recalculation, based on lower AI. The parent must prove his AI is lower than income used for the yearly assessme nt. Recalculation is not automatic when the assessment formula changes in January. (7-6-94) 14. Annual Adjustment. The AI is recalculated yearly in the same month as th e initial assessment. The assessment is adjusted, if necessary. The parent must be sent a notice of the adjusted assessment. The parent can request an adjustment of the yearly assessment. The parent must provide a copy of his federal or state tax filing for that calendar year or other proof of annu al income. The annual income is compared to the parent's AI for that tax year. If the AI is less than the AI used to calculate the assessment, the assessment is adjusted. (7-1-97) 15. Annual Reconciliation. The parent's assessment and the Medicaid cost excluding services provided by school districts or developmental disability centers for the child are reconciled at assessment year end. If the parent paid more than the Medicaid cost for the child, a credit is is sued. If the child is no lo nger a Medicaid recipient, a refund is issued. Where a parent has more than one (1 ) child whose Medicaid costs are subject to recovery, the monthly assessment will be divided by the number of children whose costs are subject to recovery. Each child's prorated share of the assessment is then compared to the Medicaid costs for that child to determine whether a refund will be issued. No reconciliation is required where the difference between the projected AI and actual income for the tax year is a minimum of three thousand dollars ($3,000) or ten percent (10%) of annual AI, whichever is more. (7-6-94) 16. Annual Support Deduction Reconciliation. Where the parent paid more child support than was deducted, he is entitled to a credit or refund, if he so chooses. If the child is no longer a recipient of NF, ICF/MR, twenty-four (24) hour care in a PCS provider's home or HCCDC Medicaid, the parent is entitled to a refund of the amount he overpaid. (7-1-97) 17. Payment Schedule. The parent may pay his annual assessment in four (4) payments yearly, for services already paid or projected to be paid by Medicai d. The parent may negotiate a different payment schedule with the TPR Unit. (7-6-94) 18. Enforcement. Failure of a responsible parent to pay the assessment will be referred to the Office of the Attorney General for initiation of collection proceedings and appropriat e legal action, including civil suit, garnishment, attachment, and any othe r legal process to accomplish the purpose of Sections 32-1003, 56-203B and 56-209b, Idaho Code. Collection will be enforced by the Bureau of Child Support Services (BCSS). (7-1-97) 19. Out-of-State Parents. Responsible parents living out -of-state will be contacted and assessed to the same extent as Idaho residents. The Department may enter into reciprocity of enforcem ent agreements with states with similar provisions. (7-6-94) 20. Administrative Appeals. Hearings to contes t the Department's calculation of the assessment 1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 34 amount shall be governed by the hearing provisions of IDAPA 16.05.03, \"Rules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings\". (7-1-97) 032. -- 035. (RESERVED). 036. REPORTING TO IRS. Pursuant to 26 USC 6041, the Department must provide annual information returns to the IRS showing aggregate amounts paid to providers identified by name, address, and so cial security number or employer identification number. (11-10-81) 037. -- 039. (RESERVED). 040. AGREEMENTS WITH PROVIDERS. 01. In General. The Department will enter into written agreements with each provider or group of providers of supplies or services under the Program. Agreements may contain any terms or conditions deemed appropriate by the Department. Each agreement will contain, among others, the following terms and conditions requiring the provider: (3-2-94) a. To retain for a minimum of three (3) years any r ecords necessary for a determination of the services the provider furnishes to recipients; and (11-10-81) b. To furnish to the Bureau, the Secretary of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Fraud Investigation Bureau, or the Department of Law Enforcement any information requested regarding payments claimed by the provider for services; and (11-10-81) c. To furnish to the Bureau, the Secretary of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Fraud Investigation Bureau, or the Department of Law Enfo rcement, information requested on business transactions as follows: (11-10-81) i. Ownership of any subcontractor with whom the provider has had business transactions of more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) during a twelve (12) month period ending on the date of request; and (11-10-81) ii. Any significant business transactions between the provider and any wholly owned supplier, or between the provider and any subcontractor during the five (5) year period ending on the date of request. (11-10-81) 02. Federal Disclosure Requirements. To comply w ith the disclosure requirements in 42 CFR 455, Subpart B, each provider, other than an individual practitioner or a group of practitioners, must disclose to the Department: (11-10-81) a. The full name and address of each individual who has either direct or indirect ownership interest in the disclosing entity or in any subcontractor of five percent (5%) or more prior to entering into an agreement or at the time of survey and certification; and (11-10-81) b. Whether any person named in the disclosure is rela ted to another person named in the disclosure as a spouse, parent, or sibling. (11-10-81) 03. Termination of Provider Agreements. Provider agreements may be terminated with or without cause. (3-2-94) a. The Department may, in its discretion, terminate a provider's agreement for cause based on its conduct or the conduct of its employees or agents, when the provider fails to comply with any term or provision of the provider agreement. Other action may also be taken, based on the conduct of the provider as provided in Section 190, and notice of termination shall be given as provided therei n. Terminations for cause may be appealed as a contested case pursuant to the \"Rules Governing Contested Case Pr oceedings and Declaratory Ru ling,\" ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 35 b. Due to the need to respond quickly to state and federal mandates, as well as the changing needs of the state plan, the Department may terminate provider ag reements without cause by giving written notice to the provider as set forth in the agreement. If an agreement does not provide a noti ce period, it shall be twenty-eight (28) days. Terminations without cause may result from, but are not limited to, elimination or change of programs or requirements, or the provider's inability to continue providing services due to the actions of another agency or board. Terminations without cause are not subject to contested case proceedings since the action will either affect a class of providers, or will result from the discretionary act of another regulatory body. (3-2-94) 04. Hospital Agreements. In addition to the provid er enrollment agreement, each claim submitted by a hospital constitutes an agreement by wh ich the hospital agrees to accept and abide by the Depa rtment's rules. Only a Medicare certified hospital, licensed by the state in whic h it operates, may enroll in the Idaho Medicaid program. Hospitals not participating as a Medicaid swing-bed provider , which are licensed for long-term care or as a specialty hospital which provides a nursing home level of care, will be reimbursed as a nursing facility. Hospitals not eligible for enrollment which render emergency care will be paid rates established in Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16.03.10, Section 456, \"Rules Governing Medicaid Provider Reimbursement\". (3-22-93) 05. Denial of Provider Agreement. The Department may deny provider status by refusing a request to enter into a provider agreement, refusi ng to extend an existing agreement, or refusing to enter into additional agreements with any individual or entity, that: (7-1-97) a. Fails to meet the qualifications required by rule or by any applicable licensing board; (7-1-97) b. Has previously been, or was a managing employee, or had an ownership interest, as defined in 42 C.F.R Section 455.101 (10-1-93), in any entity which was pr eviously found by the Department to have engaged in fraudulent conduct, or abusive conduct related to the Medicaid program or has demonstrated an inability to comply with the requirements related to the provider status for which application is made, including, but not limited to submitting false claims or violating provis ions of any provider agreement; (7-1-97) c. Has failed, or was a managing employee, or had an ownership interest, as defined in 42 C.F.R \u00a7 455.101 (10-1-93), in any entity that failed to repay the Department for any overpayments, or to repay claims previously found by the Department to have been paid improperly, whether the failure resulted from refusal, bankruptcy, or otherwise, unless prohibited by law; or (7-1-97) d. Employs as a managing employee, contracts for any management services, shares any ownership interests, or would be considered a related party to any individual or entity identified in Subsections 040.05.a. through 040.05.c., of this rule.

The addition of new services to the plan or increase in the amount of an authorized servi ce on the existing plan must be authorized by the Department prior to implementation. (5-24-95) d. Crisis Assistance, which are those SC activities that are needed in emergency situations in addition to those identified on the service plan. These are necessary activities to obtain n eeded services to ensure the health or safety of the child. To the extent po ssible the plan should in clude instructions for families to access emergency services in the event of a crisis. If a need for twenty-four (24) hour availability of service coordination is identified, then arrangements will be made and included on the plan. (10-1-94) e.

The four (4) rates are prospective rates; there will be no retroactive rate adjustments other than the application of the \"cap\" on overall payments and the limitati on on payments for inpatient care, if applicable. (7-1- 94)1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 69 a. A description of the payment for each le vel of care is as follows: (10-24-88) i. Routine home care. The hospice will be paid the routine home care rate for each day the patient is in residence, under the care of the hospice, and not receiving continuous home care. This rate is paid without regard to the volume or intensity of routine home care services provided on any given day. (10-24-88) ii. Continuous home care. Continuous home care is to be provided only during a period of crisis. A period of crisis is a period in which a patient requires continuous care which is primarily nursing care to achieve palliation and management of acute medical symptoms. Care must be provided by either a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse and a nurse must provide care for at least half the total period of care. A minimum of eight (8) hours of care must be provided during a twenty-four (24) hour day which begins and ends at midnight. This care need not be continuous and uninterrupted. If less skilled care is needed on a continuous basi s to enable the person to remain at home, this is covered as routine home care. For every hour or part of an hour of continuous care furnished, the hourly rate will be reimbursed to the hospice up to twenty-four (24) hours per day. (10-24-88) iii. Inpatient respite care. The hospice will be paid at the inpatient respite care rate for each day that the recipient is in an approved inpatient f acility and is receiving respite care. Payment for respite care may be made for a maximum of five (5) days at a time including the date of admission but not counting the date of discharge in any monthly election period. Payment for the sixth and any subseque nt day is to be made at the appropriate rate routine, continuous, or general inpatient rate. (10-24-88) iv. General inpatient care. Payment at the inpatient rate will be made when general inpatient care is provided. No other fixed payment rates will be applicable for a day on which the recipient receives hospice general inpatient care except as describe d in Subsection 104.11. (7-1-94) b. Date of discharge. For the day of discharge from an inpatient unit, the appropriate home care rate is to be paid unless the patient dies as an inpatient. When th e patient is discharged as deceased, the inpatient rate, either general or respite, is to be paid for the discharge date. (10-24-88) c. Hospice payment rates. The Medicaid hospice pa yment rates are the same as the Medicare hospice rates, adjusted to disregard cost offsets attributable to Medicare coinsurance amount s. Under the Medicaid hospice benefit, no cost sharing may be imposed with respect to hospice services rendered to Medicaid recipients. (10-24-88) d. Obligation of continuing care. Af ter the recipient's hospice benefit expires, the patient's Medicaid hospice benefits do not expire. The hospice must continue to provide that recipient's care until the patient expires or until the recipient revokes the election of hospice care. (10-24-88) 10. Limitation on Payments for Inpatient Care. Payments to a hospice for inpatient care must be limited according to the number of days of inpatient care furnis hed to Medicaid patients. During the twelve (12) month period beginning November 1 of each year and ending October 31 of the next year, the aggregate number of inpatient days (both general inpatient days and inpatient respite care) may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the total number of days of hospice care provided to all Medicaid recipients during the same period by the designated hospice or its contracted agent(s). (10-24-88) a. For purposes of computation, if it is determined that the inpatient rate should not be paid, any days for which the hospice receives payment at a home care rate will not be counted as inpatient days. The limitations on payment for inpatient days are as follows: (10-24-88) i. The maximum number of allowable inpatient days will be calculated by multiplying the total number of a provider's Medicaid hospice days by twenty percent (20%). (10-24-88) ii. If the total number of days of inpatient care to Medicaid hospice patients is less than or equal to the maximum number of inpatient days computed in Subsection 104.10.a., then no adjustment is made. (7-1-94) iii. If the total number of days of inpatient care exceeds the maximum number of allowable inpatient days computed in Subsection 104.10.a., then the payment limitation will be determined by: (7-1-94)1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 70 (1) Calculating the ratio of the maximum allowable inpatient days to the number of actual days of inpatient care, and multiplying this ratio by the total reimbursement for inpatient care that was made. (10-24-88) (2) Multiplying excess inpatient care days by the routine home care rate. (10-24-88) (3) Adding the amounts calculated in Subsections 104.10.a.iii.(1) and 104.10.a.ii.(2). (10-24-88)(4) Comparing the amount in Subsection 104.10.a.iii.(3) with interim payments made to the hospice for inpatient care during the \"cap period\". (10-24-88) b. The amount by which interim payments for in patient care exceeds the amount calculated as in Subsection 104.10.a.iii.(4) is due from the hospice. (7-1-94) 11. Payment for Physician Services. The basic rate s for hospice care represent full reimbursement to the hospice for the costs of all covered services related to the treatment of the recipient's terminal illness, including the administrative and general activities performed by physicians who are employees of or working under arrangements made with the hospice. These activities would generally be performed by the physician serving as the medical director and the physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group. Group activities include participation in the establishment of plans of care, superv ision of care and services, periodic review and updating of plans of care, and establishment of governing policies. The costs for these services are included in the reimbursement rates for routine home care, continuous home care, and inpatient respite care. (10-24-88) a. Reimbursement for a hospice employed physician's direct patient services which are not rendered by a hospice volunteer is made in accordance with th e usual Idaho Medicaid reim bursement methodology for physician services. These services will be billed by the hospice under the hospice provider number and, the related payments will be counted in determining whether the overall hospice cap amount per Subsection 104.12 has been exceeded. The only physician services to be billed by a hosp ice for such services are direct patient care services. Laboratory and X-ray services are included in the hospice daily rate. (7-1-94) b. V olunteer physician services are excluded fr om Medicaid reimbursement with the following exceptions: (10-24-88) i. A hospice may be reimbursed on behalf of a vo lunteer physician for specific direct patient care services which are not rendered on a volunteer basis. The hospice must have a liability to reimburse the physician for those services rendered. In determining whether a service is provided on a volunteer basis, a physician must not distinguish which services are provided voluntarily on the basis of the patient's ability to pay. (10-24-88) ii. Reimbursement for an independent physician's direct patient services which are not rendered by a hospice volunteer is made in accordance with the usual Idaho Medicaid reimbursement methodology for physician services. These services will not be billed by the hospice under the hospice provider number and they will not be counted in determining whether the overall hospice cap amount per Subsection 104.12 has been exceeded. The only services to be billed by an attending physician are the physician's personal professional services. Costs for services such as laboratory or X-rays are not to be included on the attending physician's billed charges to the Medicaid program. The aforementioned charges are included in the daily rates paid and are expressly the responsibility of the hospice. (7-1-94) 12. Cap on Overall Reimbursement. Aggregate payments to each hospice will be limited during a hospice cap period per Subsection 104.01. e. The total payments made for servi ces furnished to Medicaid recipients during this period will be compared to the \"cap amount\" for this period. Any payments in excess of the cap must be refunded by the hospice. (7-1-94) a. The overall cap will be compared to reimbursement after the inpatient limitation is computed and subtracted from total reimbursement due the hospice. (10-24-88) b. \"Total payment made for services furnished to Medicaid recipients during this period\" means all payments for services rendered during the cap year, re gardless of when payment is actually made. (10-24-88)1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 71 c. The \"cap amount\" is calculated by multiplying the number of recipients electing certified hospice care during the period by six thousand five hundred do llars ($6,500). This amount will be adjusted for each subsequent cap year beginning November 1, 1983, to refl ect the percentage increase or decrease in the medical care expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It will also be adjusted as per Subsection 104.13. (7-1-94) d. The computation and application of the \"cap amou nt\" is made by the Department after the end of the cap period. (10-24-88) e. The hospice will report the number of Medicaid recipients electing hospice care during the period to the Department. This must be done within thirty (30) days after the end of the cap period as follows: (10-24-88) i. If the recipient is transferred to a noncertified hospice no payment to the noncertified hospice will be made and the certified hospice may count a complete recipient benefit period in their cap amount. (10-24-88) f. If a hospice certifies in mid-month, a weighted average cap amount based on the number of days falling within each cap period would be used. (10-24-88) 13. Adjustment of the Overall Cap. Cap amounts in each hospice's cap period will be adjusted to reflect changes in the cap periods and designated hospices durin g a recipient's election peri od. The proportion of each hospice's days of service to the total number of hospice days rendered to the recipient du ring their election period will be multiplied by the cap amount to determine each hospice's adjusted cap amount. (6-23-89) a. After each cap period has ended, the Department wi ll calculate the overall cap within a reasonable time for each hospice participating in the Idaho Medicaid Program. (10-24-88) b. Each hospice's cap amount will be computed as follows: (10-24-88) i. The share of the \"cap amount\" that each hospice is allowed will be based on the proportion of total covered days provided by each hospice in the \"cap period\". (6-23-89) ii. The proportion determined in Subsection 104.13.b. for each certified hospice will be multiplied by the \"cap amount\" specified for the \"cap period\" in which the recipient first elected hospice. (7-1-94) c. The recipient must file an initial election during the period beginning September 28 of the previous year through September 27 of the curren t cap year in order to be counted as an electing Medicaid recipient during the current cap year. (6-23-89) 14. Additional Amount for NF Residents. An additional per diem amount will be paid for \"room and board\" of hospice residents in a certified NF receiving rou tine or continuous care services . In this context, the term \"room and board\" includes, but is not limited to, all assistance in the activities of daily living, in socializing activities, administration of medication, maintaining the cleanliness of a resident's room, and supervision and assisting in the use of durable medical equipment and prescribed therapies. The additional payments and the related days are not subject to the caps specified in Subsections 104.10 and 104.12. The room and board rate will be ninety-five percent (95%) of the per diem interim reimbursement rate assigned to the facility for those dates of service on which the recipient was a resident of that facility. (7-1-94) 15. Post Eligibility Treatment of Income. Where an individual is determined eligible for MA participation in the cost of long term care, the Departme nt must reduce its payments for all costs of the hospice benefit, including the supplementary amounts for room and board, by an amount determined according to Subsection 160.03 of this rule. (7-1-97) 105. HOME HEALTH SERVICES. 01. Care and Services Provided. Home health servi ces encompass services ordered by the patient's attending physician as a part of a plan of care, which incl ude nursing services, home heal th aide, physical therapy and occupational therapy.

In order to participate as a Home Health Agency (H HA) provider for Medicaid eligible persons, the provider must be licensed as required by the state, and be certified to participate in the Medicare Program. Loss of either state license or Medicare Program certification will be cause for termination of Medicaid provider status. (7-15-87) 03. Payment Procedures. Payment for home health servi ces will be limited to the services authorized in Subsection 105.01 and must not exceed the lesser of reasonable cost as determined by Medicare or the Title XIX percentile cap. (12-31-91) a. For visits performed in the first state fiscal year for which this subsection is in effect, the Title XIX percentile cap will be established at the seventy fifth percentile of the ranked costs per visit as determined by the Department using the data from the most recent finalized Medicare cost reports on hand in the Bureau on June 1, 1987. Thereafter the percentile cap will be revised annually, effective at the beginning of each state fiscal year. Revisions will be made using the data from the most recent finalized Medicare cost reports on hand thirty (30) days prior to the effective date. (8-1-92) b. When determining reasonable costs of rented medical equipment ordered by a physician and used for the care of the patient the total rental cost of a Durable Medical Equipment (DME) item shall not exceed one- twelfth (1/12) of the total purchase price of the item. A minimum rental rate of fifteen dollars ($15) per month is allowed on all DME items. (5-1-92) c.

Individuals who are identified by the RMU as not meeting the criteria for inclusion in the target population and are therefore not eligible for CM services may appeal such action utilizing procedures contained in Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16.05.03, Section 301, et seq., \"Rules Governing Contested Cases and Declaratory Rulings\". (7-1-94) 148. PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT FOR PERSONAL CARE SERVICES. 01. Reimbursement Rate. Personal care providers will be paid a uniform reimbursement rate for service as established by the Department pursuant to Section 39-5606, Idaho Code, on an annual basis. Provider claims for payment will be submitted on claim forms provided or approved by the Department. Billing instructions will be provided by the Department. (1-1-91) 02. Calculated Fee. The fee calculated for personal care provider reimbursement includes a basic rate for services and mileage. No separate charges for mileage will be paid by the Department for nonmedical client transportation or provider transportation to and from the recipient's home. Fees will be calculated as follows: (1-1- 91) a. Annually Medicaid will conduct a poll of all Idaho nursing facilities and establish the weighted average hourly rates (WAHR) for nursing facility industry employees in comparable positions (i.e. RN, QMRP, and Nurse's aide) in Idaho to be used fo r the reimbursement rate to be effective on July 1 of that year. (3-1-99)T b. Medicaid will then establish thr ee (3) payment levels for both pr ovider agencies and independent providers for PCS attendant services as follows: (3-1-99)T i. Weekly service needs of zero to sixteen (0-16) hou rs or waiver recipients zero to eight (0-8) hours/ day: (1-30-94) ii. Extended visit, one (1) recipient (eight and one-quarter hour (8.25) up to twenty-four (24) hours):Provider Agencies WAHR x 1.55 = $ amount/hour Independent ProvidersWAHR x 1.22 (which is a supplemental component to cover training, social security and liability insurance)= $ amount/hour Provider Agencies and Fiscal Intermediary(WAHR x actual hours of care up to 5 hours x 1.55) plus ($.65 x 1.55 hours on site on-call)=$ amount (Maximum $59.51)1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 143 (3-1-99)T iii. Extended visit, two (2) recipients (eight and one-quarter (8.25) up to twenty-four (24) hours): (3-1-99)T c. The attending physician will be reimbursed for se rvices provided using current payment levels and methodologies for other physician services provided to eligible recipients. (1-1-91) d. The supervisory RN and QMRP will be reimbursed at a per visit amount established by the Department for supervisory visits. Client evaluations and Care Plan Development will be reimbursed at a rate established by the Department, following authorization by the RMU. (1-1-91) i. The number of supervisory visits by the RN and QMRP to be conducted per calendar quarter will be approved as part of the PCS care plan by the RMU. (1-1-91) ii. Additional evaluations or emergency visits in ex cess of those contained in the approved care plan will be authorized when needed by the RMU. (1-1-91) 149. CLIENT PARTICIPATION IN THE COST OF WAIVER SERVICES. A recipient will not be required to participate in the cost of waiver services unless the recipient's entitlement to MA is based on approval for, and receipt of, a waiver service and income limitations contained in IDAPA 16.03.05.634. Income excluded under the provisions of IDAPA 16.03.05.613 and 16.03.05.615 is excluded in determining client participation. (7-1-97) 01. Base Participation. Base participation is income available for client participation after subtracting all allowable deductions, except for the incurred medical expense deduction in Subsection 149.04. Base participation is calculated by the recipient's Eligibility Examiner. The incurred medical expense deduction is calculated by the RMU or ACCESS unit. (7-1-97) 02. Community Spouse. Except for the recipient's pe rsonal needs allowance, base participation for a recipient with a community spouse is calculated under IDAPA 16.03.05.615. The HCBS personal needs allowance for a recipient living independently, in room and board, or in an adult foster care home at the recipient's level of care, is equal to the AABD allowances for the recipient's livin g arrangement. These allowan ces are specified in IDAPA 16.03.05, Eligibility for Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (AABD). A community spouse is the spouse of an HCBS recipient who is not an HCBS recipient and is not institutionalized. (4-1-98)T 03. No Community Spouse. Base participation for a recipient with no community spouse is calculated under IDAPA 16.03.05.613, using the appropriate HCBS personal needs allowance. The HCBS personal needs allowance is equal to the AABD allowances for a recipien t living alone in his own home. The HCBS personal needs allowance for a recipient living independently, in room and bo ard, or in an adult foster care home at the recipient's level of care, is equal to the AABD allo for the recipient's specified in IDAPA 16.03.05. The HCBS personal needs allowance for the clients receiving Waiver Services for Adult Developmentally Disabled Recipients is three (3) times the federal SSI benefit amount to an individual in his own home. (4-1-98)TIndependent Providers(WAHR x actual hours of care up to 5 hours x 1.22) plus ($.65 x 1.22 x actual hours on site on-call)=$ amount (Maximum $56.43) Provider Agencies and Fiscal Intermediary(WAHR x actual hours of care up to 4 hours) x (1.55 plus $.65 x 1.55 x hours on site on-call)=$ amount (Maximum $50.73) Independent Providers(WAHR x hours actual care up to 4 hours x 1.22) plus ($.65 x 1.22 x hours on site on-call)=$ amount (Maximum $41.44)1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 144 04. Incurred Medical Expenses. Amounts for certain limited medical or remedial services not covered by the Idaho Medicaid Plan and not paid by a third party may be deducted from the base participation amount. The Department must determine whether an individual's incurred expenses for such limited services meet the criteria for deduction. The recipient must report such expenses and provid e verification in order for an expense to be considered for deduction. Deductions for necessary medical or remedial expenses approved by the Department will be deducted at application, and changed, as necessary, based on chan ges reported to the Department by the recipient. (7-1-97) 05. Remainder After Calculation. Any remainder after the calculation in Subsection 149.04 is the maximum participation to be deducted from the recipient's provider payments to offset the cost of personal care services. The participation will be coll ected from the recipient by the provide r agency or independent provider. The provider and the recipient will be notified by the Department of the amount to be collected. (7-1-97) 06. Recalculation of Client Participation. The client participation amount must be recalculated annually at redetermination or whenever a change in income or deductions becomes known to the Department. (7-1-97) 150. TRANSPORTATION. \"Transportation\" includes expenses for transportation, co st of meals and lodging en route to and from receiving medical care or treatment, and while receivi ng medical care or treatment. It also in cludes the cost of an attendant to accompany the recipient, if necessary, an d the cost of the attendant's transpor tation, meals, lodging and, if the attendant is not a member of the recipient's family, salary. Review of \"transportation\" is required to insure that only necessary and reasonable expenses are paid. Certain trans portation services require preapproval, and other services require review after the services have been rendered. An exception to preapproval can be made when the service was an emergency or when eligibility for Medicaid is determined after the service was provided, or when a retrospective approval is required by the Department. (7-1-98) 01. Scope of Coverage and General Requirements for Transportation. (7-1-98)a. The Department will pay for necessary transpor tation for a Medicaid recipi ent to receive medical care or treatment from providers of Medicaid approved medical services. Out-of-state transportation will not be reimbursed without obtaining authorizations required in Subsection 015.03. Transportation services are subject to review by the Department or its designee prior to services being rendered, or on a retrospective basis. Transportation service review is governed by provisions of the Transpor tation Policies and Procedures Manual as amended. If such review identifies that a transportation service is not covered, then no Medicaid payment will be made for the transportation service. Reimbursement for transportation services originally denied by the Department or its designee will be made if such decision is reversed by the appeals process required in IDAPA 16.05.03, \"Rules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings\". (7-1-98) b. The Department or its designee may authorize the transportation, meals, and lodging costs of an attendant or one (1) immediate family member to accompany the recipient, if necessary, and salary for the attendant, if he is not a member of the recipient's family. The Department will not pay the meals or lodging costs for of a salaried attendant once the recipient being escorted is admitted to an inpatient facility. The Department will pay the meals and lodging costs of one (1) immediate family member while the recipient is an inpatient in a facility, if deemed necessary due to the recipient' s age or other factors, and authorized by the Department or its designee. (7-1-98) c. When lodging is required, the Department or its designee will authorize it insuring that the least expensive yet most appropriate lodgi ng is provided. Receipts for lodging ma y be required by the Department. (7-1-98) d. For any requests for transportation costs to receive covered medical care or treatment, the Department or its designee will only authorize transporta tion costs to the nearest avai lable, appropriate Medicaid provider. In some cases, a referral from the recipi ent's primary care physician is also required. (7-1-98) e. If private vehicle transportation is used, the Department will pay for such transportation at rates established by the Department. The private carrier is respon sible for providing all necessary insurance at no cost to the Department. (7-1-98)1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 145 f. If other than private vehicle transportation is used, the transportation must be the least expensive yet the most appropriate form available. The Department will make payment for such transportation at rates established by the Department. The carrier is responsible for providing all necessary insurance at no cost to the Department. (7-1-98) g. Reimbursement will be made by the Department for necessary transportation to any person, including but not limited to the recipient, or a relative or friend of the recipient. The Department will make payment to the recipient if the recipient has paid for or provided the transportation service, or to the actual provider of the transportation service. Each billing invoice must have prior authorization attached, if appropriate, and be submitted to the Department for payment. Providers must bill on a HCFA 1500 claim form. If no at tachments to the claim are required, the provider may bill electronically. Payment for transportation costs will not be issued prior to the service being rendered. (7-1-98) h. Commercial transportation companies, such as taxi, intra-city bus or van, inter-city bus or van, intrastate bus or van, interstate bus or van, airlines, car rental agencies, or lodging facilities, must not charge Medicaid recipients more than is charged to th e general public for the same service. (7-1-98) i. If the recipient has two (2) or more separate medical appointments in a day which necessitate separate trips by the same or a different transporter, the Department will pay for a round trip to transport the recipient to each appointment. (7-1-98) j. In order for the Department to pay for transportation services, the recipient must be taking the trip to actually receive medical care or treat ment from a Medicaid provider. (7-1-98) k. The Department will not pay for transportation or lodging when those services are available and provided at no cost by organizations such as Red Cross, Easter Seal Society, Cancer Society, fraternal and church organizations, Ronald McDonald Houses, and other private or social agencies. (7-1-98) 02. Preauthorization for Transportation to a Distant Point. Preauthorization of transportation to a distant point, either in or out-of-state, is required. For purposes of these rules, a \"distant point\" is defined as more than ten (10) miles from the recipient's residence. The Department or its designee must determine the following: (7-1-98) a. That adequate and comparable medical services are not available locally. When the services are available locally and/or more than one (1) service provider is within the local area, the Department's reimbursement is limited to round trip mileage to the closest pr ovider of the necessary service; and (7-1-97) b. That an appointment for covered medical care or treatment has been made with a provider at the distant point; and (7-1-98) c. If applicable, that a referral has been made by the patient's attending physician. (1-16-80) d. Transportation will not be authorized unless out-of -state care authorizations have been obtained as required in Subsection 015.03. Exceptions to this requirement are: Veteran's Hospitals and specialty hospitals which do not make a charge to the general public. Therefore, no authorization for hospitalization is made by Medicaid. (2-15-93) e. The Department will only authorize meals when over night travel to a distant point is required and cooking facilities are not available. The actual cost of the meals will be authorized up to the amount set by the Department. Meals and lodging costs will not be paid if the recipient and/or the attendant stays in a private home that is not a lodging facility. (7-1-98) 03. Scope of Coverage and General Requirement s for Ambulance Services. Medically necessary ambulance services are reimbursable in emergency situations or when prior authorization has been obtained from the Department or its designee. Ambulance services are subject to review by the Department or its designee prior to the service being rendered, and on a retrospective basis. Ambulance service review is governed by provisions of the Transportation Policies and Procedures Manual as amended. If such review identifies that an ambulance service is not 1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 146 covered, then no Medicaid payment will be made for the ambulance service. Reimbursem ent for ambulance services originally denied by the Department or its designee will be made if such decision is reversed by the appeals process required in IDAPA 16.05.03, \"Rules Gove rning Contested Case Proceedings a nd Declaratory Rulings\". Payment for ambulance services is subject to the following limitations: (7-1-98) a. If a Medicaid recipient is also a Medicare recipien t, a provider must first bill Medicare for services rendered. (7-1-98) b. If Medicare does not pay the entire bill for ambul ance service, the provid er is to secure an \"Explanation of Benefits\" (EOB) from Medicare, attach it to the appropriate claim form and submit it to the Department. (7-1-98) c. For Medicare recipients, the Department will reim burse providers for deductible and co-insurance not to exceed the Medicaid allowed amount for the services billed. (7-1-98) d. Before payment is made by the Department, a Medicaid recipient must utilize any available insurance benefits to pay for ambulance services. (7-1-98) e. Ambulance services are medically necessary when an emergency condition exists. For purposes of reimbursement, an emergency condition exists when a reci pient manifests acute symptoms and/or signs which, by reasonable medical judgement of the Depart ment or its designee, represent a condition of sufficient severity such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in death, serious impairment of a bodily function or major organ, and/or serious jeopardy to the overall health of the recipient. If such condition exists, and treatment is required at the recipien t's location, or transport of the recipient for treatment in another location by ambulance is the only appropriate mode of travel, the Depart ment will review such claims and consider authorization for emergency ambulance services. If an emergency does not exist, prior written authorization to transport by ambulance must be secured from the Department or its de signee. For purposes of reimbursement, in non-emergency situations, the provider must provide justification to the Department or its designee that travel by ambulance is medically necessary due to the medical condition of the recipient, and that any other mode of travel would, by reasonable medical judgement of the Department or its designee, result in death, serious impairment of a bodily function or major organ, and/or serious jeopardy to the overall health of the recipient. (7-1-98) f. Each billing invoice for ambulance service must have prior authorization attached, if appropriate, and be submitted to the Department for payment. Ambulance units that are not hospital- based must bill on a HCFA 1500 claim form and are reimbursed on a fee for service schedule. Hospital- based ambulance units must bill on a UB-92 claim form and are reimbursed at the hospital's outpa tient reimbursement rate. If no attachments to the claim are required, the provider may bill electronically. (7-1-98) g. All Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Providers th at provide services to Medicaid recipients in Idaho must hold a current license issued by the Emergency Medical Services Bureau of the Department, and must be governed by IDAPA 16.02.03, \"Rules Governing Emergency Medical Services\". Ambulances based outside the state of Idaho must hold a current license issued by their states' EMS licensing authority when the transport is initiated outside the state of Idaho. Payment will not be made to ambulances that do not hold a current license. (7-1-98) h. Only local transportation by ambulance is covered. In exceptional situations where the ambulance transportation originates beyond the locality to which the recipient was transported, payment may be made for such services only if the evidence clearly establishes that such institution is the nearest one with appropriate facilities and the service is authorized by the De partment or its designee. (7-1-98) i. Ambulance services providers cannot charge Medi caid recipients more than is charged to the general public for the same service. (7-1-98) 04. Air Ambulance Service. In some areas, transportation by airplane or helicopter may qualify as ambulance services. Air ambulance serv ices are covered only when: (7-1-98) a. The point of pickup is inaccessible by land vehicle; or (11-10-81)1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 147 b. Great distances or other obstacles are involved in getting the recipient to the nearest appropriate facility and speedy admission is essential; and (11-10-81) c. Air ambulance service will be covered where th e recipient's condition and other circumstances necessitate the use of this type of transportation; however, where land ambulance service will suffice, payment will be based on the amount payable for land ambulance, or the lowest cost. (11-10-81) d. Air ambulance services must be approved in adva nce by the Department or its designee except in emergency situations. Emergency air ambulance services must be authorized by the Department or its designee on a retrospective basis. (7-1-98) e. The operator of the air service must bill the air ambulance service rather than the hospital or other facility receiving the recipient. (7-1-98) 05. Ambulance Reimbursement. (7-1-98) a. Base rate for ambulance services includes cust omary patient care equipment including such items as stretcher, clean linens, reusable devi ces, and reusable equipment. (11-10-81) b. Not to be included as a base rate and to be b illed separately are charges for each nonreusable item and disposable supply, such as oxygen, triangular bandage and dressing, which may be required for the care of the recipient during transport. Oxygen will be reimbursed according to volume used by the recipient during transport. The volume must appear in the appr opriate field on th e claim. (7-1-98) c. Charges for extra attendants are not covered except for justified situations and must be authorized by the Department or its designee. (7-1-98) d. If a physician is in attendance during transport, he is responsible for the billing of his services. (11-10-81) e. Reimbursement for waiting time will not be considered unless documentation submitted to the Department or its designee identifies the length of the wa iting time and establishes its medical necessity or indicates that it was physician ordered. Limited waiting time will be allowed for round trips. (7-1-98) f. Ambulance units are licensed by the EMS Bur eau of the Department, or other states' EMS licensing authority according to the level of training and expertise its personnel maintains. At least, this level of personnel are required to be in the pa tient compartment of the vehicle for ev ery ambulance trip. The Department will reimburse a base rate according to the level of ambulan ce license the unit has been i ssued. Units with Emergency Medical Technician - Basic (EMT-B) or equivalent perso nnel in the patient compartment of the vehicle will be reimbursed at the Basic Life Support (BLS) rate. Units with Advanced Emergency Medical Technician-Ambulance (AEMT-A) or equivalent personnel in the patient compartment of the vehicle will be reimbursed at the Intermediate Life Support (ILS) rate. Units with Emergency Medical Tec hnician - Paramedic (EMT-P) or equivalent personnel in the patient compartment of the vehicle will be reimbursed at the Advanced Life Support (ALS) rate. In addition to the base rate, the Department will reimburse mileage. These rates are set by the Department. (7-1-98) g. If multiple licensed EMS providers are involved in the transport of a recipi ent, only the ambulance provider which actually transports the recipient will be reimbursed for the services. In situations where personnel and equipment from a licensed ALS provider boards an ILS or BLS ambulance, the transporting ambulance may bill for ALS services as authorized by the Department or its desi gnee. In situations where personnel and equipment from a licensed ILS provider boards a BLS ambulance, the transporting ambulance may bill for ILS services as authorized by the Department or its designee. In situations where medical personnel and equipment from a medical facility are present during the transport of the recipient, the transporting ambulance may bill at the ALS level of service. The transporting provider must arrange to pay the other prov ider for their services. The only exception to the preceding policy is in situations where medical personnel employed by a licensed air ambulance provider boards an ALS, ILS, or BLS ground ambulance at some point, and the air ambulance medical personnel al so accompany and treat the recipient during the air ambulance trip. In this situation, th e air ambulance provider may bill the appropriate base rate for the air ambulance trip, and may also bill the charges associated with their medical personnel and equipment as 1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 148 authorized by the Department or its designee. The ground ambulance provider may also bill for their part of the trip as authorized by the Department or its designee. (7-1-98) h. If multiple licensed EMS providers transport a recipient for different legs of a trip, each provider must bill their base rate, mileage, and for nonreusable supp lies and oxygen used, as authorized by the Department or its designee. (7-1-98) i. If a licensed transporting EMS provider responds to an emergency situation and treats the recipient, but does not transport the recipient, the Department may re imburse for the treat and release service. The Department will reimburse the appropriate base rate and will pay for nonreusable supplies and oxygen used at the scene. This service requires authorization from the Department or its designee, usually on a retrospective basis. (7-1-98) j. If an ambulance vehicle and crew have returned to a base station after having transported a recipient to a facility and the recipient's physician orders the recipient to be transferred from this facility to another facility because of medical need, two (2) base rate charges, in addition to the mileage, will be considered for reimbursement. If an ambulance vehicle and crew do not return to a base station and the patient is transferred from one (1) facility to another facility, charges for only one (1) base rate, waiting time, and mileage will be considered.(7-1-98) k. Round trip charges will be allowed only in circumstances when a facility in-patient is transported to another facility to obtain specialized services not available in the facility in which the recipient is an in-patient. The transport must be to and from a facility that is the nearest one with the specialized services. (7-1-98) l. If a licensed transporting EMS provider responds to a recipient's location and upon examination and evaluation of the recipient, finds that their condition is such that no treatment or transport is necessary, the Department will pay for the response and evaluation service. This service requires authorization by the Department or its designee, usually on a retrospective basis. No payment will be made if the EMS provider responds and no evaluation is done, or the recipient has left the scene. No payment will be made for mileage, supplies or oxygen, nor will payment be made to an EMS provider who is licensed as a non-transporting provider. (7-1-98) 151. -- 154. (RESERVED). 155. SOCIAL SERVICES. 01. In General. Each Field Office staff person is to be alert to the health needs of recipients as a part of the provision of social services. (11-10-81) 02. Information. (7-1-93)a.

Medical consultation is available to the Field Office on behalf of a MA recipient through the Bureau. (11-10-81) c. Informational and training brochures are avai lable to the Field Office through the Bureau concerning medical problems, diagnosis and treatment, the implications of serious disabilities and illnesses, and the social services available to families and persons suffering from serious illnesses or disabilities. (11-10-81) 156. -- 159. (RESERVED). 160. LONG-TERM CARE. 01. Care and Services Provided. (1-16-80) a. Nursing Facility Care. The minimum content of care and services for nursing facility patients must include the following (see also Section 507): (7-1-94)1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 149 i.

The minimu m content of care and services for ICF/MR must include the services identified in Subsection 160.01.a. an d Section 610, and social and recreational activities. DHW authorized purchases of specialized wheelchair and seating sy stems, and any authorized repairs related to the seating system, which are paid to a medical vendor directly by DHW will not be included in the content of care of ICFs/MR. The specialized wheelchairs and seating systems must be desi gned to fit the needs of a specific ICF/MR resident and cannot be altered to fit another client cost effectively. (7-1-99) c. Direct Care Staff. Direct Care staff in an ICF/ MR are defined as the present on-duty staff calculated over all shifts in a twenty-four (24) hour period for each de fined residential living unit. Direct care staff in an ICF/MR include those employees whose primary du ties include the provision of hands-on, face-to-face contact with the clients of the facility. This includes both regular and live-in/sleep-over staff. It excludes professionals such as psychologists, nurses, and others whose primary job duties are not the provision of direct care, as well as managers/ supervisors who are responsible for the supervision of staff. (5-25-93) d. Level of Involvement. Level of involvement relates to the severity of an MA recipient's mental retardation. Those levels, in decreasing level of severity, are: profound, severe, moderate, and mild. (5-25-93) e. Direct Care Staffing Levels. The reasonable le vel of direct care staffing provided to an MA recipient in an ICF/MR setting will be dependent upon the level of involvement and the need for services and supports of the recipient as determined by the Department, or its representative, and will be subject to the following constraints: (7-1-94)1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 150 i. Direct care staffing for a severely and profoundly retarded recipient residing in an ICF/MR must be a maximum of sixty-eight point twenty five (68.25) hours per week. (5-25-93) ii. Direct care staffing for a moderately retarded recipient residing in an ICF/MR must be limited to a maximum of fifty-four point six (54.6) hours per week. (5-25-93) iii. Direct care staffing for a mildly retarded recipient residing in an ICF/MR must be limited to a maximum of thirty four point one two five (34.125) hours per week. (5-25-93) f. The annual sum total level of allowable direct care staff hours for each residential living unit will be determined in the aggregate as the su m total of the level of staffing allowa ble for each resident residing in that residential living unit as determined in Subsection 160.01.e. (5-25-93) g. Phase-in Period. If enactment of Subsection 160.01.e. requires a facility to reduce its level of direct care staffing, a six (6) month phase-in period will be allowed from the date of the enactment of this section, without any resulting disallowances. Should disallowances result, the hourly rate of direct care staff used in determining disallowances will be the weighted average of the hourly rates paid to a facility's direct care staff, plus the associated benefits, at the end of the phase-in period. (5-25-93) h. Exceptions. Should a provider be able to show convincing evidence docum enting that the annual aggregate direct care hours as allowed under this section will compromise their ability to supply adequate care to the clients, as required by federal regulations and state rules, within an ICF/MR residential living unit and that other less costly options would not alleviate the situation, the Depart ment will approve an additional amount of direct care hours sufficient to meet the extraordin ary needs. This adjustment will only be available up through September 30, 1996. (7-1-99) 02. Conditions of Payment. (2-25-93) a. As a condition of payment by the Department for long-term care on behalf of MA recipients, each fully licensed long-term care facility is to be under the supervision of an administrator who is currently licensed under the laws of the state of Idaho and in accordance with the rules of the Bureau of Occupational Licenses. (5-25-93) b. Nursing facilities and ICF/MR facilities will be reimbursed in accordance with Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16.03.10, \"Rules Governing Medicaid Provider Reimbursement in Idaho\". (5-25-93) 03. Post-eligibility Treatment of Income. Where an individual is determined eligible for MA participation in the cost of his long term care, the Department must reduce its payment to the long term care facility by the amount of his income considered available to meet the cost of his care. This determination is made in accordance with Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16.03.05.585, \"Rules Governing Eligibility for Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)\". (5-25-93) a. The amount which the MA recipient receives from SSA as reimbursement for his payment of the premium for Part B of Title XVIII (Medicare) is not considered income for patient liability (see Subsection 165.02 and Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16.03.05, Subsection 522.02.c., \"Rules Governing Eligibility for the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD)\". (5-25-93) b. Payment by the Department for the cost of long te rm care is to include the date of the recipient's discharge only if the discharge occurred after 3 p.m. an d is not discharged to a related ICF/MR provider. If a Medicaid patient dies in a nursing home, his date of death is covered regardless of the time of occurrence. If an admission and a discharge occur on the same date, then one (1) day of care shall be deemed to exist. (7-1-99) 04. Payments for Periods of Temporary Absence. Payments may be made for reserving beds in long- term care facilities for recipients during their temporary absence if the facility charges private paying patients for reserve bed days, subject to the following limitations: (10-22-93) a. Facility Occupancy Limits. Payment for peri ods of temporary absence from long term care 1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 151 facilities will not be made when the number of unoccupied beds in the facility on the day preceding the period of temporary absence in question is equal to or greater than the larger of: (4-6-83) i. Five (5) beds; or (4-6-83) ii. Five percent (5%) of the total number of licensed beds in the facility. (4-6-83)b. Time Limits. Payments for periods of temporary absence from long term care facilities will be made for: (4-6-83) i. Therapeutic home visits for other than ICF/MR residents of up to three (3) days per visit and not to exceed a total of fifteen (15) days per calendar year so long as the days are part of a treatment plan ordered by the attending physician. (7-1-99) ii. Therapeutic home visits for ICF/MR residents of up to thirty-six (36) days per calendar year so long as the days are part of a written treatment plan ordered by the attending physician. Prior approval from the RMU must be obtained for any home visits exceeding fourteen (14) consecutive days. (7-1-99) c. Limits on Amount of Payments. Payment for reserve bed days will be the lesser of the following: (4-6-83) i. Seventy-five percent (75%) of the audited allowable costs of the facility unless the facility serves only ICF/MR residents, in which case the payment will be one hundred percent (100%) of the audited allowable costs of the facility; or (12-22-88) ii. The rate charged to private paying patients for reserve bed days. (4-6-83)05. Payment Procedures. Each long term care facility must submit its claims to the Department in accordance with the procedures established by the Department. The Department will not pay for a claim in behalf of a MA recipient unless the information on the claim is consistent with the info rmation in the Department's computer eligibility file. (11-10-81) 06. Long-Term Care Facility Responsibilities. In addition to the responsibilities set forth in Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16.03.10, \"Rules Governing Medicaid Provider Reimbursement in Idaho,\" each long term care facility administrator, or his authorized representative, must report: (7-1-94) a. The following information to the appropriate Field Office within three (3) working days of the date the facility has knowledge of: (7-13-89) i. Any readmission or discharge of a recipient, and any temporary absence of a recipient due to hospitalization or therapeutic home visit; and (7-13-89) ii. Any changes in the amount of a recipient's income; and (1-16-80) iii. When a recipient's account has exceeded one thousand eight hundred dollars ($1800) for a single individual or two thousand eight hundred dollars ($2,800) for a married couple; and (7-1-99) iv. Other information about a recipient's finances which potentially may affect eligibility for MA. (11-10-81) b. PASARR. All Medicaid certified nursing facilities must participate in, cooperate with, and meet all requirements imposed by, the Preadmission Screening and Additional Resident Review program (hereafter \"PASARR\") as set forth in 42 CFR, Part 483, Subpart C, which, pursuant to Idaho Code Section 67-5229, is incorporated by reference herein. (7-1-98) i. Background and purpose. The purpose of these pr ovisions is to comply with and implement the PASARR requirements imposed on the state by federal law. The purpose of those requirements is to prevent the 1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 152 placement of individuals with mental illness (MI) or mental retardation (MR) in a nursing facility (NF) unless their medical needs clearly indicate that they require the level of care provided by a nursing facility. This is accomplished by both pre-admission screening (PAS) and additional resident review (ARR). Individuals for whom it appears that a diagnosis of MI or MR is likely are identified for furthe r screening by means of a Level I screen. The actual PASARR is accomplished through a Level II screen where it is determined whether, because of the individual's physical and mental condition, he or she requires the level of services provided by an NF. If the individual with MI or MR is determined to require an NF level of care, it must also be determined whether the i ndividual requires specialized services. PASARR applies to all indivi duals entering or residing in an NF, regardless of payment source. (7-1-98) ii. Policy. It is the policy of the Department that the difficulty in providing specialized services in the NF setting makes it generally inappropriate to place individua ls needing specialized services in an NF. This policy is supported by the background and development of the federal PASARR requirements, including the narrow definition of MI adopted by federal law. While recognizing that th ere are exceptions, it is envisioned that most individuals appropriate for NF placement will not require services in excess of those required to be provided by NFs by 42 CFR 483.45. (11-6-93) iii. Inter-agency agreement. The state Medicaid agency will enter into a written agreement with the state mental health and mental retarda tion authorities as required in 42 CFR 431.621(c). This agreement will, among other things, set forth respective duties and delegation of responsibilities, and any supplemental criteria to be used in making determinations. (11-6-93) (1) The \"State Mental Health Authority\" (hereafter \"SMHA\") is the Division of Family and Community Services of the Department, or its successor entity. (11-6-93) (2) The \"State Mental Retardation or Developmental Disabilities Authority\" (hereafter \"SDDA\") is the Division of Family and Community Services of the Department, or its successor entity. (11-6-93) iv. Coordination. The PASARR process is a coordina ted effort between the state Medicaid agency, the SMHA and SDDA, independent evaluators and NFs. PASARR activities, to the extent possible, will be coordinated through the Regional Medicaid Units (RMUs). RMUs will al so be responsible for record retention and tracking functions. However, NFs are responsible for assuring that all screens are obtained and for coordination with the RMU, independent MI evaluators, the SMHA and SDDA, a nd their designees. Guidelines and procedures on how to comply with these requirements can be found in \"Statewide PASARR Procedures\", a reference guide. (11-6-93) (1) Level I Screens. All required Level I reviews must be completed and submitted to the RMU, prior to admission to the facility. (11-6-93) (2) Level II Screens. When a NF identifies an indivi dual with MI and/or MR through a Level I screen, or otherwise, the NF is responsible for contacting the SMHA or SDDA (as appropriate), or its designee, and assuring that a level II screen is completed prior to admission to the facility, or in the case of an existing resident, completed in order to continue residing in the facility. (11-6-93) (3) Additional Resident Reviews (ARR). An individual identified with MI and/or MR must be reviewed and a new determination made promptly after a signi ficant change in his/her physical or mental condition. The facility must notify the RMU of any such change with in two (2) working days of its occurrence. For the purpose of this section, significant change for the client's ment al condition means a change which may require the provision of specialized services or an increase in such services. A significant change in physical condition is a change that renders the client incapable of responding to MI or D.D. program interventions. (7-1-98) v. Determinations. Determinations as to the need fo r NF care and determinations as to the need for specialized services should not be made independently. Such determinations must often be made on an individual basis, taking into account the condition of the resident and capability of the facility to which admission is proposed to furnish the care needed. When an individu al identified with MI and MR is admitted to a NF, the NF is responsible for meeting that individual's need s, except for the provision of specialized services. (7-1-94) (1) Level of care. (11-6-93)1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 153 (a) Individual determinations. Must be based on evaluations and data as required by these rules. . (11-6-93) (b) Categorical determinations. Recognizing that individual determinations of level of care are not always necessary, those categories set forth as examples at 42 CFR 483.130(d) are hereby adopted as appropriate for categorical determinations. Wh en NF level of care is determined approp riate categorically, th e individual may be conditionally admitted prior to completion of the determination for specialized services. However, conditional admissions cannot exceed seven (7) days, except for respit e admissions, which cannot ex ceed thirty (30) consecutive days in one (1) calendar year. (11-6-93) (2) Specialized services. Specialized services for mental illness as defined in 42 CFR 483.120(a)(1), and for mental retardation as defined in 42 CFR 483.120(a)(2 ), are those services provided by the state which due to the intensity and scope can only be delivered by personnel and programs which are not in cluded in the specialized rehabilitation services required of nursing facilities under 42 CFR 483.45. The need for specialized services must be documented and included in both the resident asse ssment instrument and the plan of care. (11-6-93) (a) Individual determinations. Must be based on evaluations and data as required by these rules. (11-6-93) (b) Group determinations. Catagorical determinations that specialized services are not needed may be made in those situations permitted by 42 CFR 483.130. The same time limits, imposed by Subsection 160.06.b.v.(a)(2) shall apply. (11-6-93) vi. Penalty for non-compliance. No payment shall be made for any services rendered by a NF prior to completion of the Level I screen and, if required, the Level II screen. Failure to comply with PASARR requirements for all individuals admitted or seeking admission may also subject a NF to other penalties as part of certification action under 42 CFR 483.20. (11-6-93) vii. Appeals. Discharges, transfers, and preadmission screening and additional resident review (PASARR) determinations may be appealed to the extent required by 42 CFR, Part 483, Subpart E, which, pursuant to Idaho Code, 67-5229, is incorporated by reference he rein. Appeals under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with the fair hearing provisi ons of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, \"Rules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings,\" IDAPA 16.05.03, Section 300. A Leve l I finding of MI or MR is not an appealable determination. It may be disputed as part of a Level II determination appeal. (7-1-98) viii. Automatic repeal. In the event that the Pread mission Screening and Annual Resident Review program is eliminated or made non-mandatory by act of congress, the provisions of Subsection 160.06.b. of this chapter shall cease to be operative on the effective da te of any such act, without further action. (11-6-93) 07. Provider Application and Certification. (1-16-80) a. A facility can apply to participate as a nursing facility. (7-1-94) b. A facility can apply to participate as an ICF/MR facility. (1-16-80)08. Licensure and Certification. (7-13-89) a. Upon receipt of an application from a facility, the Licensing and Certification Agency must conduct a survey to determine the facility's compliance with certification standards for the type of care the facility proposes to provide to MA recipients. (7-13-89) b. If a facility proposes to participate as a skilled nursing facility, Medicare (Title XVIII) certification and program participation is required before the facility can be certified for Medicaid. The Licensing and Certification Agency must determine the facility's compliance with Medicare requirements and recommend certification to the Medicare Agency. (7-1-94) c. If the Licensing and Certification Agency determines that a facility meets Title XIX certification 1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 154 standards for nursing facility care or ICF/MR, the Section must certify to the appropriate branch of government that the facility meets the standards for NF or ICF/MR types of care. (7-1-94) d. Upon receipt of the certification from the Licen sing and Certification Agency, the Bureau may enter into a provider ag reement with the long-term care facility. (7-13-89) e. After the provider agreement has been executed by the Facility Administrator and by the Chief of the Bureau, one (1) copy must be sent by certified mail to the facility and the original is to be retained by the Bureau. (11-10-81) 09. Determination of Entitlement to Long-Term Care. Entitlement to MA participation in the cost of long-term care exists when the individual is eligible fo r MA and the RNR has determined that the individual meets the criteria for NF or ICF/MR care and services. Entitlement must be determined prior to authorization of payment for such care for an individual who is either a recipient of or an applicant for MA. (7-1-94) a. The criteria for determining a MA recipient's need for either nursing facility care or intermediate care for the mentally retarded must be as set forth in Sections 506 or 610. In addition, the IOC/UC nurse must determine whether a MA recipient's needs could be met by non-inpatient alternatives including, but not limited to, remaining in an independent living arrangement or residing in a room and board situation. (7-1-94) b. The recipient can select any certified facility to provide the care required. (11-10-81) c. The final decision as to the level of care required by a MA recipient must be made by the IOC/UC Nurse. (7-1-94) d. The final decision as to the need for DD or MI active treatment must be made by the appropriate Department staff as a result of the Level II screening process. (7-13-89) e. No payment must be made by the Department on behalf of any eligible MA recipient to any long- term care facility which, in the judgment of the IOCT/UCT is admitting individuals for care or services which are beyond the facility's licensed leve l of care or capability. (7-1-94) 10. Authorization of Long-Term Care Payment. If it ha s been determined that a person eligible for MA is entitled to MA participation in the cost of long-term care, and that the facility selected by the recipient is licensed and certified to provide the level of care the recipient requires, the Field Office will forward to such facility an \"Authorization for Long-Term Care Payment\" form HW 0459. (7-1-94) 161. HOSPITAL SWING-BED REIMBURSEMENT. The Department will pay for NF care in certain rural hospitals. Following approval by the Department, such hospitals may provide service to recipients who require NF level of care as defined by Section 506 in licensed hospital (\"swing\") beds. (7-1-94) 01. Facility Requirements. The Department will approve hospitals for NF care provided to eligible recipients under the following conditions: (7-1-94) a.

The hospital is approved by the Medicare program for the provision of \"swing-bed\" services; and (5-1-84) c. The facility does not have a twenty-four (24) hour nursing waiver granted under 42 CFR 488.54(c); and (8-23-90) d. The hospital must not have had a swing-bed approval terminated within the two (2) years previous to application for swing-bed participation; and (8-23-90)1999 IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 DHW, Division of Welfare Medical Assistance Page 155 e.

Supervision Required. Where the inherent complexity of a service prescribed by the physician is such that it can be safely and/or effectively performed only by or under the supervision of a licensed nurse or licensed physical therapist. (7-1-99) 02. Preventing Deterioration.

This would include the management of a plan involving only a variety of personal care services where, in light of the patient's condition, the aggregate of such services necessitates the involvement of technical or professional personnel. Where the patient's overall condition would support a finding that his recovery and/or safety could be assured only if the total care he requires is planned, manage d, and evaluated by technical or professional personnel, it would be appropriate to infer that skilled services are being provided. (7-1-99) 02. Assessment. Observation and assessment of the re sident's changing condition. When the resident's condition is such that the skills of a licensed nurse or other technical or professional person are required to identify and evaluate the patient's need for possible modification of treatment and the initiation of additional medical procedures until his condition is stabilized, such services constitute skilled services.
