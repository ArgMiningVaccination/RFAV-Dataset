All of our practitioners adhere to the guidance the BAcC has produced to ensure they comply with the current government guidance relating to practice. A risk assessment will be done by each practitioner to consider the measures needed to keep the clinic safe. - What should I expect when I get to the clinic? Before arrival If you or someone you live with develops symptoms of COVID-19 by the time of the appointment, please contact the clinic before attending your appointment. Handwashing Please wash your hands immediately upon entering the clinic. You will be directed to the appropriate facilities. There will be a poster nearby to demonstrate handwashing techniques recommended by the NHS. - Please also wash your hands before leaving the clinic. - Face mask and respiratory hygiene Please speak to your practitioner beforehand about mask wearing expectations and raise any concerns you have at this time. Your practitioner will determine their minimum requirements based on a through risk assessment. If you need to sneeze or cough while in the clinic, please do so into a disposable tissue and throw it away immediately. Please wash your hands immediately after doing so. We are also encouraging cashless payment where possible. - How do I prepare for my appointment? Most clinics have introduced new procedures to minimise risk of transmission of COVID-19. A pre-appointment may be part of the procedure. Your practitioner my ask you to complete this assessment by telephone or email before you can attend your appointment. So, please fill in and return any forms sent to you by your practitioner making sure you inform them if anything changes before the appointment. Please discuss yours and your practitioners` expectations regarding facemask wearing and any other expectations with your practitioner beforehand. It is recommended that you do not attend with an empty stomach (ie not having eaten that day) but try not to eat immediately before treatment either. - Can my carer/parent/guardian attend the appointment with me? If you require a carer/parent/guardian to attend, please let the practitioner know beforehand as they may require COVID-19 screening and consent forms. If the treatment room is not big enough to social distance, there may be additional concerns for the practitioner. - Will my practitioner wear a mask? Practitioners may choose to wear a mask in clinic, this will be based upon their own risk assessment and professional judgement. Please communicate any expectations you may have prior to attending for treatment. - Can I catch COVID-19 from the needles? All of our practitioners use single use, pre-packed sterile needles which will be incinerated after your treatment. As our practitioners wash their hands before handling these needles as well as before inserting and removing them, there is next to no risk of catching COVID-19 from a needle. - Can I have acupuncture the day after my vaccine? You should wait a few days until any immediate ill effects wear off after having the vaccine before having any treatment. This is not a hard and fast rule, and a practitioner may use their professional judgement to advise on this, as certain treatments are time dependent. - Can acupuncture help with Long Covid? An increasing number of studies show that acupuncture can have a direct impact on the immune system and in addition, that it has an anti-inflammatory action, particularly useful in cases of patients suffering from symptoms caused by COVID-19. These studies show that the levels of immune cells change in an immune enhancing, overreaction dampening fashion. In other words, the studies have shown clear evidence that acupuncture increases the body's ability to fight infections, while at the same time calming the body's occasional but detrimental tendency to overreact. - Can a practitioner require proof of vaccination as a condition of treatment? The NHS Covid pass is no longer available for businesses to use, and should only be used for international travel. - Do patients still need to fill in a consent form with COVID-19 screening questions? This is no longer a requirement however the COVID-19 consent form supplied in the COVID-19 guidelines is a sample template which can be used for practitioners to screen patients. Practitioners may adjust it to better suit their requirements and the screening questions are meant as a guide to better inform the risk assessment and decision to treat. The information can be adjusted or removed depending on its relevance for the practitioner and their practice. It remains that COVID-19 is a workplace hazard, and screening should be done for every client on the initial consultation, as well as a reminder to the patient to inform the practitioner should anything change. - If a patients` partner or household member has COVID 19 are they still able to attend for treatment? Yes, the patient may attend clinic. It is no longer the law to self isolate when in contact with a confirmed case. "}
