It was developed under the Private FinanceInitiative to replace the previous National Insurance Recording System(NIRS 1). The Contributions Agency, then part of the Department of SocialSecurity, was responsible for the development project. Following acompetition, the Agency awarded the NIRS 2 contract to Accenture - thenAndersen Consulting - in 1995. The contract covered the replacement ofNIRS 1, transfer of data to the new system, development of the system toimplement legislative changes arising from the Pensions Act 1995, and theoperation of the new system until 2004. 2 In 1998 the Government proposed significant changes to pensions and national insurance legislation, for example to introduce stakeholder pensions andpension sharing on divorce. The Inland Revenue, who had taken overresponsibility for NIRS 2 in April 1999 with the transfer of the ContributionsAgency, negotiated an extension to the contract to cover the work needed tosupport these legislative changes. The original contract was valued at\u00a345 million for operational services with provision for software enhancementsincreasing that to \u00a376 million. The estimated value of the extension is between\u00a370 million and \u00a3144 million, depending on the amount of work ordered overthe remaining life of the contract. On the basis of development work orderedand planned to date, the Department's current estimate is for substantially lessthan \u00a3144 million (Figure 1) . 1National Insurance Recording System contracts !Social Security Act 1998!Replacement of NIRS 1 !Transfer of data !Implement legislative changes from Pensions Act 1995 !Allow for other change foreseen in 1995!Implement legislative changes since 1998 !Allow for further major change up to 2004NIRS2 Contract \u00a345 - 76 millionNIRS2 Contract Extension \u00a370 - 144 million !Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000!Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 19992executive summaryNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION 3 We carried out a study of the extension to the NIRS 2 contract in order to ascertain: !why the Department needed to contract for additional development workbeyond the scope of the original contract; !what options were available to the Department for carrying out theadditional work, and how these options were evaluated; !how the Department evaluated the proposal submitted by Accenture in theabsence of open competition; !whether risks were shared appropriately between the parties to the contract;and !what steps the Department had taken to ensure that the problems arisingunder the original contract are not repeated during the course of theadditional work. 4 We decided to issue this report for two reasons: !to consider, on the basis of the NIRS 2 experience, the extent to which private finance initiative (PFI) contracts can provide the flexibility toaccommodate changes in government programmes and practice that flowfrom government policy developments; and !to review developments on the NIRS 2 contract with Accenture followingour initial examination 1and the subsequent reports by the Committee of Public Accounts.2NIRS 2 is a major project, supporting the Inland Revenue's administration of the national insurance scheme, holding detailsof 65 million national insurance contributors and calculating benefits andother amounts payable, such as state pensions. A project of this size andimportance is a matter of continuing public and Parliamentary interest. 5 The report does not cover the implementation or operation of the original system, progress with which is being monitored as part of our annual audits ofthe National Insurance Fund account. 1 HC12, Session 1997-98 2 The contract to develop and update the replacement national insurance recording system (46th Report, Session 1997-98 (HC472))Delays to the new national insurance recording system (22nd Report, Session 1998-99 (HC 182))National Insurance Fund 1998-99 (31st Report, Session 350))3executive summaryNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION The original NIRS 2 contract proved insufficiently flexible in catering for the significant legislative changes to pensions andnational insurance proposed by the Government in 1998 6 The original NIRS 2 contract included provision for system development work to meet foreseeable legislative changes. There was an annual limit to the quantity ofsystem enhancements which could be ordered at the agreed price, based on theContributions Agency's experience in operating the previous National InsuranceRecording System. The pricing arrangements for system enhancements werefinalised after the contract award. 7 In 1998, the government proposed changes to pensions and national insurance legislation on a scale which considerably exceeded the level expected when thecontract was agreed. The Department of Social Security had provided advice toMinisters on the technical feasibility and costs of each of the policy changes. Theimplications of each policy were, however, assessed separately, and theDepartment's ability to assess the capacity of NIRS 2 to accommodate the overallpackage of changes within the proposed legislative timetable was limited byuncertainties about the initial stabilisation of the system, and the lack of clarityaround the timescales for these changes. This meant that they were not in aposition to establish fully the aggregate effect of the changes on NIRS 2. 8 At the point when the Inland Revenue took over responsibility for NIRS 2, it was unclear whether the contract contained sufficient headroom to cater for thedevelopment work needed. They therefore worked with the Department ofSocial Security, Accenture and EDS to determine the volume of new workrequired by the legislative changes, for which responsibility was now sharedbetween the two departments, and the feasibility of delivering it throughNIRS 2. The Inland Revenue concluded that the scale of the new work exceededthe contract limit and decided to examine how best to meet the commitments. The extension of the NIRS 2 contract 9 The Inland Revenue looked at alternatives to using NIRS 2 to support the new legislative requirements, including clerical solutions and using otherinformation technology systems. Most of these were rejected because theywere not technically feasible or likely to involve greater risk or cost thanenhancing NIRS 2. They concluded that NIRS 2 was the most practicableoption for some 80 per cent of the work required.4executive summaryNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION 10 The Inland Revenue had three main contractual options for commissioning the new NIRS 2 development work: !to negotiate a contract extension; !to ask Accenture to provide the additional resources required atDepartment of Social Security framework rates, under the original contractterms; !to exercise the break clause in the original contract and hold a newcompetition for the continuing operation and development of the system. 11 They opened discussions with Accenture about extending the contract. In response, Accenture offered to deliver all development work using a dedicatedsoftware support facility. Doing this and introducing longer-term planning ofresource requirements would enable them to offer a lower price forenhancements than the Department of Social Security framework rates, whichwere the alternative charging mechanism. 12 The Inland Revenue then commissioned PA Consulting to develop a financial model to compare the cost of Accenture's proposals with that of usingalternative suppliers. The work showed that Accenture's unit costs comparedclosely with the comparators, but breaking the NIRS 2 contract would haveincurred additional costs estimated at \u00a344 million. The results thereforesupported the option to extend the contract with Accenture. 13 In addition to the financial evaluation, the Inland Revenue assessed Accenture's ability to deliver software of the required quality, the firm'scommercial stability, legal, commercial and security issues, the legislativetimetable, and the scope to improve their management of development work.After taking these factors into account, as well as a technical review of NIRSand latest Treasury guidance the Inland Revenue concluded that a contractextension provided the best option for meeting the legislative requirements inthe timescale required. 14 The Inland Revenue used the extension to the contract to introduce new operating arrangements to resolve difficulties arising on the original contractwhich had contributed to delays in implementing the system. In doing so, theyobtained legal advice that the extension complied with European procurementrules in all respects other than that the new payment arrangements to improvetheir control of development work did not strictly adhere to the terms of theoriginal procurement advertisement. The advice recognised that this might giverise to claims for compensation from other suppliers, but that the risk ofchallenge was extremely low. However, the alternatives would not haveallowed them to meet the timetable prescribed by new pensions legislation,which was already in force. They decided to proceed, as they considered thatthe costs of delaying the work programme and the advantages of the revisedarrangements outweighed the risks attached to not complying fully with theprocurement rules.5executive summaryNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION 15 Under the new arrangements, Accenture continue to bear risks relating to the operation and availability of the system. The risks associated with system enhance-ments, however, are shared to a greater extent than under the original contract. Thecontract extension has introduced stage payments linked to the achievement ofmilestones, productivity incentives, and profit sharing arrangements. 16 The Inland Revenue have recognised that, in any relationship of this kind, it is not possible to transfer the business risk of non-delivery to the contractor. Theyhave therefore strengthened arrangements for managing delivery risks byintroducing their own project management methodology to the contract. Thisincludes a system that ensures developments to the system are managed as aseries of projects, which are overseen centrally and allocated a specific releasedate linked to the legislative timetable. There are joint working arrangements tosecure increased collaboration and acceptance criteria are defined moreclearly than before. The management arrangements for the contract extensioncorrespond closely to subsequent government guidance on risk management inPFI contracts and IT projects. 17 The Inland Revenue and Accenture consider that their relationship has improved since the contract extension, due to the introduction and operationof partnership principles. Both sides describe the current relationship as open,trusting and effective in managing the contract, and have seen advantagesaccruing since the new arrangements were introduced. System changesrequired to support pensions sharing on divorce, changes in bereavement andincapacity benefits and the restructuring of national insurance contributionshave been delivered successfully. The Inland Revenue reported that the NIRS 2service had improved significantly since the new arrangements had come intooperation and user satisfaction increased substantially. In the 12 months to31 March 2001 service levels had consistently exceeded target performanceand 2 major releases of high quality software had been made on schedule.6executive summaryNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION 18 The key points arising from our examination are as follows: On the need for an extension and the lessons for Departments a The original NIRS 2 contract between the Department of Social Security and Accenture included flexibility to cater for legislative change then planned, an agreed annual volume of additional development work and routine enhancements. Butthe scale of change arising from new legislation in 1998 was considerably beyond the level expected when the contract wasagreed, and exceeded the levels allowed for in the contract. Departments should consider whether contracts should include specific mechanisms to deal with major enhancements of this nature. This might involve the reintroduction of competition orinviting the bidders to propose a separate pricing structure for major enhancements as part of the initial tendering process. b The Department of Social Security did not assess the aggregate impact of the proposed policy changes and their timing on NIRS 2 development capacity. At the point when responsibility for the system was transferred to the Inland Revenue, neitherDepartment had a clear view of whether there was the technical or contractual capacity to deliver the changes using thesystem. In advising Ministers on the implications for existing information technology systems of fixing deadlines for major legislative change, Departments need to understand the impact on their systems, individually and in aggregate, and developstrategies to manage the resulting risks. c When the original NIRS 2 contract was concluded in 1995, there was little experience of the Private Finance Initiative and none in the field of information technology. An information technology procurement contract of this scale and complexitypresented challenges in estimating the size of the requirement and developing pricing strategies which had not arisen inother Private Finance Initiative deals at the time. The Government have produced substantial additional guidance on sucharrangements since 1999, in the light of experience with this and other contracts, which includes the following advice: !Change control, and similar procedures should be agreed at the outset and allow open discussion about the volume andcost of developments. Contracts should set out clearly how acceptance will be defined. !Departments should avoid agreements to agree in key areas of contracts. The latter point is particularly important because attempts to conclude such agreements may be complicated, difficult and expensive and, in the extreme, may result in a material diminution in the value of a contract to a Department. On the contract extension d A contract extension offered better value for money to the Inland Revenue to deliver the required enhancements within the timescale required than the alternatives available. e In deciding to implement the new contractual arrangements, the Inland Revenue took into account legal advice that the new payment arrangements might leave them vulnerable to claims for compensation. As the risk of challenge was extremelylow they decided to proceed in order to meet the proposed timetable for new pensions legislation and to secureimprovements in their control of development work. Legislative timetables should be set so that Departments can implement changes while complying with other legal requirements. f The Inland Revenue contract management arrangements for the extension adhere closely to current guidance on risk management in PFI contracts and information technology projects. Had this guidance been available at the time, it wouldhave led to contractual and operating arrangements considerably different from those originally adopted for NIRS 2. Risksassociated with enhancements to the system are shared to a greater extent than under the original contract. The newarrangements have achieved improvements in the relationship between the parties and in the delivery of systemenhancements, addressing weaknesses identified by the Committee of Public Accounts.Conclusions and recommendationsPart 1NIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION Introduction 7part one1.1 This report is about an extension to the Inland Revenue's contract with Accenture to develop and operate theNIRS 2 computer system. The extension, which wasapproved in April 2000, covers development work notenvisaged when the original contract was signed. It willincrease the overall value of the contract by between\u00a370 million and \u00a3144 million, depending on theamount of work ordered. The current estimates are forsubstantially less than \u00a3144 million. 1.2 NIRS 2 - the National Insurance Recording System - is a large and complex computer system designed tosupport the administration of the national insurancescheme. It holds details of some 65 million individualnational insurance contribution records. Thisinformation is fundamental to the accurate calculationof contributory social security benefits, such asretirement pension. It also underpins payments topension schemes in respect of contributors withcontracted out personal pensions. In 1999-2000, theInland Revenue collected over \u00a350 billion in national insurance contributions and the Department of SocialSecurity (now the Department for Work and Pensions)paid out \u00a346 billion in contributory benefits, based onrecords held on the system. Figure 2 provides a summary of the main functions of the system. 1.3 The NIRS 2 system was developed under the Private Finance Initiative to replace the existing NationalInsurance Recording System (NIRS 1). The developmentproject was the responsibility of the ContributionsAgency, then part of the Department of Social Security.In 1995, following a competition, the Agency awardedthe NIRS 2 contract to Accenture - then AndersenConsulting. The contract was valued at \u00a345 million foroperational services with provision for softwareenhancements until the contract expired in 2004increasing that to \u00a376 million. It covered thereplacement of NIRS 1, transfer of data to the newsystem, development of the system to implement NIRS 2 main functions and interfaces2 EmployersPension schemes Self- employed IndividualsNIRS 2Inland Revenue PAYE records Department for Work and Pensions - Benefits systemsCalculates benefits, including pensions Pay benefits, including pensionsMaintains NI records, for all contributors, issues NI cardsPAYE system Pay and tax detailsPays rebates Supplies information Source: Based on Inland Revenue description of NIRS key functionsMake contributions, supply information8part oneNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION legislative changes arising from the Pensions Act 1995, regular enhancements to the system, and the operationof the new service until 2004.

There have also beenoperational difficulties which have led to delays inprocessing and payments, resulting in poor customerservice. The Committee of Public Accounts havereported on the system on three occasions and havetaken a close interest in progress in addressing the delaysin implementation. 4By April 2000, the original system had been fully implemented, except for some featuresjudged to be of a lower priority than later enhancements. 1.5 The Inland Revenue took over responsibility for NIRS 2 in April 1999 on the transfer of the ContributionsAgency. The Inland Revenue are now responsible forcollecting national insurance contributions andmaintaining records but the social security benefitpayment functions supported by NIRS 2 are theresponsibility of the Department for Work and Pensions. While the Inland Revenue have overall responsibility formanaging the NIRS 2 contract, they have set up jointworking arrangements which bring together the mainparties committed to the effective operation of thesystem. Figure 3 outlines the main organisational responsibilities and joint working arrangements relatingto NIRS 2. 1.6 In 1998, the Government proposed significant changes to pensions and national insurance legislation. The InlandRevenue, on assuming responsibility for the contract inApril 1999, worked with the Department of SocialSecurity and Accenture to establish how best to supportthe legislative changes. After evaluating various options,the Inland Revenue decided that an extension to theNIRS2 contract was the appropriate vehicle to deliver thedevelopment work needed to support the changes withinthe prescribed timetable. 1.7 A contract addendum signed in April 2000 provides a framework within which the Inland Revenue can orderthe additional work from Accenture. The extensionallows for a minimum capacity to cover known changesthat needed to be made, and a maximum capacity toensure any further legislative changes can be 3Organisational responsibilities for NIRS 2 Interdepartmental Steering Group A board level Department for Work and Pensions/Inland Revenue group, considering a range of issues and areas of common interest between the departments and acting as an escalation point when necessary.

It covers: !how the original contract provided forenhancements; !why additional work was required; and !how the volume of additional work was assessed. The original contract did not allow for the scale of legislative change proposed in 1998 2.2 The Contributions Agency's 1995 contract with Accenture to develop and run NIRS 2 coveredreplacement of the previous National InsuranceRecording System and enhancements required to supportlegislative changes arising from the Pensions Act 1995,which were due to take effect from April 1997. Thecontract also made provision for routine enhancementsand an agreed annual volume of additional developmentwork, measured in function points. 8 2.3 Under the NIRS 2 contract, Accenture did not receive payment until the system was operational. Payment isthrough an operating charge which varies up to a fixedceiling according to the number of specifiedtransactions processed by the system. The contract alsoprovided for certain enhancements to the system to beincluded in the basic operating charge, including thosearising from routine amendments to social security orpensions legislation, such as annual changes tocontribution rates. 2.4 Other changes were to be priced using function points. The shortlisted bidders included a price per function pointfor enhancements in their tenders. The contract, whenawarded specified a range of prices for enhancementsdepending on the size of the system in function points. Theappropriate price was to be determined at a later date,once the size of the system had been agreed between theContributions Agency and Accenture. 2.5 In May 1997, the Contributions Agency and Accenture agreed a price for system enhancements based onfunction points, reflecting the point on Accenture's pricerange bid appropriate to the agreed assessment of thesize of the system. The payment for enhancementsimplemented in a financial year would be evenly spreadover the next five years. The price applied up to a limitof 2,000 function points a year. This represented thescale of enhancements expected of NIRS 2 based onexperience gained on enhancements to the originalNIRS 1 system. 2.6 The Contributions Agency recognised that the scale of enhancements might exceptionally exceed the agreedlevel. Under these circumstances they would need toreach agreement with Accenture on the cost and timingof such additional work. Additional work could havebeen purchased at framework rates already in placebetween the Department of Social Security andAccenture. These rates were considerably higher thanthe rates agreed for the 2,000 function points. 2.7 The original enhancement rate per function point proposed by Accenture were considerably higher thanother bidders because of the different structure of theiroffer. However, the Contributions Agency calculatedthat, as Accenture had offered a much lower price forthe basic operating charge, 9the cost of enhancements would not affect the evaluation of the bids unlessenhancements exceeded 4,000 function points a year.The Agency had considered this to be most unlikely. Significant legislative changes were announced after the original contract wassigned 2.8 Between May 1997, when the Contributions Agency and Accenture agreed the arrangements for pricingsystem enhancements, and April 1999, when theContributions Agency was transferred from theDepartment of Social Security to the Inland Revenue,the Government announced a number of significantlegislative changes which affected the areas of national 8 Function points are a recognised industry standard used to measure the size of a software development. They are derived from th e number of transactions in a system, for example, the number of inputs and outputs and cross-references within the computer program. 9 Between \u00a332 million and \u00a350 million compared with the next lowest offer of between \u00a382 million and \u00a3146 million12part twoNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION insurance and pensions dealt with by NIRS 2 (Figure 4). The Department of Social Security provided advice toMinisters on the technical feasibility and costs of each ofthese policy changes. The implications of each policywere assessed separately, but the Department's ability toassess the overall capacity for NIRS 2 to accommodatethe package of changes within the proposed legislativetimetable was limited by uncertainties about the initialstabilisation of the system. This meant that they were notin a position to establish fully the aggregate effect of thechanges on NIRS 2. 2.9 Furthermore, as the original system had not yet been fully delivered, it made it more difficult to assess theextent to which it would need to be modified. So it wasnot apparent to the Department of Social Security thatthe required developments might, in aggregate, exceedthe annual enhancement limit included in the NIRS 2contract. At the time of the transfer it was not clear towhat extent, if at all, the legislative changes proposed,together with their respective implementation dates,would result in the annual 2,000 function point limitbeing exceeded, or more fundamentally, whether thesystem had the technical capacity to absorb the level ofchange required. The additional work exceeded the limit in the original NIRS 2 contract 2.10 When the Inland Revenue took over responsibility for NIRS 2 in April 1999, they commissioned a review ofthe system from PA Consulting. The aim was to establishwhether it would be technically feasible to implementthese major developments, in view of the system'sprevious record. The report, issued in July 1999,concluded that NIRS 2 was a robust and reliableplatform, but that it was not yet sufficiently stable to absorb major change. It recommended that the InlandRevenue should carry out a detailed technicalassessment of the options for delivering their futurebusiness requirements and that further changes to NIRS2 should not be initiated until 2000, when stabilisationwas expected to have been achieved. 2.11 The Inland Revenue formed a joint design team to assess the options with staff from the Department of SocialSecurity and with technical support from ElectronicData Systems (EDS), their strategic informationtechnology partners, and Accenture. Whilst this workwas going on, informal discussions were held withAccenture to consider the possible options availableshould the results conclude that the changes required ofNIRS 2 exceeded the annual maximum level contracted.The team considered the scope of the legislativecommitments, the feasibility of delivering thecommitments through NIRS 2 or through alternativemeans, and the risks and dependencies involved, inorder to derive an estimate of the scale and optimumtiming of future developments. Accenture and EDSsupplied estimates of the staff days and function pointsrequired for development, including estimates ofproductivity. The Inland Revenue's operational researchstaff validated these estimates. 2.12 In October 1999, the joint design team concluded that new development work would require between 5,860and 7,240 function points to be delivered betweenOctober 2000 and April 2002. As this exceeded the limitin the original contract of 2,000 function points a year,the Inland Revenue decided to examine ways of meetingthe commitments arising from the legislative changes.

The Inland Revenue considered a number of options for supporting the legislative changes 3.2 As part of the process of examining how best to support the legislative changes, the Inland Revenue consideredoptions which would not involve using the NIRS 2system, including clerical solutions, using otherinformation technology systems, and deferring the work.Although there was scope to use other systems, theyconcluded that, in most cases, the alternative optionswould have required modifications to NIRS 2 anyway,and would have led to duplication of effort. Most of thesealternatives were discarded, as were deferral and clericalsolutions, which would have incurred significant costs ordelays (Figure 5) . Based on function point estimates at the time, this left NIRS 2 as the most practicable optionfor some 80 per cent of the work requirement. The Inland Revenue identified three contractual options for procuring theadditional development work 3.3 Having established that there were no realistic alternatives to enhancing NIRS 2 for the majority ofrequirements, the Inland Revenue explored thecontractual options for procuring the additional NIRS 2development work. Three options were available: Qnegotiating a contract extension with Accenture; Qasking Accenture to provide additional resources tomeet the Inland Revenue's increased developmentrequirement, above the contracted level, by means ofthe Department of Social Security frameworkagreement; Qexercising the break clause in the original contractand holding a new competition for the continuingoperation and development of the system. 3.4 The Inland Revenue opened discussions with Accenture about purchasing the additional work. In response,Accenture developed proposals for a dedicated facility tomanage software development work, termed the DesignBuild and Run facility, which would help provide aconsistent and reliable service for the delivery ofenhancements. In return for the Inland Revenue providingadvance notice of their resource requirements, Accenturefelt able to offer the Department lower rates per staff daythan the Department of Social Security framework rates,which were the alternative charging mechanism for workin excess of 2,000 function points per annum. The Inland Revenue assessed the value for money of a contract extension withAccenture against industry comparators 3.5 The Inland Revenue commissioned PA Consulting to develop a financial evaluation model which they usedto compare Accenture's proposals with the estimated\u00a344 million cost of breaking the NIRS 2 contract andusing alternative suppliers. The model comparedAccenture's unit costs with: (i) average costs in theindustry; (ii) the costs charged by EDS, the InlandRevenue's strategic supplier on other work, representingthe typical charge from an outsourcing company; and(iii) Accenture framework rates. The estimates foralternative suppliers included an element reflecting thedifferential cost for a new supplier to operate theexisting system including previous enhancements. TheInland Revenue estimated this at \u00a331 million. 14part threeNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION 3.6 The cost comparisons (Figure 7) showed that Accenture's unit costs compared closely with alternativesuppliers, but breaking the contract would haveincurred substantial additional costs. The closestcomparison was with EDS rates because their long-termcontract with the Inland Revenue includes staff chargesbelow the industry average - although it must berecognised that the EDS rate resulted from anoutsourcing type contract which is very different fromthe PFI contract for NIRS 2. The model costedAccenture's proposals at \u00a3100 million for a contractvolume of 8,000 function points. Using EDS rates, thecost would have been \u00a3105 million, but when the\u00a344 million cost of breaking the contract was taken intoaccount the total outlay would have been \u00a3149 million.Figure 6 shows the break costs, which were validated by PA Consulting.Alternative options considered for delivering key legislative changes5 The joint design team considered other developments, which mainly inv olved changes to the processing of annual returns from employers, and determined that they could be implemented without amending NIRS. RationaleAffects core NIRS functions. Clerical option not viable as 48 million recordsaffected. Deferral difficult as employershad started amending rates andthresholds on payroll systems. Could be implemented using Pension Valuation on Divorce System at similarcost. Change manageable on NIRS. Alternative IT system likely to be more expensive.Clerical option available as fall-back.Deferral would jeopardise \u00a325 million ofsavings. No alternative to NIRS which delivered predecessor benefit. Deferral would risklegal claims from bereaved claimantsunder Human Rights Act. Registration of schemes and scheme members could be delivered by EDS onseparate system at similar cost, reducingrisk to NIRS.

The Inland Revenue considered,however, that, if they used an alternative supplier, theywould have to accept rates above the industry averagebecause another supplier would be likely to require apremium to take over the system, given its record. 3.8 Although Accenture's staff charges were higher, the model assumed that the firm would be able achievehigher productivity than the comparators. Accentureagreed to accept a productivity target of 7.5 staff days afunction point for NIRS 2 development work under thecontract extension compared with a rate of 8 to 10 staffdays achieved on the base system. The Inland Revenue'soperational researchers estimated that a new supplier,lacking knowledge of the system, would achieve a rateof 11.5 staff days a function point. The model used thisrate to estimate the costs of using an outsourcingcontract or another industry comparator. 3.9 We noted that the target productivity rates on new work carried out under the Inland Revenue's outsourcingcontract, which reflect six years of experience with therelevant systems, would produce much lower unit coststhan those used in the model. But even using this moreoptimistic assumption, the model showed that theoutsourcing costs would have been higher than theAccenture proposal, although their lower unit costswould come close to outweighing the costs of breakingthe contract at very high volumes of work (Figure 8). The Inland Revenue concluded that a contract extension provided the best optionfor delivering the additional requirements inthe timescale required 3.10 The Inland Revenue carried out an evaluation of whether the Accenture proposal offered value formoney. In addition to the financial evaluation, theyassessed Accenture's ability to deliver software of therequired quality, their commercial stability, securityissues, legal and commercial issues, the legislativetimetable, and the scope to improve their managementof development work. 3.11 The Inland Revenue concluded that the technical review by PA Consulting (paragraph 2.10) and the progressmade in stabilising NIRS 2 gave assurance on thequality of NIRS 2 software. They also examinedAccenture's performance in delivering a system toanother customer using the Design Build and Runapproach to software development and obtainedexternal advice which gave assurance on Accenture'scommercial stability. They had some concerns - whichhave since been resolved - about Accenture's disaster recovery arrangements but did not consider that therewere other security issues. 3.12 In addition, the Inland Revenue considered the feasibility of making changes to the arrangements forcommissioning enhancements. The first major softwarerelease after the acceptance of the system was inApril 1999 and improvements to procedures forenhancements were in the process of being developedwith Accenture. But at that point they had given rise tooperating difficulties because the original contract,drawn up within the PFI framework then in operation: Qincluded procedures for proposing, evaluating andapproving development work, but did not clearlydefine how enhancements were to be accepted ortested; Qdid not define clearly which types of smaller andregular enhancements were included in the basiccontract price, which led to contractual disputes; and Qdid not provide a mechanism to distinguish changesrequired to meet legislative requirements fromroutine change requests.Using different productivity assumptions, one comparator would have been almost as competitiveas Accenture8 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 4560 8000 12300 Volume of work in function points Source: National Audit Office recalculation of financial evaluation modelAccenture proposal Out sourcing deal - partnership terms\u00a3 million17 part threeNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION When the Department of Social Security sought compensation for the delayed implementation of thesystem, there were also disagreements between theContributions Agency and Accenture over the contractualrequirements relating to system developments. 3.13 Since the original contract was signed, the Government have produced substantial additional guidance, in thelight of experience with this and other contracts. 10In particular, the McCartney report emphasised modularand incremental development of projects, mechanismsto ensure open communication between client andsupplier, and jointly agreed and documented changecontrol processes. The Inland Revenue concluded thatthe proposed extension to the contract could bedesigned to reflect current guidance to achieveimproved working methods and reduce risk. Theyobtained legal advice to confirm that these newrequirements could be reflected in the contract. 3.14 In carrying out their evaluation, the Inland Revenue also took into account the need to deliver changes arisingout of the legislative timetable. Using a supplier otherthan Accenture would have delayed implementation ofthe changes because of the time it would have taken forthem to mobilise and become familiar with the system.It would also have required the Inland Revenue to breakthe existing contract, resulting in delay while they helda new competition. This could have led to additionalcosts for the government - for example, claims forcompensation from pensions providers if systems werenot implemented, or the costs of providing alternativeclerical solutions. The Inland Revenue did not quantifythese costs, but they would have made alternatives moreexpensive and risky. 3.15 The Inland Revenue needed to be in a position to place orders for development work in 2000-01. They alsowished to manage development work in a way thatwould overcome the operating difficulties discussed inparagraphs 3.12 above. They considered that the DesignBuild & Run option proposed by Accenture offered: Qa suitable structure to resolve issues with NIRS 2 andto take developments forward; Qa vehicle for improving working methods on thecontract; and Qreduced risk compared with the previousarrangements. 3.16 In the light of all these factors, the Inland Revenue concluded that a contract extension provided the bestoption for meeting the legislative requirements in thetimescale set and reached agreement with Accenture onthese terms. The contract extension risked being open to legal challenge 3.17 The proposed method of payment to Accenture under the contract extension differed from that advertised in theOfficial Journal of the European Communities for theoriginal procurement. At that time, suppliers were invitedto tender on the basis that they would be \"paid, after thesystem goes live, by means of a transaction-based orsimilar charging method\". The contract extensionreplaced this with stage payments for development work.The changes do, however, correspond closely to morerecent Treasury advice on the principles to adopt in PFIcontracts for information technology. 11 3.18 The Inland Revenue sought legal advice on the implications of this discrepancy. The advice theyobtained was that whereas all other aspects of thecontract extension complied with the advertisement, thepayment arrangements might not. Under Europeanprocurement rules this could make them vulnerable toclaims for damages from any suppliers who could provethat they had suffered loss of profit as a consequence.Taking account of the substantial financial differentialbetween the shortlisted bidders in the original NIRS 2competition and the history of industry practice, legaladvisers judged the likelihood of such a challenge beingmade or being successful to be extremely low. Theydecided that the costs of delaying the work programmeand the advantages of the revised arrangementsoutweighed the risks associated with failing to complywith the procurement rules. Certain risks previously borne by each party are shared under the contract extension 3.19 The original contract aimed to transfer risks to the contractor. For example, the risk of development costoverruns was borne by Accenture because paymentswere for operational performance and did not take intoaccount input costs. Delivery risk was considered to betransferred because the contractor was not paid untilthey had delivered an acceptable system. 10 The standardisation of PFI contracts, Treasury Private Finance Taskforce 1999 Successful IT: Modernising Government in Action, Cabinet Office Central IT Unit 2000. 11 The standardisation of PFI contracts, Treasury Private Finance Taskforce 199918part threeNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION 3.20 However, when difficulties emerged with the delivery of the new system the Contributions Agency still had tomeet its statutory responsibilities. Although thecontractor was not paid for the functionality they did notdeliver, and thus bore financial risk, the business risk ofnon-delivery remained with the Contributions Agency. 3.21 The original contract was designed to share the risk arising from demand for changes to the system - thecontractor accepted risk in relation to legislativechanges already agreed and documented in thecontract, and regular enhancements, which were to bedelivered within the contract price. There was nodefined mechanism for purchasing furtherenhancements should the scale of change exceed thecontractual maximum, which meant that theContributions Agency bore the full risk of additionalenhancements being required. This risk materialisedwhen the further legislative changes were announced in1998, which had to be delivered to tight timescales(paragraph 2.8). 3.22 The contract extension alters the way in which development work is managed and paid for in a numberof ways: QPreviously, development charges were rolled intothe operational charges for the system as a whole.Under the contract extension the Inland Revenuemake stage payments covering the contractor'sdevelopment costs and a share of an agreed targetprofit margin. QMechanisms are introduced to encourage timelydelivery.QPost go-live support is provided for an agreed periodof time after each release at a price based on thenumber of function points delivered, as a means ofincentivising the delivery of good quality, fault freeproducts. QProductivity targets are agreed for each projectunder the extension, and the cost of variationsshared between the parties. QIf overall profits are higher than a target margin, thedifference is shared between Accenture and theInland Revenue. There is an open book accountingarrangement, which allows the Department'sinternal audit to check costs. QThere are improved processes for resolving problemsand dealing with difficult issues. QThe extension has also introduced the concept ofqualifying events. These are events which have sucha material impact on the relationship that urgentdiscussion to identify options for resolution are held.The intention of this clause is to introduce greaterflexibility to the arrangements, and to reduce the riskof litigation. The combined effect of these new provisions is that the risks of new development work not being delivered tocost and time are shared between the Inland Revenueand Accenture (Figure 9) , which recognises the Department's view that they have an essential role toplay in effective software development. The provisionscorrespond closely to the Treasury Taskforce principlesof PFI IT contract risk management and therecommendations of the McCartney report, which wereissued after the conclusion of the extension agreement. Most development risks are shared9 Risk Ownership Comment Delayed delivery Shared Inland Revenue bear business risk. Stage payment regime rewards delivery. Financial penalties are imposed for non-delivery. Productivity deviates from target Shared Enhancements priced using agreed productivity target.

Joint testing.19 part threeNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION 3.23 The Inland Revenue continue to bear the business risk of non-delivery of NIRS 2 functionality. As the risk of non-delivery increases with the volume of change to asystem, the Inland Revenue have taken steps to managethe risk actively by: Qintroducing and applying their standard projectmanagement methodology to system changes underthe contract; Qmanaging new software developments as a series ofindividual, separately controlled projects which areoverseen centrally and allocated a specific releasedate linked to the legislative timetable; Qestablishing joint management and developmentboards joint testing arrangements; and by Qfurther developing a risk and issues register whichallocates risks to individuals, and includes actionplans and status monitoring. 3.24 Accenture continue to own and run the NIRS 2 system. They therefore still bear risks relating to the operationand availability of the system, the technology deployed,obsolescence and residual value. The Inland Revenue have taken steps to ensure that issues which arose on theoriginal contract do not recur 3.25 The NIRS 2 system has been the subject of three reports by the Public Accounts Committee.12Their first report focused on the original procurement. In 1998-99 theCommittee focused on the delays to the system and in1999-00 they took evidence on the progress made inrecovering the position. 3.26 As regards the development and delivery of NIRS 2, the Committee concluded that: Qin view of the risks of attempting to deliver thesystem to a tight timetable, there was a need for afall-back position, and the Contributions Agencyshould have taken a hard look at alternatives (46thReport of 1997-98, conclusion (xi)); Qwhere risks are transferred it is necessary to defineresponsibilities clearly (22nd Report of 1998-99(paragraph 8)); Qpost-acceptance difficulties cast doubt on the quality and rigour of the Contributions Agency'sacceptance testing; sufficient time needed to be builtinto the implementation plan to conduct rigoroustesting (22nd Report of 1998-99 conclusions (viii)and (ix)); Qthe Contributions Agency and the contractor had notdeveloped a shared understanding of what wasmeant by delivery of the system (22nd Report of1998-99 conclusion (xi)); and Qthe Inland Revenue should look again at the balanceof benefits and risks underpinning decisions onownership of intellectual property rights in majorgovernment systems (31st Report of 1999-2000,conclusion (iii)). 3.27 Under the contract extension the Inland Revenue have introduced changes to the contractual relationship inorder to overcome the difficulties encountered on theoriginal contract, reduce risk and improve workingrelationships. They developed and agreed withAccenture a set of business principles which have beenincluded in the contract. These change the way in whichrequirements are agreed, work is planned, projects aredefined, accepted and tested and problems areidentified and resolved. Figure 10 shows how the action taken has addressed the issues identified above. 12 The contract to develop and update the replacement national insurance recording system (46th Report, Session 1997-98 (HC 472)) Delays to the new national insurance recording system (22nd Report, Session 1998-99 (HC 182))National Insurance Fund 1998-99( 31st Report, Session 1999-00 (HC 350))Action taken to deal with difficulties which arose on the original contract10 Timetable for delivery Mechanisms have been introduced to manage the risks of delays in delivering software developments. Development work is managed as a series of projects leading to a single 6-monthly release. If the Inland Revenue order work to a timetable not accepted by thecontractor, a grace period can be negotiated which can protect the contractor from unfairpenalties. Definition of responsibilities The contract addendum sets out each party's objectives and responsibilities. The business structure for managing the development work was endorsed by an independent adviser. Acceptance testing The contract addendum sets out a clear framework for acceptance testing. Joint testing arrangements require the parties to agree definitions of acceptance as well as avoidingduplication of work. Shared understanding of delivery As noted above, there is now agreement on what constitutes acceptance, and there are also joint project management arrangements.20part threeNIRS 2: CONTRACT EXTENSION 3.28 As regards intellectual property rights, the same contract terms applied to developments under the contractextension as were applied to intellectual property rightsunder the original agreement. Also, there was no changein the value of the transfer payment to Accenture(\u00a314 million) for the rights to use the NIRS 2 system forits existing purpose after the contract expires in 2004. Sothe development work under the contract extension isunlikely to increase the value of the system as a wholeto Accenture. The Inland Revenue did not seek to obtainexplicit intellectual property rights to the softwaredeveloped under the extension, but as the developmentsare inextricably linked to the main system softwarethese rights would have had no separate value. Byfocusing on securing appropriate licence rights in linewith the original development, the Inland Revenueobtained all the rights it needed at no incremental cost.Accenture offered the Inland Revenue the option ofacquiring the right to use NIRS 2 for purposes other thannational insurance business for a further payment of\u00a336 million, but the Department decided not to includethis option in the contract. The new arrangements are achieving results 3.29 We interviewed the contract managers at the Inland Revenue and Accenture. Both told us that theyconsidered the relationship between the parties hadimproved since the introduction and operation of thenew arrangements. Accenture told us that, whereas therelationship had previously been confrontational, it wasnow very positive. The Inland Revenue's contractmanagement team understood their objectives, listenedto their views, and resolved issues without the need toresort to formal contract escalation procedures. TheInland Revenue rated their relationship with Accentureas very good following the introduction of newincentives and joint working, and user satisfaction withthe system had improved substantially.3.30 At the time of our examination there had been two software releases under the contract extension. Theprojects covered by these releases, which includedchanges required for pensions sharing on divorce,bereavement, incapacity and the restructuring ofnational insurance contributions, were completed onschedule. Development required to support theintroduction of stakeholder pensions was scheduled forimplementation in two stages in October 2001 andApril 2002. The Inland Revenue reported that the qualityof software had improved significantly, compared withthe earliest releases and that they had also benefitedfrom cost and productivity improvements under the newprofit and productivity sharing arrangements.
