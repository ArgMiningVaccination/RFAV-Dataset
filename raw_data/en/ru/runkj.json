When a tendon becomes inflamed, as a result of overuse, it's known as tendonitis. The [most common](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/arthritis-tendinitis#1) areas where you can get this can be found in your elbow, shoulder, hip, knee, Achilles tendon and at the base of your thumb. If you have been experiencing this pain, due to a sports injury, while performing daily tasks, here are five home remedies to help reduce tendonitis. Icing & Heating Taking ibuprofen to relieve inflammation helps, but another non-pill related form is icing. To help reduce swelling, apply an ice pack, or [frozen bag of vegetables](https://simplyhealth.io/10-natural-ways-to-treat-tendonitis/2/), wrapped in a towel, for at least half an hour, 3 to 4 times a day. Never place an ice pack or bag directly on the skin as this can cause damage, or in severe cases frostbite, to skin tissue, and if left on your skin too long can stop blood flow. Inflammation is the body's natural way of healing itself. Once an injury occurs, your body increases blood flow and within this flow are organic nutrients such as, [amino acids and antibodies](https://simplyhealth.io/10-natural-ways-to-treat-tendonitis/2/), which protect and heal the inflamed area. Applying a warm compress, like a heating pad or heating pods, helps to increase the blood flow and speed up the healing process. This not only feels good on the injury, but it helps relax [tight muscles](https://www.healthline.com/health/chronic-pain/treating-pain-with-heat-and-cold) and relieves pain. Compression As mentioned in the above, a warm compress helps to increase blood flow. Compression alone helps to prevent buildup of other fluids in your body and [limits swelling](https://simplyhealth.io/10-natural-ways-to-treat-tendonitis/9/) getting rid of what is already surrounding the pain. It can give the affected area more support while continuing to exercise safely. Look for compression aids such as, socks, elbow to ankle braces, supports and straps. Herbs When dealing with tendonitis, you don't usually think to turn to herbs. One such herb that helps [reduce inflammation](https://simplyhealth.io/10-natural-ways-to-treat-tendonitis/5/) comes from turmeric called curcumin. Other herbs to help ease the pain of tendonitis would be white willow, ginger, devil's claw and bromelain. Remember when taking herbs to treat them like any medication and only take the recommended dosage. Food Eating the right foods such as, adding more brightly, [colored vegetables](https://simplyhealth.io/10-natural-ways-to-treat-tendonitis/6/) to your diet, provide your body with vitamins and minerals to also help reduce tendonitis. Salmon, flaxseeds and certain kinds of nuts have Omega-3 fatty acids, which carry strong anti-inflammatory ingredients. When you balance your eating habits with plenty of protein and iron-enriched foods this will strengthen your body and lessen the risk of injuries that could lead to tendonitis. Rest Lastly, but certainly not the least important, is to make sure you give yourself ample amounts of rest so as to not further the pain of tendonitis. Take a few days off from your regular exercising or lower the intensity level to allow the tendonitis to subside. Be sure to get the recommended amount of sleep, 7-8 hours, as this is the best time when your body is [rebuilding and repairing](https://simplyhealth.io/10-natural-ways-to-treat-tendonitis/14/) your muscles and tissues. It also allows pressure to be released from your tendonitis pain.
