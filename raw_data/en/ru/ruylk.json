A large national, multiracial\u2014multiethnic data source permitsa more comprehensive investigation than was possible in previous studies. It also enables acloser focus on socioeconomic disadvantage and health need as determinants of utilization.Design and setting: Respondents are from the National Survey of American Life: Coping with Stress in the 21st Century (NSAL), a nationally representative multi-stage area-probability sur-vey of U.S. adult African Americans, Caribbean Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites conducted from2001 to 2003. The sample contains 6082 adults aged 18 and over .Main outcome measures: NSAL respondents were surveyed about lifetime use of alternative providers for medical care or advice. Response categories included two types of spiritual heal-ers: faith healers and psychics. These outcomes were logistically regressed, separately , onto10 sociodemographic marital status,education, household income, region, medical care use, insurance coverage, and self-ratedhealth.Results: Lifetime utilization of a faith healer is more prevalent among respondents in good health and less prevalent among Caribbean Blacks and never married persons. Users of a psychichealer are more likely to be educated, residents of the Northeast or West, and previouslymarried, and less likely to report excellent health.Conclusions: Use a spiritual healer is not due, on average, to poor education, marginal racial/ethnic or socioeconomic status, dire health straits, or lack of other healthcare options.T o some extent, the opposite appears to be true. Use of a spiritual healer is not associated withfewer social and personal resources or limitations in health or healthcare.\u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction In utilization studies of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), lifetime or past-year rates of use are typi-cally reported for a list of treatment modalities. One class ofmodalities above all tends either to be excluded altogetheror , if reported, not followed up in depth. Use of spiritualhealing, of various types, has been relegated to the marginsof health services research on CAM since the earliest daysof the eld, perhaps because of an understandable desireto dissociate from nonmedical therapies, nonprofessionalproviders, and treatments without scientically validatedmechanisms of action. Existing data, however , sparse as theyare, reveal that the frequency of use of a spiritual healeror reliance on the prayers of others may exceed almostevery other CAM therapy . 1This nding has been validated across racial and ethnic groups in the U.S.2\u20145Further , as with CAM generally the distribution and correlates of this nding''among racial/ethnic groups is complex and nuanced'' 3(p. 1236). The earliest example of note is work by Eisenberg and associates investigating past-year utilization of a list ofcomplementary medical therapies including spiritual healingand prayer . 6While 4% of the U.S. population used spiri- tual healing, 9% reported a visit to a spiritual healer , andusers averaged 14 sessions. Further , 25% of populationreported using healing prayer . A followup study 7found that spiritual healing by others was now reported by 7.0% ofthe population and self-prayer for healing by 35.1%, morethan twice the rate of any other therapy . Neither modal-ity was subjected to additional analysis. A subsequent studyfocused on mood disorders, nding that 9.9% of respondentswith anxiety attacks and 10.5% of those reporting severedepression utilized spiritual healing by others in the pastyear; reported rates for energy healing for these condi-tions were 2.8% and 5.4%, respectively . 8Other research has placed the national prevalence of past-year use of ''spiritualhealing or prayer'' at 13.7% and of energy healing at1.1%. 9 Research on spiritual factors in personal and population health has become more widely accepted in other medi-cal and sociomedical elds, such gerontology and geriatrics. 10In addition, there is a rapidly expanding literature on ethnographic,sociological, clinical, and experimental studies of healers. 11 Although not widely publicized, studies of religious cor-relates of healthcare utilization and inclusion of spiritualvariables within health services research studies actually goback several decades. 12For spiritual healing, however , we are still lacking very fundamental information as to patternsof use. Research by anthropologists, sociologists, religious schol- ars, and others has provided both descriptive andinterpretive information, case histories, and results ofsmall-scale surveys focused on spiritual healing. Mostnotable have been a few ethnographic or observationalstudies conducted decades ago 13\u201417that provide interesting social\u2014historical analysis, as well as a spate of more recentexperimental studies summarized by Benor . 18But beyond these good descriptions of these phenomena, there is a lackof systematic empirical investigation.Other CAM modalities (e.g., massage therapy , relaxation techniques, meditation) have gained acceptance withinmedical and health services research. This is largely becausethey have provided naturalistic models of explanationfor efcacy that are congruent with the physiological,psychophysiological, and pathophysiological theories ofmainstream medical discourse. 19,20The same is true for spiritual or religious therapies such as religious support, pas-toral care, chaplaincy visits, and even personal prayer , forwhich efcacy can be understood in terms of associated psy-chosocial pathways, mechanisms, and outcomes (e.g., socialsupport, self-esteem, locus of control). 21 Spiritual healers, in contrast, operate according to explanatory models that are outside the mainstream ofnaturalistic theories of healing. Whether self-described asfaith healers or psychic healers, this class of modalitiesposits mechanisms that involve superempirical or ostensibly''supernatural'' forces (e.g., Holy Spirit, paranormal forcesor energies) that are beyond the scope of observational orexperimental science. Whether such explanatory models areindeed ''real'' is a question outside of the present authors'purview and is not suitable subject matter for a medicaljournal. However , regardless of how unusual or controversialthe content of these modalities may appear to mainstreambiomedicine, the matter of their utilization is a topic thatmedicine can and should address. Simply put, clinicians andhealth services researchers would benet from identifyingwho utilizes spiritual healers and the circumstances of theiruse. Although there is rudimentary information on patterns of use for spiritual help-seeking, we still lack systematicinformation on correlates or predictors of use. People whomost utilize faith healers or psychics are thought to be, onaverage, poor , uneducated, Southerners, ethnic minorities,in desperate health straits, and lacking access to medi-cal care and other supportive resources (e.g., family). Thisis supported by results from a few small-scale, regionalstudies. 22\u201424However , larger-scale empirical investigations of sociodemographic or health-related correlates of the useof spiritual healers or healing have resulted in inconsis-tent ndings 8,25,26that appear to depend upon the time referent of the utilization question (e.g., lifetime preva-lence, past-year prevalence), the specic type of spiritualhealing assessed (e.g., use of a spiritual healer , an energyhealer , prayer), and study sample characteristics. Moreover ,analyses of spiritual healer use within particular sociodemo-graphic subgroups are sparse. 27\u201429 A different line of thinking suggests that help-seeking directed to faith healers or psychic healers is a part of alarger quest for spirituality and wholeness. Seen in this way ,spiritual and psychic healers are utilized out of faithfulnessto a particular worldview (e.g., religious) and/or in pursuitof growth and self-actualization, as much as for remissionof acute symptoms. For some people, use of healers maybe a marker of commitment to transcendental values andnot specically a response that is prompted by an acutehealth need or conditioned by sociodemographic status. Forsegments of the population, physical well-being and spiritu-ality are parts of an inseparable whole\u2014 -pursuit of one goeshand in hand with pursuit of the other . If so, then greateruse of spiritual healers may be more prevalent among theopposite sociodemographic categories: wealthier , more 65 cated, married, non-Southerners, non-minorities, in good health, with access to medical care. The present analysisseeks to address this question by focusing on sociodemo-graphic and health-related correlates of spiritual healer use. The National Survey of American Life: Coping with Stress in the 21st Century (NSAL) provides an ideal setting toexplore this issue. The NSAL contains a large nationallyrepresentative sample, is multiracial and multiethnic, andincludes variables assessing use of spiritual healers, aswell as items on health status, healthcare use, and someof the sociodemographic characteristics identied aboveas potential correlates of the use of spiritual healers. Aspecial advantage of using the NSAL to explore this sub-ject is that it builds on prior research using this samplewhich has documented mental healthcare utilization, 30CAM use,5and patterns and correlates of spirituality in this population.31The present investigation also builds on recent studies of racial and ethnic differences in spiritual help-seeking behavior 32,33and descriptions of the work of spiritual healers.34,35 Methods Sample The NSAL was collected by the Program for Research on BlackAmericans (PRBA) at the University of Michigan's Institutefor Social Research (ISR). 36The eld work for the study was completed by ISR's Survey Research Center , in cooperationwith PRBA. A total of 6082 face-to-face interviews wereconducted with persons aged 18 or older , including 3570U.S. African Americans, 891 non-Hispanic Whites, and 1621Blacks of Caribbean descent. The overall response rate of72.3% is excellent given that African Americans (especiallylower income African Americans) and Caribbean Blacks aremore likely to reside in major urban areas which are moredifcult and expensive with respect to survey eldwork anddata collection. Final response rates for the NSAL two-phasesample designs were computed using the American Asso-ciation of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) guidelines (forResponse Rate 3). 37 The African-American sample is the core sample of the NSAL and consists of 64 primary sampling units (PSUs). Fifty-six of these primary areas overlap substantially with existingSurvey Research Center National Sample primary areas. Theremaining eight primary areas were chosen from the Southin order for the sample to represent African Americans inthe proportion in which they are distributed nationally . TheAfrican-American sample is a nationally representative sam-ple of households located in the 48 coterminous states withat least one Black adult 18 years of age or over who did notidentify ancestral ties in the Caribbean. Both the African-American and non-Hispanic White samples were selectedexclusively from these targeted geographic segments in pro-portion to the African-American population. The sample design and analysis weights for this sam- ple were designed to be optimal for comparative analysesin which residential, environmental, and socioeconomiccharacteristics are controlled in the Black-White statis-tical contrasts. For all three racial/ethnic samples, theNSAL weights were designed to correct for disproportionatesampling and non-response, and to provide representation across various demographic characteristics in the 48 coter-minous states. The Black Caribbean sample was selected from two area- probability sampling frames: the core NSAL sample, and anarea-probability sample of housing units from geographicareas with a relatively high density of persons of Caribbeandescent (more than 10% of the population). Of the totalBlack Caribbean respondents ( N= 1621), 265 were selected from the households in the core sample, while 1356 wereselected from housing units from high-density Caribbeanareas (see Heeringa and associates 38for a more detailed description of the sample designs and sampling methodsused in the development of the NSAL). In both the African-American and Black Caribbean sam- ples, it was necessary for respondents to self-identify theirrace as Black. Those self-identifying as Black were includedin the Black Caribbean sample if (1) they answered afrma-tively when asked if they were of West Indian or Caribbeandescent, (2) they said they were from a country includedon a list of Caribbean area countries presented by theinterviewer , or (3) they indicated that their parents or grand-parents were born in a Caribbean area country (see Jacksonand associates 39for a more detailed discussion of the NSAL sample). The interviews were administered face-to-face andconducted within respondents' homes and respondents werecompensated for their time. Data collection was conductedfrom February , 2001, to June, 2003. Measures Dependent variablesRespondents were asked, ''Here is a list of people that onemight go to for medical help. Please indicate if you haveever gone to any of the following people'' (coded: yes vs.no). They were then presented with a list of alternativeproviders which included two variants of spiritual healer: (a)''a faith healer'' and (b) ''a person who practices astrology ,reads zodiac signs, or is a psychic'' (for simplicity , referredto from now on as a psychic or psychic healer). The questionon alternative providers was asked immediately followingan item assessing traditional medical care utilization (e.g.,doctor , clinic, health center). Independent variables Sociodemographic characteristics include race/ethnicity(African American, Caribbean Black, non-Hispanic White),age (in years), gender , marital status (currently married,cohabit, previously married, never married), and U.S. region(Northeast, North Central, South, West). Socioeconomic sta-tus is measured by education and household income. Missingdata for household income were imputed for 773 cases(12.7% of the NSAL sample). Missing data for educationwere for 74 were done usingan iterative multiple imputation approachincorporating information about age, sex, region, race,employment status, marital status, home ownership, andnativity of household residents. For the bivariate analysisonly , education was recoded into four categories (less thanhigh school degree, high school degree, some college, col-lege degree or higher) and income was recoded into tertiles.66 J. Levin et al. Use of traditional medical care was assessed by the ques- tion, ''Is there one place or person you usually go to whenyou are sick or need medical advice?'' Responses to thisquestion included: doctor , clinic, health center hospital,relative, other and none. Self-rated health was measuredby the question, ''How would you rate your overall physicalhealth at the present time? Would you say it is excellent,very good, good, fair or poor?'' There was also a dichoto-mous measure of whether or not the respondent has healthinsurance. Data analysis Both bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted.First, patterns of spiritual healer use were stratied by cat-egories of other study variables, separately for faith healersand psychics. Percentages represent weighted proportionsbased on the distribution of the population. The Rao-Scott/US 2represents a complex design-corrected measure of asso- ciation. Second, multivariable logistic regression was used,regressing use of both types of spiritual healer separatelyonto all of the independent variables. This enables iden-tication of net effects of respective correlates, adjustingfor effects of all other variables in the model. For each ofthe two logistic regression models (faith healer and psychichealer), we report logistic coefcients ( 's), standard errors (se's), and the design-corrected Fstatistic, as well as odds ratio estimates (OR's) and 95% condence intervals (CI's).Logistic coefcients and standard errors take into accountthe complex multistage clustered design of the NSAL sample,unequal probabilities of selection, nonresponse, and post-stratication. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.13,which uses the T aylor expansion approximation techniquefor calculating the complex design-based estimates of vari-ance. Results Among respondents, lifetime prevalence of faith healer useis 3.7%, and 6.1% of respondents reported ever using a psy-chic for purposes of healing. According to T able 1 , gender and self-rated health were signicantly associated with theuse of a faith healer . Women were more likely than men touse a faith healer for medical care, as were respondents whorated their health as good. T able 1 also presents the bivari- ate analysis of using a psychic for medical care. CaribbeanBlacks and non-Hispanic whites were more likely to use apsychic healer than African Americans. Women were morelikely than men and respondents with more years of edu-cation were more likely than their counterparts to use apsychic healer . Among the marital status groups, marriedswere the least likely , whereas previously marrieds were themost likely to use a psychic healer , as were respondents whoresided in the Northeast and West. Lastly , respondents whousually received their medical care in a hospital were theleast likely to use a psychic healer . Additional analyses (not reported in T able 1 ) replicated the above breakouts, this time comparing respondents whoused a faith healer only , a psychic only , both, and neither . Asonly a bit more than 1% of the total sample available (71 outof 5895 respondents) reported ever having used both typesof spiritual healers, there were not any substantive differ- ences between the results presented in T able 1 for use of each of these modalities and use ''only'' of either of thesemodalities. The ''both'' group, moreover , was too small toproduce stable estimates for this tiny portion of the sam-ple. These additional analyses did validate one substantivelyinteresting observation: that so few respondents reportedusing both faith healers and psychics provides some evidenceagainst the stereotype that people who seek alternative careare indiscriminate in their use of anything and everything.These two modalities are utilized by largely different peopleand have somewhat distinct patterns of use. Results for the weighted multivariable logistic regression analysis are presented in T able 2 . Race/ethnicity , marital status, and self-rated health were signicantly associatedwith use of a faith healer . Caribbean Blacks were less likelyto use a faith healer than African Americans ( =0.64, p= .003; OR = 0.52), and never marrieds were less likely to use a faith healer than currently marrieds ( =0.73, p= .023; OR = 0.47). Respondents who indicated that their health was good were more likely than those with poorhealth to use a faith healer ( = 0.95, p= .02; OR = 2.61). Marital status, education, region, and self-rated health were signicantly associated with seeking assistance froma psychic for medical care. Previously married respon-dents were more likely to use a psychic healer ( = 0.73, p= .019; OR = 2.09) than married respondents. Education was positively associated with psychic healer use ( = 0.12, p= .017; OR = 1.13). Respondents who resided in the North- east ( = 0.88, p= .017; OR = 1.046, p= .02; OR = 2.84) were more likely to use a psychic healer than Southerners. Lastly , respondents who rated their healthas excellent ( =1.02, p= .04; OR = 0.35) were less likely to seek medical care from a psychic than those with poor self-rated health. There was also a statistically signicant ndingindicating greater use of a psychic healer among peopleusually receiving medical care from some ''other'' sourceof care ( = 1.85, p= .005; OR = 6.39), but the absolute fre- quency was so small (only 5 respondents), and the respectiveodds ratio's condence interval so wide (1.73\u201423.58), thatthis result may be spurious. Discussion Overall, a relatively small proportion of people in this sam-ple has ever sought medical care from a spiritual healer .Contrary to common assumptions, use of such healers is notprimarily conditioned by sociodemographic disadvantage,serious health need, or lack of access to mainstream medi-cal care or insurance coverage. These ndings indicate thatuse of a spiritual healer , whether a faith healer or a psy-chic, is supplementary to traditional care-seeking behavior .Spiritual healing, whatever its merits or faults, is thus anexample of care that is both alternative and complementary . These ndings indicate that people who have utilized a spiritual healer are not characterized by lower education,marginal racial/ethnic or socioeconomic status, poor health,or lack of other care options. Efforts to understand this classof healthcare behavior based solely on these sorts of factorsare inadequate and do not explain why people utilize suchcare.

Useof a faith healer was associated with reporting good health;and never married persons and Caribbean Blacks were lesslikely to use a faith healer . Use of a psychic healer was asso-ciated with higher education, being previously married, andresidence in the Northeast or West. While persons in excel-lent health were less likely to use a psychic healer , at thenet level, there were no signicant differences in use acrossthe other response categories for health status. A few limitations should be noted. First, it would have been helpful to examine whether respondents report self-prayer for healing and if this practice is distinct from use of a spiritual healer . Second, item wording in the NSAL com-bines use of a psychic for healing with use of an astrologer .Third, the data do not specify why respondents utilized aspiritual healer or when in the process of care-seeking thisoccurred. Finally , the focus of these particular analyses wassolely on sociodemographic and health-related correlates;questions regarding psychosocial T , healer use unaddressed. These limitations, however , arebalanced by the opportunity to begin exploring this topic inPrevalence/correlates of spiritual healer use 69 a racial/ethnic-comparative context in national probability data with substantial representation of typically undersur-veyed respondent populations. An obvious next step for this subject would be to iden- tify other correlates and predictors of spiritual healeruse. Prior research on CAM has identied psychologicalcharacteristics including personality traits, primary and sec-ondary control strategies, and perceived social supportand strain 40as potential determinants of use. Further , religious/spiritual preferences and ideations including par-ticular values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations suchas a holistic orientation and personal belief in the power ofreligion 41and in ''a natural approach to treatment'' and the efcacy of ''spirituality , religion, or prayer for health rea-sons'' 42(pp. 192\u2014193) are potential correlates of spiritual healer use. Finally , one of the most important issues to address in this literature is conceptual and involves the confoundingof the various constructs (e.g., prayer , healing, spiritual-ity , faith healing) that are used in research studies. 43While these are all valid topics for investigation, we should becareful that when we speak of the use of a faith healer ,for example, we mean a faith healer and not a bioen-ergy practitioner , a qi gong master , or private prayer . An insightful discussion of this issue made the important pointthat ''use of the broad term 'prayer' in attempts to mea-sure CAM use fails to distinguish between the diverse formsof spiritual healing utilized by practitioners and the com-mon understanding of the word'' 44(p. 436). The present study did not reference prayer directly and we were ableto distinguish between faith healers and healers professingpsychic gifts (at least presumably , given the implicit limi-tations of the wording and binary response format of thesurvey items). But, still, this leaves a lot of diversity inextant practice traditions and disciplines (e.g., East Asian,Western professional, bioenergy , contemporary metaphysi-cal healing traditions) unexplored. 35For intentional healing, more generally , there is a tremendous diversity of lay , folk,and professional approaches, each presenting unique andsophisticated methodological challenges for researchers. 45 While health services researchers do not directly involvethemselves in the kinds of theoretical issues that make thissuch a controversial area (e.g., purported mechanisms ofaction), nonetheless careful attention to conceptual distinc-tions among spiritual healing modalities is a requirementfor future studies. T o further our understanding of whouses what types of spiritual therapies, and why they do so,will require a continued systematic approach to focusing onissues of diversity in populations, treatment modalities, andpotential covariates and determinants. Conclusion The present study provided a unique opportunity to explorethe sociodemographic and health-related correlates of useof a spiritual healer for a medical problem in the U.S. Theuse of these data provided several advantages: a nationallyrepresentative sample that expands upon previous surveys, alarge ethnically diverse sample of African-origin people, dif-ferentiation of faith healers and psychics, and availability ofcovariates assessing a full range of sociodemographic char-acteristics. Findings show that people who use a spiritual healer do not do so, on average, out of lack of education,marginal racial/ethnic or socioeconomic status, dire healthstraits, or lack of other healthcare options. These resultsencourage a rethinking of tacit assumptions about the deter-minants of the use of healers, and CAM generally , that havedriven much of the research in this eld.
