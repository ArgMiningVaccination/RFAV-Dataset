A toxin is any substance that cannot be discharged quickly and has adverse effects on bodily systems, such as blood \u00b9 stasis, phlegm-dampness \u00b2, cold, indigestion, qi \u00b3 stagnation (obstruction of the circulation of vital energy) and internal fire . When they accumulate in the five zang organs (the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys) these toxins accelerate the aging process of these organs, causing the skin, muscles, bones, and nerves they nourish to age at the same rate. Although they are hidden deep inside the body, toxins leave indications of their whereabouts on the surface in various forms such as hyperplasia and acne. It is important to identify where the toxins are hidden, and expel them from the body as quickly as possible. Effective detoxification methods involve maintaining a regular diet and healthy living habits, as well as massage, diet therapy, and tea therapy recommended by TCM experts. If you make adjustments to your diet and follow the methods recommended in this book for a period of time, you will find that although you're not dieting, your body feels lighter. Although you're not having beauty treatments, your complexion is rosy, and although you're not taking supplements, your vitality is restored. \u00b9The substance that is controlled by the pulse and circulates throughout the body. It is a red liquid with nutritional and moisturizing effects. Blood belongs to yin, so is also called yin blood. \u00b2The name of an ailment, referring to a symptom of the bodily constitution, which is often caused by improper diet or disease. Phlegm here also refers to abnormal accumulation of bodily fluids, which is a pathological product. Dampness is either internal or external. External dampness refers to humidity in the air and living environment. It will invade the body and cause disease. Internal dampness refers to dysfunction of the digestive system, an uncontrollable flow of water in the body that leads to the accumulation of bodily fluids, or the accumulation of bodily fluids due to excessive dietary water, alcohol, cheese, and cold drinks. \u00b3In TCM, qi is the subtle, fundamental substance that constitutes the body and maintains life activities. This term also includes physiological functions. In TCM terms, qi has different meanings when combined with other words. A TCM term, meaning that the yin and yang of the body have lost balance and the endogenous fire is vigorous. Fire describes some hot symptoms in the body. Getting internal fire is also an internal heat syndrome that occurs with an imbalance of yin and yang in the body. Specific symptoms include red and swollen eyes, sores at the corners of the mouth, yellow urine, toothache, and sore throat. It is either excessive fire or deficient fire. Excessive fire refers to the syndrome of excess heat due to hyperactive yang heat, which is mostly caused by the internal invasion of pathogenic fire-heat or the result of spicy food. Excessive mental stimulation and dysfunction of the visceral functions can be another cause. Deficient fire is mostly caused by internal injury and strain, such as long-term illness, depletion of vital energy, and excessive strain that leads to visceral imbalance and weakness, resulting in internal heat, which then turns into deficient fire. Chapter One Knowing about the Toxins in Your Body TCM and Western medicine have their own definition of poison or toxins. Although there are differences, there are also similarities. In TCM theory, poison includes an imbalance of yin and yang caused by the five endogenous evils, the six exogenous evils, internal injury caused by the seven emotions, as well as inappropriate diet, overwork, and lack of physical activity. The five endogenous evils refer to internal wind, cold, dampness, dryness, and heat caused by an imbalance of yin and yang and the qi and blood in the zang-fu organs; the six exogenous evils are the six external factors of wind, cold, summer heat, humidity, dryness, and fire that invade the body; internal injury refers to the seven emotional changes: joy, anger, anxiety, overthinking, grief, fear, and fright. 1. What Are Toxins? TCM regards all ills as poisons or toxins. They can be divided into the following categories: Heat toxins: When one's yang qi\u00b9 is hyperactive, the body will produce heat toxins. Dry mouth, a bitter taste in the mouth, halitosis, swollen and bleeding gums, nose bleeds, dry and hard stools, oily face, acne, and sweating hands and feet are the manifestations of this toxin. Cold toxins: Opposite in nature from heat toxins, cold toxins can be divided into external and internal cold. While common colds and joint pains are a result of a cold wind invasion, which is an external factor, internal cold is caused by a deficiency of yang and a decline of viscera function, characterized by cold body and limbs, feeling cold in the lower back and abdomen, clear and colorless urination, and loose stools. Fire toxins: When heat reaches its extreme, it becomes fire. In other words, when heat toxins reach a certain degree, they become fire toxins. Redness in the local area, swelling, heat, and pain are just mild symptoms of fire toxins. When it becomes severe, manifestations include fever, headache, irritability, scanty dark urine, constipation, red tongue with a yellow coating, as well as oral ulcers, and sores at the corners of the mouth. Damp toxins: Damp is divided into external damp and internal damp. External damp is induced by a hot and humid environment, and manifests as rheumatic issues such as joint pain. Internal damp is caused by a weakness in the spleen and stomach, and poor transportation and transformation of foods and fluids\u00b9 in the body. Malfunction of the spleen and stomach's transportation and transformation function can be caused by an inappropriate diet. When there is a deficiency in the spleen, vital qi\u00b2 will be weakened, allowing the invasion of external damp, and hindering the normal transportation and transformation function of the spleen and stomach. Manifestations of internal dampness are a loss of appetite, abdominal distension, diarrhea, loose stools, sallow complexion, edema, and a pale tongue with a moist coating. Parasitic toxins: Parasitic toxins damage and erode local tissues, consuming nutrients and essence. Eating raw meat carries the risk of parasitic infection in the intestines and stomach. Symptoms of toxins from parasitic infection are abdominal pain, tooth grinding, sallow complexion, and poor digestive function. Skin symptoms such as scabies, ringworm, and ulcers can appear. Toxins accumulated from food: The spleen and stomach are in charge of digestion, absorption, transformation, and transportation of food. If there is a dysfunction, food cannot be transformed and transported. This food will accumulate in the stomach. Over time it will turn into toxins, damaging the spleen and stomach, and causing symptoms such as loss of appetite, chest tightness, belching, acid regurgitation, poor stools, and acne. Toxins from drugs: There is an old saying that there is a degree of poison in every drug. The symptoms of drug poisons are relatively complex, so the details will not be discussed in this book. However, they are all harmful to the liver. It is very important to have some knowledge of drugs and understand their toxicity and side effects. Blood stasis toxins: Blood stasis toxins are the pathological product of abnormal blood function. If allowed to remain in the body, blood stasis will block meridians\u00b3, preventing the body from being fully nourished by qi and blood. If this happens, various symptoms will appear, including stabbing pains throughout the body, pain at specific fixed locations, abnormal bleeding, and ecchymosis. Toxins generated by emotions: Emotions generally refer to the seven kinds of emotional changes: joy, anger, anxiety, overthinking, grief, fear, and fright. These are the psychological reactions to external stimuli. In TCM, it is believed that emotions are generated by the gasification of the five zang organs. When a person's emotions are out of balance, harm can be done to their zang-fu and blood and qi, affecting their health. Too much joy can harm the heart; anger can harm the liver; overthinking can harm the spleen; grief can harm the lungs; and fear can harm the kidneys. Once emotions become excessive, they will harm the body. The poisons or toxins in TCM are more abstract and broader than in Western medicine, where they are more specific and detailed. The following are some common toxins: Biotoxins: Biotoxins, also known as natural toxins, are various substances produced by animals, plants, and microorganisms that are toxic to other organisms, such as the bite of a poisonous snake. Toxicity and side effects of drugs: Most Western drugs are chemically synthesized, and have certain level of toxicity along with side effects. This is clearly indicated on the packaging. Because of their quick effect, Western medicines, especially antibiotics, tend to be abused. The over-use of antibiotics causes intestinal flora disorder, killing too many probiotics in the intestines. It also raises drug resistance in the body, preventing effective drug treatment in emergency cases. Toxins caused by human factors: Human-inflicted toxins are wide ranging. Some examples are organophosphorus and organochlorine in pesticides, as well as carbon monoxide and ethanol. These toxins will cause a certain degree of damage once they enter the human body, and may even lead to death. One example is alcohol\u2014a common toxin. Drunkenness is alcohol poisoning. Drinking a lot in one sitting will cause abnormalities to a person's physical functions, and can cause serious damage to the nervous system and liver. Within a few minutes of drinking, alcohol will reach the brain, reducing the function of brain cells and inhibiting the myocardium. The heart will have to accelerate its beats to adapt to this state. The first glass will make you feel relaxed. However, continued drinking will increase the alcohol concentration of the blood, affecting the brain's nerve center. Drinking can lead to extreme and violent behavior. Driving under the influence of alcohol often leads to car accidents because alcohol inhibits a person's ability to judge accurately and slows down their reaction time. Toxins in food: This is the most common poison in daily life. Examples of such food are poisonous mushrooms, sprouting potatoes, and undercooked French beans. Although some foods contain toxins, not everyone will feel their effects. Firstly, the intake required to cause harm is different. Secondly, everyone's bodily constitution and response to toxins are different. Finally, some people are born more susceptible to allergic reactions. Even eating eggs and drinking milk may make them feel unwell. This group of people must be more cautious with their daily diet. Toxins in the air: The main sources of PM 2.5 in haze are dust, coal combustion, biomass combustion, automobile exhaust, garbage incineration, industrial pollution, and secondary inorganic aerosols, all of which will undoubtedly cause harm to the body. Studies have shown that the harmful substances produced by house decoration are usually higher than harmful outdoor air pollutants. To reduce the concentration of harmful indoor substances, proper ventilation is needed over a prolonged period. Toxins in drinking water: Water pollution is a result of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater. Drinking polluted water will cause symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and headaches, and in serious cases may even cause cancer. Toxins in daily items: Things that we use daily such as perfume, shaving cream, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, laundry detergent, nail polish, and cosmetics contain chemicals that can penetrate the body through the skin and produce toxins. 2. Are There Toxins in Your Body? In addition to the external factors that people are aware of, the human body itself also produces toxins. The waste produced by the body's metabolic activities needs to be removed promptly, or it will have a great adverse impact on the body. Accumulated fecal matter in the colon: Constipation is the result of trapped feces that have not been excreted from the body. Some people who suffer from this issue also experience insomnia, irritability, disturbed sleep, and depression. Diet therapy can alleviate these conditions. However, when symptoms such as bloody stool, anemia, emaciation, fever, black stool, and abdominal pain occur, you should go to a hospital for treatment. Uric acid: Uric acid is the waste product of metabolism, and is excreted through urination. If the level of uric acid is too high, or there is a weak flow of urine, excess uric acid will be deposited in the body's soft tissues or joints, causing inflammation. To prevent this, drink more water, eat more vegetables such as eggplants, lettuce, and celery, and cut down on your consumption of red meat (that is, meat that is red before cooking, such as pork, beef, and mutton). Free radicals: A small number of free radicals is good for the human body, as they can protect it from invasion by foreign "}
