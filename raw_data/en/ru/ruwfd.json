Vocal Toning with Dimitri | From November Explore Sacred Vowel Sounds that resonate with the energy centers of the body (chakras). Dating back to ancient times, these sounds help you to deeply relax and assist you in the path of healing, creating balance within. The human voice is believed by many to be the most potent tool as your own personal healing instrument. Every organ, bone, and tissue in the body has a healthy frequency at which it normally vibrates. When imbalances set in, the vibrations in that portion of the body become out of tune. Through Toning or sacred Bija Mantras with Shruti Box and Singing Bowls, we can set these vibrations back in tune through resonant frequency. The intention is the energy behind the sound that is being created. It is the consciousness we have when we are making a sound. The formula \"Frequency + Intention = Healing.\" SACRED SHAMANIC SOUND BATH with Dimitri | From November A Sacred Sound Journey that will shift your consciousness, remove toxic emotions, calm the mind and drop you into deep meditative states.
