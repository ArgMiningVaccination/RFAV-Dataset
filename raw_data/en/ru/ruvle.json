Blunt, BA DATA FUSION CENTER SUPPORT SERVICES SPECIALIST PRESENTED TO: The Executive Office of the Mayor The Council of the District of Columbia and The Citizens of the District of ColumbiaMISSION The mission of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) for the District of Columbia is to investigate all deaths in the District of Columbia that occur by any means of violence (injury), and those that occur without explanation or medical attention, in custody, or which pose a threat to the public health. OCME provides forensic services to government agencies, health care providers and citizens in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area to ensure that justice is served and to improve the health and safety of the public. 5 4 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORT The agency maintained the standards and guidelines of operation as established by the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME), American Board of Forensic Toxicologists (ABFT), American Board of Medicolegal Death Investigators (ABMDI) and the American Board of Forensic Anthropologists (ABFA), amongst others. The District established the Maternal Mortality, Violence Fatality and Opioid Fatality Reviews to be administered by the agency. The agency coordinated the necessary steps to stand-up the reviews to include hiring staff, providing resources, and assisting with the Mayoral appointment of review members and establishing policies and procedures. The work of the reviews will strengthen the District's ability to address systemic issues toward preventing deaths amongst these populations. The agency continued its quest towards ISO accreditation with the completion of an ISO checklist evaluation and \"next steps\" preparation for application, to include a Quality and Training Manuals. The agency Forensic Toxicology Division, Investigations Unit and the Forensic Pathology Unit not only successfully completed proficiency testing but also updated standard operating procedures regarding such testing to ensure industry standard compliance. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner hosted an interfaith ceremony to recognize our District residents who received a Public Disposition -- a District of Columbia funded cremation and burial. This interfaith ceremony allowed the families to attend a service that memorializes their loved ones as they were laid in their final resting place. The agency's Data Analysis Fusion Center continues to evaluate mortality statistics in order to determine outcomes and trends towards the improvement of public health and safety. In 2019, it published surveillance reports on Elderly Falls, Hyper- & Hypothermia, Violent Deaths (Homicides, Firearm-related Homicides, and Suicide), Opioid Overdoses, Synthetic Cannabinoids, Unsafe Sleep, and Public Dispositions. Of note, the agency managed approximately $2,520,000 in grant funding to support fatality management, toxicological testing, the opioid crises, violence prevention, and the review of fatalities of specified populations. The OCME operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. With a dedicated staff, we will continue working toward our mission of public safety and justice, academic advancement and public health surveillance. Most importantly, we will remain committed to serving as a voice for families, residents and visitors at a time when they are most vulnerable and grief stricken. In Truth and Service, Roger A. Mitchell, Jr. MD FASCP Chief Medical ExaminerA MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER Greetings, On behalf of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), I am pleased to present the 2019 OCME Annual Report which provides key statistical data stemming from our critical work in death investigation and certification, as well as a snapshot of our key achievements over the year. With about one hundred employees and a budget of about 12 million dollars in FY2019, the agency investigated nearly 6,009 deaths and performed 1,343 post-mortem examinations, including 164 homicides. We performed 1,250 toxicological tests, processed 6,738 records and resolved numerous legal matters. These accomplishments were performed in a climate of fiscal responsibility and public stewardship. This annual report includes statistical data focusing on the number and type of cases accepted and examined; cause and manner of death; decedent demographics (i.e., gender, age, race and residence); and toxicological findings. Moreover, certain agency functions, such as public dispositions, the Breath Alcohol Program and other toxicological services, organ procurement and Data Fusion Center special trend reports, are highlighted. In addition to carrying out the agency's mission to perform sound medicolegal investigations and determine cause and manner of death, the agency experienced several key achievements during 2019. 7 Executive SummaryThis Annual Report covers data that resulted from the investigation of 6,009 deaths that occurred in the District of Columbia (DC) during the Calendar Year (CY) 2019. The report also presents key agency accomplishments and other major activities such as Expert testimony by the Medical Examiners, Decedents Identification, Disposition of Unclaimed Remains, Toxicological results in Driving Under the Influence (DUI), Drug Facilitated Sexual Assault (DFSA) cases and educational endeavors. The agency hopes that the information contained in the report will be useful to the Executive Office of the Mayor, DC Councilmembers and the public at large. The OCME serves the citizens of DC and the Metropolitan area in their most difficult moments by providing timely removal of decedents from homes and public areas; thorough death investigation; prompt provision of death certificates and proofs of death to family members allowing for rapid funeral arrangements and access to insurance and other death benefits. The agency provides services to the public seven days per week during core business hours. However, deaths are reported to the agency and the agency responds to and investigates these reported deaths 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which includes weekends and holidays. Autopsies are performed every day of the year as well, and on occasion it is necessary for the Medical Examiner to perform them at night. The data presented within this report represents deaths occurring exclusively within the District of Columbia for which the OCME has jurisdiction. The data does not represent ALL deaths of DC residents. The decedent's place of residence or location of injury may be outside of the District. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has a dual role; Public Safety and Public Health. As a Public Safety agency, the OCME conducts death investigations in an independent manner and without bias. The agency's involvement with a mandatory reported death starts with the death notification and continues through the possible provision of expert testimony in legal proceedings. The agency strives toward quickly responding to death scenes, allowing non-investigating police personnel to return to regular duty. At the death scenes, the OCME takes custody of the body and secures all evidentiary material associated with the body. OCME investigators, Forensic and Medicolegal, work cooperatively with the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) to gather information useful to the interpretation of the circumstances of the death. When feasible, the OCME investigators will also ensure identification of the deceased by family members present at the scenes of death. In addition, the Medicolegal Investigators pronounce death at the scene or at the agency, as this function is reserved to specific professionals as specified in the DC Code. As a Public Health agency, the OCME is well suited to provide information on the state of health of the residents of the District of Columbia and recognize and alert appropriate officials of deaths that may present an immediate threat to its population. Critical to this work is the agency's Data Fusion Center, which conducts epidemiological research in support of the agency's public health surveillance initiative in an effort to reduce the incidence and prevalence of preventable fatalities in the District. Part of this initiative includes real-time analysis and reporting of mortality data to federal, state, and 9 8 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORTlocal entities for the purpose of detecting, investigating and predicting trends to better support at risk populations. OVERVIEW OF CASES REPORTED AND INVESTIGATED During the Calendar Year (CY) 2019, 6,009 cases were reported to and investigated by the District of Columbia - Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (DC OCME). Overall, the total number of deaths reported to the DC OCME has slightly increased since last year. However, the percentage of accepted cases remained steady at 40%. Medical Examiner Caseload Accepted Cases - The OCME accepted jurisdiction of 1,343 decedent cases, of which 936 cases were autopsied. Declined Cases - The OCME declined jurisdiction of 1,844 decedent cases, of which 77 became Storage Requests. Storage Requests - The D.C. OCME provides a unique service to area nursing homes, hospices, and other like facilities by accommodating requests to store deceased bodies. One hundred and four of the reported cases were Storage Requests only, and seventy seven of the storage requests were previously \"Declined\" cases, so as a result the agency had a total of 181 Storage Requests, of which 174 were approved (See section 8.0 for additional statistics) Cremation Requests: The D.C. OCME must review all cremations for deaths that occur in the District of Columbia. There were 3,370 Cremation requests made to the DC OCME in 2019; 729 were OCME cases, 2,641 were \"New Reports\" submitted from area hospitals, clinics and nursing homes, the OCME took jurisdiction of 16 of these \"New Reports\" for further investigation and certification. (See section 8.0 for details). Scene Visits and Body Transport - OCME investigation staff reported to 816 scenes. The OCME transported the bodies of 1,437 decedents, of which, 807 were transported directly from scenes of death to the agency. Organ/Tissue Donations - There were 188 organ donation requests during CY 2019. The following table illustrates the number of autopsy examinations, external examinations, medical record reviews and partial autopsy examinations performed by \"Manner of Death\".2019 MEDICAL EXAMINER CASES BY MANNER OF DEATH MannerFull Autopsy ExaminationsPartial Autopsy ExaminationsExternal ExaminationsReview of Medical RecordsNon- HumanAnatomical Specimen DisposalTotal Accident 451 0 72 55 0 0 578 Homicide 164 0 0 0 0 0 164 Natural 242 0 253 26 0 0 521 Stillbirth 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Suicide 61 0 0 0 0 0 61 Undetermined 18 0 1 0 0 0 19 Other 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total 936 0 326 81 0 0 1343 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS FOR MANNER OF DEATH HOMICIDES: The OCME investigated 164 homicides in CY 2019.

This information is a reflection of the status of health of the District of Columbia residents, the level and types of violence to which the population is subjected, the prevalence of drug use and its association with homicides and/or traffic accidents. The Executive Office of the Mayor, the Office of the City Administrator, the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice, the Department of Health, the D.C. Office of the Attorney General, the United States Attorney's Office, the Public Defender Service and other entities can use the data for research purposes and for the development of preventative and corrective policies. In 2019, the agency had three primary programs: Death Investigation and Certification, Agency Management, and Fatality Review. This report will include data on the Death Investigation and Certification, and the Agency Management programs. The Fatality Review Committees are statutorily required to issue their own Annual Reports. The OCME investigates the following types of human death occurring in the District of Columbia: 1) violent death, whether apparently homicidal, suicidal or accidental, including deaths due to thermal, chemical, electrical or radiation injury and deaths due to criminal abortion; 2) deaths that are sudden, unexpected or unexplained; 3) deaths that occur under suspicious circumstances; 4) deaths of persons whose bodies are to be cremated, dissected or buried at sea: 5) deaths at the workplace or resulting from work activity; 6) deaths that are due to diseases that may constitute a threat to public health; 7) deaths of persons who are Wards of the District government; 8) deaths related to medical or surgical intervention; 9) deaths that occur while persons are in the legal custody of the District; 10) fetal deaths related to maternal trauma or maternal drug use; 11) deaths for which the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), or other law enforcement agency, or the United States Attorney's Office requests, or a court ordered investigation; and 12) dead bodies brought within the District without proper medical certification. (See Appendix C - (DC Law 13-172), DC Official Code \u00a75-1401 et seq. (2001)). All deaths under the jurisdiction of the OCME, as outlined above, are investigated irrespective of the location of the primary causative incident. The data included in this report reflects deaths where the injury may have occurred outside of the District of Columbia, including primarily Maryland and Virginia. The official vital statistics for the District of Columbia are the explicit role and responsibility of the Department of Health. The Chief Medical Examiner, based on the evaluation of the circumstances surrounding the death, determines the type of investigation to be performed, i.e. autopsy or external examination. This decision is not restricted by family preference or religious beliefs. The OCME Medico Legal Investigators, Forensic Investigators and the Detectives of MPD's Natural Squad in the Homicide and Traffic 19 18 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORTDivisions provide information related to the circumstances of the deaths. The autopsy examination helps answer questions as to time of death, pattern and/or sequence of injuries, and the effect of natural disease on the certification of cause and manner of death. An autopsy procedure requires the retention of tissue specimens up to and including whole organ retention as needed. Tissue retention is for the purpose of ensuring timely and accurate diagnosis. The OCME works in close relationship with legal jurisdictions and often provides expert testimony when called upon to do so. Toxicological examinations assist in the determination of the cause and manner of death, and are performed on the majority of cases autopsied depending upon the circumstances of death. Typical examinations conducted by the laboratory provide information on the presence and amount of alcohol, volatiles, illegal drugs, and some commonly used prescription and non-prescription medications. Other expert consultations (e.g. neuropathology and cardiovascular pathology) are requested when appropriate. Fatality Review Program includes the Child Fatality Review Committee (CFRC) and, the Developmental Disabilities Fatality Review Committee (DD FRC). These committees examine causes and circumstances associated with deaths in their respective populations, evaluate issues associated with services provided and make relevant recommendations that address systemic issues related to services that the District of Columbia provides to the constituents of these vulnerable populations. Each review committee produces an annual report that summarizes relevant findings and recommendations issued as well as government agency responses to the recommendations. In addition to its routine caseload, the office offers temporary storage of bodies for all District hospices and local hospitals in the District of Columbia when final disposition cannot be established by the next-of-kin. The OCME has a total body storage capacity of 206. Public Dispositions of remains by the OCME will occur when the decedent is not identified or is identified but unclaimed. All efforts are made toward identification of the deceased before final public disposition. To achieve this goal, the OCME has not only trained its technical staff to fingerprint decedents, but also works cooperatively with the Department of Forensic Sciences, Metropolitan Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In addition, OCME uses comparative radiology, forensic odontology and/or DNA analysis as necessary to ensure proper and timely identification. The OCME also procures specimens for DNA analysis on each decedent. OCME is one of the few medical examiner offices in the nation that provides on-site grief counseling. In addition and in preparation for possible terrorist attacks and mass natural disaster events, the OCME has developed alliances with area hospitals and with agencies in the Public Safety and Justice cluster with a goal to integrate its Mass Fatality Plan with the District's Disaster Response Plan. The agency also conducts a mass fatality exercise with local and federal partners in order to test the capacity of the Mass Fatality Plan, train staff, develop policies and procedures and identify resources. Through the years, OCME staff has and continues to be very active in social programs such as Career Day at District of Columbia public and public charter schools, the Mayor's Summer Youth Employment Program, My Brother's Keeper DC, Safer Stronger DC and the DC One Fund. In the area of education, OCME provides academic training of medical students, pathology residents from local hospitals, and students from national and international universities enrolled in diverse scientific disciplines such as: physician assistance, forensic science, toxicology, and mortuary sciences. The OCME also provided training for members of MPD and various law enforcement entities including the United States Attorney's office and the soldiers of the Marine Corps. 21 20 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 2.0 ME INVESTIGATIONS AND MEDICAL LEGAL AUTOPSIESOverview of Cases Reported and Investigated During the Calendar Year (CY) 2019, there were 6,009 deaths that occurred in the District of Columbia (DC) as reported by the Department of Health, Center for Policy, Planning and Evaluation for the District of Columbia, of which 3,368 or 56% of these deaths were reported to and investigated by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). The following is a breakdown of how the reported cases were triaged. The categories include \"Accepted,\" \"Declined,\" \"Storage\" or \"Cremation\" cases. The data presented within this report represents deaths occurring exclusively within the District of Columbia for which the OCME has jurisdiction. The data does not represent ALL deaths of DC residents. The decedent's place of residence or location of injury may be outside of the District (See pages 26). Accepted Cases - The OCME accepted jurisdiction of 1,343 decedent cases, of which 936 cases were autopsied. There were scene visits for 807 of the 1,343 accepted cases. Declined Cases - The OCME declined jurisdiction of 1,844 decedent cases, of which 77 became Storage Requests. There were scene visits for 7 of the 1,844 declined cases. Storage Requests - The OCME provides a unique service to area nursing homes, hospices, and other like facilities by accommodating requests to store deceased bodies. One hundred and four (104) of the reported cases were Storage Requests only, and 77 of the storage requests were previously \"Declined\" cases, so as a result, the agency had a total of 181 Storage Requests, of which 174 were approved (See section 8.0 for additional statistics). Cremation Requests: The OCME must review all cremations for deaths that occur in the District of Columbia. There were 3,370 Cremation requests made to the OCME in 2019; 729 were OCME cases, 2,641 were \"New Reports\" submitted from area hospitals, clinics and nursing homes, the OCME took jurisdiction of 16 of these \"New Reports\" for further investigation and certification. (See section 8.0 for details).23 22 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORTTotal Number of Cases Reported and Investigated by the OCME 3,368 Total Number of Declined Cases 1844 Percent of Cases Reported & Investigated 55% Total Number of Cases Accepted for Further Investigation 1343 Percent of Cases Reported & Investigated 40% Total Number of Autopsies Full - 935; Partial -0; Performed in a University Hospital - 1936 Percent of Cases Accepted for Further Investigation 70% Number of Scene Visits by a Medical Examiner or Medico Legal/Forensic Investigator 816 Percent of Cases Accepted for Further Investigation 61% Total Number of Bodies/Cases Transported by OCME or by Order of the OCME: Transported by Pick-up Service -0 Transported by Office Personnel -1435 (METT: 1435) Transported by Others -2 (Funeral Home - 2 )1437 Total Number of Organ/Tissue Donation Requests: (See Section 3 for breakdown)188 BREAKDOWN OF ACCEPTED CASES BY EXAM TYPE Total Number of Cases Accepted and Investigated Further 1,343 Total Number of Autopsies Full - 935 Partial -0 Performed at a University Hospital - 1936 Percent of Cases Accepted 70% Number of External Examinations On-site -326 Off-site - 0326 Percent of Cases Accepted 24% Number of Medical Record Reviews * 81 Percent of Cases Accepted 6%Total Number of Cases Accepted and Investigated Further 1,343 Number of Non-Human Remains * 0 Percent of Cases Accepted 0% Number of Anatomical Specimen Disposal 0 Percent of Cases Accepted 0% Number of Exhumations/Disinterment 0 Percent of Cases Accepted 0% Definition of Unfamiliar Exam Type Classifications: \u00bb Autopsy Performed at a Area Hospital: During Calendar Year 2019 there was one case where the autopsy was performed at a University hospital. The DC Official Code \u00a7 5-1409 authorizes the Chief Medical Examiner to deputize any \"qualified pathologist\" to perform an autopsy on a decedent that is deemed a Medical Examiner case. Some of these cases were initially declined by the OCME and later accepted based on additional information/autopsy findings. Cases in which the autopsy was completed at the hospital, still required review of the autopsy reports and completion of the death certificates be done by the Medical Examiner. \u00bb Medical Record Reviews: Cases where the body is not available for examination and the investigation and determination of cause and manner of death are based solely on the review of available medical records. \u00bb Non-Human Remains: Cases that are commonly identified as animal remains. \u00bb Anatomical Specimen Disposal: Cases that are identified as those specimens received in formalin. \u00bb Exhumations/Disinterment: Cases where the remains were unearthed from a burial site.25 24 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORTBREAKDOWN OF ACCEPTED CASES AND AUTOPSIES BY MONTH Month Case InvestigationsAutopsies (Full and Partial) January 106 74 February 95 65 March 97 66 April 97 68 May 107 81 June 101 70 July 124 84 August 124 80 September 109 79 October 128 83 November 125 84 December 130 102 Total 1343 936 MEDICAL EXAMINER CASE EXAMINATIONS BY MANNER OF DEATH MannerFull Autopsy ExaminationsPartial Autopsy ExaminationsExternal ExaminationsReview of Medical RecordsNon- HumanAnatomical Specimen DisposalTotal Accident 451 0 72 55 0 0 578 Homicide 164 0 0 0 0 0 164 Natural 242 0 253 26 0 0 521 Stillbirth 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Suicide 61 0 0 0 0 0 61 Undetermined 18 0 1 0 0 0 19 Other 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total 936 0 326 81 0 0 1343PIE CHART - MEDICAL EXAMINER CASES BY MANNER OF DEATH TRENDS IN DEATHS REPORTED TO THE MEDICAL EXAMINER Note: All accepted cases and all declined cases will not equal Total Deaths Reported, because there are other types of cases \"Death Reports\" not included in this illustration.1%5% 0% 39% 12%43%Accident Homicide Natural Stillbirth Suicide Undetermined 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORTTRENDS IN DEATHS REPORTED AND INVESTIGATED BY EXAM TYPE 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Autopsies 752 External Exams 288 Scene Visits 485754 305 694735 354 712715 345 674891 353 840963 360 805901 376 819936 326 816020040060080010001200Number of Procedures Breakdown of Accepted Cases by Residence of Decedents By law the Medical Examiner (ME) must accept all traumatic, unwitnessed or suspicious deaths that occur in the DC. As a result, the primary residence of these decedents can be anywhere in the world. Nonetheless, the majority of the cases accepted by the OCME were decedents that resided or were injured in DC, Maryland or Virginia. The breakdown by decedent residence is found below. Just as important, Medical Examiner cases accepted by the OCME do not represent all the suspicious or non-natural fatalities of District residents, who may have died in another state or country. There are DC residents who may have died in hospitals found within another state like Maryland or Virginia that are not reported to OCME. 1%10% 2%3% 14% 70% BY JURISDICTION OF RESIDENCETABLE: MEDICAL EXAMINER CASES BY RESIDENCE AND MANNER OF DEATH DC Deaths by Jurisdiction of Residence and Manner of Death Ward# of DeathsAccident Homicide Natural Stillbirth Suicide Undetermined Other Ward 1 74 22 7 41 0 4 0 0 Ward 2 39 14 0 21 0 4 0 0 Ward 3 35 12 3 18 0 2 0 0 Ward 4 101 34 4 52 0 9 2 0 Ward 5 153 67 17 64 0 5 1 0 Ward 6 120 31 15 65 0 7 1 0 Ward 7 166 63 25 73 0 2 4 0 Ward 8 254 97 49 101 0 6 0 0 DC 942 340 120 435 0 39 8 0 MD 186 114 25 27 0 15 5 0 VA 31 23 3 4 0 1 0 0 Other 34 13 1 17 0 3 0 0 Unknown 14 3 6 4 0 1 0 0 Undomiciled 136 85 9 35 0 2 5 0 Total 1343 578 164 522 0 61 18 0 TOTAL NUMBER AND PERCENT OF 2019 DEATHS BY AGE <1 1 to 5 6 to 12 13 to 15 16 to 19 20 to 29 30 to 39 40 to 49 50 to 59 60 to 69 70 to 79 80 to 89 90+ Total Deaths 8 26 6 7 23 138 156 159 275 284 155 74 32 % of OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORT TOTAL NUMBER OF 2019 DEATHS BY GENDER AND RACE/ETHNICITY Race/Ethnicity Female Male Total American Indian 1 1 2 Asian 7 9 16 Black 293 742 1035 Hispanic 11 34 45 Other 3 5 8 Unknown 1 1 2 White 80 155 235 Total 396 947 1343 TOTAL NUMBER OF 2018 DEATHS BY MANNER OF DEATH AND GENDER1 Gender Natural Accident Homicide Suicide Undetermined Total Percent Female 171 12 186 23 4 396 29.50% Male 407 152 335 38 15 947 70.50% Total 578 164 521 61 19 1343 100.00% Note: The above tables do not include - Anatomical Specimen (1) and Human Remains (1).

This is a 4.5% increase from CY 2018. The following tables and graphs provide a distribution by cause of death, month, race, gender and age group. Death by homicidal acts was most prevalent in Black males and in the age group between 20 to 29 years than any other group presented. Firearm injuries were most frequent amongst the 2019 homicides. In 2019, January and July had the most homicides.

Peak incidents occurred in August. An \"Undetermined\" manner of death is determined when the evidence or investigatory efforts are inconclusive as to the circumstances of the death. This manner of death can be amended as additional information is received as it infers a continuous investigation/search for clarification of the events surrounding the death. At times, the cause of death can also be certified as \"Undetermined\" when autopsy findings are not decisive. This is often the case in skeletonized or markedly decomposed remains.

Because the system centers on the incident instead of the victim, data such as multiple homicides within a 24-hour period, homicide-suicides, and connections between suspect(s) and victim(s) over a period time can be collected. The system has grown from originally supporting six states to now all 50 states, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Death certificates, police reports/records, and coroner and medical examiner records are the three core sources among others used in collecting detailed information on violent fatalities occurring in the DC jurisdiction involving deaths due to violence related to suicide, homicide, unintentional firearm deaths, legal intervention, and those of undetermined intent. Individually, these sources satisfy their intended uses for their agencies, but collectively, they develop a more complete picture surrounding the nature of violent deaths occurring within a state/jurisdiction and aid community partners and agencies in identifying strategies for their prevention or intervention. In 2016, the District of Columbia's Department of Health (Now known as DC Health) and the District of Columbia's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (DCOCME) was awarded CDC funds for a 5-year period to initiate the District of Columbia Violent Death Reporting System (DCVDRS) and began collecting data in 2017. The contribution of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department (DCMPD) and DC Health as DCVDRS partnering agencies have been invaluable resources toward the efforts against DC violent deaths. The success of DCVDRS, as a whole, would otherwise be unachievable without the collaborative effort of these partnering agencies. Advantages to utilizing the DCVDRS include, but are not limited to: \u00bb Collaborative input from partnering agencies-DCMPD and DC Health on circumstances surrounding a single violent death \u00bb The recording of incidents involving more than death or deaths related to one another (i.e. multiple homicides, incidents involving a homicide and suicide \u00bb The complete picture surrounding the who, what, when, where, how and why the violent death occurred (i.e. suspect information in homicides, mental health and recent stressors for suicides, crimes committed before fatal injury, etc.). \u00bb Extensive collection of data involving Intimate-Partner Violence (IPV), Fatalities involving infants, children, teens and wards of the state and Accidental Overdoses. The following report reflects DCVDRS data from 2019. 51 50 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORTDCVDRS SUICIDE DATA In 2019, the District of Columbia OCME saw 61 suicides. The DCVDRS suicide report reflects any mental illness diagnoses/emotional disorders, history of suicide attempts or ideations, and recent stressors to victim. This information was provided from medical records, evidence found on scene, investigative reports and interviews of witnesses/family/friends. Forty-four (44) of the 62 suicide victims in 2019 had at least one mental illness diagnosis with depression being the most common (n=33). Thirty-five (35) had either been recently receiving treatment (medication, therapy, etc) or had been treated for their mental health in the past. Twenty- three (23) victims had a history of alcoholism and/or substance abuse. Fourteen (14) of the 62 suicide victims for 2019 had made at least one suicide attempt prior to death; six (6) of those 14 victims made a prior suicide attempt within 1 year of their death. Twenty-three (23) decedents had a history of suicidal thoughts or ideations prior to death, and Fourteen (14) had a history of a suicide attempt prior to death.

Circumstances surrounding the homicidal incidents are collected in the DCVDRS among other variables and demographics. Due to the often- extensive legal, multi-agency and multi-state incorporated legwork surrounding homicides for the District of Columbia, there are incidents where no circumstances could be recorded to give reason or understanding to the homicide. Overtime, as new evidence presents itself to investigative parties, circumstances surrounding homicides may not be currently available. The data below highlights severity trends in firearm related homicides as 129 of the 164 homicides seen in the district for CY 2019 were due to firearms. Between 2015 and 2019, the percentage of firearm-related homicides has steadily increased from 69% in 2015 to 79% in 2019. Among multiple gunshot wound homicides, the average number of gunshot wounds decreased slightly from 5.33 in 2017 to 6.24 in 2019. Note: there are a number of decedents amongst 2018 and 2019 where the firearm injury occurred a year or more prior to the year of death. 5 YEAR TREND OF HOMICIDES BY CAUSE OF DEATH AND YEAR HOMICIDES BETWEEN 2018 VS 2019 SINGLE VS.

Forty- seven had a prior acquaintance with the suspect, with 18 victims having an intimate or familial/ friend-like association with the suspect. Fourteen incidents reportedly had drug involvement; 18 were drive-by shootings and 13 were walk-by assaults. The 4 cases where V was an intervener/ bystander communicate V had no direct association with the assault/homicide and may not have been an intended/direct target. PERSONAL HISTORY OF HOMICIDE DECEDENTS Demographic Breakdown of Decedents: Firearm vs. Non-Firearm Approximately 72% of all homicides happened among adults between the ages of 20-39 years old. In 2018, 53% of all firearm-related homicides were among decedents age 20 to 29, however, the percentage of firearm-related homicides among that age range increased slightly to 56% in 2019. Blacks accounted for 149 or 91% of all homicides. This observation remains true for firearm-related homicides, with 94% to 95% of the firearm-related homicides occurring among Blacks. Generally, homicides were more common among males, which is also the case for firearm related homicides. Females were more likely to die from non-firearm related homicides with the exception of 2019 at 50%. Given the small number of homicides among women (18 in 2018 and 12 in 2019), the percentages observed in firearm and non-firearm-related homicides among females are sensitive to small differences in the number of deaths per year.

The primary entity that procures organ donations in the District of Columbia is the Washington Regional Transplant Consortium (WRTC). To maintain compliance with this law and ensure full cooperation is occurring with and between the OCME and WRTC - the Medical Examiner monitors and tracks all organ donation requests. However, the OCME also has a regulatory obligation to ensure that donation requests do not compromise the ethical standards, investigation efforts or evidence of the remains, and that the process is conducted with respect and honor to the decedents and their families. The following tables provide a statistical rendering of all work related to organ requests and the procurement of organs where approval has been provided, as well as where approval is not required.

Additional screens were assigned depending on intake case history and special requests made by physicians. All significant drug results were confirmed by further testing. Typical case specimens received include blood, urine, bile, vitreous, liver, brain, and gastric contents. In 2019, the Washington, D.C. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner's Toxicology Division received and inventoried 10,032 postmortem specimens (1,260 cases) yielding 4,465 reported results. By comparison, in 2018 the Toxicology Division received 9,654 postmortem specimens, 1,271 cases and 4,718 reported results.61 60 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORTA negative case refers to the absence of any alcohol or detectable drug. A positive case refers to the presence of alcohol and/or drug(s), noting that a case can be positive for more than one substance. The alcohol and/or drugs detected do not necessarily cause or contribute to death. Drugs that are excluded from statistics include common compounds found in routine casework such as: lidocaine, caffeine, and nicotine.

[give] the name, if known, of every person whose death is investigated.\" The process of identification can be a complex and lengthy procedure. The methods used to identify decedents whose deaths are investigated by the OCME are detailed below. The methods of identification are listed from the most to least commonly used. ID Method# of ID's ID By Visual at OCME - 266 at Scene - 249515 ID By Fingerprints411 ID By X-ray 55 ID Waived 299 ID By Dental X-ray2 ID By Circumstantial Evidence18 ID by DNA 5 ID Other 4 Unidentified 0 ID Not Required110 Total 1309 11 There were a total of twenty-five accepted Medical Examiner cases that were not required to be identified, because eleven were Non-Human Remains and fourteen were Review of Medical Records, where the remains were not required to be transported to the Medical Examiner's office.Visual identification: This method is used whenever circumstances of death and discovery allow. In general, the immediate family, close friends, neighbors or colleagues provide identification verification through viewing a photograph of the decedent. At the OCME facility, a digital photograph is taken of the decedent's face and presented to the family or other appropriate individual. Also, visual identification may occur at the death scene if an appropriate individual observed the decedent and is available to speak with the medicolegal death investigator. Timeframe: Instant. Fingerprint: When the physical state of the decedent allows, fingerprints are captured. These fingerprints are sent to law enforcement and processed through the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS). Fingerprints are searched through both the criminal and civil databases. If the fingerprint search returns a negative hit, the fingerprints are sent to the Department of Homeland Security for a search of individuals in the immigration database. Timeframe: Typically 1-5 hours, but may take up to 3 days. Radiograph (X-ray) Comparison: Individualizing skeletal characteristics are captured during routine medical and dental radiographs. Antemortem (before death) radiographs are compared to post-mortem (after death) radiographs and these individualizing characteristics are targeted to confirm identification. Timeframe: Up to 1 week. DNA testing: This method requires the decedent's DNA profile to be compared to the DNA profile of a close biological relative, preferably a parent or child. The DNA profiles are obtained from a decedent specimen (i.e. femur bone, blood, teeth or deep muscle tissue) and a buccal (cheek) swab collected from the biological relative. Alternatively, the decedent's DNA profile can be compared to the DNA obtained from the decedent's personal item such as a tooth brush or hair brush. Timeframe: Up to 3 to 6 weeks. 81 80 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORTCircumstantial Identification: Circumstantial identification is utilized when no other means of identification are available and the investigative information strongly supports the identification. Investigative information may include: discovery location (i.e., locked and secured residence); decedent's physical state and date last known to be alive; and, physical description of the decedent (i.e., sex, age, and race). Unidentified: Individuals are classified as unidentified when a tentative name cannot be confirmed by the methods listed above or no tentative name is known and fingerprint submissions result in negative hits. Prior to final disposition of the decedent, the case is entered into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs). NamUs is a database managed by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and is available to the public. Included in a NamUs entry are the decedent's physical description, circumstances surrounding death, identification photograph, photographs of tattoos and clothing, dental and skeletal radiographs and fingerprint cards. Additionally, a biological sample is submitted to a DOJ funded DNA laboratory for analysis and the decedent's DNA profile is uploaded to the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). Family members searching for lost love ones have access to NamUs through the internet (http:// www.namus.gov/) and may submit a buccal swab for processing and uploading to a family member specific DNA database. The unidentified decedent's DNA profile is regularly compared to all the family member profiles in the database. Positive matches are reported to the investigating agencies. Entry of a missing person's description into NamUs and submission of a family reference DNA sample are handled by law enforcement in the locale where the person went missing. 8.2 - PUBLIC DISPOSITIONS All bodies examined at the OCME are stored by the agency until the next of kin or other authorized individual makes funeral arrangements. Usually this occurs in a matter of days. However, a portion of the population remains \"Unclaimed\" or \"Unidentified\" and final disposition must be arranged by the agency. Additionally, the OCME provides storage of remains for nursing homes and hospices that do not have refrigerated facilities to store bodies. A minimal one-time fee is charged to these facilities and the remains are kept until family members are located or able to make funeral arrangements, or until the expiration of 30-days and at such time public disposition can occur. By regulation (DC Code \u00a75-1411), OCME is required to arrange final disposition for unclaimed remains housed at local hospitals. The process for which unclaimed bodies are handled is called \"Public Dispositions.\" After a 30-day waiting period and after all efforts to locate family members are exhausted the OCME makes final arrangements for these bodies through a contracted local funeral home. Unclaimed decedents are cremated and the cremains are buried. At the discretion of the medical examiner, unclaimed or unidentified decedents may be buried. Furthermore, the OCME has a memorandum of understanding with the National Museum of Health and Medicine allowing the museum to serve as a repository for unidentified skeletal remains. The museum archives the remains until the individual is identified and can be returned to his or her family. Unclaimed decedents identified as United States military veterans are provided a burial at Quantico National Cemetery. First, veteran status is verified through the National Scheduling Office. Then, a burial is scheduled and the decedent is transported, dressed and casketed by the contracted local funeral home. Family members may attend the interment service. Notably, Public Dispositions are not performed by medical examiners in neighboring jurisdictions. For instance, in Maryland bodies are released to the Anatomical Board after 3 days if they are not claimed by Next of kin. There were a total of 231 Public Disposition cases, of which 122 were Medical Examiner cases and 109 were Storage cases. There were no unidentified decedents that were released for Public Disposition in 2019. The breakdown by Adults, Children and Fetuses: Description # of Public Disposition Adults 224 Children 4 Fetus 1 Cremains 2 Total 231 *At times, cremains are found in the community and submitted to the medical examiner's office.

This involves review of the cause and manner of death to be sure it is an etiologically specific disease process and that the manner is natural. Should the cause of death not be appropriately documented, the certifying physician is contacted, the cause of death reviewed and the appropriately formatted cause of death is determined. If this review reveals the manner of death is not natural, the death then falls under the jurisdiction of OCME. Storage Requests The OCME offers temporary body storage for individuals as well as institutions unable to make immediate funeral arrangements. Institutions - but not families - are charged a $150.00 fee for such requests. In these instances, death certificates are also reviewed for appropriate causation. During Calendar Year 2019 there were 181 Storage Requests made to the DC OCME 85 84 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORT APPENDIX A OCME ORGANIZATIONAL CHART87 86 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORTFORENSIC TOXICOLOGY DIVISION Chief Toxicologist Deputy Chief Toxicologist Staff Assistant Forensic Toxicology Laboratory Forensic Toxicologist (Breath Program Manager) Forensic Toxicologist (QA/QC Manager) Forensic Toxicologist (7) Laboratory Support Specialist Forensic Toxicologist.

Since 1999, the Wendt Center's RECOVER program supported the community through the process of decedent identification by providing crisis and early intervention bereavement support, education, and resources to all individuals who came to the OCME to complete decedent identification. Ensuring a positive identification and the emotional well-being of surviving family members were both of critical importance. The end of fiscal year 2018, the program changed to accommodate the needs of a differing identification protocol. Fiscal year 2019 began with RECOVER training OCME staff and marketing a new pilot program being offered at the Consolidated Forensic Laboratory. The new program would offer support groups to individuals whose loved ones had come through the OCME. Brochures were created and disseminated by all appropriate teams within the OCME. Each week beginning in February, 2019 two groups were offered on a weekday and a weekend. An educational group (Managing the First few Days- Logistical Support) and a support group (Connect with other adults who are also grieving) was offered on each of these days. Attendance was very low. During the 8 month pilot- 128 groups were offered in which 19 groups had at least one participant; 16 different people attended. The majority of participants were women, had experienced a death in the past weeks to 6 months (prior to group,) identified as the mother or partner/spouse of the deceased and acknowledged the cause of death as suicide or homicide. Most participants sought a space to better understand trauma and acute grief reactions, share the death narrative, learn coping and self regulating skills, tips for talking to and supporting children and teens and accessing resources. Due to the lack of substantial physical participation in this program, the support and educational groups ceased to be provided on October 1, 2019. Recommendations were provided to the Chief Medical Examiner for future provision of services. The importance of recognizing the impact of vicarious trauma on OCME staff remained paramount during this fiscal year. An increased effort to engage all team members was made, by offering a full day of dedicated scheduling once a month to providing stress release activities, educational materials and an outlet for support and connecting. Forty- six (46) staff wellness groups were offered this year. The program integrated the use of a support/therapeutic dog which was a huge success with many staff. The unconditional love shown by the dog to staff returning from death scenes, to the way the dog helped to ground and contain anxious and stress staff by laying on their legs was amazing to witness. Activities included creating affirmation boxes, succulent gardens, yarn wrapped hearts, mask making and mindful breathing bottles. Music, mindful breathing and body awareness was integrated into each session. Thematic educational material and snacks were provided. The staff verbalized great benefit from these sessions and often explored ways of expanding programming. One to one support for staff continued to be offered, yet followed an appointment scheduling approach to maximize need and time. Twenty (27) sessions were provided this year. Thematic support focused on stress, vicarious trauma, violence at home and in the community, parenting, substance misuse and communication. During this fiscal year- specialized support and training was provided to OCME teams to address stress, communication, toxic stress and vicarious trauma. These trainings were crafted specifically to meet the needs of the team and their roles at the OCME. The Wendt Center team continued to provide data information for the Fatality Review meetings, though did not have a presence at the table. Information provided included clinic based intakes, attendance in therapy, attendance at camp, and/or request for a community based vigil. As of December 2019, the Wendt Center's RECOVER program no longer had a presence at the DC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. 93 92 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORT APPENDIX C GLOSSARY95 94 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 2019 ANNUAL REPORTGlossary Autopsy - A detailed postmortem external and internal examination of a body to determine cause and manner of death, collect evidence, and determine the presence or absence of injury. Cause of Death - The disease, injury, or poison that results in a physiological derangement or biochemical disturbance that is incompatible with life. The result of post-mortem examination, including autopsy and toxicological findings, combined with information about the medical history of the decedent, serves to establish the cause of death. Chief Medical Examiner - The head of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The Chief Medical Examiner must be a board certified forensic pathologist licensed to practice medicine in the District of Columbia and may appoint a Deputy Chief Medical Examiners and other forensic pathologists. Drug Caused Death - A death caused by a drug or combination of drugs. External Exam- A detailed postmortem external examination of the decedent's body, clothing, and injuries that may have caused or contributed to their death another. Fentanyl/Fentanyl Analogs - According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, fentanyl is a synthetic and short-acting opioid analgesic, is 50-100 times more potent than morphine and approved for managing acute or chronic pain associated with advanced cancer. Although fentanyl may be prescribed to treat severe pain, most of the fentanyl highlighted in this report is illicitly produced non-pharmaceutical fentanyl and fentanyl analogs.

Jurisdiction-The jurisdiction of the Medical Examiner extends to all reportable deaths occurring within the boundaries of the District of Columbia, whether or not the incident leading to the death (such as an accident) occurred within the district. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner functions pursuant to District of Columbia Code, Division I, Title 5, Ch.14. (DC Law 13-172). Reportable deaths are defined by DC Official Code \u00a75-1401 et seq. (2001), as explained in the \"Introduction\" section of this report. Not all natural deaths reported fall within the jurisdiction of the Medical Examiner. Manner of Death - The general category of the circumstances of the event which causes the death. The categories are accident, homicide, natural, suicide, and undetermined. Manner: Accident - The manner of death used when there is no evidence of intent; an unintentional, sudden, and unexpected death. Manner: Homicide - The manner of death in which death results from the intentional harm of one person by another, including actions of grossly reckless behavior. Manner: Natural - The manner of death used when a disease alone causes death. If death is hastened by an injury, the manner of death is not considered natural. Manner: Suicide - The manner of death in which death results from the purposeful attempt to end one's life.Manner: Undetermined - The manner of death for deaths in which there is insufficient information to assign another manner. An undetermined death may have an undetermined cause of death and an unknown manner, an undetermined cause of death and a known manner, or a determined cause of death and an unknown manner. Motor Vehicle Collision Related Death - A death involving a motor vehicle. Motor vehicles include automobiles, vans, motorcycles, trucks, aircraft, and trains. The decedent is usually a driver of, a passenger in, or a pedestrian who is struck by a motor vehicle. The death of a bicyclist that is struck by a motor vehicle is considered to be a motor vehicle related death. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner - The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) is responsible for the investigation of sudden, violent, or unexpected death. Race/Ethnicity- The racial categories used in this report are: African American, American Indian/ Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, Other, and White. Hispanic is the only ethnicity included in data. Stimulant - A class of drugs, including cocaine and oral amphetamines, whose principal action is the stimulation of the central nervous system. Sudden and Unexpected Infant Death - A diagnosis designated for infants (children under the age of 1 year). Sudden and Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) is a diagnosis made in cases in which autopsy does not reveal a definitive medical or traumatic cause of death and the circumstances surrounding the death suggest that there is an associated risk factor for dying, such as unsafe bedding or co-sleep, or some other external factor, but the contribution of this factor cannot be determined with certainty. The diagnosis may also be used in the situation where a medical disease is identified, but it is uncertain that this disease caused death. Toxicology Terms: Ethanol - An alcohol, which is the principal intoxicant in beer, liquor, and wine. A person with an alcohol concentration in blood of 0.08 percent by weight by volume (0.08%) is legally intoxicated in the District of Columbia. Ethanol Present - Deaths in which toxicological tests reveal a reportable level of ethanol (0.01% W/V or greater) at the time of death. Opiate - A class of drugs derived from the opium poppy plant (Papaver somniferum). \"Opioid\" is often used interchangeably with opiates, and describes chemical/pharmaceutical narcotics that bind to the opiate receptors of the brain and work very similarly to opiates. Poison - Any substance, either taken internally or applied externally, that is injurious to health or dangerous to life, and with no medicinal benefit.OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER 401 E Street, SW , Washington, DC 20024 ocme@dc.govGovernment of the District of Columbia OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER "}
