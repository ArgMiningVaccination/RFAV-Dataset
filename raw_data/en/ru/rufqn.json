It's understandable why many people would be intrigued by inexpensive, \"natural\", and easily attainable solutions to help them reduce pain, lose weight, improve memory, or treat a wide range of ailments including the common cold. However, herbal supplements (sometimes known as botanicals) may not always be what they seem. The truth is that herbal supplements are not subjected to the same scientific standards and regulations as over-the-counter or prescriptions medications. Some herbal supplements can have medication-like effects. However, they can also carry significant risk. That's why the [healthcare providers at Abraham Family Medicine](https://abrahamfamilymedicine.com/about-us/providers/) wanted to provide some critical information that anyone should know before they begin taking any kind of herbal supplement. Herbal Supplements Have Lower Standards & Regulations Like other over-the-counter and prescription meds, herbal supplements are regulated by the FDA. However, they are regulated under a category called dietary supplements and not as drugs. This is why herbal supplements are not required by the FDA to prove their safety and effectiveness to diagnose, prevent, treat, or cure the health conditions they claim. That burden falls on the manufacturers themselves, as opposed to an impartial third party. Herbal Supplements Can be Dangerous for Some People Herbal supplements can be unsafe for people with certain health problems as well as women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Additionally, there are [herbal supplement concerns for older adults](https://abrahamfamilymedicine.com/geriatric-services/) and children whose bodies may process certain ingredients differently. For patients who are having surgery, herbal supplements can cause potential issues with surgery including bleeding problems, as well as complications during recovery. It's important to tell your surgeon ahead of time about any supplements that you take. Herbal Supplements Can Affect Other Medications If you regularly take any medication, whether it be over-the-counter or prescription, it is imperative that you speak with your doctor before taking any herbal supplements. Herbal supplements can affect the way your body processes drugs and lead to harmful, unforeseen negative side effects. While we can certainly see the appeal in a natural supplement that can help improve your general health or treat a specific ailment, it's important to be 100% sure of what you're taking before making any decisions. Unfortunately, herbal supplements often make this difficult and this lack of transparency can lead to potentially dangerous situations.
