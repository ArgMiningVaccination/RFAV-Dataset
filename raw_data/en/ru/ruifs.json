Tablet. The tablet can be divided into equal doses. Piriton tablets are indicated for symptomatic control of all allergic conditions responsive to antihistamines, including hay fever, vasomotor rhinitis, urticaria, angioneurotic oedema, food allergy, drug and serum reactions, insect bites. Also indicated for the symptomatic relief of itch associated with chickenpox. Oral Administration only Do not exceed the stated dose or frequency of dosing Minimum dosing interval: 4 hours Do not use continuously for more than two weeks without consulting a doctor. Adults and children 12 years and over: 1 tablet 4 to 6 hourly. Maximum daily dose: 6 tablets (24 mg) in any 24 hours Elderly: The elderly are more likely to experience neurological anticholinergic effects. Consideration should be given to using a lower daily dose (e.g. a maximum of 12 mg in any 24 hours). Children aged 6 - 12 years: \u00bd tablet 4 to 6 hourly. Maximum daily dose: 3 tablets (12mg) in any 24 hours Not recommended for children under 6 years Populations Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should seek doctor's advice prior to taking this medicine. (See Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Piriton tablets are contra-indicated in patients who are hypersensitive to antihistamines or to any of the tablet ingredients. The anticholinergic properties of chlorphenamine are intensified by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Piriton Tablets is therefore contra-indicated in patients who have been treated with MAOIs within the last fourteen days. Chlorphenamine, in common with other drugs having anticholinergic effects, should be used with caution in epilepsy; raised intra-ocular pressure including glaucoma; prostatic asthma; hepatic impairment; renal impairment. Children and the elderly are more likely to experience the neurological anticholinergic effects and paradoxical excitation (eg. increased energy, restlessness, nervousness). Avoid use in elderly patients with confusion. The anticholinergic properties of chlorphenamine may cause drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision and psychomotor impairment in some patients which may seriously affect ability to drive and use machinery. Concurrent use with drugs which cause sedation such as anxiolytics and hypnotics may cause an increase in sedative effects, therefore medical advice should be sought before taking chlorphenamine concurrently with these medicines. The effects of alcohol may be increased and therefore concurrent use should be avoided. Should not be used with other antihistamine containing products, including antihistamine containing cough and cold medicines. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine, Keep out of sight and reach of children. Concurrent use of chlorphenamine and hypnotics or anxiolytics may cause an increase in sedative effects, concurrent use of alcohol may have a similar effect therefore medical advice should be sought before taking chlorphenamine concurrently with these medicines. Chlorphenamine inhibits phenytoin metabolism and can lead to phenytoin toxicity. The anticholinergic effects of chlorphenamine are intensified by MAOIs (see Contra-indications). Pregnancy There are no adequate data from the use of chlorphenamine maleate in pregnant women. The potential risk for humans is unknown. Use during the third trimester may result in reactions in the newborn or premature neonates. Not to be used during pregnancy unless considered essentially by a physician. Lactation Chlorphenamine maleate and other antihistamine may inhibit lactation and may be secreted in breast milk. Not to be used during lactation unless considered essential by a physician The anticholinergic properties of chlorphenamine may cause drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision and psychomotor impairment, which can seriously hamper the patients' ability to drive and use machinery. The following convention has been utilised for the classification of the frequency of adverse reactions: very common (>1/10), common (>1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (>1/1000 <1/100), rare (>1/10,000 to <1/1000) and very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Adverse reactions identified during post-marketing use with chlorphenamine are listed below. As these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, the frequency of some reactions is unknown but likely to be rare or very rare: | | System Organ Class | | Adverse Reaction | | Frequency | | Nervous system disorders* | | Sedation, somnolence | | Very common | | Disturbance in attention, abnormal coordination, dizziness headache | | Common | | Eye disorders | | Blurred Vision | | Common | | Gastrointestinal disorders | | Nausea, dry mouth | | Common | | Vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia | | Unknown | | Immune system disorders: | | Allergic reaction, angioedema, anaphylactic reactions | | Unknown | | Metabolism and nutritional disorders | | Anorexia | | Unknown | | Blood and lymphatic system disorders | | Haemolytic anaemia, blood dyscrasias | | Unknown | | Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders | | Muscle twitching, muscle weakness | | Unknown | | Psychiatric disorders | | Confusion*, excitation*, irritability*, nightmares*, depression | | Unknown | | Renal and urinary disorders | | Urinary retention | | Unknown | | Skin and subcutaneous disorders | | Exfoliative dermatitis, rash, urticaria, photosensitivity | | Unknown | | Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders | | Thickening of bronchial secretions | | Unknown | | Vascular disorders | | Hypotension | | Unknown | | Hepatobiliary disorders | | Hepatitis, including jaundice | | Unknown | | Ear and labyrinth disorders | | Tinnitus | | Unknown | | Cardiac disorders | | Palpitations, tachycardia, arrythmias | | Unknown | | General disorders and administration site conditions | | Fatigue | | Common | | Chest tightness | | Unknown *Children and the elderly are more likely to experience the neurological anticholinergic effects and paradoxical excitation (eg. increased energy, restlessness, nervousness). Reporting of suspected adverse reactionsReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme at:www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store. Symptoms and signs The estimated lethal dose of chlorphenamine is 25 to 50mg/kg body weight. Symptoms and signs include sedation, paradoxical excitation of the CNS, toxic psychosis, convulsions, apnoea, anticholinergic effects, dystonic reactions and cardiovascular collapse including arrhythmias. Treatment Management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centres where available. Symptomatic and supportive measures should be provided with special attention to cardiac, respiratory, renal and hepatic functions and fluid and electrolyte balance. If overdosage is by the oral route, treatment with activated charcoal should be considered provided there are no contraindications for use and the overdose has been taken recently (treatment is most effective if given within an hour of ingestion). Treat hypotension and arrhythmias vigorously. CNS convulsions may be treated with i.v. diazepam. Haemoperfusion may be used in severe cases. ATC Code R06AB02 Chlorphenamine is a potent antihistamine (H1-antagonist). Antihistamines diminish or abolish the actions of histamine in the body by competitive reversible blockade of histamine H1-receptor sites on tissues. Chlorphenamine also has anticholinergic activity. Antihistamines act to prevent the release of histamine, prostaglandins and leukotrienes and have been shown to prevent the migration of inflammatory mediators. The actions of chlorphenamine include inhibition of histamine on smooth muscle, capillary permeability and hence reduction of oedema and wheal in hypersensitivity reactions such as allergy and anaphylaxis. Chlorphenamine is well absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract, following oral administration. The effects develop within 30 minutes, are maximal within 1 to 2 hours and last 4 to 6 hours. The plasma half-life has been estimated to be 12 to 15 hours. Chlorphenamine is metabolised to the monodesmethyl and didesmethyl derivatives. About 22% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. No additional data of relevance. Lactose Maize Starch Yellow Iron Oxide (E172) Magnesium Stearate Purified Water None reported. 3 years.
