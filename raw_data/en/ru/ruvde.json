Much of this growth recently has been driven due to the interest in CBD containing products (1). Natural based cosmetic oils and waxes are important ingredients used in personal care formulations to structure formulations and impart a smooth, soft, moisturized feel to skin or hair. Some have also been shown to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, soothe skin, reduce TEWL, reduce sebum and have antimicrobial activity. All-natural cosmetic oils, using no chemical modification in their production, are comprised of liquid oils, waxes, butters, unsaponifiables, and essential oils. Oils containing high levels of unsaturation are normally liquid and are prone to oxidation. Solid waxes or butters contain higher levels of saturated C12-30 chains and have melting points greater than ~40\u00b0C. Plant based oils/waxes/butters are normally mixtures of hydrocarbons, triglycerides, esters, and alcohols depending on the type of plant and processing used. Plant unsaponifiables are ingredients that do not hydrolyze or saponify when reacted with caustic. [alcohols](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/Product/search?k=Alcohols&sug=1&st=1&utm_source=KnowledgeCenter&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=2021pcc&utm_content=naturalcosmetics), and [triterpenoids](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=triterpenoids&st=1&utm_source=KnowledgeCenter&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=2021pcc&utm_content=naturalcosmetics). Carotenoids are highly colored antioxidants commonly found in plants that are potent scavengers of singlet oxygen free radicals. It is believed they are the important antioxidants that protect skin from free radical attack. The main sterols found in plants are [beta sitosterol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=beta+sitosterol&st=1&utm_source=KnowledgeCenter&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=2021pcc&utm_content=naturalcosmetics), [campesterol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=campesterol&st=1&utm_source=KnowledgeCenter&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=2021pcc&utm_content=naturalcosmetics), and [stigmasterol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=stigmasterol&st=1&utm_source=KnowledgeCenter&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=2021pcc&utm_content=naturalcosmetics). These are similar to sterols like cholesterol needed to produce biologically active sterols in the body. Many have also been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity and help repair the skin barrier function (3,4). Essential oils are concentrated hydrophobic liquids containing volatile chemical compounds from plants. Essential oils are called volatile oils, ethereal oils, or as the oil of the plant from which they were extracted (ex. oil of clove). An essential oil contains the characteristic fragrance of the plant from which it is derived, and many are used to provide a natural scent to products (2). Additionally, many essential oils have antioxidant, antimicrobial, sebum reducing, and skin soothing properties. Commonly used plant derived liquid emollients [Castor oil](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=castor+oil&st=1&utm_source=KnowledgeCenter&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=2021pcc&utm_content=naturalcosmetics)(Ricinus communis seed oil) is obtained by pressing the seeds of the castor oil plant and is one of the most important seed oils produced globally with over 3,000 claimed uses. Castor oil is a very stable, pure, triglyceride which contains over 90% Ricinoleic acid. Castor oil is most frequently used in lipsticks due to its excellent pigment dispersing, shine, and lubricating properties. It is one of the most popular of all-natural based emollients currently sold. [Squalane](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=Squalane&st=1&utm_source=KnowledgeCenter&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=2021pcc&utm_content=naturalcosmetics)is a very popular methyl branched hydrocarbon emollient used in skin care products. It was originally extracted from shark liver oil but currently is produced from olive oil and by fermentation. Squalane has been shown clinically to reduce TEWL, increase cell turnover, and significantly reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. [Jojoba oil](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=Jojoba+oil&st=1&utm_source=KnowledgeCenter&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=2021pcc&utm_content=naturalcosmetics)(Simmondsia chinensis seed oil) is a stable, liquid wax ester produced from a shrub native to southern Arizona, southern California, and northwestern Mexico. Jojoba oil has an excellent skin feel and is quickly absorbed into skin. Recently in vivo skin efficacy tests have demonstrated that a 10% jojoba oil containing cream provided a significant improvement in skin radiance and a reduction in sebum versus a placebo cream containing 10% capric/caprylic triglyceride. It also was shown to significantly improve skin and lip hydration (5).
