Purpose . To provide policy and guidance for controlling tuberculosis (TB) among Department of t he Navy (DON) military personnel and Military Sealift Command (MSC) civilian mariners (CIVMAR) . Tuberculosis control efforts for other populations (e.g., health care workers, DON civilians, eligible beneficiaries, inmates of detention and confinement facilities, etc.) are to be guided by and consistent with current U.S. Centers of Disease Control guidance and app licable Federal laws. Enclosure (1) provides a list of references. 2. Cancellation . BUMEDINST 6224.8A . 3. Scope . Per reference (a) , this directive applies to all DON Commands. 4. Background . The threat of TB is a significant public health concern in the naval s ervice. Although being a military member or CIVMAR is not in itself a risk factor for tuberculosis, particular situations imposed by military service may present an increased risk of infection. TB continues to occur among military personnel. Navy and Marine Corps personnel often operate in areas of the world where there is a high prevalence of TB infection. Close working and living quarters in military and shipboard operations demand vigilant public health measures to prevent the acquisition and spread of TB. Early detection and respiratory isolation of persons infected with TB significantly reduces the chance that infection will sp read to others. BUMEDINST 6224.8B 21 Feb 2013 5. Program Summary . Our strategy to control TB is : a. To promptly detect, treat , and report persons who have developed clinically active TB . b. To protect persons in close contact with patients diagnosed with infectious TB . c. To prevent TB disease in military personnel, MSC CIVMAR's , DON employees, and certain health care beneficiaries through targeted testing and effective treatment for latent TB infection, as described in enclosures (2 ) through ( 5). d. That DON contractors, especially in the deployment setting, should also be assessed for TB control program compliance either through contracting oversight or direct care where applicable. Contract health care workers should be screened for risk of exposure to TB, as specified in their contract. Language addressing the initial s creening and subsequent testing or screening will be added in contracts for health care services awarded after date of this instruction . 6. Recording. For medical record and information gathering purposes we provide NAVMED 6224/7, Initial Tuberculosis Exposure Risk Assessment , NAVMED 6224/8, Interim Tuberculosis Exposure Risk Assessment , and NAVMED 6224/9, M onthly E valuation for P atients R eceiving Treatm ent for Latent Tuberculosis Infection.

Tuberculosis ( TB) Testing On Entry Into Naval Service . Skin and blood tests are available for identifying individuals asymptomatically infected with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex bacteria that cause TB. Appropriate testing identifies persons with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). These individuals are at increased risk for developing active TB, and should be treated to reduce their risk for developing active disease and transmitting TB infection to others. Pers onnel diagnosed with LTBI based on a positive skin or blood test and without active disease are not infectious. a. All Navy and Marine Corps accessions, and all individuals beginning employment as Civilian Mariner s (CIVMARs ) for the Military Sealift Command ( MSC) must be tested for LTBI unless there is documentation of previous TB infection as described below. b. Individuals with a history of TB, a positive T uberculosis S kin T est (TST) or other LTBI test, or treatment for LTBI must provide any available medical documentation of clinical evaluations, hospitalizations, diagnoses, and treatments. Documentation includes copies of pertinent medical records, treatment records, or a physician 's statement on letterhead stationery. Pertinent informa tion should be transcribed into the medical record. If such documentation is not available, follow the testing procedures in this instruction. 2. Screening After Receipt of Permanent Change of St ation Orders to a Commissioned Vessel . All personnel must be screened for LTBI (or clinically evaluated for persons with prior LTBI diagnosis) during their operational suitability screening. Positive screens using NAVMED 6224/8 should proceed to testing (prior TST reactors excepted). Screening or testing documented within 6 months prior to reporting aboard a commissioned vessel is acceptable. Once reporting aboard, paragraph 3 applies. 3. LTBI Screening At Times Other Than Entry a. Screen all active duty and Reserve personnel during the Periodic Health Assessment, using form NAVMED 6224/8, to determine their TB exposure history and risk of acquiring TB. Individuals answering \"yes\" to one or more questions on this form are deemed to be at increased risk. CIVMARs will be screened or tested annually or during their periodic physical examination at the directi on of MSC Fleet Surgeon based on their different risk profile in comparison to uniformed service members. Subsequently, perform LTBI skin tests or blood tests only on individuals deemed to be at risk of acquiring TB. Additional screening and subsequent testing may be done: (1) As directed by combata nt commanders. (2) As part of a co ntact or outbreak investigation. (3) If clinically indicated by an individual practitioner based on history or physical (clinic visit, Periodic Health Assessment, Post- deployment Health Assessment, etc .). Enclosure (2) BUMEDINST 6224.8B 21 Feb 2013 (4) As recommended by the cognizant Navy Environmental Preventive Medicine Unit (NAVENPVNTMEDU) . b. Results from this additional screening and testing can be used to meet other LTBI assessment requ irements if performed within 6 months of the requirement date. 4. Screening for Persons or Units Embarking on a Commissioned Vessel . Perform TB screening on all personnel prior to or within 6 months of arrival on a commissioned vessel. 5. Testing Before Separation From Naval Service . It is no longer required that all personnel must have LTBI test results (o r be clinically evaluated for persons with prior LTBI diagnosis) documented within the 6 months prior to separation or retirement. 6. LTBI Testing Guidance a. TST (1) Tuberculin, Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) . The approved tuberculin skin test material for the routine Mantoux test is the Tween -80-stabilized intermediate strength PPD (5 TU equivalent) available as NSN 6505- 00-105-0102. The preferred product should be Tubersol from Pasteur vice Aplisol from Parkedale Pharmaceuticals. However, if Tubersol is not available, Aplisol can still be used. (2) Recording Administration . Record the following information on the NAVMED 6230/4, Adult Immunization Record, NAVMED 6230/5 , Child Immunization Reco rd, and in an authorized Navy electronic medical information system, either Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application ( AHLTA ), Medical Readiness Reporting System ( MRRS ) or Shipboard Non -Tactical ADP Program (SNAP) Automated Medical System (SAMS ). Include date administered, type , and strength of tuberculin, manufacturer, lot number, and route of administration. (3) Measurement . The TST reaction must be read within 48 to 72 hours after PPD administration. Measure induration to the neare st whole millimeter (mm). If a person returns more than 72 hours after TST placement, record the result as \"Not Read\" and apply a TST on the opposite forearm. If the person does not return at all, enter \"Not Read\" on the appropriate forms, recall the per son and administer another TST. (4) Recording Result . Enter TST test result in mm of induration on NAVMED 6230/4 or NAVMED 6230/5 and enter into the authorized electronic medical information system, either AHLTA, MRRS or SAMS. If there is no induration, as \"0 mm\" or \"zero mm.\" A TST record is not complete without clear documentation of all required data elements and entry into an authorized electronic immunization tracking system for electronic data storage and reporting. 2 Enclosure (2) BUMEDINST 6224.8 B 21 Feb 2013 b. Blood Assay for M. tuberculosis (BAMT) Infection (1) A U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved BAMT, QuantiFERON\u00ae -TB Gold (QFT -G), is available as a diagnostic aid for M. tuberculosis infection. QFT -G testing is approved for use in all circumstances in which the TST is used. QFT -G is designed for use in place of, not in addition to, a T ST. Reference (e) offers guidance for the use and interpretation of BAMT. (2) A positive QFT -G result should prompt the same public health and medical interventions as a positive TST reaction. As with the TST, QFT -G does not discriminate between LTBI and active TB, so all persons with a positive QFT -G test should be evaluated for active TB before L TBI is diagnosed. As with a negative TST result, a negative QFT -G result should not be used alone to exclude M . tuberculosis infection in those with symptoms or signs suggestive of TB disease. (3) Recording Result. As with the TST, QFT -G results must b e recorded in detail in the medical record. Include the date of the blood draw, result in specific units, the concentration of cytokine measured, and the laboratory interpretation (positive, negative, or indeterminate). 7. Significant LTBI Conversion Ra te a. Based on historical TST results associated with routine (non- targeted) screening, the rate of newly -identified LTBI converters is normally no more than one to two percent of personnel tested per year in most Navy and Marine Corps settings. If the rate of newly identified converters is two times greater than the expected baseline conversion rate of the command among any group tested, contact the cognizant NAVENPVNTMEDU for specific guidance. b. If there is a concern that TSTs have been improperly administered or read, consider retesting, but do not ignore a positive TST. Contact the cognizant NAVENPVNTMEDU for LTBI testing and risk assessment guidance. 8. Special Situations a. Previous Bacillus Calmette Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunization . TSTs can be administered to persons who have previously received BCG immunization. A positive TST reaction in BCG - immunized individuals should be regarded as indicative of TB infection. These individuals must be evaluated for active TB infection prior to receiving treatment for LTBI. b. False Negative TST results . False negative tests can occur because of specific immunosuppression due to TB infection or disease, general immunosuppression due to t he presence of immune system compromising conditions or receipt of immunosuppressive medication, or when a TST is administered within a short period after receiving parenteral live - 3 Enclosure (2) BUMEDINST 6224.8B 21 Feb 2013 attenuated virus vaccines. A TST may be placed on the same day parenteral live-attenuated virus vaccines are given or at least 4 weeks later. Where compliance with the live virus vaccination window proves problematic, consider QFT -G. c. Pregnancy . TSTs are both safe and reliable throughout pregnancy and should be administe red as appropriate. d. TST \"Allergy .\" If a TST result is thought to be consistent with an allergic reaction, subsequent TS T placement should be deferred until a full evaluation can be performed by an allergist/immunologist. Contact the cognizant NAV ENPVNTMEDU for further LTBI screening guidance. e. Two-Step Procedure . Do not use the two- step procedure for recruit or officer accession screening or other active duty screening programs. It is most useful in reducing the likelihood of interpreting a boosted response as evidence of a new infection such as in older hea lth care workers entering a military treatment facility screening program. f. Positive TST . Service members with a posit ive TST undergoing further evaluation should not deploy until the evaluations are completed and all results have been reported (for example, chest X -ray, Mycobacterium cultures, etc.) . 4 Enclosur e (2) BUMEDINST 6224.8 B 21 Feb 2013 EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF NEW POSITIVE TESTS FOR LATENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION 1. Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) Interpretation . Evaluate all individuals with a TST induration 5 mm to determine if their test is positive based on risk factors outlined in Table 1 below. In addition, an increase in reaction size of 10 mm or more, within a three -year period, also is considered a skin test conversion or positive test indicative of a recent infection with tuberculosis (TB). Service accessions and individuals assigned to operational military forces, including shipboard personnel, without risk factors for acquiring TB a re in low risk group in Table 1, so their TST is considered possible only for indurations > 15 mm. If the individual does not meet the criteria for a positive TST reaction based on risk factors in Table 1 or clinical assessment, continue routine Latent Tu berculosis Infection (LTBI ) screening per enclosure (2 ). TABLE 1 Criteria for D etermining a P ositive TST R eaction High Risk : Reaction 5 mm of Induration Is Considered Positive In: Medium Risk : Reaction 10 mm of Induration Is Considered Positive In: Low Risk Reaction 15 mm of Induration Is Considered Positive In: Recent close contacts of active TB disease patients Persons with fibrotic or other changes on chest radiograph consistent with prior TB Patients suspected of having active TB disease Recent immigrants (i.e., within the last 5 years) from high TB prevalence countries Mycobacteriology laboratory personnel Persons with clinical conditions that place them at increased risk Persons with no risk factors for TB 2. Initial Evaluation: Persons with Positive Blood Assay for M. tuberculosis (BAMT) or TST . Ensure all persons newly identified as having a positive TST and all persons with a positive BAMT are evaluated by a medical officer, nurse practitioner, physician's assistant , or indepe ndent duty corpsman to determine if they have active TB disease. a. The evaluation of positive tests must include : (1) An appropriate history and physical examination . Use NAVMED 6224/7, Initial Tuberculosis Exposure Risk Assessment. Those creating encounter templates in AHLTA should use enclosure (5 ) as a guide and select ICD -9- M code V74.1 \"Screening Exam for P ulmonary Tuberculosis.\" Enclosure (3) BUMEDINST 6224.8 B 21 Feb 2013 (2) Chest X -rays. Chest x -rays should be examined for fibrotic changes consistent with old TB infection and for any signs of active TB. Pregnant women also should have active TB ruled out with chest x -rays using appropriate shielding. b. Enclosure (5) contains of a list of consultants that providers should contact if they have questions about the evaluation and treatment of persons with positive tests. 3. Management of Individuals with a New Positive BAMT or TST Reaction . An individual with a new positive BAMT or TST result that meets one of the criteria for a positive TST reaction listed in Table 1 must be managed accordingly. a. Rule out active TB . This assessment can be done concurrently with the initial evaluation in paragraph 2 above for new reactors. Suspect active TB if the individual has signs and symptoms of a clinically manifest infection or chest x -ray changes consistent with active TB. A person with suspected active disease should be masked and isolated immediately and then referred to an appropriate provider at a medical treatment facility for evaluation, diagnosis, and initial treatment. b. LTBI treatment . If active TB is ruled out and the individual meets the criterion for LTBI, isoniazid (INH) treatment shall be initiated unless medically contraindicated. INH 5 mg/kg (300 mg max) daily for 9 months is the preferred treatment regimen to accomplish 270 daily doses within 12 months. INH 15 mg/kg (900 mg max) twice weekly for 9 months is an alternate regimen that may be used only in combination with directly observed t herapy (DOT). For drug regimens other than INH, consult with a TB specialist listed in enclosure ( 5). Whenever it is certain or probable that an individual acquired their TB infection from a person with INH - resistant or multiple drug resistant TB, consul t the cognizant Navy Environmental Preventive Medicine Unit or a specialist listed in enclosure ( 5) to determine the appropriate LTBI treatment. Management and treatment of a pregnant patient with LTBI should be done in consultation with the patient's obs tetric provider. (1) Baseline laboratory testing . Baseline laboratory testing is not routinely indicated for patients at the start of LTBI treatment. be performed on those whose initial evaluation suggests an elevated risk for liver disease or INH -induced hepatoxicity. (2) Laboratory monitoring . Routine laboratory monitoring is necessary for those individuals whose baseline liver function tests are abnormal, and for those who are at risk for liver disease. Consider withholding INH if a patient's transaminase levels exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal. (3) Clinical monitoring . Monthly follow up of individuals receiving therapy for LTBI must be conducted until treatment is completed. The health care provider will evaluate patient compliance, possible side effects, and indications of active TB and do cument monthly valuations 2 Enclosure (3 ) BUMEDINST 6224.8 B 21 Feb 2013 on NAVMED 6224/9, Monthly Evaluation of Patients Receiving Therapy for Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) . Those creating encounter templates in AHLTA should use NAVMED 6224/9 as a guide select ICD -9-M code V68.1 \"issue of repeat prescriptions.\" Clinical monitoring is indicated for all patients, including physical assessment to check for signs of hepatit is or other adverse effects. Counsel patients on potential adverse drug reactions that may occur with their drug therapy, when to discontinue medication(s), and when to report for prompt medical evaluation. If any question of adverse drug reaction or act ive tuberculosis disease results from clinical monitoring, refer the patient to a medical officer as soon as possible. (4) DOT . Whenever feasible, DOT is the recommended mechanism to assure LTBI treatment compliance. DOT should be used for persons who are at very high risk for developing active TB and who are at high risk of non- adherence. It is especially appropriate when a household member is on directly observed therapy for active disease. 4. Previous Positive LTBI Test a. If a person gives an undocumented history of a positive BAMT or TST without documentation of an adequate course of treatment for LTBI or active TB, perform a BAMT or TST. If the person's BAMT is positive or if the TST reaction is 5 mm of induration, proceed as per paragraph 1 above. b. If a person has a credible documented past positive TST or BAMT, do not perform another LTBI test. Document whether the individual received an adequate course of treatment for LTBI or active TB. If the individual did not receive an adequate course of therapy for LTBI, manage per paragraph 3 above. 5. Patient Education . The patient must be educated about the implications of his or her BAMT or TST results, the benefits and risks of LTBI treatment, and the potential signs of an adverse drug effect. The necessity for strict adherence to the prescribed course of treatment in the absence of untoward side effects must be strongly emphasized throughout the course of treatment. Document patient education and counseling on the SF 600, \"Medical Record Chronological Record of Medical Treatment .\" 6. Completion of Treatment for LTBI . Document successful completion of appropriate LTBI treatment regimen in the medical record. No additional LTBI testing or chest radiograph is required unless otherwise indicated. 7. Missed Doses or Interrupted LTBI Treatment . Persons on treatment for LTBI often miss doses. Do not restart the 9- month daily Isoniazid ( INH) regimen if at least 270 doses of INH can be administered within a 12- month period. If treatment has been interrupted for more than 2 months, patients must be examined to exclude active TB disease. Clinicians should consider the use of DOT to ensure adhe rence to LTBI treatment regimens. 3 Enclosure (3) BUMEDINST 6224.8 B 21 Feb 2013 8. Continuity of Care for LTBI . All naval service beneficiaries who transfer from the treating health care facility or leave the military service before completing a course of treatment for LTBI must be counseled on the need for continued treatment, and counseling must be documented on NAVMED 6224/ 9, Monthly Evaluation for Patients Receiving Treatment for Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) . a. The treating medical department shall contact the gaining medical departments about all transferring members currently receiving treatment for LTBI. b. The transferring medical department shall ensure the member has enough medication to continue LTBI treatment enroute to the gaining medical department. Gaining medical departments shall continue therapy as stated in paragraph 3b above. c. Members leaving active service are eligible for continued TB treatment and follow up care at Veteran's Administration (VA) facilities by calling the local VA prior to separation or discharge. Providers shall make initial arrangements for the member's follow up, either at a military facility (if member is still eligible for care), at the VA facility closest to their home, or through alternative options such as local health departments or private providers . 4 Enclosure (3 ) BUMEDINST 6224.8 B 21 Feb 2013 TUBERCULOSIS CONTACT INVESTIGATION RESPONSIBILITY, INITIAL TUBERCULOSIS PATIENT MANAGEMENT , AND REQUIRED REPORTS 1. Program Summary . Upon discovery of a suspected or confirmed case of active tuberculosis (TB) in a service member assigned to Navy or Marine Corps operating forces (Navy and Military Sealift Command ships, aircraft squadrons, Marine operating forces, construction battalion detachments, and naval special warfare personnel), the commanding officer or officer in charge must notify the cognizant Navy Environmental Preventive Medicine Units (NAVENPVTMEDU) (see enclosure (5 )), and the local health department as soon as possible. The cognizant NAVENPVTMEDU will conduct a TB contact investigation, assisted by command medical personnel, based on the CDC guidelines in reference (e). Upon completion of the TB contact investigation, the NAVENPVTMEDU will provide an investigation report to the Comma nd, cognizant Fleet / Type Commander Surgeon, and Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center ( NMCPHC ). The servicing medical treatment facility ( MTF ) will conduct TB contact investigations on persons not assigned to naval operational forces. The MTF must notify the cognizant NAVENPVNTMEDU upon initiating a contact investigation and provide the completed investigat ion report to the Navy Medicine r egion and N MCPHC . 2. Contact Investigation Responsibility . The commanding officer and officer in charge of th e individual diagnosed with active TB disease is responsible for ensuring the contact investigation is initiated rapidly and command support for the NAVENPVTMEDU's or MTF's public health interventions is maintained until the investigation is completed. Th e commanding officer and officer in charge is responsible for the continuation and completion of contact investigations initiated among personnel assigned to or transferred from their command. Personnel transferring from the command during the course of a contact investigation must have appropriate documentation in their medical record, and the receiving command must be notified of their status. Personnel who are enrolled in a contact investigation but are separating from the Service before the 8 -10 week repeat Tuberculosis Skin Test /Blood Assay for M. tuberculosis Infection , must be identified to the local public health department for follow -up testing. 3. Protection of Non- Infected Persons in Spaces Occupied by Patients with Infectious Tuberculosis Disease . Surgical masks are designed to prevent respiratory secretions of the person wearing the mask from entering the air. Particulate respirators are designed to filter air before it is inhaled by the person wearing the respirator. Patients with suspected or known active TB should wear surgical masks, when indicated, to minimize aerosolization of respiratory secretions. They should not wear a particulate respirator, with or without an exhalation valve. Precautions for pre -MTF or shipboard management of persons with known or suspected active TB include: a. Transfer persons with known or suspected active TB to a MTF as soon as practical. b. Pending and during transfer, persons with known or suspected active TB should wear a surgical mask at all times. Every attempt should be made to remove a potentially active TB case from shared berthing spaces or medical wards until the individual can be transferred to a MTF. Enclosure (4) BUMEDINST 6224.8 B 21 Feb 2013 c. Medical department personnel must wear particulate respirators (N95 minimum) when working in rooms or spaces containing a person with known or suspected active TB. d. Visitors to rooms or spaces containing a person with known or suspected TB should wear a particulate respirator. W hen this is not possible, visitors should wear a surgical mask and minimize time spent in the room/space. All visitors must be made aware that the surgical mask does not provide complete protection from airborne infectious particles. 4. Tuberculosis and Air Travel . Assessing the risk of TB transmission on board aircraft presents public health challenges . Emp loy the guidance in reference (h ) when conducting TB contact investigations with suspected transmission within aircraft cabins. 5. Reporting Re quirements . A Medical Event Report must be submitted for all new cases of active TB or suspected new cases of active TB by the ship or station within 24 hours. Civilian or other public health authorities must be notified, as appropriate. Submit a second Medical Event Report in active TB cases when the disease is either ruled in or out. 2 Enclosure (4) BUMEDINST 6224.8 B 21 Feb 2013 LIST OF TUBERCULOSIS CONSULTANTS Officer in Charge Navy Environmental and Preventive Medicine Unit Number 2 1887 Powhatan Street http://navymedicine.med.navy.mil/nepmu2/ E-mail: nepmu2norfolkthreatassessment@med.navy.mil Officer in Charge Navy Environmental and Preventive Medicine Unit Number 5 Naval Station Box 368143 3235 Albacore site: http://www.nepmu5.med.navy.mil E-mail: nepmu5@nepmu5.med.navy.mil Officer in Charge Navy Environmental and Preventive Medicine Unit Number 6 1215 North Road Pearl http://nepmu6.med.navy.mil/ E-mail: nepmu6admin@med.navy.mil Commanding Officer Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center 620 John Paul Jones Circle Ste 1100 Portsmouth, VA 23708- 2103 DSN: Naval Medical Center Pulmonary Diseases Division 34800 Bob Wilson Drive San Diego, CA 92134- 5000 BUMEDINST 6224.8 B 21 Feb 2013 Naval Medical Center Infectious Diseases Division 620 John Paul Jones Circle Portsmouth, VA 23708 Medical Center Infectious Diseases Division 34800 Bob Wilson Drive Suite 201 San Diego, CA 92134- DSN: http://www -nmcsd.med.navy.mil/index.cfm Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Pulmonary Diseases Division 8901 Wisconsin Avenue Bethesda, MD 20889 x Naval Medical Center Pulmonary Disease D ivision 620 John Paul Jones Circle Portsmouth, VA Enclosure (5 ) Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Infectious Diseases Division 8901 Wisconsin Avenue Bethesda, MD 20889 Feb 2013 ACRONYMS AHLTA Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application AOR Area o f Responsibility BAMT Blood Assay for M. tuberculosis Infection BCG Bacillus Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin CIVMAR Civilian Mariner DON Department of the Navy DOT Directly Observed Therapy ICD-9 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision INH Isoniazid LTBI Latent Tuberculosis Infection MRRS Medical Readiness Reporting System MSC Military Sealift Command MTF Medical Treatment Facility NAVENPVTMEDU Navy Environmental Preventive Medicine Unit NMCPHC Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center PPD Purified Protein Derivative QFT -G QuantiFERON\u00ae -TB Gold SNAP SAMS Shipboard Program Automated Medical System TB Tuberculosis TST Tuberculosis Skin Test VA Veteran's Administration Enclosure (6) "}
