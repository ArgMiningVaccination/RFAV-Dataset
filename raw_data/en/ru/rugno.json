Homeopathy is a gentle and natural healing approach that can be used to treat a broad range of children's physical, behavioral, and emotional problems. Edmond Sarraf, MD, at Southern California Integrative Wellness Center has dedicated years to working with children and their parents, providing effective homeopathic treatment that gets to the heart of the problem. If you'd like to learn more about homeopathy, call the office in Los Angeles. Homeopathy is a system of natural health care that supports your body's innate ability to heal. The principal philosophy of homeopathy is that each patient is unique, and that their mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual health are all connected. Where traditional medical care sees a collection of symptoms and makes a diagnosis, homeopathic physicians look beyond the symptoms, find the true underlying cause of a health problem, and treat every aspect of the patient's life that's influencing the problem. For example, you can give your child an over-the-counter pain reliever to treat a headache, which is treating the symptom. But if their headache is triggered by school stress, sensitivity to bright lights, or an underlying physical problem like a strained neck, the headache will keep coming back until the real cause is identified and treated. It sounds simple when only a headache is involved, but the value of finding the underlying cause becomes more essential as your child's health issues become more complex. What Types of Health Problems Are Treated with Homeopathy Homeopathy can be used to treat the full range of children's health concerns. Homeopathic remedies are non-toxic, inexpensive, and they don't cause side effects that can occur when using traditional medications. Dr. Ed may use homeopathic remedies to treat health concerns such as: - Colds - Ear infections - Migraines - Sore throats - Asthma - Depression - Constipation - Sleep problems When Dr. Ed evaluates children for any physical, behavioral, or emotional problem, he takes the time to learn about the many aspects of their life, from their personality and eating habits to their environment and interactions with others. Every piece of information is needed to create a complete picture of the multiple issues potentially causing the problem. What are Homeopathic Remedies? Homeopathic medicines, called remedies, are made from natural sources, such as plants, minerals, milk, and other substances. Many remedies are available over the counter in pharmacies and health food stores, as well as online. When they're used as directed by Dr. Ed, they're completely safe for infants and children. These unique remedies are made by repeatedly diluting the specific substance. When a plant is used, it's first cleaned, then mixed with alcohol and water to make a tincture. Then the tincture is diluted, shaken, and diluted again. This is repeated numerous times because you only need a small amount of the remedy to stimulate your body's healing process.
