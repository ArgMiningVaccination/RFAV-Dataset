The main pathological changes are the degeneration of the substantia nigra striatum, lack of dopamine in the brain, causing clinical performance: static tremor, muscle rigidity, slow movement and abnormal posture. It is one of the worldwide medical problems, at present, modern medicine thinks that PD is an incurable and permanent disease. However, in my long-term clinical work, I have cured many cases of PD patients by using Xifengzhizhan pills and Xifenzhizhan capsules, and I have found and proved that Chinese Medicine can cure PD. Introduction According to the modern medical literature data collected, at present, due to the exact pathogeny of PD is not yet clear, Modern medicine mainly uses dopamine replacement therapy and dopamine receptor agonist symptomatic treatment for PD, which can improve symptoms, but cannot cure PD. There are no reports of complete cure of PD treated with Traditional Chinese Medicine alone. I use the Traditional Chinese Medicine compound Xifeng zhizhan pills and Xifengzhizhan capsules to treat Parkinson's disease, which can not only improve the clinical symptoms, but also cure Parkinson's disease, which is a major medical breakthrough. Case Selection and Treatment Methods All treated cases were Parkinson's disease patients who had been diagnosed by experts in neurology department of senior hospitals. According to the theory of TCM, Yin governs tranquility, Yang actively, Yin governs softness, Yang governs rigidity, combined with the main clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease, such as limb tremor and muscle stiffness, syndrome differentiation is , deficiency wind internal movement, so nourishing yin of Gan and Shen, and extinguishing wind should be the treatment principle. According to this rule, the Chinese herbal medicine with the right syndromes was selected, and the Chinese patent medicine Xifeng Zhichan pills and Xifeng Zhichan capsules were prepared. I used the Xifengzhizhan pills and Xifengzhizhan capsules to treat PD. Both Xifengzhichao Pills and Xifengzhichan Capsules are pure Chinese herbal compound preparations. The main components of Xifeng zhichan Pills white peony bidentata, etc. Xifengzhichan 9 grams each time, three times a day; Xifengzhichan Capsules 6 capsules each time, three times a day, Oral administration. In this article, only 10 typical cases from many cured PD patients were selected and reported as follows: Cases 1: Mr. Wang, 62 years old, a farmer of Xinmi city, Henan province.

Discussion According to the viewpoint of modern medicine, if a patient is definitely diagnosed as Parkinson's disease, it cannot be cured. If treated with Western medicine, only the symptoms can be improved and lifelong medication is needed. As the disease progresses, the quality of life of patients will be seriously reduced, even unable to take care of themselves. Late-stage patients may be fatal due to a variety of complications. However, traditional Chinese medicine treatment is not the same. Although it cannot be as immediate as western medicine, most of cases need take several months to begin to produce results, but TCM can not only gradually improve clinical symptoms, but also completely cure Parkinson's disease, which is the result that western medicine cannot achieve. The reason why Chinese medicine can cure Parkinson's disease is supposed to be the following aspects: Chinese medicine can eliminate the cause of Parkinson's disease, Although the etiology of Parkinson's disease is still unclear, from the follow-up of the cured patients, it was found that the patients had terminated treatment for many years and did not see the symptoms of Parkinson's disease again. Obviously, the etiology of Parkinson's disease has been cleared by traditional Chinese medicine. If the etiology persists, even after the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, the symptoms will disappear temporarily and the symptoms will reappear after the termination treatment. It can also be inferred that the etiology of Parkinson's disease can be eliminated by traditional Chinese medicine.[ [1](#1), [2](#2), [3](#3)]; Chinese medicine can reverse the process of degeneration of substantia nigra in brain, The main pathological change of Parkinson's disease is substantia nigra degeneration. Modern medicine believes that this degeneration process is irreversible, and my research confirms that this degeneration process is actually reversible, that is to say, the degeneration process is not one-way, but can be reversed gradually after the etiology is cleared in the course of traditional Chinese medicine treatment.[ [4](#4), [5](#5)]; Chinese medicine can repair the pathological changes of substantia nigra cells, Except for the necrotic nigral cells, the remaining pathological nigral cells can be gradually repaired under the action of traditional Chinese medicine until their morphology and structure are normal, [ [6](#6)]; Substantia nigra degeneration can lead to the decrease of dopamine in the brain. After the morphology and structure of the diseased cells are gradually restored, Chinese medicine can gradually restore the function of substantia nigra to make dopamine until it reaches normal completely [ [7](#7)]; Chinese medicine can eventually cure all the clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease after treatment one to two years [ [8](#8)]. So that patients with Parkinson's disease can recover. Otherwise, if the cause of Parkinson's disease persists, the degeneration of the substantia nigra cannot be reversed, and the dopamine production of the substantia nigra cannot be fully restored. The symptoms of Parkinson's disease are unlikely to disappear and the disease cannot be completely cured. In a word, the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine has a fundamental effect on Parkinson's disease, which brings hope for the recovery of Parkinson's disease patients. Parkinson's disease, a major and difficult disease in human medicine, has been conquered. The methods and drugs that can cure Parkinson's disease have been found. Parkinson's disease will no longer be an incurable lifelong disease. Conclusion In the past 28 years, more and more patients with Parkinson's disease have been cured by TCM. These cured cases of Parkinson's disease strongly prove that Parkinson's disease can be cured and TCM can cure Parkinson's disease.
