These safe, all-natural baby teething remedies really work to ease teething pain for good. Teething is no joke. It can turn even the most relaxed baby into a hot mess. Luckily, there are plenty of safe and effective natural teething remedies\u2014no ibuprofen required. Let's take a closer look. Here's a video! Baby Teething Remedy #1: Apply Cold and Pressure It's one of the older natural teething remedies in the book, but using cold and pressure to help baby's aching gums is an excellent teething remedy. Give baby safe, non-toxic objects that can be frozen and then used to chew on. The cold helps numb the area, and the pressure soothes inflamed gums. Here are some examples: - Frozen washcloths: Soak a small washcloth in water, wring out, then freeze for at least an hour. Let baby chew on the washcloth after it comes out of the freezer. - Frozen fruit or veggies: Put these foods in a mesh or [silicone](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=baby-products&field-keywords=Boppin+Baby+Food+Feeder&linkCode=ll2&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=c3f25a089641f5d79243a320592ee8d2) teether for small babies and freeze for at least an hour. For older babies, put a banana in the freezer for a tasty snack that's also one of the best natural teething remedies. - A cold spoon: Put a metal spoon in the fridge for at least 15 minutes, then give it to baby to gum. - [Natural teething biscuits:](https://mamanatural.com/how-to-make-healthy-teething-biscuits/) These biscuits are easy to make and don't contain questionable ingredients like the ones you buy in the store (even the organic ones!). They can be kept in the refrigerator for a cooler treat.

There are lots of options for teething toys that are also safe and non-toxic. - [Silicone teething rings](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=baby-products&field-keywords=Silicone+Teething+Ring&linkCode=ll2&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=b8f6e1664e8d48df349496651f2e9178): Made of safe silicone, rather than latex or plastic, this teether is a safe choice. - [Wooden teethers](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=wooden+teether&linkCode=ll2&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=543b91543ff27b30bb3bdb3adfab8449): What works for one baby may not work for the next, so if silicone and rubber don't do it, try a wooden teether. The texture might be just right for your baby. Just be sure to choose a brand that uses natural water-based sealants or food grade dyes. And be aware that some teethers need to be oiled or (bees)waxed before use. Sophie used to be the gold-standard when it came to natural teething remedies. But there's been controversy after some moms found mold inside their toys. Until the manufacturer solves this problem, we don't recommend this teether. Infant Teething Remedy #3: Use Teething Necklaces Teething necklaces for mom Another option is a [teething necklace for mom](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=silicone+teething+necklace&linkCode=ll2&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=473e7324648336c58e660e7f28211646). These necklaces are made of silicone and are great for baby to use while sitting in mom's lap or in a baby carrier. They also act as something for baby to fiddle with while she nurses.

Here are some ideas: - Rosehip: Packed with vitamin C and antioxidants, rosehip tea is great for boosting the immune system. Additionally, rosehip has been shown to contain [anti-inflammatory properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22762068). - Chamomile: Chamomile is one of the more popular natural teething remedies. It helps relax and soothe irritability. - Catnip: Catnip is said to calm irritable babies and help them rest. - Clove: Clove is a natural anesthetic and [has been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16530911) to work as well as benzocaine at relieving pain. How to use herbal teething remedies - Make a tea: Any of these herbs can be made into a tea, which can be used to dampen a washcloth before freezing. - Give as a beverage: To make a tea, boil water and steep 1 tsp of herbs in 10 ounces of water for 6-7 minutes. Let cool fully before serving to baby in a bottle or with a syringe. - Rub directly onto gums: To make an herbal infusion that can be rubbed directly onto the gums, place herbs in a small saucepan and cover with olive oil. Simmer on low for 4-6 hours. Strain and store in the refrigerator. Dab some cool oil onto baby's gums as needed. Baby Teething Remedy #5: Lower Inflammation Inflammation from teething [can stimulate nerves](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation#1) that cause pain, so reducing inflammation is one way you can help relieve baby's pain. - Try a low inflammation diet: If baby is [eating solids](https://mamanatural.com/5-signs-your-baby-is-ready-for-solid-food/), white foods, such as refined sugar and flour, potatoes, and even dairy, can cause inflammation. Focus on paleo-type foods\u2014a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, pastured meats, wild seafood, ample healthy fats (coconut, avocado, butter, and whole eggs). - Lower stress: Over time, stress can cause inflammation. Make sure baby is getting enough rest and eating healthy foods in addition to breastmilk or [formula](https://mamanatural.com/best-baby-formula/). - Balance blood sugar: Blood sugar swings (highs and lows) require the stress hormones to get involved to keep blood sugar stable (yes, even in babies and young children!). To keep blood sugar levels stable, focus on whole foods instead of highly processed snacks. Try to pair healthy carbs (like sweet potatoes and fruit) with protein and plenty of healthy fats. Baby Teething Remedies #6: Boost the Immune System There is some debate whether teething causes [fevers](https://mamanatural.com/baby-fever/) and colds by lowering the [immune system](https://mamanatural.com/natural-immune-boosters-for-kids/), or whether the two occurring at the same time is simply a coincidence. However, many parents do notice a runny nose or fever while baby is cutting teeth. At the very least, boosting the immune system can't hurt and can help prevent baby from dealing with double ailments. - Continue breastfeeding: Baby gets antibodies from your breastmilk to help build her immune system. - Give baby vitamin D: Many of us (and our babies) are vitamin D deficient because of too little time outside in direct sunlight, and [vitamin D plays](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166406/) an important role in supporting immune system function. Babies can take liquid vitamin D drops to get their levels up to a normal range. - Give [baby probiotics](https://mamanatural.com/baby-probiotics/): Since most of the [immune system resides in the gut](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515351/), building healthy gut flora is important for overall health and immunity. What about amber necklaces? If you've been around the natural mama circuit, you've likely seen those cute amber necklaces on infants. They are actually [amber necklaces](https://mamanatural.com/amber-teething-necklaces/). The idea is that baby's body heat triggers the baltic amber to release an oil that contains succinic acid, a natural anti-inflammatory. I no longer recommend amber teething necklaces for babies or children. While they are safe if used as instructed, too many babies are being injured as a result of improper use. For a sleep deprived mom, it's easy to forget to take the necklace off during car rides or nap time. This is why I urge moms: DO NOT TAKE THIS RISK. IT IS NOT WORTH IT. Rely on the other teething tools listed in this post. Teething Isn't Fun, But... Luckily there are lots of things you can do to help baby cope. Try some of these simple and natural teething remedies to help relieve pain at the gums. And don't underestimate the importance of overall health to alleviate excess inflammation. Soon, baby will be back to normal... until the [next tooth](https://mamanatural.com/baby-teeth-chart/) comes in! How About You? "}
