Veterinary herbal medicine looks at the patient in an entirely different way, while remembering that the body has the ability to heal itself and sometimes needs some extra tools to help it do so. The role of the herbalist in the healing process is to consider a whole patient and implement changes including diet, herbs, and supplementation. These changes help to foster an increased state of balance and health - thus maximizing the body's self-healing capabilities.
