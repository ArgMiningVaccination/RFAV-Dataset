They may also reduce the harsh effects of other medications, making them more tolerable on the body. Learn the best ones to take here. [COVID symptoms](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/general-health/respiratory-health/cold-flu-symptoms/) can be difficult to treat. The virus seems to affect each person differently. Also, not everyone responds well to over-the-counter medications. If you're looking for natural ways to help get you through a COVID diagnosis, consider adding [herbal medicine](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/natural-products/supplements/herbal-medicine-basics/) to your wellness routine. This article discusses the top 8 best herbs to help manage the symptoms of COVID and how they work. How Do Herbs Help With COVID Symptoms? Along with conventional treatment and vaccination, studies show that there are several [Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/traditional-chinese-medicine/) herbs that may help manage the symptoms of COVID. Pathology in TCM focuses on the specific syndromes of illness caused by pathogens. These can be categorized into Wind, Cold-Fire, Dampness, Phlegm, Qi (vital life force) Stagnation, Blood Clot, and Fluid Retention. According to Real Health Medical TCM Physician Brandon Yew, \"Once the specific pathogenic characteristics and traits are accurately identified, a TCM practitioner will prescribe herbs that target them and strengthen immunity. As the saying goes in TCM, if the [immune system ](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/general-health/energy-and-immunity/how-to-boost-immune-system-covid-19-vaccine/)is robust and sufficient, pathogens will not be able to enter and cause disease.\" It reflects what has been seen in the past two years: not everyone exposed to the virus gets infected. Also, not all infected people experience the same set of symptoms and the level of sickness. Some are even asymptomatic. Numerous studies are showing that many TCM herbal formulas help manage COVID symptoms. A recent 2021 study published in Frontiers of Pharmacology analyzed 58 different clinical trials with 2,773 COVID patients. It concluded that combining TCM herbs and Western medicine led to better outcomes than clinical treatment alone. This analytical study also revealed that using TCM herbs in conjunction with conventional Western medicine did not increase the risk of adverse reactions. We look at eight herbs that show efficacy in treating the different symptoms associated with a [COVID infection](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/general-health/energy-and-immunity/post-covid-syndrome/). Best Herbs To Help Manage COVID Symptoms TCM herbal formulas were created and developed with the concept of treating specific syndromes and imbalances that may have allowed the infection to take root in the first place.

As with all medicine, herbal or otherwise, these herbs will not necessarily work the same way for all COVID cases.
