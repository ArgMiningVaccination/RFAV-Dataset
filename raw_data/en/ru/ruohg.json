Read Full LicensePage 2/18Abstract Background Inclination towards Herbal Health Products (HHP) among patients and consumers are increasing, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to explore the various reasons behind the usage and recurring use of HHP among patients and consumers in Malaysia and understand the construct that motivates consumers to make a recurring purchase of HHPs. Methods To explore the purpose underlying usage of herbal health products (HHP) and its constructs of preferred choice and motivations for recurring use among Malaysians, this study employs a qualitative approach of in-depth interviews with 30 participants whom are consumers of any herbal health products in Malaysia. Participants were interviewed regarding their experiences and opinions using a semi-structured protocol, and data were transcribed and thematically analyzed. Results There are three main purpose of HHP usage among Malaysians, which are to treat illness, to control symptoms or pain related to illness and to prevent illness or promote general health. Among these identi\u0000ed purpose of usage, it is observed that usage of HHP for treatment are for non-chronic illnesses, whereas usage to control symptoms are for chronic illnesses. To explore the reasons further, it is observed that there are few constructs that make HHP the preferred choice among consumers which are perceived safety of the herbal products; its effectiveness to treat or control illness; perceived to have less side effects compared to conventional medicine; religious beliefs; and price worthiness of the product. Motivational constructs for repurchase of HHPs are perceived e\u0000cacy to health and well-being, reduction in prescribed medicine dosage and reasonable price. Conclusion In summary, there are myriad of reasons underlying the preferences towards the consumption of HHP among Malaysians and motivation for repurchase according to individual objectives. Awareness for safe use of HHP among consumers pertaining to the herbal ingredients needs to be promoted to align the purpose of use and its real e\u0000cacy towards illness management. Initiatives for safe use of HHP must be done in order to safeguard consumers from unnecessary health risks and adverse effects in HHP consumption. INTRODUCTIONPage 3/18Valued at close to USD $10 billion, the health supplement product market in Southeast Asia is continuously ascending due to the rise of health conscious consumers [1]. Additionally, according to Euromonitor, about 35.7% of total sales of health supplements in Malaysia in 2019, came from herbal or traditional products [2]. This corresponds to the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) Annual Report for year 2019, which reports that the highest new product registration is from natural health products (HHP) mounting to 994 applications from the total of 1324 applications. HHP encompasses both the traditional products and health supplements with 679 and 315 registrations for each product category. These numbers signi\u0000cantly display the vast amount of HHP products that are being marketed to consumers via different platforms, among others includes herbal drinks, supplement capsules and tablets as well as topical herbal formulations. Issues related to these products are its safety, e\u0000cacy, and quality of the products in the market. HHPs contain pharmacologically active molecules that might give therapeutic effects and might also potentially be able to cause adverse effects to human health. One example of toxicity associated with herbal use includes hepatotoxicity due to pyrrolizidine alkaloids containing plants [3]. Some herbs contain highly toxic cardiotoxins and neurotoxins [4]. Other adverse effects are caused by herb-drug interaction, between the herbal products consumed with a drug taken for any diseases at the same time. The complex nature of phytochemicals inside herbal products makes it di\u0000cult to assess its speci\u0000c herb-drug interaction [5]. Some plants have synergistic effects with certain antibiotics [6], and might cause certain effects if taken together. Even though there are adverse effects from consumption of these products which are reported, consumers still purchase herbal health products for some reasons. Currently in Malaysia, HHP's are regulated under NPRA, and guidelines are available for producers and manufacturers. NPRA have also introduced a guideline on therapeutic claims for herbal products in 2020, In the aspect of consumers, consumers can check the registration of HHPs in the Quest3+website, and make a report for products which give side-effects/adverse effects via the NPRA portal. Although there are both of these initiatives in monitoring safe use of HHP, most consumers are not even aware of the initiatives, and only a small portion of consumers self-check the products prior usage. An expert review from the pharmacologist perspective, suggests that awareness and education should be given to not only clinicians but also caregivers and consumers themselves about the risks associated with the use of HHPs and alternative medicine [7]. We should not stop individuals from trying these options, but consumers need to make informed decisions Balekundri & Mannur (2022) even suggest that traditional herbs and herbal products should have a stringent quality control to safeguard safety, e\u0000cacy, and potency of herbal products and protect consumers [8]. Besides regulatory initiatives, education on safe-use is also crucial to make sure consumers and healthcare providers are aware of the regulations and follow the necessary guidelines before consuming a HHP and make informed decisions [9, 10]. METHODOLOGYPage 4/18Data collection To explore the purpose underlying usage of herbal health products (HHP) and the constructs of preferred choice among Malaysians, a qualitative approach of in-depth interviews were applied for data collection. A semi-structured protocol was administered in the interviews to secure the main questions while allowing the researchers to develop additional questions in response to the answers provided by the participants. During the interviews, observations were also made on the consumers' routines in HHP product consumption and storing to triangulate data collection besides the interview. Participants were recruited using a purposeful sampling strategy that focuses on the need to obtain 'information rich cases', in other words, respondents who are willing to talk freely and openly about the speci\u0000c subject of interest. Respondents are consumers, which at least use one HHP throughout their life (n=30). Consents were recorded in a written document from each respondent and also verbally sought for again before each interview. Data is considered reliable when the answers given by respondents are exhaustive and data is saturated. To secure the trustworthiness of the analysis, they will be returned to the participants to check on the interpretation whether or not they \u0000t their actual meanings, de\u0000nitions or perceptions. Data analysis Data obtained from in-depth interviews are recorded and transcribed. The verbatim transcripts are thematically analysed using Atlas.Ti software, Version 22. Thematic analysis involves methodically reading through the verbatim transcripts and segmenting and coding the text into categories that highlights what the group discussed [11, 12]. Statements in the verbatim transcript are tagged in the software to appropriate identi\u0000ed themes. The themes are then assessed, compared and interpreted and any similarities and differences will be noted. The categories will be combined and assigned to major themes that provide a framework for usage of HHPs. This process is done continuously via workshops with all researchers until a consensus is achieved. RESULTS In this section, brief details of all of the participants are being reported, followed by main themes pertaining the purpose of use, reasons of the preferred use and constructs for recurring use. Brief descriptive analysis is being done for the sake of tabulating the mentioning of a particular theme, and guiding the elaboration of results. Quotations of the interviews were carefully selected to be representative for the themes and are meticulously translated by researchers to English from Bahasa Melayu. For each quote, the code of participants is mentioned, and names remain anonymous. Participants Demographic pro\u0000les of the in-depth interview participants (n=30) are described in Table 1. Participants are all consumers of at least one HHP and voluntarily participated in the study. Among the participants,Page 5/1860% were women. Participants were categorized into youth (18-35 years old), adults (35-60 years old) and senior citizens (above 60 years old). Percentage of youths and adults are balanced, which is 36.7% of youth participants and 40.0% of adult participants. Married participants are dominant (63.3%) compared to unmarried participants (30.0%). Among the pro\u0000les that were captured in the study is either participants consuming a single product or using multiple products (more than one product) simultaneously. More participants use more than one product simultaneously (56.7%). Table 1 Demographic pro\u0000ling of participants Frequency Percent Gender Male 12 40.0 Female 18 60.0 Total 30 100.0 Age 18-35 11 36.7 35-60 12 40.0 >60 2 6.7 Undisclosed 5 16.7 Total 30 100.0 Marital status Single 9 30.0 Married 19 63.3 Undisclosed 2 6.7 Total 30 100.0 Single product use Yes 13 43.3 No 17 56.7 Total 30 100.0 Purpose of use In the study, three different purposes of use were revealed, namely to treat illness, to control symptoms or pain related to the illness and to prevent illness or promote general health. Participants that use HHP to treat illness, mostly are for treatment of mild illnesses such as gastric, skin in\u0000ammation, sinusitis, and period pain. Whereas participants that use HHP to control symptoms or control pain related to the illness, are patients of high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic sinusitis, asthma, and acute knee pain. Promoting general health and using HHP as a supplement for the main reasons of increasing energy, increasing immune system, improving blood circulation and reducing stress. There are two participants whoPage 6/18highlighted that they use the HHP without knowing the purpose, and solely because it is recommended by their wife or family member. Among the three purposes identi\u0000ed in the study, both purposes except preventing illness, were nearly equal in the frequency of mentioning. What signi\u0000cantly was observed was that the mentioning of the purpose differs in regards to participants age, marital status and either using a single product or multiple products. This is clearly tabulated in Table 2 which shows the distribution of purpose of use among participants, strati\u0000ed to age groups, marital status and single product use. Table 2 Distribution of purpose of use among participants, according to age, marital status and single use of products.

Age wise, it is observed in this study that youths are more prone to consume HHP when they are diagnosed with a chronic or acute illness, and are using HHP as a sort of treatment to the illness itself or to control the symptoms or pain related to it. Among the illnesses being mentioned were high-blood pressure, sinusitis and nephrotic syndrome. One of the participants, which uses Nigella sativa sp. oil for treatment of his nephrotic syndrome mentioned that the use of HHP has helped him to treat the illnessPage 7/18and reduce the amount of prednisolone prescribed by his doctor from 10 pills per day to eventually only one pill a day. \"I've been sick for about \u0000ve years. After a year of taking doctor's medicine, it seems to be less effective. So after that, I used this product (showing the product). So far it's been about 3-4 years... As far as I can see and I have been using it for 3-4 years, I have seen the positive effects. For example, I used to take the doctor's medicine, the prednisolone medicine, 10 pills until now it has been reduced to only one pill a day. So, for me, there is a positive change there.\" (P011) Another youth participant who has been diagnosed with high blood pressure used HHP to help him manage with the effects of the illness. The participant used Eurycoma longifolia sp. dried roots which his grandmother bought at a traditional medicine local store. According to his explanation, the remedy was suggested by the store owner, and he drinks the decoction of the herb once daily. \"I was diagnosed with high blood pressure 2 years back, so I took doctor's medicine. It's been 2 years... My grandmother boils the Tongkat ali root (Eurycoma longifolia sp) and I drink it to treat my illness. I think it is quite effective because I can feel lighter after consuming the medicine (remedy). I still take the doctor's medicine, but using this (herbal remedy) helps me feel healthier and reduces my chest pain.\" (P027) The discussion among adults highlighted a different purpose which is the promotion of general health and well-being. It was mentioned eight times by adults, which is more than the other purposes. Among those mentioned regarding general health is about increasing the immune system and to maintain energy su\u0000cient for everyday routine. A women participant emphasized that she consumes a herbal drink made from several herbal ingredients to give her extra energy for everyday routine, and does not use it for treatment of any speci\u0000c illness. \"Before I consume this product, I easily feel tired, and drowsy.... sleepy, but after I use this product, I observe that my body feels fresher and more energetic. I use this for my health because I require a lot of energy. In the morning I always get up early to go to work and come back from work at night.... I have to manage home chores and o\u0000ce work. So, I really need this food (herbal juice) as a supplement.\" (P003) One of the adult female participants used more than one HHP to cater different purposes which are to maintain general women's health, to heal illness and to control the pain related to illness. This gives insights to the study that consumers consume a product for a speci\u0000c purpose, and therefore will use more than one product if they have more than one purpose. \"This product (showing one of the products) I use for general women's health... at this age it's very important to take supplements like this especially for women to look young and healthy... it also tastes very nice, fruity with berry \u0000avour...\" (P029) The same participant (P029) used different HHP to treat her heel spur and another HHP to control her sinusitis.Page 8/18\"I'm clear of diabetes and other illnesses, but I have a heel spur. Very hard to climb up stairs and walk for a long time... It's painful to stand up for a long time... and I always experience leg cramps at night...and I can't fold my legs for prayers... then I tried this product (showing one of the products), the pain heals slowly with time. This is my fourth bottle; I have healed nearly completely.\" (P029) \"This product (showing a different product) is used for my sinus. I usually sneeze and have a runny nose nearly every morning. Doctor prescribe me with a medicine, but I can't take it because it gives me heartburn. So I stop taking it, and take this instead. If I take this I don't sneeze anymore, no more itching to my ears and nose as well.... But if I stop sometimes it comes back, so I will consume it when needed.\" (P029) We also explored whether participants use one single product or multiple products concurrently. The analysis shows that participants that use HHP for treatment of illness, only use one speci\u0000c product whereas for participants that consume HHP to maintain general health, they tend to use multiple products. Treatment of illness was mentioned ten times by the participants who used a single product while promoting general health and nine times by the participants who used multiple products. Single use of HHP in treating illness was observed in participants P010 who uses a cream to treat acne and participant P019 who uses herbal products to treat itchy scalp and hair loss. \"I have very bad acne (cystic acne) and the doctor prescribed isotretinoin, while using that I also use a cream from turmeric that was promoted in Instagram. So I used both the drug prescribed and the turmeric cream. After a few months I stopped the drug and until now I continue using the turmeric cream for my skin's well-being for nearly 4 years. I feel that it's safe and effective\" (P010) \"I use this product only when I feel that my scalp is itchy, it also helps me treat my hair loss problem. I don't take it every day though... just when I need it.\" (P019) In a nutshell, there are three different themes of purpose of use which are as demonstrated above in the \u0000ndings; i.e., for treatment of illness, to control symptoms or pain related to the illness, and to prevent illness or promote general health. Consumers have their own purpose in taking HHPs, according to their condition and needs. Role of type of illness Another important aspect that in\u0000uences participants' choice to use HHP is the type of illness. In our study a variety of illnesses was mentioned by participants and is summarised in Table 3.Page 9/18Table 3 Types of illness of participants Type of illness Frequency High blood pressure 6 Chronic Diabetes 2 Asthma 1 Sinusitis* 2 Gastric 2 Skin related illness 3 Hair fall 2 Non-chronic Heel Spur 1 Bone problem 1 Period pain 2 Gallstone 1 Knee problem 2 More than one illness 5 *not all sinusitis is a chronic illness, depending on the duration of the symptoms. Among the illnesses mentioned, we can categorize the illness into chronic and non-chronic illness. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, chronic illness is a recurring illness for a long period of time. Examples of chronic illnesses including heart diseases, diabetes, and recurring respiratory illness such as asthma. Consumers with chronic illness use HHP mainly to control the symptoms or pain related to the illness. This is observed from few responses from participants with chronic illness. Participant P017 tried to control his glucose level after being diagnosed with diabetes by consuming herbal blend tea which consists of green tea (Camellia sinensis), Gymnema sylvestre herb, rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) and stevia. \"... after the blood test, and the doctor found out that I have slightly high glucose level, I started to consume this product (showing the product) ... and it helps me to control my sugar levels. I went to the doctor for a follow up check-up and the doctor said I can continue to take the product because it helps my glucose level.\" (P017) Another participant with diabetes also consumed the same herbal blend as P017, and besides that also consumes Nigella sativa oil in addition. Participant P002 is currently prescribed insulin injections toPage 10/18control the glucose level. She consumes herbal tea and Nigella sativa oil in addition to the insulin injection. \"I take the tea to cut (maintain) the glucose level, even though I need to use insulin, but this product really helps me to control the glucose level. Then I also take this (showing the Nigella sativa oil product) as a sunnah (Islamic food) to help give energy to my body, because having diabetes really makes me tired.\" (P002) A participant with high blood pressure mentioned that she tried to \u0000nd an alternative natural remedy to make sure her blood pressure is controlled. She consumes Ling Zhi (Ganoderma lingzhi) tea which is manufactured in Taiwan to help control her blood pressure. According to her response, she uses the HHP alongside her medications which were prescribed to her. This routine helps her control her blood pressure which she self-monitor every day. \"I take this tea after being recommended by a medical doctor, and it helps me control my high blood pressure... the readings become more regular, and I still take the prescribed medicine, but wait after 1 to 2 hours before I consume the tea, this is advised by the doctor... so far this helps me with my high blood pressure.\" (P020) Participants use HHPs for treatment only for non-chronic illnesses such as period pain, gastric, knee problems, hair fall, heel spur and gallstone. A participant with gastric consumes olive oil to help with preventing gastric to reoccur. The participant only takes the prescribed medicine when she can't bear with the pain. \"This olive oil helps me to make sure my gastric is in control, I think it helps the digestion or something related... I only take the prescribed medicine when I can't bear the gastric pain, but I consume olive oil almost every day, it helps me treat my gastric, because now it seldom reoccur.\" (P004) A participant takes a turmeric (Curcuma sp.) based pill to cure period pain which occurs almost every month. According to her experience, consumption of this pill helps her reduce the period pain. She also mentioned to prefer using the turmeric pill instead of painkiller because it doesn't have side effects. \"This pill was recommended by Tok Bidan (Ethnomedicine practitioner) to help with period pain. My sister and other family members also use it. Tok Bidan says that the pill improves blood \u0000ow and hence reduces period pain. I prefer using this than taking paracetamol or other painkillers, it's safer to use long term, no side-effects.\" (P025) Reasons of preference towards HHP To explore the reason consumer preference toward HHPs as a remedy, we explored further and asked their preference of HHPs rather than prescribed medicine for their illness care. It is observed that there are two major responses i.e., participants which prefer HHPs rather than prescribed medicine and participants which only take HHPs as supplements, alongside prescribed medicine.Page 11/18Participants who prefer using HHPs rather than prescribed medicine, identi\u0000ed that the construct that they associate with their preference is perceived safety (due to its natural ingredient), perceived e\u0000cacy, affordable price and personal trust to recommendations from friends and family. Participants which prefer HHPs will seek to \u0000nd any HHPs available to treat or control illness, rather than consuming prescribed medicines. This can be extracted from participant P004 as below: \"I take olive oil for my gastric every day. If I can't bear the pain, then I will take the prescribed medicine given to me... I don't want to take the medicine because it has side effects. I think olive oil is better than the drugs to treat my illness.\" (P004) Participant P001 highlights that herbal health products are safer than prescribed medicine due to its natural ingredients. \"I suggest to all women to try this oil to help with menstrual pain because it's made from natural ingredients and is safe for our body, we don't know whether the prescribed medicine is safe for us, so better seek natural products.\" (P001) Another participant uses Aloe Vera gel to treat acne on his face and prefers using the HHP rather than taking medicine for the acne due to its e\u0000cacy for his treatment and affordable price. \"Don't want to rely on the prescribed medicine for my acne, so I sought this aloe vera gel recommended by my friend. It's very good, it works to treat my acne... I prefer using natural products rather than taking the medicine because it's effective as a treatment for my acne and the price is also affordable.\" (P013) It is observed that participants who prefer HHPs rather than prescribed medicine are only for the treatment of mild symptoms such as acne, menstrual pain and gastric which are not death threatening. Besides that, there are participants which only take HHPs as supplements, alongside prescribed medicine. These participants are well aware of the importance of taking the prescribed medicines alongside HHPs. \"The product I use is Propolis to help with my asthma, but I still use the prescribed medicine because the product just helps me to control my body so that there are less asthma attacks, I still use the medicine to treat my asthma.\" (P015) \"I take these Chinese herbs to help with my high blood pressure. My friend recommended this product because it helped him control his high blood pressure... but I always take my prescribed medicine, never miss it because it's important and dangerous if I miss the medicine.\" (P021) Motivations for Recurring Use Probing deeper into consumers' reason for use of HHP, we also explored whether the consumers repurchase and use the HHP repeatedly and their reasons. Interestingly, out of 30 respondents, 14 respondents mentioned repurchasing the HHP more than once and will continue to use the product. The motivating constructs for recurring use are perceived e\u0000cacy of the product after experiencing thePage 12/18positive effects, ability to reduce the prescribed medicine dosage for a certain illness, and affordable price. Participants highlighted that e\u0000cacy of HHP is among the motives they repurchase the product. The e\u0000cacy however is based on personal experience and is mostly perceived e\u0000cacy because the experience is not backed by any clinical data or diagnosed by any clinician. A participant with skin irritation used a cream formulated from Cucurma longa sp. and have been using it for 4 years repeatedly. She mentioned the reason for recurring use is that she experiences positive effects on her skin and will continue to use it due to its effects. \"I've been using this cream for 4 years and to me it's safe because it's made from a plant. I will continue to use it as long as I experience the positive effects on my skin condition.\" (P010) Other reasons for recurring use as mentioned by consumers are the effect of 'feeling better' in terms of well-being and to maintain energy level. One of the participants shared that she makes sure that the product she's using will always be available at home, and will stock up every two weeks. The product is an herbal drink which are made from twelve different natural ingredients i.e., prune (Prunus domestica), mangosteen (Garcinia the product before it's \u0000nished, one bottle usually lasts for two weeks, so I will buy two bottles for one-month stock. I consider this as my daily supplement to maintain my energy level, as I feel energetic after consumption of the drink... And it's also very affordable, so why not just continue...\" (P003) A participant continued the daily consumption of olive oil (Olea europaea) because it helps to reduce the dosage of her prescribed medicine for Gastroesophageal re\u0000ux disease (GERD). According to her, although the olive oil is rather expensive, she is willing to spend for the natural remedy because she could not bear the pain when her stomach aches. \"... as long as I still have this illness, I will take my olive oil daily in the morning. I can't bear the pain when there's too much acid in my stomach, I can't do my work... I only take my medicine (Pantoprazole) when It's too painful, so the olive oil has reduced my frequency of taking it, it helps me cope better with my illness...\" (P004) Tambah satu citation utk affordable DISCUSSION On the basis of in-depth interviews, our study explored the reasons for consumers using HHP in the general population. Our purposive sampling focused on any consumers currently using HHPs or have once any time before use HHP. In this study, 60% of our participants were female which aligned withPage 13/18\u0000ndings from other studies which stated that females are more attracted to consuming natural and herbal based products [13, 14, 15, 16]. In regards to participants' age, there were no signi\u0000cant differences between the numbers of participants in the 18-35 age group and 36-60 age group which indicates that both age groups similarly consume HHP products. This contradicts with a study in the United States whereby older age and higher education patients have higher use of herbal supplements [15] and also to a similar study in Indonesia which highlights area of residence, age, education level and occupation as signi\u0000cant predictors for herbal medicine use [17]. In Jordan, a study only associates age as the only predictors for use of herbal supplements [18]. In contrast to age, the numbers of participants greatly differ in regards to marital status. The number of married participants is much higher than single participants which indicates more married people consume HHP in comparison to single people. This is aligned with studies from other countries which shows that herbal supplements prevalence among married women are higher compared to single women [19, 20, 21].Our women participants also mentioned the use of HHP as supplements to boost or maintain energy levels which is aligned with a study being done about fatigue-management among women in South Africa. The \u0000ndings reveal that one of the strategies sought are using supplements to manage fatigue, besides cognitive strategies, physical strategies and dietary changes [22]. In this study, three different purposes of use were explored, namely to treat illness, to control symptoms or pain related to the illness and to prevent illness or to promote general health. All reasons are mentioned about the same number of times, which shows that all three reasons were similarly important. Report on the use of medicinal herbs among Surinamese migrants in the Netherlands shows similar \u0000ndings, with the main purpose of use is for health promotion [23]. This discovery is a bit different from a Focus Group Discussion in Germany whereby, \u0000ndings demonstrate that the most frequently mentioned purpose is for the treatment of illness in comparison to prevention of illness and promotion of well-being [24]. Participants that use HHP to treat illness, mostly are for treatment of mild illnesses such as gastric, skin in\u0000ammation, sinusitis, and period pain. This is in line with studies that show consumers are most likely to seek natural remedies for mild illness such as headache and colds [25]. Whereas participants that use HHP to control symptoms or control pain related to the illness, are patients of chronic illness such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic sinusitis, asthma, and acute knee pain. A study from Mohamad et al. states that women in Malaysia use herbal remedies for chronic illness such as hypertension and diabetes [26]. This study suggested that HHP is mainly used as a supplement to promote general health by increasing energy and immune system, improving blood circulation and reducing stress. The use of HHP for holistic well-being or general health is common especially after the Covid-19 pandemic, whereby consumers perceived to bene\u0000t from the natural supplements in some way [27]. Herbal products are also used to target lipid metabolism for weight control to promote general health [28]Page 14/18Demography wise, what was signi\u0000cantly observed was that the mentioning of the purpose differs in regards to participants age, marital status and either using a single product or multiple products. In a study by Bishop et al. (2010), both demographic and health characteristics contribute independently in the use of complementary and alternative medicine including herbal products [29]. In Ghana, a study highlights that education level and the dosage form of the product in\u0000uence the choice of using herbal products, but gender, age and occupation does not have a positive relationship [20]. Similar \u0000ndings highlight age, gender and marital status being predictors for herbal medicine use [17, 18, 19]. Consumers have personal objectives in seeking HHPs and incorporating it into personal health regimes. Although the e\u0000cacy of HHP products is debatable, the safety of the products, hence its consumer, is prime important. Thus, health literacy regarding HHP is very important to regulate the use of these products. In Malaysia, there are various regulations such as the Control of Drugs and Cosmetics Regulations 1984, Sale of Drug Act 1952, Poison Act 1952, and the Advertisement and Sale Act 1956 to regulate HHP, however most regulations and guidelines are implemented at the upstream of the supply chain of HHP for example, for the manufacturer but for the consumers, it is very minimal. In a study in Thailand, accessing reliable information regarding herbal and food supplements was among the highest challenges in health literacy [30] and thus, it is a pivotal concern to focus initiatives to improve health literacy regarding HHPs. LIMITATION Even though in-depth interview methodology applied in this study has its strength, we also note the limitations of the study. First of all, like other qualitative analysis, the mentions and themes are not quanti\u0000able. The objective for the qualitative analysis is to provide deep data and insights from the consumers rather than addressing statistically evidenced data. Although a high standard of research protocol was followed to achieve reliability and validity of the data, transcripts and analysis still may be in\u0000uenced by interpretation of authors and researchers. Furthermore, the data also cannot be generalized to the whole population and could not be easily compared to other locations. CONCLUSION We conclude that HHPs are being used for different purposes and aims across different gender, age and marital status. There are three main purposes of HHP consumption which are for treatment of illness, controlling symptoms or pain and for prevention of illness and general well-being. Some consumers are aware of the risks and limitations of HHPs in attaining the objectives of use, but some consumers need to be informed and guided in regards for safe-use of HHPs, especially consumers with chronic illnesses. Therefore, a holistic guideline on safe and quality use of HHPs are pivotal in protecting consumers and patients against risks and adverse effects related to HHPs.
