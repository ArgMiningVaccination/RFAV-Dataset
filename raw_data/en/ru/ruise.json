If taking medications, ensure that drug-nutrient/herb interactions are checked. Unless otherwise stated, it is advised that supplements and herbs are taken for approximately 3-4 weeks but can be adapted to suit the requirements of the individual. All remedies should ideally be used as soon post-vaccination as possible but can also be used at a later date if required. Supplements: + Vitamin D3 (10,000 iu per day) \u2014 immunomodulator (enhances immunity and reduces autoimmunity), anti-inflammatory (reduces inflammatory cytokines); a sub-optimal vitamin D status has been correlated with worse outcomes from COVID. [1,2] + Vitamin C (3-5 g per day) \u2014 supports various components of the immune system; reduces some inflammatory cytokines / mediators, shown to reduce exaggerated immune responses in COVID; evidence suggests a possible benefit in reducing thrombosis (clot) risk. [3] + Zinc (25-50 mg per day) \u2014 anti-viral activity; regulates the development of immune cells; deficiency is associated with more COVID complications. [2] + NAC (N-acetyl cysteine) [or glutathione] (1.5 g daily) \u2014 potent antioxidant effects which is crucial because excessive oxidative stress has been linked to enhanced viral spike protein binding to ACE2 receptors; reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines / mediators; supports liver detoxification (i.e., for vaccine ingredients). [4] - Or milk thistle \u2014 use a high strength preparation such as a fluid extract (1:1) or standardised silymarin content tablets or capsules. + Quercetin (500-1000 mg, twice daily) \u2014 impairs the binding of the viral spike protein to ACE2 receptors; reduces pro-inflammatory signals associated with COVID-19; inhibits COVID-19 viral replication; evidence to suggest that it inhibits coagulation (clotting). Similar action demonstrated to ivermectin. [5] \u00a9 College of Naturopathic Medicine (CNM) UK and Ireland Herbal medicines: + Dandelion leaf (Taraxacum officinale) - evidence to suggest that it inhibits the interaction between the viral spike protein and ACE2 receptors. Note that this herb is a diuretic and so can increase urinary output. [6] + Pine needle (Pinus sylvestris) \u2014 contains shikimate which has been harnessed as a pharmaceutical drug for COVID. It is thought to inhibit viral replication, neutralise the viral spike protein and inhibit clotting. [7] + Fennel seed (Foeniculum vulgare) \u2014 also contains shikimate (as does star anise) and is thought to have similar effects. + Artemisia spp. (e.g., wormwood) \u2014 shown to inhibit of Peter Jackson-Main's herbal detox decoction - containing pine needles (40 g), dandelion leaf (30 g), Artemisia spp. (10 g), fennel seed (10 g), Angelia archangelica (10g): 2 teaspoons of herbal mix in 500 ml water, simmered gently with the lid on for 5 minutes. Then strain and drink 2-3 of these cups daily. For 2-3 weeks. This blend is available to purchase from CNM's London Kings Cross Campus (at the front desk) or from the CNM website here: naturopathy-uk.com/pv-protocol \u00a9 College of Naturopathic Medicine (CNM) UK and Ireland If neurological side effects: + Lion's mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus) (2 g / day for 2 months) - stimulatory effect on the production of 'nerve growth factor', a protein required in order to regenerate and repair nerve tissue; powerful antioxidant effects. [9] Other considerations: + Focus on good quality sleep \u2014 the hormone melatonin (which regulates the body's internal clock) is a crucial antioxidant in the body. This is beneficial in that it can reduce oxidative stress generated by vaccination. Aim for 7-9 hours of good quality sleep. [10] + Good nutrition \u2014 avoid highly-processed foods, trans fats (e.g., margarine, fast foods), refined sugars, over-eating (listen to your body). Instead focus on whole and organic foods, focusing on plant foods with a variety of colours from vegetables and fruits. Also ensure adequate hydration. - Resveratrol (supplement 200 mg / day or eat resveratrol-rich foods, e.g., red grapes, blueberries, cranberries, pistachios) which have been shown to inhibit SARS CoV-2 in vitro; a potent antioxidant. [11] + Support gut health (seek advice from a natural therapist where needed) \u2014 to support microbiome balance, ensure adequate elimination of waste materials and promote an overall anti-inflammatory environment. + Avoid other stressors on the body \u2014 e.g., smoking, alcohol, caffeine. + Relaxing exercise \u2014 e.g., walking, Pilates, yoga, Qi gong. \u00a9 College of Naturopathic Medicine (CNM) UK and Ireland Homeopathic remedies: The remedies discussed below are useful considerations for those who have had the COVID vaccine as well as those that have developed side effects from the COVID vaccine. Do not take the homeopathic remedies any longer than suggested. Order the remedies from Helios or Ainsworth Pharmacy in sucrose, no.6 size homeopathic pills. 3 pills = 1 dose. Straight after the vaccination: + Ledum 30C (twice daily for 3-5 days) \u2014 to reduce injection site pain, especially when the injection site is left with a deep purple-black bruise. The area feels sore to touch and aches. + Arnica 200C (once daily for 5 days) \u2014 to reduce risk of clot formation and haemorrhaging. Arnica works to reduce inflammation and balance the clotting system. + Thuja 200C (twice daily for 5 days) \u2014 taken straight after the vaccination to reduce ill effects of the vaccine. For over 2 weeks post the vaccination: (Only take if you have not done the above protocol or you are still feeling the ill effects of the vaccine despite doing the above protocol). + Thuja 1M (once weekly for 3 weeks) \u2014 for symptoms of 'never been well since' a vaccination. Side effects from the vaccination: + Apis 200C (twice daily for 2-3 days) \u2014 for any acute reaction to the vaccine where there is restlessness, swelling and inflammation at the site of the vaccination. Frequent urination, irritability, periorbital swelling / oedema. + Sulphur 1M (once weekly for 3-4 weeks) \u2014 may present with anxiety about health and may repeat the question asked before answering.

Diarrhoea is offensive, watery, worse for \u00a9 College of Naturopathic Medicine (CNM) UK and Ireland drinking cold drinks and worse from eating fruit. Development of asthma symptoms, which tend to come on between 12am-2am. Breathing is better if they sit upright or bent forward (think pericarditis). Atrial fibrillation or indications of congestive heart failure may be present. Development of Raynaud's syndrome. Restless sleep, insomnia \u2014 wake from midnight to 1am.

It is important to note, however, that homeopathic remedies are prescribed on a totality of the presenting signs and symptoms of a client, and it may be that the above remedies do not always match the totality of your client symptom. If there is no relief of symptoms after taken the chosen remedy, do consider seeking a consult with a qualified Homeopath. \u00a9 College of Naturopathic Medicine (CNM) UK and Ireland Tissue salt supports for post-vaccination: Take 1 dose 3 x daily for 6-8 months: + Silica \u2014 used for encouraging elimination / detoxification of any foreign matter from the vaccine. This can be useful for suppuration or keloid formation that may occur at the site of the vaccination. (Avoid if there are foreign bodies such as pacemakers, implants, plates or pins etc.). + Calc. phos. \u2014 supports mitochondrial function due to the phosphorous contribution to phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Useful where there is mental and physical prostration, severe fatigue and weakness, poor appetite with irritability. + Kali. phos. \u2014 known as the nerve nutrient, this is a wonderful support where there has been an impact on the nervous system. You may observe irritability, headaches from mental strain, hypersensitivity to all stimuli, great exhaustion with mental dullness, difficulty in concentrating, weak memory, etc..
