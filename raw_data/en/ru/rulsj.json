Maintaining a balanced system is imperative for achieving optimal wellness. Any slight imbalance, however minor, can lead to inflammation and chronic illnesses. Eating a plant-based diet full of cruciferous vegetables, getting adequate sleep, and doing plenty of daily exercise can help keep your body's operating system working properly and reduce your chances of developing an illness or disease. Some compounds found in cruciferous vegetables are even thought to be cancer-fighting. Most people are aware of the importance of eating a balanced diet containing plenty of vegetables, but the type of vegetables you eat can be equally important. Cruciferous vegetables are a great choice, and could also be life-saving. Yes, eating cruciferous vegetables is one of the most important choices you can make towards healthy, cancer-free living. These veggies have some pretty amazing benefits. By looking closely at their nutritional content, you'll soon discover why they are major contributors to a vibrant healthy body. Cruciferous vegetables, also referred to as \"cole crops\" in the United States, belong to the Brassica genus. This includes the following vegetables: Cruciferous vegetables are an abundant source of many important elements your body needs, such as fiber and vitamins C, E, and K, folate, as well as several carotenoids and minerals. They also contain sulfuric compounds known as glucosinolates, which are what give these vegetables their bitter taste and distinct smell. Glucosinolates are just some of the elements in these superfoods\u2014the\"magic\" components\u2014that provide amazing health benefits. Cruciferous vegetables contain a remarkable amount of glucoraphanin making them a natural powerhouse. Sulforaphane stimulates our bodies to produce important enzymes and can also destroy carcinogens. The substance is particularly abundant in broccoli sprouts\u2014about 20 to 50 times more abundant than in mature broccoli. A study conducted by researchers from the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, California found that people who consumed 3.7 half-cup servings of cooked broccoli per week were 50 percent less likely to develop colorectal cancer than those who did not eat broccoli at all. Cruciferous veggies also contain a naturally occurring compound called indole-3-carbinol. This important compound is converted into a phytochemical known as 3,3-diindolylmethane (DIM) during digestion which, in turn, balances estrogen hormone levels. Although more predominant in females, your estrogen levels [must be kept in check](/blog/estrogen-dominance-part-1/) regardless of your gender. DIM can also reduce your risk of hormone-dependent cancers such as prostate, breast, and ovarian cancer. The additional anti-estrogenic effects of this compound provide even greater levels of protection for women. It's a good idea to keep a supply of cruciferous veggies available at all times so you can boost the nutritional value of any meal. There are a number of different ways to add these amazing veggies to your meals. Here are just a few ideas: Studies have demonstrated a multitude of life-altering health benefits associated with glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables. . Toxins are present in our daily lives and are extremely difficult to avoid; therefore, it's safe to say that everyone\u2014from the chronically ill to supremely healthy\u2014can benefit from foods that protect against toxins and eliminate them from the body. Cruciferous vegetables and their sulforaphane-rich tissues can help with this process. In a randomized trial, 291 participants from a highly polluted rural area of China were divided into two groups. Half were given a concentrated extract of cruciferous vegetables over a 12-week period and the other half were only offered a placebo. Urine testing confirmed that significantly more toxins were eliminated from the bodies of those drinking the veggie-derived drink compared to those who drank the placebo. It has also been confirmed that the sulforaphane found in cruciferous vegetables can help rid your body of arsenic and pesticides. Eating cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower is a great way to detoxify the various pathways of your body, especially if your body is not clearing toxins as efficiently as it should. If you are suffering from a chronic illness, such as adrenal fatigue, chances are high that your body's natural detoxification process is [not working properly](/blog/detoxification-circuit-dysfunction-part-1/). Moreover, this is likely placing additional strain on other organs such as the kidneys and adrenal glands. Your liver and gastrointestinal system are directly connected. If you suffer from digestive issues, excess hormones may be reabsorbed, rather than being properly dealt with and removed. Furthermore, if your liver is clogged and overloaded with toxins, it cannot filter out excess hormones that are normally passed along to the gut for removal. The adrenal glands are two small walnut-shaped organs located above your kidneys. Your adrenals are primarily responsible for pumping out stress-related hormones like cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine when your body perceives a potential danger or threat. This system works perfectly when our bodies only have to deal with short moments of acute stress. However, chronic stress can overwork the adrenals, which will have to constantly pump out large quantities of stress hormones, and this can lead to Adrenal Fatigue Syndrome (AFS). The [symptoms of adrenal fatigue ](/adrenal-fatigue/) include constant and debilitating fatigue, hormone imbalances, problems with blood glucose levels, decreased cognitive abilities, anxiety, sleep disorders, and weight gain. The most damaging components of adrenal fatigue are hormone imbalances and increased inflammation. Inflammation has been identified as a driving force in almost all chronic diseases. If you are unwell, your body is most likely experiencing inflammation. Hormone imbalances can alter every organ and cell involved in the NeuroEndoMetabolic (NEM) stress response system, which begins at the base of the brain and sends signals to your adrenals via the pituitary glands. When your adrenal glands are engaged, direct physical responses will take place\u2014of utmost importance, production of the stress hormone, cortisol. Hormones are chemical messengers that travel through your body delivering messages to various organs and tissues. Their job is to signal to your organs when work needs to be done. Therefore, hormone imbalances can affect many different processes in the body, including metabolism, growth and development, reproduction, libido, and mood. [Managing your diet](/blog/adrenal-fatigue-diet/) is one of the most important steps in both preventing and recovering from AFS. Luckily, nature has provided us with some incredible edible remedies, including cruciferous vegetables. If you suffer from AFS, you may be experiencing a multi-faceted set of problems that are affecting your entire system. This is because once your adrenal glands become exhausted, they can no longer send out the proper signals to ensure appropriate levels of inflammation or normal blood sugar levels. If not properly addressed, AFS can lead to exhaustion and chronically debilitating health problems. There are ways to help your body recover from AFS. For starters, a healthy lifestyle that includes plenty of sleep, daily meditation, exercise, and a healthy diet full of cruciferous vegetables, can help your adrenals remain strong. Cruciferous vegetables are incredibly high in vitamin K, which can have a huge influence on inflammation and potentially reduce the need for your adrenal glands to produce so much cortisol. Vitamin K allows your adrenals to rest and regain strength. Veggies in the cruciferous family are also rich in antioxidant-boosting vitamins A and C, which help fight free radicals throughout your body to prevent cancer. The tremendous amount of benefits obtained by eating cruciferous vegetables cannot be overlooked and everyone should take advantage of this amazing gift from nature. However, it's important to remember that before starting any new diet or supplement you should consult with a nutritionist or your primary care doctor. Many chronic illnesses can cause food allergies and sensitivities and should be monitored closely. If you are suffering from adrenal fatigue, it's important to be cautious about the foods you eat. Supervision by a knowledgeable healthcare provider is advisable, particularly when starting any new meal plan. Your body can change quite dramatically during different stages of a disease, so food you once tolerated may no longer be safe to consume. Moreover, it's best to eat everything in moderation. Too many cruciferous vegetables can cause health-related issues of their own. This particular family of plants have a compound called thiocyanate that when over-consumed can affect your body's ability to properly absorb iodine. This can lead to a condition called hypothyroidism characterized by an enlarged and underactive thyroid gland. You may notice symptoms such as weight gain, low energy levels, and constipation. [Too many of these veggies](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/8-health-foods-harmful-in-large-amounts) can also throw off your body's estrogen balance. If you are prone to hormonal issues or have hormone imbalances as a result of AFS, it's definitely best to eat cruciferous vegetables in moderation. \u00a9 Copyright 2012-2019 Michael Lam, M.D. All Rights Reserved.
