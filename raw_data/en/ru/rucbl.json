Complementary therapies are used in conjunction with traditional Western medicine, while alternative therapies are used in place of traditional medicine. The majority of the sources listed below explore both complementary and alternative medicine and are considered CAM sites. Selection for this list was based on reliability of the site's publisher or sponsor, the purpose of the site, the extent and origin of content on the site, its currency, and its accessibility to the health care consumer.

Sites with advertising or a shopping feature appear only if their content and reliability outweigh the commercial elements.
