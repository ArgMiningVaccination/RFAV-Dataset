Chan Research and Development Division, School of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, SAR, PR China Abstract A World Health Organisation survey indicated that about 70-80% of the world populations rely on non-conven- tional medicine mainly of herbal sources in their primary healthcare. In recent years, we have witnessed the increasing growth in popularity of over-the-counter (OTC) health foods, nutraceuticals, and medicinal products from plants or other natural sourcesin developed countries. This indirectly indicatesthat thepublic isnot satised with theirorthodoxmedical (OM) treatment. Such increase in popularity has also brought concerns and fears over the professionalism of practitioners, and quality, ecacy and safety of their treatment methods and products from herbal and natural sources available in the market. Over the past decade several news-catching episodes in developed communities indicatedadverse eects, sometimes life threatening, allegedly arisen consequential to taking of OTC herbal products or tradi-tional medicines from various ethnic groups. These OTC products may be contaminated with excessive or banned pesticides, microbial contaminants, heavy metals, chemical toxins, and for adulterated with orthodox drugs. Excessive orbannedpesticides,heavymetalsandmicrobialcontaminantsmayberelatedtothesourceoftheseherbalmaterials,ifthey are grown under contaminated environment or during collection of these plant materials. Chemical toxins may come from unfavourable or wrong storage conditions or chemical treatment due to storage. The presence of orthodox drugs can be related to unprofessional practice of manufacturers. Some of these environment related factors can becontrolled by implementing standard operating procedures (SOP) leading to Good Agricultural Practice (GAP), Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), Good Supply Practice (GSP) and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for producing these medicinal products from herbal or natural sources. The public /C213s belief that herbal and natural products are safer than synthetic medicines can only be ascertained by imposing regulatory standards on these products that should bemanufactured using these Good Practices. UsingChinese medicines, asexamples, thispaperillustrate how advancesinchemical andbiomedical analysiswould help to detect intentional and unintentional toxic contaminants in herbal substances.

General considerations on how CHM products produce toxic eects when reports on the presence of heavy metals, pesticides, and orthodox drugs in herbal forward for assurance of quality, safety and ecacy of herbal medicines 1368 5.1. Basic research on 70-80% of the world populations, particularly in the developing countries, rely on non-conventional medicine in their primary healthcare as reported by the World Health Organisation (Akerele, 1993). The rest ofthe populations, in the better-developed countries, havebeen fortunate receivers of orthodox medicine (OM) or conventionalmedicinesincetheearly19thcentury.Yetin the present era of rapid advances in biomedical scienceand technology it is astonishing that the public in rich developedcountriesspendsansignicantamountoftheir earningsonover-the-counter(OTC)herbalproductsandrelatednon-conventionaltherapies.Overthepastdecade wehavewitnessedtwoapparentlyunrelatedtrendsinthe biomedical and biotechnological development of medic-inal products. There is the rapid development of recom- binant DNA technology and related procedures to provide biomedical proteins and related biologicalproducts for use as therapeutic drugs, prophylactic vac-cines and diagnostic agents (Chan, 1996). The growth in popularity of OTC health foods (nutraceuticals) and medicinal products from plants or other natural sourceshave taken a very large share of the healthcare market (Johnson, 1997). These two unrelated trends indicate changes in people /C213s perceptions of OM treatment using synthetic drugs or conventional therapies. 1.1. Increasing use of complementary or alternative medicines In most developed countries where OM assumes full responsibility in national healthcare, where as mostforms of traditionally practised medicine and therapies are considered as complementary or alternative medi- cine (CAM). Some experts consider that OM is allo-pathic treatment while many of the CAM involve holistic approach; the practitioners of OM attempt to intervene in order to block certain body processes whilepractitioners of the CAM focus on supporting andworking with the body /C213s innate powers of self-regener- ation. The WHO has dened CAM as all forms of healthcare provision which /C212usually lie outside the o- cialhealth sector /C213(Eisenberg etal., 1993).This denition by WHO embraces formalised traditional systems of medicine(Ayurvedic,Chinese,HindooandUnanisystemsetc.), traditional healers and medicine men, feedback, chiropractic, naturopathy, osteopathy, and homeopathy etc. Very little is known concerning the reasons for theincrease in popularity of CAM in developed countries. Untested assumptions include the side-eects of syn- thetic drugs, general dissatisfaction of orthodox treat-ment,diseasesthatcannotbecuredbyOM,andpatientswith chronic illnesses demanding more attention from OM practitioners. Research is urgently needed in these areastoimprovehealthcareplanning(Chan,1996).CAMtreatments are recommended for chronic pain aecting spine, joints or muscles, for the control of nausea, ec- zema, and other skin complaints, asthma, cancer andmigraine etc. (Lewith et al., 1996). There are over 100 dierent therapies available as CAM treatments, but the ve discrete clinical disciplines (acupuncture, chiro-practic, herbal medicine, homeopathy and osteopathy)are distinguished by having established foundations of training and professional standards (British Medical Association,1993).Howeverithasbeenpointedoutthat1362 K. Chan / Chemosphere 52 (2003) 1361-1371not all natural therapies or products related to CAM are free from adverse eects (Table 1) (Abbot et al., 1996;Barnes, 1997). 1.2. The emerging market of herbal products Herbal or medicinal plant products in various forms have been available for many hundreds of years for treatment of diseases in both Eastern and Western cul- tures. About one-quarter of marketed orthodox phar-maceutical medicines is either derived from plant sources or from derivatives of secondary plant metabo- lites. The success of obtaining new drugs from naturalsources is not very encouraging. Several factors are re-sponsible for such observation (Chaudhury, 1992). At present, of about 2000 varieties of minor illnesses and serious diseases only 40% have cure using conventionalorthodox pharmaceuticals (Abbot et al., 1996). Vari- ous chemicals and biotechnological products are being screened by major multinational pharmaceutical indus-tries in the hope of discovering new cures for diseases. Table 2 shows the dierent types of herbal medicines being practised. It is interested to note that China has aUS$1.3 billion turnover of herbs used in Chinese medi-cine. In Europe there is signicant amount, in the vi- cinity of about \u00a3300 million, of herbal remedies that the public consumes. In the 1997meeting of Federation ofInternational Pharmcaceutique (FIP), an ocer from United State Pharmacopoeia (USP) indicated a steady increase of 10% in public spending on remedies of bo-tanicalorigins.Inthesamemeetinganotherocialfrom the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicated the concern on adverse eects induced by consumption ofremedies of natural sources including botanicals. The emerging importance of herbal products cannot be ig-nored. Aspects of the ecacy, safety and quality of herbal or natural products are the subjects of on-going debates. 1.3. The growing popularity of Chinese medicinal herbs and herbal products in the west Chinese medicinal (CM) products have received most attention and recently gained popularity and attention in the West. Increasing information on CM has been published in the English literature and the debate ofecacy of CM products has begun (Chan, 1995). Ze-maphyte,consistingof10dierentCMherbsintheform of an aqueous decoction for the successful cure of atopic eczema, that has been resistant to orthodox treatment,has created greater interest and attention on the use of CM herbs and proprietary products (Atherton et al., 1992). Increasing concern and fear have also been ex-pressed to their unsupervised use, ecacy, toxicity and quality of these natural products as well as the legal responsibilities of practitioners. Inclusion of orthodoxmedications such as antibiotics, non-steroidal drugs andsteroids in CM patent products was not considered as a positive attribute of CM in the West (Karunanithy and Sumita, 1991). The use of fake or wrong herbs hascontributed a negative opinion about the safety and ef- cacy of CM products (Jin et al., 1995). Many popular and expensive CM herbs are in short supply and inferiorsubstitutes or fake crude herbs have been found in the UK market (Yu et al., 1995, 1997). Thus, the increasing popularity of herbal products as medications and foodTable 1 Suspected adverse eects of complementary/alternative medicine (modied from Abbot et al.

This isprobablybecauseoftheincreasinguseiscausingashort-age of the raw materials and unprofessional trading. 1.4. The concern over quality, safety and ecacy of herbal medicine CM herbs and their manufactured products have been used for thousands of years for prevention and treatment of diseases in China apart from recently in- troduced synthetic pharmaceuticals in orthodox medical(OM) practice since the late 1800s. When used or pre- scribed according to Chinese medical philosophy and practice, through test of time, those medications andcrude materials recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia have been approved for safe use (The Pharmacopoeia Commission of PRC, 2000). The previously mentionedunfavourable incidents have possibly been due to un-professional practice and shortage of supply. Neverthe- less, all medicinal products used in humans and animals should have proven QSE. Problems and diculties arisein the quality assurance of herbal medicinal products because there are so many unidentied chemical entities in the nished products, and the actual bioactive com-ponents are seldom known. Recent advances in analy- tical chemistry and related disciplines have helped elucidating the complex chemical compositions of CMherbs. Table 3 summarises the dierences between or-thodox drugs and CM materials (both crude herbs, known as /C212Ying Pin /C213, and ready-made or proprietary products). Chemical analytical techniques can be applied at dierent stages of good practices in quality assurance of natural or herbal products, including Good AgriculturalPractice (GAP), Good Sourcing Practice (GSP), Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), and Good Clinical Trial Practice(GCTP). This review paper addresses how using modern analytical methodologies to assess contaminants thatmay be detected from these materials. Data from theseanalyses will provide a range limit accepted generally according to guidelines for food substances.

Dierent government bodies from dierent countrieswill have dierent regulatory controls over productsfrom herbal or natural sources (Chan, 1997). 2. Advances in chemical analytical and biomedicial screening technology 2.1. Chemical analytical systems For the past 40 years, chromatography and spec- troscopy have been used to study chemical compositions of CM herbs and plants. Using the methods of gas chromatography (GC), high diraction, GC-MS andHPLC-MS, many chemical compounds from CM herbs have been isolated and identied. Recently, capillary electrophoresis has been used to infer the botanicalsources and to assess the quality of Ephedrae Herba (Liu et al., 1993), Coptidis Rhizoma (Liu et al., 1994), Ginseng Radix(Chuang et al., 1995) and Paeoniae Radix (Chu- ang et al., 1996). Increased sensitivity has been achieved by coupling HPLC or GC with other analytical systems. For instances, the combination of liquid chromato-graphy and tandem mass spectrometry was ecient todetectco-eluting,closelyrelatedsubstances(Coveyetal., 1986) and to quantify active components from tradi- tional Chinese medicine over a concentration range of1 ng/ml to 10 lg/ml (Wang et al., 1997). The successes of eventual launching new drugs using these conventional approaches have been very disap-pointing (Chan, 1995) even though several eective single chemical entities have beenfound, some with their denite chemical structure modications (Table 4). InCM practice, synergistic actions provided by some chemically unknown or not isolated ingredients in composite prescriptions have proven eectiveness fromdouble blind clinical trials. Thus these analytical meth-ods may not be appropriate for quality/ecacy assur- ance. 2.2. Biomedical screening systems Problems related to chemical analysis have been identied that the level of the active (secondary meta-bolites) components may be aected by physiological conditions, harvesting period and storage conditions. Moreover, closely related plant species may containsimilar chemical components from which a denite bo- tanical identication is not always possible. In some cases,thechemicalmethodusuallyrequireslargeamountsof samples for a proper analysis and some of the in- struments such as HPLC; capillary electrophoresis andmass spectrometry are expensive and may not be avail-able in many analytical laboratories. Classical cytogenetic methods including chromosome counting and karyotyping may also be used to dier-entiatemedicinal materials(Hondaetal., 1994)andplay a role in assessing hybridity of plants (Magdalita et al., 1997). Nevertheless, it is not useful in dierentiation ofclosely related species. Proteins have been exploited as identicationmarkersin Epimedium species(Kogaetal., 1991), and to dierentiate inter- and ginseng (Sun et al., 1993; Koren and Zhuravlev, 1998). One of the drawbacks of such markers is that the protein patterns vary in dierent tissues, developmentalstages and environment as a consequence of temporaland spatial gene expression. Distinguishable markers may also not be easily detected in closely related species and protein is prone to degradation after prolongedstorage of the herbs. DNA molecules are reliable markers for informative polymorphisms as the genetic composition is unique foreach individual and is less aected by age, physiological conditions as well as environmental factors. Additional advantages of DNA markers include: Firstly, smallamount of sample is sucient for the analysis, which isparticularly relevant for CM materials that are expen- siveorinlimitedsupply,andsecondly,thephysicalform of the sample for assessment does not restrict detection.The DNA materials can be extracted from leaves, stems or roots of the herbal materials. Therefore DNA n- gerprinting can be very useful to assess and conrm thespecies of the plant materials of interest.Table 4 SomepharmacologicallyactiveprinciplesisolatedfromChinesemedicinal plants (adopted from Chan (1995)) Chemical type Number of compounds isolatedAlkaloids 213 TerpenesMonoterpenes 36 761K. Chan / Chemosphere 52 (2003) 1361-1371 1365Other established conventionally in vitro, in vivo and in situ or ex vivo techniques for pharmacological and toxicological screening may be more appropriate forscreening purposes for the bioactivities of CM herbs andproducts as most of the CM formulary products are in combinations of multiple herbs. These techniques can be applied for the studies of other herbal medicinal mate-rials using their crude extracts or bio-active fraction- guided approaches. 3. Sources of toxic chemicals and contaminations in herbal products The practices of most ethnic herbal medicine include the use crude or raw herbs that are collected from thewild or from cultivated elds and their prepared or ready-made (formulated mixture of herbal or other natural materials) products. Toxic contaminants maycome from: Environments and conditions that the medicinal plants are grown or collected. The conditions under which they are dried and pro- cessed. The storage conditions and conditions during trans- port. The manufacturing processes when the ready-made medicinal products are produced. 3.1. The use of potent and toxic medicinal materials in Chinese medicinal prescriptions Some CM natural herbs listed in the ocial Chinese Pharmacopoeia, CP (The Pharmacopoeia Commission of PRC, 2000) are considered poisonous or toxic due tothe presence of poisonous or toxic chemical constituentsin the herbs. Of which about 50 of animal, plant and mineral natural materials are included in the CP. In CM they are seldom prescribed or used alone. In the CP thewords ''toxic, non-toxic, very toxic or slightly toxic'' are often used in describing Chinese Materia Medica. Non- toxic herbs, sometimes referred to as /C212Superior Class /C213, are moderate or mild in nature and, generally speaking, do not possess any side eects. Toxic herbs, sometimes referred as /C212Low Grade /C213herbs and used for specic purposes in a traditional CM prescription, can causesymptomatic reactions and adverse eects. No overdose of these should be prescribed or given. Examples are processed aconite root (Fuzi) and Nuxvomica seed (Maqianzi) as cited in the present Compendium. CMherbsareoftenprescribedin Fu-Fang (composite formulae) according to CM principles of diagnosis andtreatment. This approach of combining of processed poisonous or toxic herbs and non-toxic herbs with the latter neutralises or reduces the toxicity of the poisonousherbs. The dierent characteristics of herbs in a given prescriptions, consumed orally as aqueous decoction, recties the hyper-activity or hypo-activity of Yinand Yangin the unwell body, consequently curing the dis- eases that have caused the imbalance of YinandYang, and restoring health. Dierent combinations of herbs can cause variation in therapeutic eects. Traditionallythe result of combining herbs can be classied as mutual reinforcement; mutual assistance; mutual restraint or mutual counteraction; mutual suppression; and mutualantagonism . Basedon the CM principles of Fu-Fang-Xue (Studies of Herbal Combination), the poisonous herbs present in formulae have been included in some well-used prescriptions over a long period of time according to recorded experience. The poisonous herbs that are included in Fu-Fang should be processed according tolaid down procedures listed in the Pharmacopoeia orother CM guidebooks. 3.2. General considerations on how CHM products produce toxic eects when not used properly Similar to using orthodox medicines it is understood that all drugs are toxic at high doses. Although the 48 CM materials described in the Pictorial Compendium for potent and poisonous CMMs (Xu and Chan, 1994)are recorded in Pharmacopoeia as poisonous herbs theyare used, after special treatments according to tradi- tional processing procedures, in herbal combinations with other non-toxic herbs according to CM diagno-sis and treatment. With practice experience and good knowledge of CM herbs the practitioners seldom come across any problems (Chan, 2002). Among many fac-tors, possible reasons for occurrence of adverse eects and toxicity in using CM are discussed. 3.2.1. Authenticity or poor quality of CM herbs Popularity and scarcity of certain CM herbs may encourage traders to sell poor quality herbs. Misuse and confusion of names of certain CM herbs enhances dif-culty in identifying the correct herbs in the market. Some traders supply fake herbs that are poisonous. Substitution or adulteration with more toxic herbs may occur erroneously, when the herb is incorrectly identied, or deliberately for economic reasons when a cheaper herb is supplied to replace a safer, more ex-pensiveone.Themostwidelypublicised reportswerethecluster of cases of rapidly progressive interstitial neph- ritis in Belgium (Vanhaelen et al., 1994). Following investigation, this problem was attributed to the sub-stitution of Aristolochia fangchi instead of the CM herb Stephania tetrandra in a combined slimming regimen that included some orthodox medications. Aristolochicacid from Aristolochia fangchi is a known nephrotoxin, and the other orthodox drugs present such as aceta- zolamide in the slimming medication could have poten-1366 K. Chan / Chemosphere 52 (2003) 1361-1371tiated this toxic eect. Most of the cases involved were young women, and some developed irreversible end- stage renal failure and/or carcinoma in the urinary tract. 3.2.2. The consequence of processing of CM crude herbs All CM herbs are processed or prepared from fresh after collection with appropriate procedures before use. The processing, apart from cleaning and preservingpurposes, removes or reduces the toxic components in the unprocessed crude herbs which when taken alone will cause fatal eects. Certain processing changes theeects of some herbs. For example, raw Radix Reh- manniae is mainly used to purge heat, or cool the blood and promote the generation of body fluids. But Radix Rehmanniae Preparata has a warm property and is es- pecially eective for enriching blood. After processing the therapeutic eects of some herbs will be enhanced. For example, Rhizoma Corydalis processed with vinegar has greater analgesic eect. If the supplied herbs in the market of developed countries have not been processed properly could lead to toxicity, especially so when usedwithout composite prescriptions (Chan, 2002). 3.2.3. The quantity of CM herbs prescribed This refers to the dosage of each herb used in the composite prescriptions--(Fu-Fang) and depends onhow well trained and experienced is the practitioner who prescribes. General guidelines are listed in each of the monographs of CM herbs and composite formulae asreference for use. Thus overdosing should be avoided. This is also related to the quality of herbs supplied. Potentorpoisonousherbs,ifnotproperlyprocessedandchecked, will produce adverse eects even when used as components in composite formulae. 3.2.4. The likelihood for interaction of drug-CM products interactions Reportshavereviewed potential interactionsbetween herbal medicines and drugs. These have focused mainly on the herbs used in the west especially for ginseng andginkgo biloba, which are widely used in Asian countries. Ginseng has been reported to interact with phenelzine and other monoamine inhibitors causing a central ner-vous system (CNS) stimulant eect (Jones and eect of warfarin was de- creased ginseng was taken simultaneously(Janetzky and Morreale, 1997). Digoxin levels were ele-vated in a patient who took a preparation labeled as Siberian ginseng, Eleuthero coccus senticosus , (McRae, 1999), but there were no signs of toxic eects. We re-ported the clinical observations on interactions between some popular CM herbs and warfarin with experimental animal studies. Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) had eects on both the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokineties of warfarin in rats (Lo et al., 1992), whereas danggui (Angelica sinensis) aected the pharmacodynamics butnot the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in rabbits (Lo et al., 1995). However, there are very few publications in the En- glish language that report interactions between CMsubstances and orthodox drugs. We have recently com- piled a list of CM and drug interactions (Chan and Cheung, 2000). We have also observed that not all in-teractions between CM products and orthodox drugs are harmful; some were benecial when both CM products and OM drugs are combined. All commonlyused CHM crude herbs and ready-made CM products have been listed against orthodox drugs for warning of likely and clinically important herb-drug interactions. 3.3. The conditions of the patients 'welling being and disease state Manypatientsareveryillbythetimetheyconsultthe CM practitioners. Some would consider CM treatment as their last hope for recovery. The incidents of adverseeects could be higher in this group of patients. Because of the aging processes many elderly patients would have compromised body functions; in particular, the cardio-vascular system, liver function, and renal function. Moreover many of these patients have been undergone poly-pharmacy scheme of drug treatments. Thereforethe likelihood for occurrence of drug-CHM products interactions is relatively high in this subgroup. 4. Literature reports on the presence of heavy metals, pesticides,and orthodox drugs in herbal products Contamination or adulteration of CM products with heavy metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, or thallium is of concern. A number of case reports havebeenpublished(Wu,1992;Wongetal.,1993;Uengetal., 1997; Liang et al., 1998; Au et al., 2000; Koh and Woo, 2000), and the problem was discussed in the followingsections. However some CM products do contain heavymetals as essential ingredients. The poor quality control of these products causes health hazard as some products may present unusually high concentrations of potentand poisonous ingredients that could lead to fatality if consumed. The presence of pesticides, excessive micro- bialgrowthandorthodoxdrugsinsomeherbalproductshas been reported: A review article (Koh and Woo, 2000) with 58 refer- ences reported excessive toxic heavy metals and un- declared drugs in Chinese proprietary medicines (CPM) in Singapore between 1990 and 1997. Thenames, uses, toxic heavy metals or drugs detectedand the year of detection are tabulated. Information on the brand or manufacturer /C213s name are pro- vided whenever available. The public and health careK. Chan / Chemosphere 52 (2003) 1361-1371 1367professionals should be better informed of the basic concept of traditional CM and its usefulness, as well asthe potential adverse eects associated with its use.Greater control over the safety and quality of CPMcould be achieved through GMP, regulatory control, research, education, reporting usage of Chinese med- icine (as in drug history) as well as reporting of ad-verse events. Lead, arsenic, mercury and any undeclared drugs have been detected in CPM using ICP/MS and atom-ic absorption spectroscopy. A database for the CPM was established and used to educate the public, the herbal industry and medical professionals (Au et al.,2000). In a research report (Liang et al., 1998), the authors measured various metallic elements by atomic ab-sorption spectrophotometer (K, Na, Mg, Ca, Fe,Cu, Zn, Mn, Co, Cr, Ni, Mo and heavy metals As, Pb, and Cd) in some Chinese herbal medicines. The results showed: Lonicera japonica Thunberg dry flow- ers(each100g)hadpotassiumion1.11g,magnesium ion 9.43 mg, copper ion 2.76 mg, zinc ion 5.06 mg, Radix Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fischer et DC /C213s (each 100 g) had magnesium ion 37.2 mg, calcium ion 358.8 mg, heavy metals detected in Lonicera japonica Thunberg 's dry flos andRadix Morinda ocinalis How 's(each 100 g), the arsenic ion was over 10 mg. A review (Ueng et al., 1997) with 51 references sum- marized the toxicity of some commonly used tradi-tional CMs in terms of acute, systematic, genetic,analytic, and clinical toxicology. Acute toxicity study showedthatherbalmedicinesandtheirchemicalcon- stituents exhibited LD50 values ranging from thepracticallynon-toxictosuper-toxiccategories.Target organs of traditional CM-induced toxicity investi- gated including liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract,nervous, and cardiovascular systems. Some TCM showed mutagenicity by the Ames test, increased the incidence of unscheduled DNA synthesis, micro-nucleus formation, and chromosomal aberration incytogenetic assays. Some TCM products were con- taminated with pesticides and heavy metals andadul- terated with western drugs. Improper dispensing anduse of traditional CMs and individual idiosyncracy may result in adverse eects and fatalities. The paper suggested that future TCM research, new drug devel-opment, and safety evaluation should require ade- quate toxicity testing and mechanistic toxicological studies. A research article (Wong et al., 1993) reported the concentrations of nine heavy metals, cadmium, co- balt, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead, zinc,and mercury in 42 Chinese herbal medicinal (CHM)plants spectrophotometrically. Generally, the sam- ples contained, relative to the other trace metals, higher concentrations of iron, manganese, and zinc.The concentration range of the metals was compara- ble to that reported in many of the East Asian vege- tables and fruits. A few samples contained relativelyhigher concentrations of toxic metals such as cad-mium, lead, and mercury. This report suggested that the presence of heavy metals was probably caused by contamination during air-drying and preservation. A review (Wu, 1992), with 45 references, reported studies of metabolism and toxicity of trace elements and revealed important interactions between heavymetals (Cd, Pb, and Hg) and some essential trace el- ements such as Zn, Fe, Se, Cu, Cr, and Mn. In gen- eral, a deciency of these essential trace elementsincreased the toxicity of heavy metals, whereas excess appeared to be protective. These suggest that the presence of the dietary essential trace elements maycontribute to the protection of man from the detri-mental eect of heavy metal exposure, while their de- ciency may increase toxicity. Some traditional Chinesedrugsareespeciallyrichinessentialtraceele-ments. Appropriate use of these CM materials in dietarymanipulationmightbevaluableinthepreven- tion and treatment of heavy metal poisoning andmaintenance of healthy conditions. 5. Conclusion: the way forward for assurance of quality, safety and ecacy of herbal medicines 5.1. Basic research on herbal medicines Although herbal medicines have been used in clinical practice for thousands of years, basic research pro-grammes on CM substances should be focused on the toxicity and ecacy relationship for those potent and poisonous herbal substances according to the principlesas practiced in Chinese medicine with doses applied forcomposite formulae. To overcome those environment factors that are re- lated to contaminations from pesticide residues andheavy metals there should be control measures to im- plement necessary standard operating procedures (SOP) for GAP and Good Sourcing Practice (GSP) at source.GLP and GMP are also needed to produce good quality medicinal products from herbal or natural sources. Due to the particular concern of toxicity, poor qualityandadulterationofready-madeherbalmedicinalproducts in the market the priority of research on product-related treatment, in particular herbal products, istoensureQSEoftheendproductsusedbyconsumers.For the majority of cases, the biologically active chem- ical compounds of these products are unknown even other known chemical entities have been isolated. It hasalso been shown that single compound isolated from organic solvents is either too toxic or with no thera- peutic activities. Most traditional medicinal herbs are1368 K. Chan / Chemosphere 52 (2003) 1361-1371used in the form of an aqueous decoction. Therefore research projects should be centred on development of analytical and biological procedures for use to give thequality assurance and control, and clinical assessment ofecacy and safety of these products. I have been in- volved with institutes in China to develop procedures linking analytical with bio-activity patterns or nger-printings follow by fuzzy logic computing techniques for interpretation on CM herbs and herbal prescriptions (ocialFu-Fangmixturesofseveralherbs,administeredas decoction). After a series of /C212training set /C213inputs authenticated aqueous herbal extracts, individual herbsormixturesofherbs,a /C212standard /C213patternisusedas the reference guide for subsequent assessment. This type of approaches will generate patterns as reference and for prediction and recognition purposes for further researchon individual pure active chemical entities (Chan et al.,1995). 5.2. Regulatory aspects All CM or other ethnic herbal products when sup- plied, as medications, should be regulated for safety,quality and for appropriate evidence of ecacy. It ad-vocates the establishment of a new category of licensed herbal medicines, prepared in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Procedures (cGMP), which meetstandards of safety and quality, and which are regulated bylocalgovernment healthdepartment thatshouldhave reciprocating arrangements with organizations such asthe Medicines Control Agency in the UK, FDA in the USA and those in the European Union. The licensing requirements in this new category (i.e. herbal medicines) may not be as demanding as those currently apply to licensed medicines. Specically, the ''level ofproof''ofactivitymaynotneedtobeashigh asfor onthebasisofdocumentation oftraditional use overalong period, as suggested by WHO. Safety may deem to have been demonstrated by vir- tue of traditional use. However, these products ought to be required to substantiate a history of safe use, pref- erably in the EU for the dosage and indications fortreatment to be approved, and the license should clearly indicate the inappropriate conditions of use (contra- indications). It would be dangerous to agree productsafety as the basic, default position. In addition, the''test of time'' criterion detects common acute adverse events, but not rare adverse events or those with a long latency.Also,today /C213susersofherbalremediesmaydier from those in earlier eras. The governmental departments in China, such as State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicineand State Food and Drug Administration, issue regu- lations and registration guidelines and procedures for CHM products. Consultation with these guidelines willhelp to set up regulations in the UK or other developed countries for CHM products. Consultation of the Commission E structure from Germany will also help toformulate Regulatory Guidelines for herbal products asmedicines. There is a need for regulation on the quality assur- ance of both practitioners and products-related treat-ment involving herbal products for medicinal uses. In the case of CHM products in the UK nearly all of them are imported. Some are /C212manufactured /C213from imported dried granules by small herbal rms. They are crude herbs and ready-made products of well-used prescrip- tion products. Quality assurance and control of thesehave been loose and unsatisfactory. They reach the UK market probably as food or under the nutritional cate- gory. There is a lack of expertise in checking the identityof herbs. Language problem is another aspect as herbalingredientsare suppliedwith similarly namedsubstitutes thatcould be toxic. Appropriate regulations may help to sort out problems on the quality assurance and controlissues. One way of giving guidelines for regulation is to spell out monographic control of imported herbs and herbalproducts. For some herbs used in the EU there are monographs issued for all of them in common use. The Commission E in Germany has produced standardmonographs for controlling herbal medicines. ESCOP has commissioned the writing of standards for over 50 European herbs. With quality of herbal medicinalproducts assured the ecacy of them can be assessed byrandomised clinical trials (RCT) before licenses can be issued. The drawback of such procedures will certainly single out /C212cow-boy /C213practice, but also discourage man- ufacturers to register their products as medicines due to the high cost for getting the licences. An alternative approach should be found without compromising theissue on QSE of these products. References Abbot, N.C., White, A.R., Ernst, E., 1996. Complementary medicine. Nature 381, 361.
