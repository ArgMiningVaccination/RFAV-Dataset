Aromatherapy offers many solutions to boost our immune systems to help us fight off any respiratory and gastric illnesses looking for a place to land during the fall and winter months. Using aromatherapy to boost the immune system can be a strong addition to your other methods of staying healthy during cold and flu season. Here are a few essential oils and ways to use them that can be helpful to support the immune system and relieve symptoms of illness. Eucalyptus (globulus or radiata) Essential Oil Eucalyptus is getting popular again after being found to be quite effective at relieving symptoms for older children and adults with coughs and colds due to sinus congestion, sore throat, and nasal congestion. It is a popular ingredient in many over the counter products offered for respiratory and sinus relief, as well as relief for muscle soreness and joint pain. This powerful healing oil is great diffused or added to a carrier oil and [applied topically](https://www.benandme.com/eucalyptus-essential-oil-natural-vapor-rub/) to the chest and neck for respiratory congestion. You can also add eucalyptus to a spray bottle of water, shake well, and use as a spray throughout your room or area for an instant pick-me-up during those times when allergies cause sinuses to become congested. Just make sure if using it in a spray that you shake it really well with every use to ensure the oil distributes evenly. In general, eucalyptus is a wonderful oil to have on hand because it can be used for so many different things and is a real workhorse when it comes to fighting infections and illness. While it is an effective decongestant and expectorant, this oil should not be used on pets or children under 10 years of age, so do note that especially before you use it as a spray. It should also be avoided or used cautiously if you have asthma or seizures. Cajeput Oil Ever heard of cajeput oil? This oil comes from the cajeput tree, an evergreen native to Australia. It has many uses, including reducing pain when applied topically, treating acne, bronchitis, colds/flu, common cold sores, coughs (including chronic coughs), insect bites, respiratory inflammation, toothaches, muscle sores, fevers, and rashes. It has anti-inflammatory properties and can be combined with eucalyptus oil to make a very effective natural remedy you can use to help relieve congestion, nasal stuffiness, and muscle aches. While not as well known as its counterparts, [tea tree](https://www.benandme.com/everyday-uses-for-melaleuca-tea-tree-oil-and-an-acne-treatment-serum-recipe/) or eucalyptus, this oil is just as powerful in the fight against illness, irritation of the throat and bronchial passages, inflammation of mucous membranes, and upper respiratory infections such as coughs, laryngitis, sinusitis, and bronchitis. It's a little safer to use as it won't irritate your pets but you still want to apply caution when it comes to young kids. Always dilute cajeput oil before using it on the skin. This makes it much safer and can help you avoid discomfort or burning sensations. Mix cajeput oil with coconut oil and eucalyptus oil for a fantastic immune-boosting massage blend before bedtime to relieve congestion and relax your body. Fir Needle Oil Fir Needle oil is derived from the fir tree and has a very crisp, woodsy scent. It is an anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, astringent, diuretic, expectorant, decongestant. It can be used for colds and flu symptoms such as fever, chills, respiratory infections such as bronchitis and sinus infection due to its anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties which also make it helpful in relieving pain. This oil can be diffused or applied topically with carrier oils or salves to help your immune system fight bacterial and viral infections that lead to congestion in the lungs. It is also a very calming oil that is often used to purify the air through distillation. You'll be pleased to learn that this oil can be used on young children 2+ and is safe to use while pregnant and breastfeeding, of course on advice from your medical professional. It is not pet safe.

Do not ingest unless working with a qualified practitioner. Keep essential oils away from children.
