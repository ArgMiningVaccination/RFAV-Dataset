If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission or other tangible benefit. Optum Store, Optum Perks, and Healthline Media are owned by RVO Health. Here's our process. How we vet brands and products Healthline only shows you brands and products that we stand behind. Our team thoroughly researches and evaluates the recommendations we make on our site. To establish that the product manufacturers addressed safety and efficacy standards, we: Evaluate ingredients and composition: Do they have the potential to cause harm? Fact-check all health claims: Do they align with the current body of scientific evidence? Assess the brand: Does it operate with integrity and adhere to industry best practices? We do the research so you can find trusted products for your health and wellness. Finding the best vitamin brands means looking at third-party testing, certifications, ingredients, and brand integrity. We did, and our pick for overall best vitamin brand is Thorne. If you're unable to meet your nutritional needs through your diet alone, supplements can be a convenient and effective way to do so. That said, not all vitamin and mineral supplements are created equal. Some products may contain fillers, additives, and unhealthy ingredients that can do more harm than good when it comes to your health. It's important to choose a reputable brand with products that have undergone extensive testing, ideally by a third-party lab, and are sourced from high quality ingredients. Doing so can ensure that you're getting a supplement that's pure and potent and that your body can use it efficiently. Here are the 14 best vitamin brands to help meet your nutritional needs, as well as the criteria we used to choose them. When researching the best vitamin brands, we considered the following factors: Quality testing: We prioritized brands with products that have undergone testing to ensure purity and potency, ideally by an independent lab. Certifications: We looked for brands that offer products with additional certifications, such as NSF Certified Safe for Sport, non-GMO verified, or certified gluten-free or vegan. Ingredients: We chose brands that prioritize the use of high quality ingredients and easily absorbed forms of vitamins and minerals. The brands below also avoid or limit the use of artificial flavors, fillers, and preservatives. Price: While the products included vary in price, each brand offers supplements that provide a good value. Additionally, the vitamin brands on our list have been vetted to ensure they align with Healthline's brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. As part of our vetting process, we made sure each product: adheres to allowable health claims and labeling requirements, per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations is manufactured in facilities that adhere to standards established by the FDA Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) is produced by a medically credible company that follows ethical, legal, and industry best standards Best overall vitamin brand Certifications: Thorne manufacturing facility certified by NSF and TGA, some products NSF Certified for Sport, some products third-party tested for purity and potency Products: multivitamins, letter vitamins, minerals, herbs, prental vitamins, probiotics, fish oil and omega-3 supplements, fiber, collagen powders, protein powders, creatine, other specialty supplement formulations Healthline's review Why we chose it: Thorne offers a wide range of supplements and adheres to strict manufacturing standards to ensure quality and label accuracy. Company details: Thorne is a supplement company that uses high quality ingredients free of contaminants, fillers, and heavy metals. All Thorne products are manufactured in a facility that's certified by NSF International and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the regulatory body in Australia that's responsible for assessing the safety of supplements. According to the company, all products are tested multiple times throughout the manufacturing practice, either in house or by third-party labs, to ensure purity and potency. Plus, Thorne makes more than 30 products that are NSF Certified Safe for Sport. Thorne offers a variety of products, including protein powders, multivitamins, probiotics, and fish oils. The company also provides supplements designed to support healthy aging, bone and joint health, immune function, and energy levels. In fact, Thorne Women's Multi 50+ was featured as the best multivitamin for women older than 50 years in Healthline's roundup of the best multivitamins for women's health. This product contains several essential nutrients in highly absorbable forms, including magnesium malate, a chelated form of magnesium. Research suggests that, compared with other forms of magnesium, chelated magnesium may be better tolerated and more easily absorbed by the body. Many supplements from Thorne are vegan and free of gluten, soy, or dairy, although this may depend on the specific product you select.

All the brand's products are free of unnecessary fillers and additives, as well as GMOs and many common allergens.

In addition to single nutrient supplements, Pure Encapsulations offers products for digestive health, immune support, brain function, hormone balance, and more.

Company details: NOW is a family-owned company that focuses on producing budget-friendly supplements free of GMOs and artificial ingredients. The company's supplements are manufactured in facilities certified by UL Solutions, a third-party company that inspects facilities to ensure that they comply with good manufacturing practices and tests products for label accuracy.

The company also offers a variety of single nutrient supplements, such as NOW Foods Chewable Vitamin D3 5,000 IU, which was selected as one of Healthline's best vitamin D supplements. This product contains vitamin D3, which has been shown to be more effective than vitamin D2 at increasing blood levels of vitamin D and improving vitamin D status. What our tester says \"I was recommended a vitamin B supplement from NOW by a trusted healthcare professional. I found the product to be a good price for the quality of the supplement. \"However, because I was experiencing an unpleasant reflux sensation after taking the supplement, I ultimately switched to a different brand.\" \u2014 Crystal Hoshaw, Healthline senior associate editor \"I was recommended a vitamin B supplement from NOW by a trusted healthcare professional.

Company details: Llama Naturals offers a selection of flavored gummy vitamins specifically for children, including multivitamins, prebiotics, probiotics, and supplements featuring ingredients like vitamin D. For example, the brand's Plant-Based Multivitamin contains a blend of 13 vitamins and phytonutrients, which are naturally flavored and made with real fruit. As registered dietitian and health coach Brenda Peralta points out, gummy supplements could be a good option for young children who may have trouble taking pills. Just make sure to keep the bottle safely out of reach. Not only is each supplement from Llama Naturals certified organic, but all products are also plant-based and free of added sugar and artificial ingredients. The label on some products state there is \"added sugar from organic fruit.\" We've reached out to the brand to clarify, but we assume this is from the juice listed on the ingredients list. According to the company, the gummies are slow-cooked at a low heat to retain their flavor and phytonutrients while increasing absorption. Furthermore, all products undergo third-party testing to ensure label accuracy and are backed by a money-back guarantee. Be sure to use products only as directed and talk with your pediatrician before starting supplementation if you have any concerns. Pros & cons all products are third-party tested for purity and potency all products certified organic, plant-based, and free of added sugar and artificial ingredients gummies made with real fruit and naturally flavored relatively affordable and easy to find adult supplement formulations also available only offers gummy vitamins limited variety of supplements all products are third-party tested for purity and potency all products certified organic, plant-based, and free of added sugar and artificial ingredients gummies made with real fruit and naturally flavored relatively affordable and easy to find adult supplement formulations also available only offers gummy vitamins limited variety of supplements Best prenatal vitamin brand Certifications: third-party tested for purity and potency Products: prenatal vitamins, fish oil, fertility supplements, men's multivitamin, other specialty supplement formulations Healthline's review Why we chose it: FullWell supplements are produced in a UL Solutions certified facility, batch-tested for quality, and provide comprehensive formulations to support a safe and healthy pregnancy. Company details: Founded by dietitian and fertility nutrition expert Ayla Barmmer, FullWell specializes in producing prenatal vitamins designed to provide support before, during, and after pregnancy. Though the brand recently began offering a supplement to promote men's fertility, a fish oil supplement, and an herbal supplement to promote relaxation, the signature Prenatal Vitamin is still its most popular product. This supplement provides many nutrients that are essential for promoting a healthy pregnancy, including folate, vitamin D, and vitamin B12. It also contains choline. According to women's health dietitian Coral Edelson, MS, RD, this micronutrient is important for your baby's brain development and isn't found in all prenatal supplements. Other minerals found in the supplement, such as magnesium and calcium, are chelated, or bound to amino acids. This can help increase absorption. Just keep in mind that because the prenatal vitamin doesn't include omega-3 fatty acids, you'll want to purchase the company's omega-3 supplement as well. FullWell products are manufactured in a UL Solutions certified facility and batch-tested to ensure purity and potency. Plus, a certificate of analysis (COA) is available upon request. If you're pregnant or breastfeeding, always talk with a healthcare professional before taking any new supplements. What our tester says \"I subscribed to the prenatal and fish oil bundle, which I've been taking while breastfeeding. At first I was worried about taking 8 capsules per day.

Company details: As one of the leading probiotic manufacturers on the market, Culturelle is a top-notch brand trusted by consumers and healthcare professionals alike. The brand provides probiotics specifically for children, infants, and adults, along with supplements that combine probiotics with other nutrients, such as fiber, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids. One of the brand's bestselling supplements, Culturelle Daily Probiotic, is shelf-stable and 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) into each serving. Probiotics are a type of bacteria found in the gut that have been linked to a long list of health benefits, including improved immune function, enhanced digestion, and lower cholesterol levels. Culturelle products are manufactured in a facility that's certified by NSF International, and each product lot is carefully inspected prior to packaging. Most Culturelle supplements are also free of common allergens, such as dairy, soy, and gluten, making them great options for those with food allergies.

There are several factors to consider when determining which vitamin brand is right for you, including: Personal needs: Consider your health goals and look for a brand that offers products catered to your needs. For example, some brands provide products specifically for athletes, while others focus on meeting the needs of children, teens, or pregnant people. Brand reputation: Choose a product from a well established, reputable brand that's compliant with CGMPs established by the FDA. Testing: Look for products that are tested to ensure purity and potency, ideally by a third-party organization. Ingredient label: Be sure to check the ingredient label and steer clear of supplements that contain large amounts of fillers, additives, and preservatives. Dietary restrictions or food allergies: Many products are certified vegan, gluten-free, or kosher, which may be a key consideration for some. Cost: Some brands are more expensive than others, so be sure to look for a company that offers products within your budget. Note that certain brands provide personalized product recommendations or convenient subscriptions, which may be a good option for some people. Third-party testing and certifications The FDA doesn't approve the safety or accuracy of individual supplement products. Instead, some brands voluntarily have their products tested by a third-party organization, such as: NSF International Labdoor Consumer Labs Eurofins Scientific Advanced Laboratories In addition to pursuing third-party testing, some supplement companies go a step further to become third-party certified. Certifications, such as NSF Certified and USP Verified, indicate that the supplement company's products and facilities have been audited and tested by the third-party organization to ensure purity, potency, and safe manufacturing processes. Others, including NSF Certified Safe for Sport and Informed Sport, confirm that a product is free of substances banned in competitive sports. Keep in mind that some companies have third-party certified facilities, but their products aren't third-party tested for purity and potency. Other products may be third-party certified to ensure that they're appropriate for vegans or free of specific allergens or ingredients, such as gluten. What is the best name brand for vitamins?

Be sure to consider these factors to find the best brand of vitamins to fit your needs and health goals. Who makes the highest quality multivitamin? There are many companies that make high quality multivitamins, including several of the brands featured above, such as Ritual and Nordic Naturals. Look for brands that offer multivitamins catered to your needs, and opt for products that use high quality ingredients and are rigorously tested, ideally by an independent lab. How do you know if a vitamin is good quality? To evaluate the quality of a vitamin, check the ingredients label and look for products that are free of fillers, additives, and artificial ingredients. If possible, look for a vitamin that's tested or certified by a third party and buy from brands that are transparent about how their products are sourced and manufactured. It's also a good idea to ensure a product is using the most bioavailable forms of ingredients, which are better absorbed by the body. Given the myriad of vitamins and minerals on the market, it can be tricky to determine which products are worth their price tags. Buying from reputable retailers and looking for vitamins made with high quality ingredients can help ensure that you're getting the best supplement possible. Checking the ingredient label and looking for products that have undergone third-party testing can also help you get the most bang for your buck. "}
