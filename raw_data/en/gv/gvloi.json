Homeopathic medicines, also known as remedies, have a documented history of effectively treating diseases and conditions ranging from musculoskeletal, to metabolic, to psychological. While homeopathy is known to be safe, and without toxic side effects as compared with pharmaceutical drugs, its reputation as a gentle healing technique must not distract us from the fact that it can powerfully treat severe pathologies. For instance homeopathy proved to be successful during cholera and flu epidemics in the late 1800s and the 1918 Spanish Flu outbreak, when pharmaceuticals failed to offer any comparable life saving benefits. Homeopathy is based on the principle of like cures like (simila similibus curentur). It was discovered and developed over 200 years ago by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in Europe. While reading a manuscript about the use of quinine (derived from cinchona bark) to treat malaria, in which quinine's healing effects were attributed to its bitter quality, Hahnemann found this explanation unacceptable. He dosed himself with cinchona bark and developed the symptoms of malaria, alternating chills and fever. Malaria is caused by a protozoa transmitted into the bloodstream through the bite of a mosquito. Hahnemann's symptoms were induced by the substance that was used to treat malaria. While homeopathy has been used worldwide to treat colds and flu, injuries such as sprains, bone fractures, and concussions, internal medicine conditions such as asthma, allergies and cystitis; gynecological issues including painful and excessive menstruation, ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, PMS, infertility, and menopausal symptoms; male issues including prostatitis, sexual dysfunction, andropause; immune system dysfunctions such as allergies, autoimmune diseases, chemical sensitivities, and cancer; mental and emotional problems including depression and anxiety, post traumatic stress disorders, insomnia and eating disorders. Homeopathic remedies can treat simple maladies such as cold, flu and injuries but its most sophisticated and impressive use can be found through constitutional treatment, curing deep, long-term health issues. In classical homeopathy, we select the single remedy which will best cure a person of their deepest and typically long-standing or chronic imbalances. We treat serious physical pathology as well as deep rooted mental and emotional issues. To practice homeopathy successfully requires years of study of the medicines in books called material medica (medical materials or substances); The Repertory, the book of symptoms and diseases which also documents which medicines have historical clinical proof of curing them; cultivating the intellectual and intuitive skills to interview and interpret the patient and what is most important and fundamental to be cured; and matching the gestalt of the disease(s) with the correct homeopathic medicine (or remedies), along with nonpathogenic individual characteristics such as food cravings, sleep and lifestyle habits, dreams, even hobbies and artistic aspirations.
