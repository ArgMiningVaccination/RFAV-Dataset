DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: On behalf of the Federal Council on the Aging, I am pleased to submit the 1977 Annual Report of the Federal Council on the Aging. As you know, the President asked me to serve as Chairman of the Council effective July 1 to succeed Bertha S. Adkins. Miss Adkins has continued as a member of the Council and her continued service assured the smooth functioning of the Council in carrying out our congressionally-mandated role as advocate for older Americans to the executive and legislative branches of Government. The report summarizes the various positions taken by the Council on a number of legislative issues, some of which are still pending in the Congress and some which have yet to be addressed. We hope the Council's views will be considered as the second session of the 95th Congress reconvenes. We appreciate the continuing support and interest of the Special Committee on Aging and look forward to another year of cooperative efforts with committee members and staff toward our mutual goal of service to older Americans. Sincerely, NELSON H. CRUIKSHANK Chairman. [Enclosure.] PREFACE LEGISLATIVE MANDATE The Federal Council on the Aging was created by the Congress under provisions of the 1973 amendments to the Older Americans Act, for the purpose of advisingthe President, the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Wel- fare, the Commissioner on Aging and the Congress on matters relating to the special needs of older Americans.The Older Americans Act directs the Federal Council on the Aging to perform the following functions: 1. Advise and assist the President on matters relating to the special needs of older Americans; 2. assist the commissioner in making the appraisal of the Nation's existing and future personnel needs in the field of aging;3. review and evaluate on a continuing basis, Federal policies regarding the aging and programs and other activities affecting the aging conducted or assisted by all Federal departments and agencies for the purpose of appraising their value and their impact on the lives of older Americans;4. serve as a spokesman on behalf of older Americans by making recommenda-tions to the President, to the Secretary, the Commissioner, and to the Congress with respect to Federal policies regarding the aging and federally conducted or assisted programs and other activities related to or affecting them;5. inform the public about the problems and needs of the aging, in consultationwith the National Clearing House on Aging, by collecting and disseminatinginformation, conducting or commissioning studies and publishing the results thereof, and by issuing publications and reports; and6. provide public forums for discussion and publicizing the problems and needs of the aging and obtaining information relating thereto by conducting public hearings, and by conducting or sponsoring conferences, workshops, and other such meetings. CHAIRMANSHIP On June 6, 1977 Vice President Mondale announced that President Carterwould name Nelson H. Cruikshank as both Chairman of the Federal Council onthe Aging and Counselor on Aging to the President.Bertha S. Adkins who resigned as member and chairman effective June 30, 1977 was asked by the administration to remain as a Council member until the expiration of her term in June 1978 and consented to do so.Mr. Cruikshank took office as Chairman of the Federal Council on the Agingon July 1, 1977 and as Counselor on Aging on July 5, 1977. He has been a memberof the Council since its establishment in 1974 and served as chairman of itsCommittee on the Economics of Aging. Mr. Cruikshank was president of theNational Council of Senior Citizens from 1969 until his appointment as Counselorto the President. He was director of the Department of Social Security at theAFL-CIO in Washington from 1953 until his retirement in 1965. In announcingthe dual appointment of Nelson Cruikshank, Vice President Mondale stressedthe need for the talents and skills and the contributions of senior citizens at highlevels of government. At the July 12 meeting of the Council, members paid tribute to both MissAdkins and Mr. Cruikshank. They passed a resolution commending the Council'sfirst chairman for her service beginning June 5, 1974 and thanking her for herleadership, sincerity and dedication in guiding the Council in assuming the responsibility given by the Congress to be an advocate for older Americans.The resolution concluded: Your words of wisdom inspired a spirit of cooperiation among 15 personsfrom all over this country. We came together and developed national policyrecommendations which affect the lives of older Americans and those whowill become old. We especially appreciate your warm sense of humor whichmade our serious deliberations productive and pleasant.In noting Mr. Cruikshank's appointment by the President, the Council ex-pressed pleasure at the continuity this dual appointment would provide for majorCouncil projects and goals. These comments were communicated to the Presidentalong with the assurance to the President of the Council's continuing commitmentto advocacy for older Americans. 3 MEMBERSHIP The Council is composed of 15 members nominated by the President and con- firmed by the Senate. The Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Commissioner on Aging serve as ex officio members of the Council but they do not participate in the development of recommendations by the Council because of the fact that such recommendations are made, under the law, to them, to the President, and to the Congress. Ten members of the Council are themselves older persons. They and the other members are representative of national organizations with an interest in aging, business, labor, and the general public as called for in the law.

MAJOR COUNCIL ACTIONS OVERVIEW This annual report marks the fourth such issuance by the Federal Council onthe Aging. It describes the Council's activities during 1977 and with its predecessorreports chronicles the activities and views of 15 citizens charged with being advo-cates for older Americans to the executive and legislative branches of government since 1974. Because the Council has now been in operation for almost 4 years, it has builtup a series of continuing issues and projects which extend beyond a narrow interestor the 1-year span of an annual report. These \"projects\", usually involving out- side studies, consultants and contractors are the Council's way of identifying and addressing emerging issues or those which do not lend themselves to short- term responses to initiatives by the Congress and the administration. These projects are described elsewhere in this report. The remainder of this section records the Council's actions on matters which were deemed of importance to the elderly in 1977. It represents the Council's bestefforts to utilize its resources and collective experience. Selecting these priorities was and will continue to be a difficult process for the Council when there are somany issues of vital importance to this Nation's older citizens. CODIFICATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACT FCA Chairman Bertha S. Adkins, on January 4, 1977, recommended that Congress take action to codify the Social Security Act. Members of the Council were of the belief that codification would be of great assistance in administering the social security program and would improve the understanding of the pro- visions of the act by millions of older persons who either receive or wish to apply to receive benefits under the Social Security Act. Letters were sent to the Vice President and to the Speaker of the House urging that the Senate and House undertake a review of the many amendments to the Social Security Act over the past 40 years which make the act extremely complex to administer and interpret. The matter was also brought to the attention of the administration. HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano, Jr. replied that he did not believe that a codification of the Social Security Act would necessarily simplify its administra- tion or make it more understandable to persons affected by its programs. Codifica- tion might result in some simplification for those people whose job requires them to work directly with the statutory language, but codification would not, the Secretary held, make substantive changes in the requirements of the act that would assist beneficiaries in general. SOCIAL SECURITY ADVISORY COUNCIL As a result of Council action at its March meeting, Chairman Adkins wrote to HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano, Jr. expressing the interest of the Council in the quadrennial Social Security Advisory Council to be appointed to review the status of the several trust funds maintained by the Social Security Administration in relation to the long term commitments of the social security old age and survivors, disability and medicare trust funds and the impact of the programs on the public assistance programs that are a part of the Social Security Act. The FCA hoped that the Social Security Adivsory Council would address: The relationship of the supplemental security income program to the social security retirement benefit as an adequate income floor for older Americans. The impact of the practice of government retirees not covered by social security, entering into covered employment and thereby establishing eligi- bility for social security retirement benefits on the basis of short-term employment. The relationship of private pensions to social security retirement benefits and the impact of private pensions on the adequacy of total retirement income with special attention to the problems of workers with life-long low earnings records. A continuation of the work of prior councils to study ways to remove inequities based upon sex and race in social security benefits. HEW Secretary Califano expressed appreciation for the views of the FederalCouncil on the Aging and for any Council study materials which could be of rele-vance to the work of the Social Security Advisory Council. SOCIAL SECURITY FINANCING On March 14, 1977 the Council brought to the attention of HEW SecretaryCalifano, and appropriate Senate and House Committee chairmen, Council efforts,dating from a letter to the President on December 3, 1975, to stress the importanceof the long- and short-term issues of financing the social security system. TheCouncil said that \". ..the decoupling issue is of a long-term nature though it hasan immediate influence on the public's attitude towards the system.\"\"Under the present automatic benefit increase provisions of the act, in a situa-tion when both wages and prices had risen steadily, future workers would in effect,get a double upward adjustment of their retirement. This would occur because theimpact of the rising wages and rising prices would be entered twice in the com-putation of the benefit-once in the determination of the average wage on whichbenefit amounts are based and again by adjusting the amount for rising prices. Inthe long run, this would result in paying present workers unjustifiably highbenefits when they retire-a situation neither foreseen nor intended by Congress.\"The Council recommended that the Congress act to amend the Social SecurityAct to correct this inequitable feature of the system.In May, President Carter proposed far-reaching measures to strengthen thefinancing of the social security system. The Council expressed unanimous supportfor these at their quarterly meeting that month. A major element of administra-tion proposals was to compensate trust funds from general revenues for a shareof social security payroll taxes lost when unemployment is 6 percent or higher.The Council also agreed that increasing the taxable wage base is preferable to anincrease in the rate on wages saving: \" ...the removal of the ceiling on the em-ployer wage tax is also preferable to an increase on the tax rate on workers' wages.It provides the employer with a tax credit that workers would not receive.\"As this important piece of legislation moved through the Congress, an issuewhich was not included in the administration's proposals emerged, namely, the\"retirement test\". This test establishes the amount that can be earned in wagesor self-employment by a person otherwise eligible for social security retirementbenefits and still be considered retired.The House of Representatives eliminated the retirement test for those over age65 by 1982. The Senate voted to retain the retirement test except for people overage 70 and liberalized it for those under 70 increasing the wage limit to $4,500 in1978, $6,000 in 1979 and by increases in the average wage thereafter.The Federal Council on the Aging reviewed the House and Senate bills at theirDecember meeting and passed the following motion:The Federal Council on the Aging recommends the retention of the retire-ment test for social security beneficiaries with the liberalizations in the billpassed by the Senate. The FCA correspondence to Congressman Al Ullman and Senator Russell Longas Cochairmen of the Joint Senate-House Conference Committee on Social SecurityFinancing Amendments stressed the Council's concern about the cost of removingthe retirement test and the increased tax burden this would place on younger low-and middle-income workers while those benefiting would be a group among theelderly who are relatively in a more favorable financial position.The Social Security Amendments of 1977 ultimately passed by the Congresson December 15, included the Senate provisions for retaining the retirement testand reducing the age at which the test no longer applies from 72 to 70. Houseprovisions for raising the earnings limit to $4,000 in 1978 and $500 annual incre-ments to $6,000 in 1982 and indexed to earnings thereafter were also adopted.The Congress also corrected the decoupling situation by reestablishing benefitsat replacement rates which are assured for the future in terms of increases inaverage wages. This ratio will not result in excessive drain on the system but willat the same time maintain benefits geared to improved productivity in the economyand maintaining a wage replacement ratio. OLDER AMERICANS ACT In recognizing the Older Americans Act as a major Federal law affecting thelives of the elderly, the Council has continuously reviewed the implementation ofthe law and made recommendations for improvement from time to time. In prep-aration for the major review of the act which will take place in 1978 when re- 6 authorization is required, the Council took a number of actions during 1977 whichwere conveyed to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Com-missioner on Aging who have major responsibility to develop the administration'sposition. The major guidance the Council is proposing to the Congress and the Admin-istration at this time is that the level of authorization for all programs under theOlder Americans Act be increased to meet the needs of the growing elderly popu-lation. The Council believes there should be continued support for the role andconcept of the State and area agencies on aging as set forth in the current legisla-tion. The major change which the Council is proposing is the return of the nationalolder American volunteer programs to the Administration on Aging from ACTION.The rest of this section describes certain amendments which the Council believeswill improve the Older Americans Act without affecting its current major thrusts.Since the Federal Council on the Aging is established by a provision of theOlder Americans Act, the Council reviewed its enabling legislation as part of itsevaluation which took place this year. Apart from the obvious need to deletereferences in the act to studies which have been completed, the Council agreedto recommend that the following section be added to title II, section 205:In performing its functions under this act, the Council may utilize theservices and facilities of any agency of the Federal Government and of anyother public or nonprofit agency or organization in accordance with agree-ments betweens between the Council and the head thereof; and be authorizedto pay therefor, in advance or by way of reimbursement, as may be providedin the agreement. The Council continued to recommend that the act be amended to allow theDirector of the National Institute on Aging to be an ex officio member of the Coun-cil as are the Secretary of HEW and the Commissioner on Aging.Other major positions which the Council has taken during the year and dis-tributed to both the administration and the Congress include the following:Title I, Declaration of objectives: Substitute the Federal Council's BicentennialCharter. Title II, Administration on Aging: National Clearing House for the Aging-broaden the language to include data collection, characteristics of the elderly,research findings, current programs serving older persons, analyses, disseminationand publication. Title III, State and community programs: Delete section 302(l)(E) and substitute the following: \"services designed toprovide older persons with appropriate high quality medical and social care bothin the community and in institutions.\" Delete (H) and substitute the following: \"services designed to develop jobsfor older persons, job referral and followup for those who want to continue towork.\" (H) then becomes (I). Section 303(b)(2) area planning and social service programs. Amend the Stateallotment formulas by adding poverty in addition to the number of State residentsaged 60 or over as a factor in the present State allotment formulas.Section 305(b) Reaffirm position that national priorities be set from time totime in title III of the Older Americans Act but that mandatory percentages offunding restriction not be imposed. Title IV, Training and research: Part A. Section 402(a). The Commissioner onAging should consult with minority aging organizations and include in reports on existing and future personnel needs, the status of meeting the manpower needs for minority elderly. Part A. Section 403. Amend to include provisions for encouraging minority persons to enter the field of aging.Part B. Section 411. Broaden AoA research, now literally restricted to study of current patterns and conditions of living, to study of future directions.Part C. Move sections (2) and (3) to part D so these fiscal and reporting pro- cedures apply to all title IV projects. Title V, Multipurpose senior centers: Fund centers through allotment formulasrather than through grants and contracts as is presently the case; shift the admin-istration of this title from the Federal level to the State level; add the sections from title III referring to participation by Indian tribal organizations. Title VI, National older American volunteer programs (repealed): Return the foster grandparents, senior companions and RSVP programs presently admii-istered by ACTION'to AoA. Title VII, Nutrition program for the elderly: Section 706(a)(3) add the follow- ing: \"where older persons cannot attend a congregate meal site because of acute or chronic conditions, that home delivered meals be available. Criteria should be developed for participation in home delivered meals and periodic contact should be maintained to determine continuing need for home delivered meals.\" Add the sections from title III referring to participation by Indian tribal organizations. On behalf of the Council, member John Martin testified before Senate and House committees on proposals to amend title VII of the Older Americans Act to expand nutrition services to the homebound. On April 17, he told members of the House Select Committee on Aging, Subcommittee on Federal, State and Com- munity Services that the FCA shared the concern of many persons for the \"home- bound\" elderly bud did not believe that a separate \"meals-on-wheels\" program was the best approach to meet their needs in a systematic way. Mr. Martin described the Council's \"frail elderly\" proposals as an attempt to accurately determine the services most required by vulnerable older persons to maintain their independence while serving their continuing needs. (The Council's position on a National Meals-on-Wheels Act had been originally approved in September 1976.) In testimony before the Subcommittee on Aging of the Senate Committee on Human Resources on May 13, Mr. Martin expressed the Council's opposition to S. 519 and S. 1283 both of which would amend title VII of the Older Americans Act to bring about a separate \"meals-on-wheels\" program. Instead, he urged additional funding for title VII to increase the number of home-delivered meals through the existing legislation. COST-RELATED REIMBURSEMENT FOR LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES At the Council's March meeting, it was agreed to contact HEW Secretary Califano expressing concern about the delay in implementing the regulations on cost-related reimbursement for skilled nursing and intermediate care facilities in the medicaid program from July 1, 1976 to January 1, 1978. On June 8, Secretary Califano replied: \". ..nothing in the regulation discourages the State from implementing the statute immediately. The department has not delayed imple- mentation of the effective date of section 249; it has merely committed itself, for a limited time, not to impose on the States a particular sanction entirely within its discretion. This decision does not change the effective date of the statute.\" WELFARE REFORM During this year, the FCA considered the administration's welfare reform proposals from the point of view of the adequacy of the proposals for older persons. On March 10, 1977, John B. Martin, Chairman of the FCA Senior Services Com- mittee, testified before Secretary Califano at the DHEW hearing on wlefare re- form. Mr. Martin reviewed the findings of the Council's study on the interrela- tionships of benefit programs. The numerous income-conditioned Federal benefit programs for the elderly have not considered the interrelationship of programs and have resulted in a complex system that is too difficult to administer and understand. He advanced a Council recommendation that federally financed benefits have similar eligibility criteria and perhaps a single eligibility process. Mr. Martin also expressed the Council's concern that certain social services for frail older persons not be cashed-out. A premise of the Council's frail elderly project is that even with an adequate income floor, many older persons of the most advanced years require some one-to-one personal help in coping with living. At its September 14-16 quarterly meeting, the Council analyzed the impact on the elderly of the administration's welfare reform proposal which has now been introduced in Congress as the \"Better Jobs and Income Act\" (S. 2084 and H.R. 9030). It combines the largest jobs program since the Great Depression with a cash assistance program for the poor simplifying the program that now exists, and providing more uniform cash benefits. The proposal consolidates three of the largest existing welfare programs-aid to families with dependent children (AFDC), supplemental security income (SSI) and food stamps-and replaces them with a single system of cash assistance. The Council agreed to transmit the following selected recommendations to Secretary Califano and Senate and House leadership: (1) Jobs and Work: (a) Some of the jobs and training opportunities provided by the program should be available to older persons within their capabilities and should include incen- tives.-The central focus of the proposed welfare program is work for low-income families with children; thus ensuring that families in which someone works will 8 be better off financially than families of the same size structure in which no oneworks. The second major theme, fairer and more uniform cash benefits, appearsto be based on the assumption that the aged, blind and disabled will be providedwith an adequate income level and will not be required, or expected, to work.They can work, if they choose, but there will be some reduction in benefits; i.e.,50 cents for every dollar received in wages. This is a higher reduction rate thanexists under the SSI program. The reduction thus serves as a disincentive for theelderly. (b) Exclusions from earned income should be provided for the elderly whowork.-Exclusions from earned income are established for parents of childrenunder age 14, those eligible for subsidized work or training and other units withtwo or more adults meeting certain criteria. This incentive to work is not avail-able to the aged, blind and disabled who are not expected to work but who maywish to work. (c) The number of CETA jobs for older persons should be increased.-The roleof CETA in the proposal's emphasis on 1.4 million public sector jobs is unclearinsofar as older persons are concerned. Opportunities for older persons in CETAprograms are limited, at best, at the present time. The elderly who are working inthese jobs (for income and well-being) should not be replaced by the parents ofchildren who are required to work. Consideration should be given to expandingother programs, such as senior companions and foster grandparents, to providejob opportunities for the elderly. (2) Eligibility: (a) Financial need, not living arrangements, should be the basis for eligibility.-The provision requiring a reduction in benefits when an elderly person shares acommon residence with a related individual focuses on family structure and liv-ing arrangements rather than on financial need and should be eliminated. Such areduction is a disincentive to families to care for their older relatives in their ownhomes or for older persons to share a home with adult children, etc.(b) A permanent outreach program should be established.-A permanent out-reach component should be included in the program to assure continuous effortsto locate low-income aged, blind and disabled persons who cannot be expected tobe aware of benefits for which they must apply. The Council suggests an outreachapproach utilizing peer groups and voluntary organizations with special effortsfor those who have not been reached before, especially the minority and ruralelderly. (c) Eligibility determination should be on a prospective basis.-Under the pro-posed program, eligibility will be determined on a retrospective basis, using theapplicant's actual income over the preceding 6 months. This procedure presumesaccurate record keeping, which could present problems for many elderly individ-uals. Eligibility for SSI and food stamps now is determined on the basis of antici-pated income, using varying lengths of time (3 months in SSI and 1 month infood stamps) in determining need. The retrospective basis could cause hardshipfor an older person who suddenly loses income and who might not be eligible forthe next 6 months based on the previous 6-months income. If a retrospectivebasis is adopted for all applicants, arrangements must be made for emergencyassistance for the elderly who are not employed.(d) Eligibility redeterminations for the elderly who are unable to work and whosesole income is the national basic benefit should be on an annual basis.-Recipientswith employment income will be required to report monthly; others, less frequently.Older persons whose income is not primarily from employment and whose assetsare stable should not have their eligibility redetermined as frequently as those whoare working. Many elderly individuals do not have the physical stamina to visitoffices for eligibility redeterminations. (e) Current aged, blind and disabled recipients should be protected againstreduced benefits after the 3-year transitional period.-States will be required tomaintain a substantial fraction of their current expenditures for AFDC, SSI,emergency assistance and general assistance during the 3-year transitional period.This is to assure that current benefits for these recipients are not reduced. Since itis claimed that the AFDC caseloads turn over approximately one-third each year,the 3-year transition period should cover current recipients. It cannot be assumedthat the SSI caseload turns over at the same rate. Data must be collected to deter-mine the turn-over rate and arrangements made to protect the current elderly,blind and disabled recipients from benefit reductions. There should be a guaranteethat the elderly do not receive less than their current entitlement.(3) Medical care: (a) The present principle that cash recipents also are eligible for medical assist- ance (medicaid) should be continued.-Under the proposed welfare reform pro- gram, existing medicaid eligibility criteria will be preserved. This ensures that the new eligibility rules under welfare reform do not automatically expand the medic- aid rolls. No reference is made to linking new recipients to the medical care system until such time as a national health insurance program is enacted. Con- sideration must be given to ways of providing medical care and services to new recipients of the porposed welfare reform program. Acknowledgements of the Council position paper were received from Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging; Congressman Claude Pepper, Chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging; Congressman James C. Corman, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Public Assistance and Unemployment Compensation; and Congressman Carl D. Perkins, Chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor. HUD ASSISTANCE FOR MINORITY SPONSORS OF SUBSIDIZED HOUSING As a result of action at its March meeting, FCA communicated its concern to HUD Secretary Patricia Roberts Harris that a lack of technical knowledge was preventing minority sponsors from developing successful subsidized housing applications for the poor and minority elderly. The Council suggested that HUD fund a national center to provide assistance to interested minority and other sponsors who need help in preparing the papers for sponsorship of subsidized housing. HUD Secretary Harris replied that the department recognized the importance of encouraging competent minority sponsorship, but did not contemplate a nationwide developmental training program for section 202 projects. HUD head- quarters office will handle the selection of sponsors and all funds will be reserved by September 30, 1977, making it possible for sponsors to apply without risking funds beyond what is necessary to put together an application. INCREASED FUNDING FOR SECTION 202 HOUSING PROGRAM FOR THE ELDERLY AND HANDICAPPED On May 6, HUD Secretary Patricia Roberts Harris, responded to an earlier communication from the Council by expressing her appreciation to the FCA for its continued interest in the section 202 Housing for the Elderly and Handi- capped. Mrs. Harris reported that section 106(b) seed money loan program was being reactivated so that eligible borrowers under Section 202 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 could borrow up to 80 percent of the necessary seed money expenses from HUD on an interest-free basis. MANDATORY RETIREMENT The Federal Council on the Aging, following review at its September 14-16 quarterly meeting of pending legislation and data on the impact of the legislation on the elderly, voted 10 to 1 to support the raising of the age limit under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The Federal Council recommended to the appropriate Senate and House Com- mittees that increasing the age limit under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act would protect the rights of older workers who have the desire and capability of continuing to work after age 65. The Council stated that passage of this legislation is a beginning in imple- menting section III of the bicentennial charter for older Americans issued by the FCA in January 1976-the right to an opportunity for employment free from discriminatory practices because of age. \"Proposed legislation is a start to imple- mentation since it would expand protected employment rights of older workers. However, it does not meet the goal of the charter since it does not increase employ- ment opportunities for unemployed or underemployed older workers or begin to establish a national policy on the right of older workers to employment oppor- tunities.\" The Federal Council on the Aging recommended that national policies be pursued that will result in an expanding economy and that a part of these policies include comprehensive and flexible programs designed to promote employment opportunities. The administration's stimulus package and the recently enacted Youth Employment and Demonstration Projects Act of 1977 represent appro- priate ways to address unemployment problems without necessitating the exclu- sion of any one group to make room for another. The Council's position was sent to the President and to appropriate Senatorsand Congressmen. Congressman Claude Pepper, Chairman of the House SelectCommittee on Aging, utilized the FCA position statement in floor debate on thebill on September 23. Vice President Mondale acknowledged receiving the Council's position onmandatory retirement in a letter on November 9, 1977 to Chairman Cruikshank.He described the concern of the administration in adequately protecting theinterests of older citizens as social and economic policy is developed. IMPACT OF ENERGY/WEATHER CRISIS ON ELDERLY The winter of 1976-77 with its combination cf extreme cold and rising costof energy/fuel was a particular hardship for many older persons. The Councilanalyzed the problem as it affects the elderly as well as the actions taken by theFederal Government to assist the poor in meeting the increasing cost of energy.At its regular quarterly meeting on September 14-16, the Council approvedcertain recommendations dealing with the short-range issues of energy/weather.The Council will continue to work on the longer range aspects of this problemduring 1978. On behalf of the Council, Chairman Cruikshank communicated with the WhiteHouse, HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano, Jr. and congressional leaders urgingthe adoption of the following recommendations to assure that Federal aid willbe in place for the elderly during the 1977-78 winter season: (1) That funding the Community Services Administration program of emer-gency assistance to pay overdue fuel and utility bills be continued for the winterof 1977-78. The amount of funding for the coming year should be based on anevaluation of the effectiveness of the program as well as on the adequacy of thefunding in relation to the total need. (2) That funding be continued to assist low-income elderly persons to weath-erize their home to minimize heat loss and to improve thermal efficiency. Insulationprograms conserve energy by decreasing utilization of fuel by consumers. Theamount of funding for weatherization programs should be based on an evaluationof the effectiveness and adequacy of 1976-77 funding in relation to need. (3) That a significant outreach component be built into the emergency assist-ance and weatherization programs and that new approaches be tried to reachminority and rural elderly, such as utilization of peer groups and voluntaryorganizations. (4) That programs be developed for the dissemination of energy conservationinformation, establishment of energy conservation education programs andrepresentations of the interests of the elderly poor in public proceedings on energypolicy and utility rate structure. Utility companies should be required to provideeasily understandable explanations of fuel assistance payments available to theirlow-income customers. The President communicated to Mr. Cruikshank as counselor on aging hisapproval of the FCA recommendations. With administration support, the Con-gress approved funding of the Community Services Administration program ofemergency assistance for fuel and utilities for the winter of 1977-78. Unfortunately,the funding for this program was attached to a bill which would also providemonies for the B-1 bomber. The bill was still in conference at the end of the year.In a letter to Chairman Cruikshank on October 28, 1977, Senator Frank Church,Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, stated that he was in fullagreement with the recommendations made by the Council relative to relief forolder persons affected by the energy/weather crisis.Appreciation of the Council position was expressed also by HEW SecretaryJoseph A. Califano, Jr., Congressman Henry S. Reuss, Chairman of the HouseCommittee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, and Congressman Al Ullman,Chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means. NATIONAL HEALTH CARE AND THE ELDERLY At its September 14-16, 1977 meeting, the Council agreed on the need for cer-tain principles regarding the elderly which should guide legislative and adminis-trative initiatives for national health care. This position statement was forwardedto Secretary Califano and Senators and Congressmen with responsibilities in thefield of aging. Background: 11 In the preamble to the constitution of the World Health Organization, health is defined as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" This definition suggests that physical well-being, in itself, is not sufficient for health, but that mental and social factors must be considered simultaneously. However, a much narrower, concept guides the delivery of health care in the United States. It is crisis-oriented. It lacks any kind of unified health-medical system covering the full range of preventive and curative services. In older persons, the interrelationship between physical and mental health problems is especially important. For this age group, the possession of both be- becomes more valued than at any other time in life, in large part because of the potential threat to independence from any mental or physical illness and because of the likelihood of such social \"ills\" as loss of work role and spouse and decreased income.. Providing the resources that make it possible for the elderly to remain healthy and independent is a responsibility that society must try to fulfill. The establishment of medicare and medicaid in 1965 evidenced a strong national concern for relieving major health care costs for many older and poor persons. Medicare, even with its coinsurance and deductible features, has covered the major part of acute health care costs for most older persons. But just as the cov- ered health care costs have risen so too has the recipient contribution and uncov- ered health care services. The cost of out-of-hospital drugs, preventive health services and long-term institutional care, never intended to be covered by medi- care, have become a disproportionate drain on the resources of the elderly. Some of these needs are met for the certified poor by the Federal-State cost-sharing medicaid program, Medicaid has been especially valuable to eligible older persons for long-term institutional care. But wide differences exist among many States as to those who are eligible to receive assistance. The mental health services so vitally important to the elderly have been only minimally provided for and much needed services actually excluded in existing health care reimbursement programs. Despite the many problems of medicare and medicaid, the Council believes that these two programs are still of inestimable value to the elderly and the poor. The challenge facing this Nation is to maintain the real benefits of medicare and medicaid for the elderly and the poor and extend them to the nonpoor and the nonelderly who have many of the same problems in receiving and paying for adequate health care. Principles: (1) Since health care is a basic right for all Americans, the elderly should be included in any Federal initiative to improve health care. These programs should be designed to enhance the dignity and maximize the opportunity for choice for all persons, especially the elderly.-Older persons should be served by an inte- grated program for all age groups. The elderly, however, like other segments of the population, should also have the benefits of certain specialized facilities, pro- grams and services based on their distinctive needs. The elderly should have a choice of the type of care they want; i.e., physicians' office, ambulatory care clinic, HMO's, etc. They also should be involved in decisions for treatment and for institutional versus home care. It is recognized that just as certain facilities, programs, services and research are geared to various diseases, so too should the special problems related to age be addressed in activities within a total health care program. (2) A national health care policy should be directed to the development of a system which emphasizes the maintenance of health, the treatment of illness and care of the sick and their restoration and rehabilitation rather than merely focus- ing on a method of financing.-To be effective, physical and mental health serv- ices should be provided to maintain good health and prevent illness as well as to treat those who are already ill. However, although the need for a comprehensive program of preventive health services for older people has been increasingly recog- nized, our medical care system continues to be crisis-oriented, lacking any kind of unified health-medical system covering the full range of preventive and cura- tive services. Preventive and maintenance care are not included in the present reimbursement mechanisms. (3) A national health care system should be comprehensive in that: (a) All essential health services are provided. (b) All the population is included. (c) All costs are paid for without coinsurance and deductibles. 24-084 0 -78 -2 A comprehensive system of appropriate health care requires that the full spectrum of presently known essential treatment and services be readily accessible. To be comprehensive and systematic, health care must provide: (a) assessment of health condition and needs; (b) education to preserve health; (c) appropriate preventive and outreach services; (d) all physical and mental health services necessary to maintain or restore health with linkages to social and supportive services; (e) rehabilitation; and (f) maintenance and long-term care when dis- ability occurs. The deletion of coinsurance and deductibles will remove a major barrier to obtaining needed medical care. (4) Accessibility is akin to the very right to health care. The system, including reimbursement, should remove as far as possible cultural, physical, language and distance barriers to services. It should be defined in such a way as to include all that is necessary to health care, available to all, particularly the poor and rural residents.-Adequately staffed and programed comprehensive health services should be available in geographically accessible settings. Where necessary to provide effective communication with members of ethnic and racial groups, staff must be multilingual. Individual differences must be considered in planning services. (5) The Federal financing of a national health program should be based on these sources: (a) Direct contributions from all employed persons. (b) Sharing of the cost by those who derive indirect benefits, such as employers whose employees' health will benefit, and through the use of general revenues. A contribution based on income by all persons covered is important not only to assure revenues for the program, but also to establish entitlement to benefits as a right. It also provides a sense of participation in the operation of the program on the part of beneficiaries. Both wages and salaries and income from self-employ- ment should be taxed. Since all of society benefits, indirectly if not directly, from the operation of a comprehensive health care system it is appropriate that part of the cost of the system should be paid for out of the general revenues of the government. (6) Attention must be given to both the training and educational needs in the health care field which will produce the types, quality and distribution of profes- sional and related manpower essential to achieve quality of care. Affirmative action efforts, including the involvement of women and racial minorities on an equitable basis, must be built into the manpower component.-Education and training programs should be addressed to all ages and should include all stages of develop- ment so that the needs of the different age groups will be understood. (7) Long-term care has two major components: medical and social. The long- term care medical system and benefit should reach all whose primary need is a medical regimen (in their own homes or in a medical facility). The long-term care social support system and benefits should reach all whose primary need is social support. In such a system, the medical component (both services and financial support) should be an integral part of the national health program. As a matter of national priority, a social support system should also be developed to com- plement the national health care system with both systems designed for implemen- tation on the local level in a simple, comprehensive fashion.-\"Long-term care\" refers to health and social services provided to chronically disabled persons, most frequently the elderly. Such services range from frequently required skilled nur- sing and therapy that must be provided in a medical facility to occasional contacts in a person's own place of residence by a homemaker/home health aide, social worker or volunteer. The Federal Council on the Aging is developing national policy recommenda- tions calling for universal entitlement of certain social services to the most frail among the elderly-usually the oldest. They would be offered 1-to-1 assistance in assessing their needs and resources of the community. Assistance would be given in matching needs and resources. If there were no \"significant other\" person in the life of the frail older woman or man, then that would be arranged. The \"case management\" service would continue to be available to arrange for but not neces - sarily provide other needed, desired and, hopefully, available health and social services. (8) A national health care program must provide for stringent cost containment and quality assurance from sources outside of the health care program itself whether private or public. Incentives for both quality of care and cost containment should be built into a national health care program.-Spiraling costs for hospital and health care are a major concern to all interested in the provision of quality care. To contain costs in the long run, health resources must be organized more effec- tively, health care benefits distributed more equitably and prevention and primary care emphasized. Cost containment is but one aspect of the problem. High quality of care must be assured through vigorous monitoring by State and Federal agencies whose mission is quality assurance. There must be incentives to providers to control costs and to establish and maintain high quality care. Centralized respon- sibility for standards and controls over health facilities and services must be com- bined with protection for the patient and provider from arbitary, capricious and varied application and interpretation of existing as well as new standards. (9) Every person has a responsibility, insofar as possible, to maintain his/her own physical and mental health. Both the public and private sectors can assist individuals and families through health education and the prevention and amelio- ration of adverse environmental conditions.-Programs of health education are needed for people of all ages so that they can enter their later years as well pre- pared as possible to meet and understand the special health conditions and needs which are likely to occur with advancing age. Health education programs must utilize peer groups and voluntary organizations in order to involve previously unreached groups such as minority and rural elderly. The prevention and amelioration of adverse environmental conditions is the responsibility of all citizens. The health care system can identify societal and environmental factors which contribute to disease and illness but improving con- ditions requires a commitment by the entire society. TITLE XX-SOCIAL SERVICES The subcommittee on Federal, State and community services of the House Select Committee on Aging invited Chairman Cruikshank to testify at an over- sight hearing on October 27 on the effectiveness of title XX of the Social Security Act in meeting the social service needs of the elderly. Mr. Cruikshank made observations based on the Council's proposals for the frail elderly and its study on the interrelationships of government benefit pro- grams. He said that while the Council was proposing a set of core services for the frail elderly, that it was equally important to determine and provide certain social services for the nonfrail or \"independent elderly\" so that their independence is maintained as long as possible and they do not have to depend on society for the more costly health and social services needed by their frailer and older parents, spouses, brothers, sisters and friends. The FCA chairman concluded with some of his own views on rationalizing the two major social services programs for the elderly: I believe it is important to continue serving the elderly through both all-ages and aged-only programs. Both the title XX agencies and State and area agencies on aging have planning and advocacy functions which are important for the elderly. There are many services, usually individually-determined and individ- ually-delivered, which are needed by certain persons at all age levels and these might more appropriately be the responsibility of the public multigenerational casework agency. Protective services, one of the most important title XX pro- grams for the elderly, is one example. Many group services are unique to the needs and role of the older persons and might more appropriately be lodged and financed on an ongoing, not a demonstration and startup, basis in the Older Americans Act. There should not have to be a means test-even if you call it \"Group Eligi- bility\"-so an older person can attend a senior center. But neither should older people be discouraged from paying for their own meal in a senior center so they can be full and independent partners in a \"Senior Service\" program. 1981 WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON THE AGING On May 3, 1977, Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the Senate Special Com- mittee on Aging, and Congressman Claude Pepper, Chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging, introduced a joint resolution calling for a White House Conference on Aging in 1981 (S. J. Res. 48). In commenting on the joint resolution, FCA Chairman Bertha Adkins, stated to Senator Church that the Federal Council had discussed it at the May quarterly mecting and was pleased to note the reference to the Council in assisting the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in planning and conducting the conference. ...\"As the permanent national citizen advisory body on aging, the Council might be assigned a major role in monitoring and assessing the efforts of government and the private sector in carrying out the major goals of the 1981 conference ...The Council looks forward to the holding of this important decennial meeting and hopes that it might be able to make substantive and specific contributions to the development of issues out of our ongoing work such as the bicentennial charter for older Americans.\" 14 WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON HANDICAPPED INDIVIDUALS At the September 14-16, 1977 Council meeting, member Dorothy L. Devereux gave a report of the White House conference on handicapped individuals at which she was an official observer on behalf of the Council. The Council voted to assure Dr. Henry Viscardi, Jr., chairman of national planning and advisory council of the conference, of their intention to use the recommendations from the conference as guides in the Council's role of national advocacy for the elderly. The Council conveyed the need for focusing on and planning for so many older persons with debilities, mentioning especially its own concern that all housing for the elderly be barrier-free so residents are not forced to move because of later difficulty in getting around in their homes. WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON FAMILIES In a letter to HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano, Jr. following the FCA meet- ing of May 18-20, 1977, Chairman Bertha Adkins advised the Secretary of Council interest in the proposed White House conference on families. The Council recom- mended that the concerns of older persons and older persons themselves be in- volved in planning for the conference since the elderly are a vital and essential part of the family, and issues concerning the elderly should be of major emphasis at the conference. As a national advocate for the elderly, the Council offered its assistance in planning the proposed conference. STUDY OF ASSET TESTING When the Congress established the Federal Council on the Aging through the 1973 amendments to the Older Americans Act, it charged the Council with con- ducting a study of the interrelationships of government benefit programs for the elderly. The study was duly carried out and transmitted to the President in December 1975. One recommendation in that report was a charge by the Council to itself totry to come up with some answers to one of the most perplexing aspects of deter- mining the manner in which government benefits should be distributed. The Council said it would \". ..initiate a study of the philosophical and administra- tive rationale connected with the way in which assets and asset income are con- sidered in determining eligibility for benefit programs and the various options available to reduce the inequities in the existing asset tests.\" The Council began the project with the commissioning of a paper by economist Betty Duskin. Her paper reviewed philosophies of income maintenance, the economic basis of asset tests, the existing approach and an alternative strategy,the asset tests and administrative complexity and costs. The Council accepted Mrs. Duskin's recommendation that a number of study papers be commissioned to increase the knowledge base on asset tests and to provide a choice of options for the Council. In early 1977, a grant was made to the institute for research on poverty at the University of Wisconsin to carry out the following activities: (a) Commissioning of concept papers on asset testing topics by experts in economics, law, and social work. (b) Critique of the papers by authors and other experts at.a conference. (c) Preparation of a publication containing the technical papers and an over- view of the conference. Dr. Robert Lampman, professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin was engaged by the Council to develop recommendations based on his own work and the outcome of the conference for consideration by the Council in preparing policy guidance for the executive and legislative branches of government. The conference was held at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in May. The following persons prepared papers on the listed subjects: Marilyn Moon, Ph.D., The Treatment of Assets in Cash Benefit Programs for the Aged and Disabled. Irene Lurie, Ph.D., Income, Asset and Work Tests in Transfer Programs for Able-Bodied, Nonaged Individuals. Leonard J. Hausman, Ph.D., Rules and Practices for the Taxation of Income and Assets in Income-Like Subsidies for Housing, Medical Care, and Higher Education. Robert I. Lerman, Ph.D., Treatment of Assets and Property Income in Designs for Negative Income Taxation. 15 Yung-Ping Chen, Ph.D., Housing Assests as Potential Income: Implications for Income-Conditioned Programs. Michael K. Taussig, Ph.D., The Treatment of Wealth in Means-Tested Transfer Programs. Paul L. Menchik, Ph.D., Should Wealth Matter? In November, these technical papers and an overview by Dr. Lampman were issued as an FCA publicaticn titled The Treatment of Assets and Income from Assets in Income-Conditioned Government Benefit Programs. Copies are available upon request from the Council. No conclusions were reached at the Madison conference but some general agreement developed on the following points: (a) Assets cannot be ignored since wealth is important, in addition to income, in considering the economic status of individuals. (b) Benefits should not have an arbitrary cutoff when assets reach some arbitrary limit, particularly when exemptions vary by type of asset. (c) The exemption of the total value of a home is not supportable since this gives an unreasonable advantage to home owners as compared to those who invest in other assets. To aid the Council in preparing policy recommendations, Dr. Lampman presented the following series of questions and options to members at the Decem- ber meeting: I. Definition of countable nonearned income. (A) Should net imputed rent of an owner/occupied home be counted? (B) Should realized and unrealized capital gains be counted? (C) Should the \"return of principle\" in the proceeds of annuities, private pen-sions, and social security be subtracted? (D) Should some part of contributions from relatives be excluded? (E) Should a contribution be \"deemed\" in the case of an aged beneficiary who lives in the home of an adult child? (F) Should an arbitrary rate of return to property be used to calculate a hypo- thetical property income, which would be substituted for the actual cash income (now included) in the form of rent, interest, dividends, and profit? II. Benefit reduction rate to be applied to each type of nonearned income. (A) Should the same benefit reduction rate, now 100 percent, be applied to all types of nonearned income, or should some type, say net imputed rent, be subject to a lower rate? (B) Should the benefit reduction rate be uniformly reduced to less than 100 percent? (C) Should the benefit reduction rate be changed to a schedule of bracket rates,starting at less than 100 percent for, say, an initial bracket of under $1,000 of property income and rising to more than 100 percent for a bracket of over $3,000? III. Definition of type of assets to be counted (This is aside from the question of asset limits). (A) Should an owner/occupied home be included? (B) Should the assets of a spouse who is not a beneficiary be counted? (C) Should the assets of any other relatives be counted? (D) Should the present (capital) value of an annuity be included? What about the capital value of future pension and social security benefits? (E) Should the present value of future earnings (human capital) be included? (F) Should liabilities be subtracted from assets? In other words should only net worth be counted? IV. Levels of assets or net worth limits by type of asset. (A) Should an owner/occupied home be subject to an asset limit? (B) Should the several asset limits by type of asset be abandoned in favor of one limit for the combined total of all types of assets? (C) Should asset or net worth limits be regularly (automatically?) adjusted for changes in consumer price index (or in some other index)? V. Alternatives to asset limits. (A) Simply abandon all asset limits and rely on the present income definition of nonearned income and the benefit reduction rate on poverty income (now 100 percent) to accomplish the purposes of denying aid to nonneedy persons and varying benefits according to need. (B) A variant of (A) would broaden the definition of countable nonearned income. See part I (F). (C) Another variant of (A) would institute a set of progressive benefit reductionrates against countable property income (excluding transfers, proceeds of annuitiesand pension funds, and gifts). (See part I (F), and part II (C)). The rationale fora surtax on property income (or a tax on net worth) is that the public expectsthe applicant for aid to use up some of his wealth for current consumption duringperiods of low income. (D) Reinstitute the lien law, whereby benefits paid are recaptured when assetsare sold or transferred. VI. Should the treatment of assets and income from assets differ from one means:tested program to another? (A) Should the treatment differ by age of the beneficiary?(B) Should medicaid be considered separately? (C) Should housing benefits, child day care benefits, higher education benefits,et al, each be considered separately? Does the answer to this question turn on theissue of how much we expect which consumers of these benefits to dissave?(D) Should the treatment differ by whether beneficiaries are expected to be onthe program for more or less than one year?Dr. Lampman also developed recommendations and options for changes in thesupplemental security income program with respect to treatment of assets andincome from assets. These include:1. All asset-limits and the present treatment of property income in SSI shouldbe abandoned. In their place, we should introduce the following scheme:(A) Determine a net worth total counting all types of property except rightsto annuity, pension, and grant income. (B) Attribute an income of 5 percent to all net worth in excess of $5,000.(C) For an aged couple, calculate an \"expected contribution out of net worth\"in the amount of 5 percent of net worth in excess of $28,000. ($28,000 is approxi-mately 7 times the povertyline income for an aged couple. This ratio should bemaintained as the povertylines are adjusted.)(D) Reduce the benefit by the sum of attributed income and expected contri-bution multiplied by the benefit reduction rate. 2. The basic benefit-reduction rate on all types of nonearned, income should bereduced from 100 percent to 75 percent. It is estimated that this recommendationwould increase cost by 35 percent and increase the number of those aged who areeligible for SSI benefit by 55 percent. The combined effects of recommendations1 and 2 would be approximately a zero change in costs.Recommendations 3 and 4 are alternatives to recommendation 1. They could becombined with 2. 3. The several asset limits by type of asset should be abandoned in favor ofthe limit for the combined total of all presently included types of assets plus anowner-occupied house, less liabilities. This limit should be set at $35,000 for acouple. It is estimated that this recommendation would increase the cost of SSIfor the aged by 19 percent. 4. Countable income should be defined to include net imputed rent of an owner-occupied house. This recommendation would reduce the cost of SSI for the agedby 15 percent. Recommendations 3 and 4, taken together, would leave the cost of SSI for the agedapproximately unchanged. If recommendations 3 and 4 were combined with 2, the cost of SSI for the aged would rise approximately one-third. 5. The present scheme of reducing benefits by one-third for living in the homeof a relative should be eliminated. This would encourage more cooperation amongfamily members in meeting housing needs of aged persons. It would, however,have an initial effect of raising SSI cost by 15 percent. If neither recommendation 1 nor 3 is adopted, then recommendation 6 should beconsidered. 6. The existing asset limits in SSI should be adjusted regularly for changes inthe consumer price index. 7. \"Housing annuity plans\" and \"reverse mortage plans\" should be encouraged as ways to accommodate gradual dissaving of net worth.Following Dr. Lampman's presentation and a discussion at the December FCAmeeting, the Council decided that it would need additional information andreactions to the range of options from Federal officials with major responsibilityfor administration of means-tested programs. The Council will study their com-ments and hopes to complete this project with a series of policy recommendationsto the Congress and the President early in 1978. 17 NATIONAL POLICY FOR THE FRAIL ELDERLY OVERVIEW In its first annual report issued in March 1975, the Federal Council on the Agingidentified as a priority concern, that group among the elderly-usually the oldestof older Americans-who have an accumulation of health, social, economic andenvironmental problems which impede their independent living to such an extentthat they need to have some direct personal assistance from society on a con-tinuing basis. Presently, in this country, we are struggling to determine the nature,arrangement, and financing of that \"assistance\". Efforts towards solving this problem have all too often been short-range andnarrowly focused. Many of them are based on medical models without addressingoverwhelming social needs. Inadequate income is often a major criterion for eligi-bility for assistance. These well intentioned efforts have often resulted in duplica-tive and administratively ponderous programs which fall short of an equitable andeffective distribution of government or philanthropic dollars. Neither do theseefforts systematically begin with minimum government intervention needed tomaximize the voluntary sector be it family, friends or philanthropy. A great variety of programs and institutions have been tried ranging from nursinghomes to friendly visitors. Some have proved successful and some have not.The need for help in getting help has been recognized. The Older AmericansAct, particularly through the area agency, attempts to bring about agency co-operation at the community level towards the goal of comprehensive, coordinatedservices for the elderly. There are now federally aided mechanisms for health andsocial services planning for people of all ages at the local level. There have been anumber of demonstration projects where coordination has begun with the indi-vidual needing help rather than the helping agency. During these past 3 years, the Federal Council has developed a conceptualframework within which to make a determination of a national policy regardingservices to this most vulnerable segment of the American older population whichthe FCA came to call the \"frail elderly\". The Council claims no scientific accuracy for the nomenclature. It was selected because of the need for a, dramatic term tofocus attention on this particular subgroup of the elderly. While lauding efforts at agency coordination at the community and other locallevels and short-term individual advocacy efforts, the Council believes there isneed for long-term coordination by individual agents of society for individualfrail persons. The Council's recommendation for systematizing aid to persons who need directpersonal assistance from society on a continuing basis is for a free-standing caseassessment and case management service as an entitlement to the frail elderlyupon reaching a certain age, on a universal and voluntary basis. Frail persons below that age could be qualified by some functional eligibility determination.This essentially social model would be complementary and of equal stature to services designed to meet the long-term health care needs of this population. This \"floor\" of social services would provide a skilled practitioner to develop aplan of care in conjunction with the older person and his or her family and/orfriends. A priority in the assessment and plan process would be to identify asignificant other person or persons available to the older man or woman to assist in coping with daily needs. This practitioner would see to the provisions of this person if none were already available. COUNCIL ACTIONS During 1977, the Council adopted several formal positions towards develop-ment of a national policy for the frail elderly. The Council approved eight major elements which are described later in this section. The Council also took formal action in two other related policy areas, welfare reform and national health policy, which were influenced by its study of the needs of this vulnerable group among the elderly.The Federal Council took the position on welfare reform proposals that there should be no reduction in the supplemental security income (SSI) benefit of elderly recipients residing with a relative to encourage such living arrangements. The Council also adopted principles for national health care and the elderly which described long-term care as having both medical and social components. The Council urged development of a social support system to complement a national health care system with both designed for implementation on the local level in a simple comprehensive fashion. 18 The Council's Task Force on the Frail Elderly continued to function duringthis year under the chairmanship of Monsignor Charles Fahey. Specific focuswas directed to identifying the basic concepts of services for the frail elderly whichhad been considered by the Council over the past few years. A number of hypoth-eses were developed. Reactions were sought from the many individual practi-tioners and scholars in the field who have maintained contact with the Council.The task force also met with representatives of voluntary agencies serving theelderly and relevant Federal agency staff. The Government Accounting Office(GAO) through its study on \"The Well-Being of Older People in Cleveland\"provided valuable data for the Council's deliberations. Monsignor Fahey partici-pated in a symposium at the gerontological society annual meeting on the frailelderly proposals. Many of the views of these individuals and organizations havebeen incorporated into the FCA project.At the September Council meeting, the task force presented eight major ele-ments of the FCA frail elderly proposal which were adopted by the Council: 1. Frail Population There are many persons within the aging population who because of an accumu-lation of various continuing problems require the assistance of a significant personfrom time to time to aid in coping with certain daily life activities.Implicit in this statement is the Council's belief that national attention needs tobe drawn to that group of the elderly who no longer belong to the vast majority ofaged who can manage their own lives with their personal resources and such out-side assistance as social security, pensions and some form of housing subsidy.Neither is this vulnerable group primarily in need of care in such settings ashospitals and nursing homes. In developing a national policy response to thisgroup of the elderly, the Council is advancing a \"social model\" based on the pre-mise that the first level of assistance which the frail elderly need is a \"significantother\" person or persons in their lives to assist in coping with daily life. 2. Government Assistance Where there is limited or no continuing availability of a significant personcertain aids for life management should be assured by government if agreed to bythe frail person. Several recent research projects have issued findings substantiating the Council'sviews that there is extensive aid available to the elderly through family and friends.Government policies whether carried out through the tax system, income sup-plementation programs, housing or services should supplement not supplant these\"natural\" aids when necessary and appropriate.Traditionally, protective services have been available from public social serviceagencies for older persons in crisis because of the need for assistance in life man-agement. The service has been of a short-term duration and clients have beenreferred elsewhere for any other available services. Because of the location ofprotective services in the public welfare agency, this aid has been stigmatized ascare for the poor.State and local government in this country has been providing certain aids forlife management for its mentally ill citizens for many years. Courts are often in-volved in admission and discharge to government mental treatment facilities. Atless restrictive levels and for less deviant behavior, the procedures of guardianship,conservatorship and other forms of surrogate management are frequently utilizedby the courts. What is different about the FCA proposals is the Council's advocacy of FederalGovernment assurance of certain aids for life management before a crisis occursand not because of some manifestation of an emotional or physical disorder orbefore the person is rendered destitute. 3. Core Services The Federal Council on the Aging proposes that this assistance be available ona universal basis as an entitlement and be primarily of a social support natureconsisting of the following services: case assessment, plan of care and case manage-ment. The initial step in the process would be an assessment carried out in conjunctionwith the frail older person, insofar as possible, of his or her health, social, economicand environmental condition, problems and resources. This would include theperson's role and relationship with significant other persons in his or her life or theabsence thereof. The process would move on to an identification of benefits available from Fed- eral and other governmental programs and such private provisions as pensions. The caseworker and the older person, and possibly a significant relative or friend, would then develop a plan of care with an emphasis on fully utilizing personal resources and the help of family and friends. When appropriate and available,formal services in the community would be obtained. 4. Eligibility The core services should be available on the basis of presumptive eligibility,determined on the basis of attaining a certain age; e.g. 75. Persons below that defined age with need for these services should have access through some form of functional assessment. The Council believes that because there is a high degree of correlation among the factors of frailty, advanced age and the need for the core services, that the services should be available upon attainment of a certain age such as 75. This presumptive eligibility process would provide for considerable administrative efficiency and cost-saving. At the same time, the Council is aware of and sensitive to the needs of frail persons under the age of 75 or 80 who require some ongoing assistance in coping with life management. These individuals could have access to the set of services through a form of functional assessment certifying to the existence of some chron- ically disabling condition. 5. Administration The core services should be administered by a single State agency with Federal/ State matching funding with flexible delivery at the community level. In making this decision, the Council utilized the following criteria: administra- tive capacity, accessibility, acceptability and adaptability. The Council envisions the State agency as having overall responsibility for assuring the quality and coverage of the program with State options as to where and how the service would be delivered at the community level. It could be a local counterpart of a State agency such as a county public health or social services office. It could be through a senior center, area agency on aging, long-term care center or a voluntary health or social service agency. 6. Significant Person When a significant person is not available or has not been identified through the case assessment, priority in developing the plan of care should be given to the provision of such a person. A \"significant other\" is a helping and concerned individual, a resource to assist frail individuals with limited but consistent aid in such matters as personal man- agement of the household, marketing and other simple chores, and to provide a measure of companionship. The concept of a significant other person to assist the frail elderly individual derives from a recognition that at the edge of the life span there is a strong likeli- hood of personal losses among elderly-loss of spouse, of close friends and neigh- bors. To help offset such losses, both in a material and an emotional sense, the Federal Council suggests bringing into the life of the frail elderly person a replace- ment individual. The persons could be viewed as a family surrogate for a shorter or longer period of time where a family member is unable to be present or there is no family member to satisfy this role. Individuals prepared to serve can be drawn from a number of potential sources such as kin, friends, interested neighbors or elderly volunteers from ACTION programs such as senior companions and RSVP or a local volun- teer organization. The significant person would have a collegial and partnership relationship not only with the older person but also with the professional who would be providing case management. 7. Referral Any other services identified as being needed or desired are to be obtained from informal or formal services and benefits available to older persons. Like many advocates for the elderly, the Council would like to see an array of services available in every community so that there would truly be options for every older person. But with limited government and philanthropic resources, services should be created and systematized according to principles which stress the highest degree of dependence upon self and informal resources. In this vein, 20 the Council is advocating certain core services for a broadly defined group rather than comprehensive, coordinated services for a few. The frail elderly casework service would not only identify the informal or formal services that exist in a community but would assure that the services are received. The same approach would be utilized in seeing that the older persons would receive all the government and private benefits such as social security, SSI, and pensions to which he or she had an entitlement. 8. Unmet Needs A mechanism should be developed for providing data about the unmet needs of the frail elderly to community planning agencies and leadership/advocacy groups. The Council recognizes the limitations of a case management system which is geared to identifying the need for such services as home-delivered meals, trans-portation, day care, homemaker and home-health aids when in fact these services frequently do not exist in a community or cannot be afforded. But the Council envisages the core services only as a beginning, as a floor of social support, as a point of entry to the spectrum of long-term care benefits and services. - The frail elderly service program would have to operate in close cooperation with all community agencies responsible for planning and/or delivering health and social services both to the elderly and to the total population in need. COMPLETION OF PROJECT To complete the frail elderly project, the Council plans to issue a report early in 1978 which will contain data collected during the project such as findings from. relevant research and demonstration projects and the observations and reactions of the many organizations and individual practitioners and citizens including the elderly with whom the Council has been in communication during these past few years. In the course of this project, the Council has been aware of the broader aspects of \"long-term care\" and the needs of the nonelderly frail population. At the last FCA meeting in 1977, the Council addressed the timeliness of national policy attention to the broader context in which the floor of social services for the frail elderly would hopefully be provided. The Council recognized that the problem was one which impinged upon the responsibilities of many agencies and depart- ments of government. In view of these considerations and taking note of the fact that its chairman also serves as counselor to the President, the Council adopted a resolution at their last meeting in 1977 requesting him to propose a coordinated effort at the highest level of government, for developing long-term care policy in the United States. PERSONNEL NEEDS IN THE FIELD OF AGING In fulfilling the legislative mandate of the Federal Council on the Aging to assist the Commissioner on Aging in making periodic appraisals of the Nation's existing and future personnel needs in the field of aging, the Council has maintained close communication with the Administration on Aging and other units in HEW and the Department of Labor with responsibilities for manpower for aging pro- grams. The Council has given particular attention to the health and geriatric field because no other unit inside or outside government was providing a compre- hensive approach to this concern. SOCIAL SERVICE MANPOWER The Council reviewed the AoA report issued in 1977 on \"Hearings on Human Resource Issues in the Delivery of Social Services to the Elderly.\" The hearings were held in three cities with testimony from 70 organizations and individuals. The following are the five recommendations made by the Council to the Com- missioner. His comments follow each recommendation. Recommendation AoA develop model job descriptions and career ladders for occupations in the delivery of social services to the elderly. Comment This recommendation was made in the report section on turnover and education and training. During the hearings it was suggested that a national model for job descriptions might help particularly at the State and local levels where there isan effort to up-date job requirements. There is the question as to whether the development of model job descriptions and career ladders would reduce or have any effect on turnover which is a problemin a number of agencies. The real problem in many of these agencies is not having money for competitivesalaries or that the agency is too small to offer advancement opportunities thatare comparable to those in larger, better established agencies. Recommendation AoA study graduates from gerontology centers on what jobs are available andwhere do graduates become employed. Comment The Administration on Aging awarded a contract to Camil Associates in fiscalyear 1976 to evaluate the Title IV-A Career Training program. Part of this eval-uation consists of contacting graduates of the various programs to determine,first of all if they obtain jobs in gerontology, and if they do-where. Preliminaryresults of this study are expected in early 1978. This should give some facts on theemployment picture of AoA supported graduates. Recommendation AoA require placement services in supported schools. Comment AoA is concerned that graduates of supported programs be employed in posi-tions in which they can use their related skills and knowledge. In the title IV-Agrant application, institutions are encouraged to provide information on the man- power needs in the area and any type placement service that exists at the insti-tution. Reviewers examine this information as part of their assessment of theinstitutions' capability to respond to identified manpower needs. AoA does notfeel it would be desirable to establish strict guidelines in this regard since educa-tional institutions may, for administrative reasons, handle this kind of service in different ways. Recommendation AoA evaluate the impact of title IV training efforts for quality and effectiveness in improving services to older persons. Comment It is difficult to measure quality and effectiveness of services provided. TheBureau of Labor Statistics indicates that the fairly extensive studies that have been done on direct service provision have had very questionable results. How- ever, all other things being equal, the individual who has had special training can perform his/her job better than one who has not. BLS suggests that one type of effectiveness measure, for short term training, is a followup survey of the peo- ple who receive the training 6 months to a year after the training. AoA wil pursuethe feasibility of relating this method to the in-service training program. Further- more, it is expected that as part of the career training evaluation, the interviews with former students and employees may provide additional insights on how best to assess the impact of the career training program on improved services for older persons. Recommendation AoA study ways to reduce the maldistribution of personnel providing social services to the elderly. Comment Regional job market difference, like effectiveness, are difficult to asses. How- ever, AoA will explore with the Bureau of Labor Statistics the feasibility of studying the distribution of personnel providing services to older persons. HEALTH MANPOWER As a part of activities to evaluate and plan for systems of health care delivery for the aged, the FCA has awarded a contract to CSF Ltd. to analyze manpower issues in the delivery of health services to older Americans and to develop public policy recommendations aimed at providing appropriate health care services. The overall aims and objectives of this study are: -Assess manpower requirements in the delivery of health care services to the elderly and identify conditions of present or expected future manpower short- ages. -Identify the health care and allied support services for a comprehensive health program for the elderly and its potential impact on health manpower needs. -Delineate key issues for governmental policy decisions with respect to the delivery of health care services to the elderly. -Identify areas where insufficient data exists and where further research is required. This project is under the supervision of the Council's Research and Manpower Committee and was developed out of a survey undertaken by the committee last year. Government agencies and selected national private organizations with re- sponsibility and concern for health manpower to serve the elderly were asked to submit available information and views. After Council review of the reports, data and studies collected, the FCA made the following interim findings and observations: -The entire service delivery system to the elderly is highly fragmented with little coordination or continuity. No single unified structured system currently exists to deliver the total range of needed health services to the elderly. The organization for the delivery of services is severely inadequate. -There is very limited coordination and unification of health manpower needs and services provided by the Federal Government and other private, State, local and county organization. Little attempt is made to organize and inte- grate the research findings of the various agencies. -Many of the personnel providing health services for the elderly are not properly trained for their positions. They perform their jobs without the skills necessary to meet the special needs of this group. -There is little evidence of any coordination among the training programs that presently exist. It is also unknown at this time whether funding for training programs is determined according to documented needs. -While a considerable amount of data and other information resources cur- rently exist on health manpower needs and sources, little effort has been made to convert the existing data to future planning activities and programs. -Some evidence exists that the level and quality of care and services provided the elderly are inadequate and need improvement. The delivery of and acces- sibility to a full range of social services are essential to meeting the special needs of the elderly. Community resources are scarce. -The problems of accessibility and availability of services present barriers to care for the elderly. -The financing of needed services is often lacking since inadequate reimburse- ment mechanisms exist. Oftentimes, the categorization of patients into skilled nursing facilities is arbitrary. Confronted with the findings and observations the Council contracted for this study that is scheduled for completion in February 1978. In addition to issues directly related to health manpower and the delivery of services, there are several related issues which are also being studied. These include the special health problems of the minority elderly and the oldest of the old; namely, persons 75 years of age and over. Several outcomes of the project are anticipated. First, areas with the greatest manpower shortages will be identified. Second, recommendations will be made as to areas where further data must be collected and further research is warranted. Finally, key issues for government policy decisions will be identified. STUDY OF MINORITY ELDERLY One of the Federal Council on the Aging's mandated functions is to review and evaluate on a continuing basis Federal policies regarding older persons as well as programs and other activities affecting older persons which are conducted by Federal departments and agencies for the purpose of appraising their value and their impact. Another equally important mandated function of the Federal Council on the Aging is to serve as spokespersons on behalf of older Americans by making recommendations with respect to Federal policies and federally con- ducted or assisted programs and other activities. During the Federal Council's efforts to pursue these functions, policy and program concerns affecting the minority elderly (Blacks, Hispanics, Native Amer- icans, and Asian and Pacific Islanders) emerged. The concerns of the minority elderly were especially apparent throughout the Federal Council's deliberations on the frail elderly. To achieve administrative simplicity, the idea of presumptive eligibility for specific services, based on the attainment of age 75, is being con- sidered. The critical issue for most minorities is that they experience life expect- ancies substantially shorter than those of their white counterparts. Thus such age eligibility consideration may be disadvantageous to minority elderly because they generally do not live long enough to participate in Federal programs. Because of this and other concerns relating to minority elderly, the Federal Council on the Aging undertook a study to examine the equity and impact of age eligibility criteria not only in relation to the frail elderly proposal, but also for all major Federal programs. The Research and Manpower Committee of the Council has the responsibility for overseeing the conduct of the study and to forward recommendations to the Council for action. In October of 1977 the Human Resources Corporation of San Francisco and Washington, D.C., a minority firms, was awarded a 26-week contract to conduct the study. The contractor is currently: (a) Collecting, analyzing and synthesizing available data on the four minority groups (e.g., life expectancy, health statistics, income levels, employment histories, housing characteristics, family support systems, etc.); (b) reviewing the Federal Council's frail elderly proposal to determine its potential impact on minority elderly; (c) identifying data gaps and further research needs which relate to existing and proposed policies and their impact on minority elderly; and (d) developing recommendations regarding the Federal policies and programs analyzed, including age entitlement for the frail elderly, as they impact on minority aged. The recommendations will address issues in relation to legislation, Federal programs for the aging, research directions, as well as provide an operational definition of frailty. Assisting the Human Resources Corporation is a National Advisory Panel which includes Larry Curley, the National Indian Council on Aging; Dr. Fernando Torres-Gil, Andrus Gerontology Center, University of Southern California; Dr. E. Percil Stanford, Center on Aging at San Diego State University; Alan Wong, Self-Help for the Elderly, San Francisco; and Dr. Robert Binstock, Florence Heller School, Brandeis University. Representatives of governmental agencies are also participating on the advisory panel. The final product of this study will be a series of policy recommendations for consideration by the Federal Council on the Aging. 1978 AGENDA During 1978, the Council will continue working in a number of areas which have been its special concern as well as initiating attention to emerging issues of importance to the elderly of the present and the future. The Council's agenda will also be affected by actions concerning the elderly by the executive and legis- lative branches of government. A major component of the Council's agenda for 1978 will be the completion of four projects (described elsewhere in this report) which will have been in process for some time: (1) Treatment of assets and asset income in determining eligibility for income- tested government benefit programs. (2) A national policy for the frail elderly. (3) Health manpower needs to serve the elderly. (4) Policy concerns on special problems of minority elderly. A number of legislative issues of importance to the elderly were still pending as the 95th Congress concluded its first session or are scheduled for consideration in the second session. Legislation having to do with such matters as welfare reform, mandatory retirement, reauthorization of the Older Americans Act and the White House conference of the aging will be given attention by the Council during 1978. The administration has several major activities underway or about to be launched of the kind which the Council is to \"review and evaluate\" under pro- visions of the Older Americans Act. These include: development of proposals for national health care, planning for a White House conference on families, issuance of legislated studies on age discrimination and mental health and the establish- ment of three new advisory bodies on social security and pensions. A FOCUS ON OLDER AMERICANS The increase in the absolute and relative numbers of the elderly among theAmerican population coupled with their increasing longevity means that there aresubstantial numbers of people at each age level right up to 100 years.As the Council examines its future agenda, it will attempt to personalize, andorganize, its work keeping these data in mind. Therefore, the Council will begin byconsidering the elderly as belonging in two major categories: the \"independentelderly\" and the \"impaired elderly\". Because of the importance of developingnational policy for the elderly with full utilization of all modern technologies,especially tools for forecasting, the Council will also consider the special concernsof the \"future elderly\". INDEPENDENT ELDERLY There is general agreement on the importance of national policy directed to thegoal of sufficient income and good health to live out one's last years in comfortand dignity. For the purpose of defining the Council's agenda for 1978, the \"inde-pendent elderly\" shall be considered as being those who are, in the main, in theyounger age group, in relatively good health, capable of making decisions abouttheir lives and generally able to seek and obtain needed medical care and socialservices. For this group of the elderly, the Council will be examining some of the followingissues in 1978 to determine the need for new policy initiatives: Income How can the adequacy, efficiency and integrity of Federal income maintenanceprograms be assured? Housing To what extent should government-assisted housing programs be available tothe independent elderly? Health care Pending enactment of a national health care program, are there short-rangesteps to provide health care to the independent elderly in a more efficient and lesscostly manner? Senior services What is the nature of the partnership of the public and private sectors in makingavailable social, educational, cultural and recreational group services to enrichthe lives of the elderly? Citizen participation How can volunteer opportunities be increased and older people encouraged tobe volunteers in policy advisory roles and in direct service to others? Employment How can opportunities be expanded for increased income and life satisfactionthrough employment? Minorities What are the barriers which prevent older minority members from obtainingneeded benefits and services and how can these barriers be removed? Family What is the function of the Federal Government in enhancing the role of theolder person as an active family member? IMPAIRED ELDERLY For some time the Council has advocated the need for a special national policyapproach to the oldest of the old, usually those over the age of 75. The Council hasused the term \"frail elderly\" to describe those women and men who although ca-pable of making decisions about their lives need continuing assistance of a socialsupport nature to enable them to reside in the community. Some of the \"old-old\" need much more assistance in the form of institutional care, special home-de-livered services and even court intervention in making life decisions. Obviously, the impaired elderly must have at least the basic levels of income, health care, housing and other needs which all the elderly require. In addition, they require certain special benefits and services to improve the quality of their lives. In 1978, the Council will be studying some of these special needs to deter- mine priorities for Federal action: Assessment How can a multidisciplinary assessment be incorporated into the delivery of individually-determined social and health services for the elderly? Case management services How can the package of case assessment, plan of care and case management services proposed by the Federal Council for the frail elderly be implemented as an entitleme nt? Family What additional steps, if any, should government take to assist individuals in caring for their elderly relatives? FUTURE ELDERLY In addition to the survival needs which will be no different from those experi- enced by their parents as they became aged, there are some special factors to be considered in examining national policy issues which will affect the elderly of the future. VETERANS By the year 1980, veterans will comprise 70 percent of the American male population 65 and over. These large numbers, composed of veterans with service- connected disabilities and veterans without disabilities, will impact on income maintenance, social services, health and housing not only for veterans but also for all older Americans. LIFE CYCLE PLANNING Increasing longevity and changes in work patterns such as elimination of mandatory retirement and the fuller participation of women in the workforce are bringing about substantial changes in the structure of society. The periods of time an individual devotes to education, work and leisure are changing along with their very sequence. \"Retirement\" itself must be reexamined as a concept affect- ing adults of all ages. COUNCIL STEWARDSHIP There are several Federal laws which affect the operation of the Federal Council on the Aging. Of particular importance are the Older Americans Act and the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Older Americans Act defines our mission of advocacy for older Americans and certain specific operating procedures. The Federal Advisory Committee Act sets forth standards to insure the effective use of all advisory bodies within the Federal Government. Regular reports are filed with committee management offices in the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of the Secretary, HEW. As called for by the Older Americans Act, this calendar year report is compiled for the President. The FCA annual report also appears in \"Developments in Aging\" issued by the Senate Special Committee on Aging. The Council held the four quarterly meetings called for by the Older Americans Act on March 8-9, May 19-20, September 15-16 and November 30-December 1. A special Council meeting was held on July 12 concerning the evaluation of the Council. All meetings were announced in the Federal Register and some three hundred notices of the meetings sent to representatives of national organizations and staff of various Federal agencies, Congressional members and committees with a special interest and responsibility in the field. A number of these persons and the general public do attend Council meetings. AGING magazine, the publication of the Administration on Aging, regularly carties stories on Council activities. All documents relevant to Council official actions are maintained in the office of the FCA Secretariat and are available for public inspection and copying. Council members received briefings during the year from a number of Federal officials including the Commissioner on Aging, staff of the Government exequtive and legislative branches and experts from the private sector in the field of aging. 26 EVALUATION OF THE COUNCIL Several factors combined in bringing about the decision by the Council inearly 1977 to retain a management consultant to undertake a study of the Coun-cil's effectiveness in carrying out its mandated responsibilities. First, the Councilwas reviewing the Older Americans Act to determine what amendments wereneeded, if any, when reauthorization was scheduled in 1978. Since the FederalCouncil on the Aging was established by provisions of the act, the Council feltit could not exclude itself from an examination. Then, President Carter hadcalled for an evaluation of all Federal advisory bodies. Finally, the Council feltthat any organization, especially one purporting to speak for so broad a con-stituency and with so broad a mandate, should make a periodic selfevaluation.The project, which was conducted by Arthur Boyd, began with a retrospec-tive look at the origins of the FCA and at what had transpired since its inception.For the current year, the institutional context for FCA activities at the nationallevel was examined. Mr. Boyd concluded with a presentation of recommendationsfor the Council's future operations.Acknowledging all of the factors that have shaped its performance, it is clearthat the FCA has done well. It has completed the mandated studies in a mannerthat exemplifies high standards for such work. It has spoken out on a wide rangeof issues affecting older Americans. It has initiated and is pursuing importantlines of inquiry and development. It has established a \"following\" among thosewho have an active interest in aging. It has contributed the Bicentennial Charterfor Older Americans as an instrument for improving the public dialogue regardingthe elderly. It has stimulated and supported worthwhile activities by other bodiesconcerned with the well-being of older persons.These assets and liabilities of a virtually unlimited congressional mandate topromote the interests of older Americans in relation to the whole range of Federalpolicies and programs were described by Mr. Boyd.The FCA has a generic-function mandate reinforced with guidance as to thecongressional intent. But generic-function mandates, even when enriched andreinforced by congressional or presidential statements of concerns to be addressedand purposes to be served, are inherently weak instruments for organizing talentand getting worthwhile nonroutine things done. What such mandates accomplishis nothing more than to mark the boundaries within which appointees/employeesexercise their personal capacities and dispositions. Within such boundaries peopleare in fact without direction other than self-direction.On close examination, it turns out that the FCA's mandated generic functionsare a source of gratification without being a source of strength. It turns out also,that the task of advising the Congress and the President about actions on behalfof older Americans imposes on the FCA that same burden of particularizationwhich explains the fragmentation (nee \"specialization\") of congressional andexecutive branch efforts on behalf of older persons-a fragmentation the FCAhas the opportunity if not the duty to counteract.Collective selfdirection, in such complex circumstances, cannot be determinedby reference to the mandated generic functions of the FCA, or by reference tocongressional or presidential intent, or by reference to the needs of older personsand the worthwhile possible responses to those needs. The selfdirection can beestablished only by FCA members jointly crystallizing a sense of their own col-lective role and purpose vis a vis other elements of the larger system.For a variety of reasons, including the initial burden of the mandated studies,the present Council has not formulated such a consensual view of its role-anyadequate vision of which would perhaps have enable it to achieve a larger measureof its potential value to older persons.The evaluation contained five alternative models for operation of the FederalCouncil in keeping with the congressional mandate and the legislative historythat would improve its effectiveness and efficiency. The Council reviewed theseoptions at the September meeting and agreed it was not necessary to make achoice among the models at this time but that the entire report would be mosthelpful as new members came on the Council and sought to organize themselves.The Council adopted a specific suggestion from Mr. Boyd regarding an amend-ment to the Older Americans Act which would strengthen the ability of the Councilto receive assistance in carrying out its work. (The proposed amendment is pre-sented in detail in another section of this annual report.) 27 COUNCIL SUB-UNITS The Council has three standing committees; each met twice during 1977. The Committee on Senior Services headed by John B. Martin had as its major responsibilities during 1977, a review of proposed legislation in the areas of energy/weather, health care for the elderly welfare reform, national meals-on- wheels program and reauthorization of the dlder Americans Act. The Aging Research and Manpower Committee chaired by Bernard E. Nash, reviewed and made recommendations through the Council, to the Commisgioner of the Administration on Aging on social service manpower needs, developed two major studies, one on health manpower needs for services to the elderly, and the second, on policy issues concerning minority elderly whose groups show shorter life expectancies than the majority white population. The Committee on Economics of Aging chaired by Nelson H. Cruikshank monitored the study, by the Institute for Research on Poverty, University of Wisconsin, of assets and asset income in means-tested benefit programs being carried out for the Council. The Committee reviewed legislative initiatives regard- ing mandatory retirement and developed the position eventually taken by the Council. The Administration's social security financing proposals were reviewed and recommendations made for Council action. All three Committees considered recommendations to the Council on amend- ments to the Older Americans Act, and to the Task Force on the Frail Elderly in the formulation of a national policy on services to the frail elderly and the develop- ment of a frail elderly services definition. The Task Force on the Frail Elderly under the chairmanship of Monsignor Charles J. Fahey held two meetings in 1977. The first meeting on April 25 in- cluded the input of representatives of provider groups in the field of aging to the Council's developing recommendations on services for the frail elderly. The second meeting of the task force on July 11 and 12 included the input from selected major providers of services in the field of aging and representatives of Federal agencies concerned with the aging in an effort to obtain reactions and recommendations to the FCA's development of a national policy on services for the frail elderly. The FCA paper identifying issues on services for the frail elderly to be dis- cussed at a symposia at the November annual meeting of the Gerontological Society was reviewed. ACTIVITIES OF CHAIRMAN As part of the general responsibility of the Federal Council on the Aging to inform the public of the needs and contributions of older Americans, members of the Council participate in a number of activities. Miss Adkins' major engagements included: -Address to the National Intra-Decade Conference on Spiritual Well-Being of the Elderly in Atlanta, Georgia on April 14.

STAFF SUPPORT According to provisions of the Older Americans Act, the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Commissioner on Aging are to make available to the Council such staff, information, and other assistance as it may require to carry out its activities. This is done in a variety of ways. The Secretariat for the Federal Council on the Aging is located in the Admin- istration on Aging. Staff is composed of five professional persons-one of whom is a reemployed Federal annuitant, a staff assistant, an administrative assistant and a secretary. FCA staff participate in a wide range of meetings in various parts of the country both to learn about developments in the field as well as to disseminate information about the Council. The placement of the Secretariat in AOA and the Office of Human Development Services provides informal as well as formal utilization of their staffs and supportive services. The Committee Management Office in the Office of the Secretary aids in carrying out the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Various units within departments other than HEW have given ready response to FCA requests for resource speakers and materials. Short-term employees and contractors have been utilized to assist with certain FCA projects such as the assets study, national policy for services to the frail elderly, health manpower needs, and policy issues concerning minority elderly. The FCA budget for fiscal year 1977 of $550,652 was provided within the AOA appropriation. The Administration's fiscal year 1978 budget sets a funding level of $450,000. DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL COUNCIL ON THE AGING PUBLICATIONS Distribution of Federal Council on the Aging publications continued throughout 1977. The publications have been requested in quantity by the Gerontological Society, the Naitonal Council of Senior Citizens, the National Council on the Aging for their regional meetings, the American Association of Retired Persons/ National Retired Teachers Association, the American Association of Homes for the Aging, Maine Committee on Aging, the U.S. Commission National Women's Conference, the National Institute on Aging, and the Asociacion Nacional Pro Persona Mayores and many other groups. This distribution also included 20,000 copies of the Bicentennial Charter for Older Americans in Spanish. Publications were sent also on Administration on Aging and Federal Council on the Aging mailing keys to the Administration on Aging network of area and state agencies, Senators and Congressmen on appropriate aging-related committees, Federal staff and national organizations in the field of aging and hundreds of individual requesters. During 1977, the Council initiated publication of a \"status report\" summarizing major actions taken by the Council at its meetings. There were three issues this year along with the following publications: -1976 Annual Report to the President -Bicentennial Charter for Older Americans (Spanish edition) -The Treatment of Assets and Income from Assets in Income-Conditioned Government Benefit Programs. In addition, over one hundred copies of draft versions of papers on the frail elderly have been distributed to leading gerontologists for their comments. Appendix 2 REPORTS FROM FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ITEM 1. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE JANUARY 26, 1978. DEAR SENATOR CHURCH: We appreciate the opportunity to share programactivities and developments undertaken by the Department to improve thequality of life for older Americans. Enclosed are summary reports indicatingagency support and implementation of the Department's commitment to theneeds of the elderly. If we can be of additional assistance, please do not hesitate to call on us.Sincerely, ALEX P. MERCURE,Assistant Secretary. [Enclosures.] RURAL DEVELOPMENT SERVICE The mission of the Rural Development Service (RDS) is to improve the qualityof life for people in the rural regions of the Nation. Agency objectives to carryout this mission are: (1) To insure that rural communities receive an equitable share of the availabledevelopment resources. (2) To assist rural communities to gain better access to the available develop-mental resources. (3) To assist people in rural communities to become more effective in imple-menting the developmental process in their communities.Some of the RDS initiatives related to the problems of the rural elderly include:(1) Creation of a staff position to advocate for increased services to the ruralelderly with key policymakers in other executive branch agencies.(2) Grant award to develop a \"State of the Art\" report on the rural elderly,identifying major problems and alternative solutions.(3) Participation with the Senate Special Committee on Aging in respondingto issues surfaced at hearings conducted by the committee on the rural elderly.(4) Exploration of the feasibility of establishing a National Center on RuralAging to serve as the central focus in raising the problems of the rural aged topriority status, developing a coordinated network of supporters, and in providingtechnical assistance and consultation in the development and expansion of servicesto meet priority needs. (5) Participation in the rural health coalition convened by Senator Dick Clarkduring the development of the Rural Health Clinic Services Bill which extendedcoverage of health services under medicare and medicaid and greatly assists inmeeting the health needs of the elderly in rural areas.For the upcoming year RDS has identified health, transportation, housingand income as priority areas. RDS. will be involved with appropriate agencies ofthe executive branch and concerned organizations in the development of jcintinitiatives and interagency agreements to implement better means of servicedelivery to the rual elderly. For example, RDS has served to initiate the planningof a project, jointly funded by the Administration on Aging and the Departmentof Labor, to train older workers as homemaker home health aides to serve theelderly in rural communities.In addition to working with agencies outside USDA, RDS is exploring thefeasibility of establishing and coordinating an intraagency Committee on Agingto serve as a vehicle for joint action and information sharing on the problemsof rural older Americans. Also, RDS will administer the area developmentassistance program which will provide funding to assist State and local plannersin developing rural strategies to improve the living conditions of persons in ruralcommunities. It is expected that the regulations for this program will be publishedin the Federal Register in the near future. RDS has made the Administrationon Aging and other agencies and organizations aware of this program andencourages the submission of applications that include components to addressconcerns related to the rural elderly. 31 FARMERS HOME ADMINISTRATION One of the most beneficial programs for rural elderly is the section 515 rural rental program. This highly successful program has grown since its inception in 1963 from 24 units costing $117,000 to an impressive 32,000 units in fiscal year 1977 for $545 million in loan obligations. We have budgeted $690 million for this program in fiscal year 1978. The importance of this program to the elderly is illustrated in the statistics. From 1963 through fiscal year 1976, our agency financed 88,000 rental units. Of these, about 30,000 were for elderly families- about one-third of the total. Indications are that of the 32,000 units financed in fiscal year 1977, over 25 percent and probably one-third of them were for the elderly. Of particular interest to the elderly will be the rental assistance program which Secretary Bergland has implemented. Under this program, the Farmers Home Administration will be able to assist in providing rental housing for families with lower incomes than have been helped in the past. Under this program, low income families will be required to pay up to 25 percent of their income for rent, including utilities. If their payment is not enough to pay the market rent, the Farmers Home Administration will provide a subsidy to make up the difference. This should help many elderly families with low incomes who are facing financial problems under present inflationary times. The implementation of our rental assistance program, together with the sec- tion 8 program, will be especially important for senior citizens with fixed incomes by limiting the amount they must pay for rent to a specified proportion of that income. These programs will remove much of the economic impact faced by these rural residents in times of ever increasing utility and maintenance costs associ- ated with the single family detached dwelling. Basically, the Farmers Home Administration offers two rural housing pro- grams which are available to the rural elderly in repairing or replacing their homes. These are Farmers Home Administration's section 502 and 504 programs. Section 504 provides both low interest loans and grants for the elderly up to $5,000 to deal with basic repairs to make the property safe and habitable. Section 504 was not funded during the fiscal years 1965 through 1976. The Congress, however, authorized $5 million for grants in fiscal year 1977, which are authorized only for the elderly, that is persons 62 years of age or older. The 1978 fiscal year budget includes $5 million for this program and the Department has requested a supplemental appropriation of $4 million. This additional $4 million is contained in H. R. 9375, the supplemental appropriations bill to be taken up by the House of Representatives tomorrow. Loans under section 504 rural housing loans are made at an interest rate of 1 percent and may be amortized over a period of up to 20 years, depending on the amount of the loan. A section 504 rural housing grant is combined with a loan to the degree an applicant can afford repayment. Since 1970, $16 million-about 42 percent-of the section 504 funds obligated have been for the elderly. This financial assistance has made it possible for about 11,000 elderly families to repair their homes. In fiscal year 1977, the section 504 grant program was funded for the first time in several years, providing financial assistance to an additional 1,500 senior citizens. Under section 502 programs we assist the elderly in repairing their homes, and if the homes are beyond repair, we offer financial assistance to buy different homes which are safe, sanitary and decent. The interest rate on section 502 loans is curk-ently 8 percent. However, since many elderly citizens are on fixed, or limited incomes, such families may obtain interest credit subsidies that enable them to obtain the decent housing they otherwise could not afford. We can reduce the effective interest rate charged low-income families to as low as 1 percent, depend- ing on family income, family size, and the amount of annual loan installment, real estate taxes, and property insurance. Loans may be amortized over a 33-year period. Since 1970, about $260 million-2 percent-of the section 502 funds obligated have been for loans to the elderly, enabling over 20,000 senior citizens to buy a home or repair the home they already owned. Repair loans under both section 502 and 504 programs are made for such things as improving or providing water and waste disposal systems for the home, making structural repairs, repairing the roof, adding insulation and storm windows, and installing screens. These loans and grants are available in rural areas in all States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Trust Territories. The largest number of loans and grants for repair are made in the southeastern United States, principally Mississippi, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and Texas. The number of loans to senior citizens to buy or build dwellings has declined inrecent years, while the number of loans for repair purposes has increased. Webelieve this trend is due to erosion of family income due to inflation and thecorresponding increase in construction costs. Many elderly families are simplyunable, or unwilling, to request home ownership loans. Another factor may bethe availability of more rental units in rural areas which are providing attractiveand comfortable housing at rental rates that low and moderate income elderlyfamilies can afford to pay.The recently enacted Housing Act will permit us to provide congregate housingfor the elderly and handicapped. We will be developing regulations for this pro-gram as rapidly as possible, and anticipate a significant speed up and improvementin our ability to meet rural housing needs of the elderly. 1978 REPORT OF COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE PROGRAM EFFORTS STIMU-LATED BY THE NATIONAL EXTENSION WORKSHOP ON AGING SEPTEMBER 1976 Forty-five participants from 36 states and the District of Columbia respondedto a followup survey of action resulting from the National Extension SevrviceWorkshop on Programing For and With the Aging. At the close of the nationalworkshop ninety-three percent (93%) of all participants stated that they leftthe workshop with plans to initiate new and/or additional action in regard toprograming with the elderly in their respective states. Action ideas for imple-mentation both within Extension and outside Extension were generated by theparticipants at the workshop.The data presented below are indicative of the Extension program plannedaction and action that has already been initiated since the workshop for and withthe aging. This action stemmed from the inspiration and ideas gained by partic-ipants at the national workshop held in Dallas, Texas.A number of ideas for action have been planned and many have already beenimplemented in each of the 36 states and the District of Columbia from whichresponses were received in this survey. Significant planning and initiation ofaction to enhance programs for and with the aging have taken place particularlyin the northeast and southern Extension regions.Action within Cooperative Extension that has been initiated by more thanone-third of the States since the national workshop includes: stepped-up planningat the State level, updating of teaching materials, negotiating for interagencycooperation on programs for the aging, sharing of ideas from other States, trainingcounty Extension staffs on understanding and working effectively with the aging,and youth, and senior citizens working together. These and other action ideasthat are in the planning stage and/or have been initiated are presented in tableI below.

This was reported by nearly half of the respond- ents. The involvement of the elderly by county Extension staffs in program devel- opment and in the planning and conduct of pilot projects is being done exten- sively (see table III).

The program was federally funded but aides, who were employed by the Bureau of Aging, felt that they needed specific training in serving the needs of the elderly home bound. Extension Home Economist and the Bdireau of Aging representatives met together to discuss needs. A second meeting was scheduled where representatives of service groups (Health Department, Social Services Department, Bureau of Aging, and Cooperative Extension, etc.) could join hands in planning a program where each group could give support. State Extension staff members in the area of family life, nutrition and manage- ment met with the group to assist with planning and resource information. After the planning sessions were completed the following five training programs were scheduled and conducted for aides in the cane belt area. -Understanding the Elderly (Extension) -Nutrition and the Elderly (Extension) -What To Expect in Homes of Elderly and Home Bound (Welfare) -Household Tasks (Health Department Nurses) -Home Management (Extension) Aides trained during the sessions felt that they could be of greater service to the aging as a result of the training. This will be an ongoing type program where Extension will cooperate in helping people to help themselves. Approximately 200 families have been reached as a result of the program. 34 Senior citizens nutrition program in California In Tulare County there are approximately 35,000 citizens who are over the ageof 60. Many of these elderly are on their own, on fixed incomes and on specialdiets. They have many questions on low cost food buying and time saving andenergy saving food preparation tips. Often they do not understand why theyshould or should not exclude certain foods when on special diets. Many are insearch of recipes for low fat, low cholesterol, and low calorie diets.This year with the additional assistance of a nutrition aide trainee from theTulare County training center Extension launched a 90 day program to provideseniors with nutrition knowledge through: (1) a monthly newsletter, (2) nutritionteaching on a 1-to-1 basis and (3) educational program at senior citizen feedingsites. This program has been so successful that we will continue the program withassistance from CETA funds. The plans now are to expand the program and reachSpanish speaking seniors. Senior citizens study high priority problems The North Carolina Columbus County Council of Senior Citizens in cooperationwith the Agricultural Extension Service has attackedfour high priority problemsthrough education and action. The problems selected for study were: crimeprevention, retirement income, health maintenance, and meaningful use of time.A four session crime prevention program included demonstrations on preventionof street crimes while walking or riding; security of the home; fraud-bunco andhow to deal with con artists, and improving community and police workingrelations. Law enforcement officials and police science department of a communitycollege and Agricultural Extension staff served as resource persons. Transportationof the elderly to meetings was furnished by Community Action.The Boy Scouts, police and other civic groups assisted with getting homesburglar proof. A highly successful \"Lively Living\" seminar series sponsored by the ColumbusCounty Senior Citizen Council and Agricultural Extension was planned aroundhealth, income and leisure concerns. The seminar program included exercise,nutrition, meal planning, health frauds, retirement income management, willsand inheritance laws, estate planning and funeral arrangements; also, growinghanging planters, enjoying birds and travel. Resource persons involved wereretired people, Agricultural and Home Economics Extension Agents and StateExtension Specialists. The Columbus County Council of Senior Citizens was organized by ElaineBlake, Home Economics Extension Agent. A retired school superintendent is theCouncil president. 4-H PROGRAMS FOR THE ELDERLY A new publication, \"Seniors and Kids Involved in Learning Life's Skills,\" de-signed to aid in the development of 4-H programs for the elderly, has been pub-lished in Texas as a part of an Extension Service-USDA Special Needs Grant.Purpose of the project was to: -Identify needs of senior citizens that can be met through volunteer effortsin the 4-H program. -Identify intergenerational projects and programs presently being conducted inthe State that successfully meet needs of youth and older adults. -Identify a variety of opportunities for young and old to teach and learn from one another in ways that are beneficial to both. -Develop a format to encourage involvement of older adults as volunteers inthe 4-H program. The manual will assist county Extension agents in providing opportunities for4-H youth and older adults to interact, gain respect for each other as individuals, grow in their understanding of the aging process and develop friendships outsidetheir peer group. Included in the manual is an inventory of ideas for activities olderadults and youth can do together. It includes civic projects, individual and group help projects, service projects, entertainment, and fund raising plus ideas for a local advisory committee. This publication is being made available for all State4-H offices throughout the Nation. On the national level, 4-H is cooperating with the National Council on Agingin its Project Share-an intergenerational service program designed to bring aboutmaximum involvement of young and old people in community service to each other. During 1978-79, expertise of both NCOA and 4-H will develop and test programmodels for use in Project SHARE through a pilot program in 3 counties of Mary-land, involving 15-25 sites. If these pilot projects are successful in demonstrating how young people and the elderly can work together, plans are to extend this pro- 35 gram through 4-H nationwide. A manual will also be published and made available to other youth groups for orienting young people to work with the elderly. A few years ago, the American Association of Retired Persons invited 4-H'ers throughout the country to become involved with their members in a program of sharing ideas, community service endeavors and exploring of skills and talents. This cooperation is continuing to grow and today hundreds of 4-H'ers are active in more than 50 GAP (generation alliance program) groups nationwide. In addi- tion to working together on specific projects, young and old have an opportunity to discuss such topics as marriage and the family, value of higher education, crime prevention, history and future of our community, and others. Examples of pro- grams include: -The National Collegiate 4-H Clubs have GAP as its principal service project for the second consecutive year and are developing suggested GAP meeting programs. -4-H'ers in Sonoma County, California, have organized eight GAP groups in their communities, working together on crafts, landscaping grounds of apartment complexes for older persons, and recreational activities. -Seven GAP groups in Morgantown, W. Va., worked together to beautify local airport and in various craft programs. -In Manhattan, Kansas; Fargo, N. Dak.; and Lancaster, Ohio; 4-H'ers and AARP members assisted with the meals on wheels program and worked with retarded children in gardening and pet care. In addition to these types of activities, AARP members and 4-H'ers get together for social activities such as bowling, square dancing, tours, picnics and holiday events. Through all of these, both young and old gain a new under- standing and appreciation of another generation. In all States, 4-H'ers are involved in some type of community service project to help the elderly, as a part of their regular project program. For example, in Jeff Davis County, Georgia, 4-H'ers participate in a ' telephone reassurance program.\" Each 4-H'er enrolled in the program has a senior citizen phone buddy whom he calls every day at approximately the same time. Purpose of the program is to give security and companionship to any senior citizen who desires this service. In addition to understanding needs of elderly persons, 4-H'ers are learning a sense of responsibility for their phone buddies. Many 4-H'ers go beyond the daily phone call, remembering their friends on special days, doing errands for them, and preparing meals or special dishes for them. In five southwestern Utah counties, 4-H members began a community garden- ing project earmarked for \"golden agers\" who no longer could garden for them- selves. The community garden projects' expressed aim was to help increase the nutritional level of older rural folks' diets. As a result of this program, 4-H'ers supplied fresh vegetables to the elderly in 400 homes in the five counties, made regular visits to the homes of the elderly, and developed friendships and under- standing between them. In California, teenage 4-H'ers planted a community garden at a nursing home. Elderly residents assisted or became companions of the youth who prepared the gardens. Also, in Kansas City, Kansas, four local 4-H groups planted and maintain gardens in four nursing homes for senior citizens. Often residents of the home worked together with the youth in planting the gardens. Wisconsin's \"Grand Kids\" program continues to grow. In Shawano County, 4-H'ers in this program helped fix up the home of an elderly person. In Jackson County, 4-H'ers went door-to-door offering to rake lawns for the elderly. 4-H programs in Illinois included a foster-grandparent program, organization of a youth corps to assist senior citizens, use of skills of senior citizens in 4-H project work, and involvement of senior citizens in historical programs. In Colorado, community service recreation programs involving the elderly were conducted. . \"Expanded Horizons\" is a program being conducted in six southwest Virginia counties which last year involved 230 senior citizens and 1,931 4-H'ers. Through this project, senior citizens with folklore and mountain craft skills are located and introduced to 4-H'ers with similar interests. In Wythe County for example, elderly volunteers and 4-H'ers worked in small groups, often in the volunteer's home, on particular arts or crafts. As a result of this activity, a cooperative crafts market is being explored. In another county, the program offered quilting and woodworking field trips. In Dickinson County, a retired school teacher met with young people to discuss early educational systems, old health practices, and similar topics.

A more detailed analysis of the subject matter content of this ongoing research reveals that the foci are in such areas as: Studies Food Habits and Nutrition Studies of the Elderly -------------------- 15 Economic Characteristics and Needs of the Elderly ------ --------- 6 Health Care Among the Elderly ---------------------------------- 2 Community Services and the Aged -------------------------------- 7 Attitudes Toward Purchasing Goods and Services ------ ------------- 2 Housing and the Elderly ------------------------------------------ 6 Demographic Profiles of the Elderly -------------------------------- 7 Personal Adjustment Among the Elderly --------------------------- 1 Family Participation and Maintenance Among the Aged --------------- 1 Recreation Among the Elderly ------------------------------------- 1 Clothing Selection Among the Elderly ------ --------------------- 1 Retirement Preparation by the Elderly ------------------------------- 2 Several examples of the types of research underway would best depict the variety of and extent to which various States are pursuing research on the aged. The State of Vermont has a project underway which is looking into the effectiveness of title VII hot meals programs on home dietary intake of the recipients. A study in Tennessee is looking into the variations between what retired persons expected in retirement status and what they actually have found in that status. A study of alternatives means of property transfer between retired parent and offspring is being conducted in Oklahoma. Both States of Maine and New York are looking into architectural and landscape design as it affects the elderly. In addition, a study in New York is analyzing the alternatives of property tax concessions versus housing annuities for the low-income elderly. A number of studies are looking into the barriers to the coordination of human services for the elderly. A study in Maine is focused on the analysis of alternatives to the present systems of service delivery. Among the demographic studies underway, work in Illinois has revealed the increasing proportion of elderly found in nonmetropolitan areas due to selec- tive out-migration of the youth. Studies in Illinois revealed that 30 percent of the population in the 64 nonmetropolitan counties consisted of low-income elderly. ITEM 2. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE JANUARY 18, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The enclosed report on major Department of Commerce activities affecting the aging is submitted as requested. The report's focus is on 1977, but activities to be continued or undertaken in 1978 are also briefly mentioned. Sincerely, JUANITA M. KREPS. [Enclosure.] PROGRAMS FOR THE AGING-1977 STATISTICAL RESEARCH, DATA, AND PUBLICATIONS The following reports were issued during 1977 by the Census Bureau in its Current Population Reports series. These reports contain statistical data on the demographic, economic, and social characteristics of older Americans. Many of the reports are issued annually and will be updated in 1978. Series P-SO No. 305-------- 306 __-_---307--------310-------- May 1977 a report entitled \"A Comparative Study of the Selected MinorityElderly Populations in Austin and Pittsburgh\" was delivered to the Administra-tion on Aging. The report completed requirements for an interagency agreementbetween the Bureau of the Census and the Administration on Aging. The reportdiscussed the analysis of differences among various minority elderly populations inthe Austin and Pittsburgh SMSA's. Using selected data from the 1970 Census ofPopulation and Housing and developing social areas (from tract-level data)comparisons were made at the tract, area, and SMSA levels. Implications of theresearch in Austin and Pittsburgh for further research with census data on theelderly were discussed. One of the major features of the report was an appendixon census data available for minority elderly populations. That appendix isscheduled for publication by the Center for Census Use Studies sometime in theearly Spring of 1978. During 1977 the demand for the report \"Demographic Aspects of Aging andthe Older Population in the United States,\" series P-23, No. 58 (published in 1976)exhausted the supply. The report is being revised and will be reprinted.Dr. Paul Glick, Mr. Jacob Siegel, and Mr. Harold Wallach of the CensusBureau participated in the meeting of the Gerontological Society in San Fran-cisco in November 1977. Dr. Glick presented a paper titled \"Perspectives onLiving Arrangements of the Elderly.\" Mr. Siegel was the invited discussant atthe symposium on the mortality of the elderly, and Mr. Wallach discussed \"ThePlanning Process and Social Statistics for the Elderly\" in another session.In September Mr. Siegel had addressed a seminar in social gerontology held atthe Human Development and Family Relationship Center of the University ofConnecticut. His topic was \"The Demography of Aging.\"Title Geographical Mobillty: March 1975 to March 1976.Marital Status and Living Arrangements: March 1976.Population Profile of the United States: 1976.Persons of Spanish Origin in the United States: March 1976.Household and Family Characteristics: March 1976.Marriage, Divorce, Widowhood, and Remarriage by FamilyCharacteristics: June 1975.Households and Families by Type: March 1977.Persons of Spanish Origin in the United States: March 1977(Advance Report).

The Department's National Technical Information Services (NTIS) sells two technical reports which treat the aging: 1. \"The Elderly,\" NTIS-PS-77/0673/2P&B, contains selected abstracts of research reports submitted to NTIS by both Federal agencies and private organi- zations or by individuals with Federal grants and contracts. The report primarily treats topics on social services, health, housing, and transportation problems. 2. \"Transportation for the Elderly or Physically Handicapped,\" NTIS-PS- 77/0713, contains abstracts of reports on transportation difficulties and designs as they relate to the aged and handicapped population. The source documents were submitted to NTIS from both Federal and non-Federal organizations. SAFETY The Center for Fire Research of the National Bureau of Standards continued two research programs which should benefit the aging. One is to develop life safety systems for the type of buildings frequently used by the aging, e.g., hospitals, nursing homes and other institutional facilities. The program is focusing on six elements of life safety: (1) Decision analysis; (2) behavior in fire emergencies; (3) alarm and communication systems; (4) smoke control systems; (5) fire and smoke detectors; and (6) automatic extinguishment. This work is supported by and done in conjunction with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The second program is to develop new flammability standards for general wearing apparel and upholstered furniture. The center is developing the technical base and test method for these standards. Garments worn by the elderly and furniture purchased by them will be covered by these new standards, which will be pro- mulgated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The National Fire Prevention and Control Administration (NFPCA) continued several research and public education programs. One involves research on fire prevention methods and standards for nursing homes and hospitals. The program, which began in 1976, will continue through 1978. In a continuing public education project, NFPCA used written materials and radio/TV spots and programs directed toward fire prevention among the elderly. The public education office maintains a brochure for senior citizens advising them of fire prevention methods and escape procedures should a fire actually occur. NFPCA began pilot testing a program to include senior citizens in fire pre- vention home inspection programs with local fire departments. If the pilot pro- gram is successful, NFPCA expects to expand it throughout the country. This program will continue through 1978. HEALTH-RELATED RESEARCH The National Bureau of Standadrs (NBS) continued a number of studies which have direct bearing on the health and well-being of older persons. One deals with- metallic biological implants (e.g., heart pacemakers and skeletal replacements), whose use has increased dramatically in recent years to the present number of 2,000,000 metal implants per year in the U.S. alone. NBS, with its advanced materials capability and expertise, has made a major contribution to this success by providing the standards, characterization, testing and material properties which could be combined with the medical input. Skeletal and reconstructive surgical implants require strong, inert, biocompatible material, and although presently used materials are good, many deficiencies still exist. Research is con- tinuing at NBS in this area with an overall goal to provide improved data leading to metal implants which will not fail unexpectedly in service or produce adverse reaction. The measurement of small amounts of heat by calorimetry (microcalorimetry) has become very important to health care of the elderly since this care involves diagnostic clinical tests in which temperature measurement and control are crucial. The NBS biochemical thermodynamics program is continually researching methods to lessen and/or solve problems in health care facilities frequented more by the elderly. Some of these problems focus on procedures for clinical laboratory assay and analysis for glucose and uric acid; and nondestructive evaluation of cardiac pacemaker units and electrochemical power cells for these units. NBS efforts in this program can substantially improve the microcalorimetric measurement ca- pabilities and accuracy in the Nation's health care program. Also ongoing are programs concerning neutron techniques, which have impacted strongly in areas of medicine, health and safety. The use of these techniques has helped solve many trace element measurement problems in foods and body fluids 24-084 0 -78 -4 44 that have proven essential to physicians in diagnosing various types of illnessesin the elderly. A major research effort is continuing with the National Institutesof Arthritis and Metabclic Diseases to better understand the metabolic mechanismsand disorders which trigger disease and enzyme activity in the digestive process.Information obtained in this program will allow physicians to better diagnose andtreat the elderly who are most often plagued with digestive disorders and relateddiseases. The third in a continuing series of annual workshops on reliability technologyfor cardiac pacemakers was held in October 1977. The workshop was attendedprimarily by technical representatives of pacemaker manufacturers, pacemakerbattery manufacturers, and suppliers of materials, components, and services tothe pacemaker community. Also among the attendees, which totaled 157 (about 70 percent increase in attendance over the previous meeting) were representativesof the Food and Drug Administration and other industrial and governmentalorganizations concerned with reliability. The NBS-sponsored workshop addressed the following areas of concern:battery evaluation, characterization, and quality control; moisture measurementand control problems; procurement and assurance of high reliability componentsand systems; and materials and assembly processes.The TV captioning system to aid the deaf and hard-cf-hearing (which par-ticularly impacts the aged) now has the support of President Carter. He recentlyurged the major networks to consider the matter, and all three have expressed awillingness to discuss the possibility. The closed captioning system was first developed and demonstrated by NBSin 1971. \"Closed\" captioning means the captions are \"hidden\" in the TV signaland the viewer would have to add a special attachment to the TV set to make thecaptions appear on the screen. This eliminates annoyance to viewers with normal hearing who do not want to see the captions. The FCC approved the use of closed captions in December 1976, and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) network now broadcasts some of its major programs with closed captions. For this to become a valuable aid for the hearing- impaired, all of the networks will have to implement use of the system. NBS furnishes, on a continuing (reimbursable) basis, technical data and test results on hearing aids to the Veterans Administration for their use in selecting hearing aids for their clients, of which a substantial percentage are assumed to be elderly. The VA makes the test results available through the Government Print- ing Office so that other Federal and state agencies may make use of the data in selecting hearing aids. In 1971 NBS published a 32-page consumer's guide, \"Facts about Hearing and Hearing Aids,\" which is of use to the elderly and their families. A revised and updated publication on hearing aid devices will be issued in 1978 and will include a discussion of the new regulations on hearing aids issued by the Food and Drug Administration. The regulations appeared in the February 15, 1977, issue of the Federal Register. The publication will be part of the NBS Consumer Information Series. The National Weather Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides daily weather forecasts which are useful to all citizens but may be critical for older persons. The forecasts of severe storms, extreme heat, the pollution index, floods, tornados, and hurricanes provide advance infor- mation which helps less mobile older citizens plan and act on ways to avoid predicted weather which could force a crisis. For long range planning before retirement, NOAA's Environmental Data Service (EDS) makes information available on weather trends in various regions of the country. BUSINESS ASSISTANCE District Offices of the Industry and Trade Administration (formerly the Domestic and International Business Administration) continued a cooperative venture with the service corps of retired executives (SCORE). Members of SCORE have assisted in seminars on international trade promotion and business planning. Because of limited resources of their own, the district offices could not sponsor such seminars without assistance from SCORE. The district offices also maintained contacts with the various State depart- ments of labor and industry to provide business information and assist individuals establish new small businesses. Special attention is given to older persons. PATENTS The Patent and Trademark Office continued the practice of allowing patent applications from persons aged 65 or older to be \"made special.\" That designation provides for examination of the patent application earlier than its filing date would normally permit. The practice is allowed by section 708.02 of the Manual of Patent Examining Procedures. The following patents which directly affect the aging were granted during the year: Patent No. 4007266-A composition containing vitamin B-12 used as a method for treatment of disorders due to aging of the skin. Patent No. 4010296A composition and method for treating viruses in humans. Infections such as influenza are especially severe in older patients. Patent No. 4025645A method of treating inflammatory conditions such as acute hemorrhoids and skin-graft donor site edemas, which affect aged individuals.Patent No. 4034083--A composition and method for treating and/or preventing hypercholesterolemia.Patent No. 4034113--A method of treating senile geriatric humans to restore performance (mental alertness) pPatent No. 4058591--A method of treating patients with multiple sclerosis, adisease which affects many aged people. ITEM 3. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE JANUARY 12, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in reply to your letter of December 14, 1977,requesting information on Department of Defense actions and programs related to aging.The Department of Defense continues to operate one of the most compre- hensive retirement planning programs for civilian employees in the Federal Government. Integrated into the overall personnel management process, our program is designed primarily to assist employees in their adjustment to retire- ment and to assist management in planning for replacement manpower needs. It encompasses extensive preretirement counseling for employees (and their spouses in many instances) on such subjects as financial planning, health needs,leisure time activities, living arrangements and personal guidance; and includes trial retirement and gradual retirement options for employees where feasible. We believe our program helps alleviate many of the problems that employees have encountered in the past when approaching retirement age. We expect tocontinue the operation of this program through 1978. The military departments and defense agencies, in cooperation with communityhealth officials, have continued to provide multiphasic occupational wealth programs and service to employees, and in some cases to former employees who have retired. Many of these programs and services are designed to address prob- lems generally associated with increasing age. Included are health guidance and counseling, periodic testing for diseases and disorders, immunizations and treat-ments. We plan to continue to provide these services to employees to the maximum extent possible during 1978.Within the department active and continuing efforts are conducted to eliminatediscrimination based upon age. These actions include the revision of internal regulations to assure that age is not used as a selection criterion or screeningfactor in any type of personnel action, and the continual examination of personnel policies, practices, and procedures for possible conflict with equal employmentopportunity intent, including discriminatory use of age. These are continuing efforts.In summary, the Department of Defense has operated a comprehensive retirc- ment planning program for civilian employees, provided extensive health care services to employees and carried out an ongoing, affirmative action programto preclude discrimination based on age. These program efforts will be continued in 1978. We appreciate the efforts of the Senate Special Committee on Aging and the opportunity to comment on the department's efforts in this area. Sincerely, (Signed) WILLIAM C. VALDES, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Civilian Personnel Policy). ITEM 4. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY FEBRUARY 1, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: In response to your request of December 14, 1977, to Secretary Schlesinger, I am pleased to provide a summary of the Department of Energy's (DOE) major activities affecting the aging during the past year and anticipated in 1978. These activities include those directed specifically at resolv- ing the energy-related problems of the elderly, as well as activities affecting low-income persons, a large proportion of whom are the elderly. Weatherization program.-President Carter, in his National Energy Plan, re- quested increased funds to provide grants to States for the Low-Income Weather- ization program. This program, authorized under the Energy Conservation and Production Act, provides-for the purchase of materials to weatherize homes occu- pied by low-income persons, particularly the elderly. The President requested that $130 million be provided in fiscal year 1978, and an additional $200 million in each of fiscal years 1979 and 1980 for this program. In 1977, DOE began imple- mentation of the weatherization program by disbursing $27 million to 49 States, the District of Columbia, and to various Indian tribes. We anticipate these grants will result in weatherization of some 115,000 homes, with 80 to 85 percent of these homes being occupied by elderly persons. If the full $130 million requested for fiscal year 1978 is approved, approximately 442,000 additional homes would be weatherized. Energy emergency planning guide.-An energy emergency planning guide for winter has been prepared in recognition of the need to be adequately prepared for situations like those that occurred during last winter's energy shortages. The guide: -Identifies and evaluates actions and programs to deal with energy emergencies this winter. Included in the guide are assistance programs such as special energy assistance for the elderly to help pay fuel bills as well as the use of emergency food stamps to supplement the needs of low-income people during an energy emergency. -Provides an advance indication to the public of those actions considered most likely to be taken by the Federal Government. -Provides State and local governments with recommended actions they can take to deal with energy emergencies. The guide was developed by the Winter Energy Emergency Plans Task Force, an interagency task force established by Secretary Schlesinger -in July, 1977. The task force was assisted by numerous State and local government organiza- tions and from the private sector. Energy emergency center.-In addition, DOE has established an energy emer- gency center (EEC) to serve as a focal point this winter for coordination of energy emergency efforts and for communications between Federal, State and local governments. The EEC is manned on a 24-hour basis. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and has EEC representatives in each of the DOE regional offices. In addition to the above activities, DOE has assisted in efforts by the Depart- ment of Health, Education, and Welfare to provide emergency assistance for low-income persons most severly affected by rising fuel costs. This has included work with the Community Services Administration during the 1976-77 winter heating season to develop allocation criteria for the energy crisis relief program. Energy prices and consumption of the elderly.-The Federal Energy Administra- tion (FEA), now a part of DOE, prepared a report entitled \"Energy Prices and Energy Consumption by Older Americans: 1973, 1976 and an Estimate for 1985.\" This report estimates home fuel and gasoline expenditures for those households headed by persons aged 60 and over and compares these expenditures with house- holds headed by persons under 60 years old, The data is further classified by income size and regions. Human resources data system.-FEA designed and implemented a \"Comprehen- sive Human Resources Data System\" which provides a tool for evaluating the impact on energy consumption over time of proposed energy policies and pro- grams on a variety of population subgroups including the elderly. These sub- groups have been cross-classified by a variety of demographic and economic characteristics, at national, regional, and State levels. A report, based on this system, was issued showing the distributional impacts of energy price increases on households, including the elderly. Impact of 1976-77 winter on low-income households.-FEA, in conjunction with the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and the Edison Electric Institute, collected data for residential gas and oil users to determine the financial burden placed on low-income households by the abnormal cold weather experienced during the winter of 1976-77. Citizen town hall meetings on national energy policy.-FEA held a series of 10 citizen town hall meetings on national energy policy in its regional cities between March 15 and 21, 1977. The meetings were designed to obtain citizen ideas and opinions to be considered by the administration in developing the President's energy policy message to the American people. The meetings were attended by approximately 2,700 persons, and a special effort was made to obtain comments from the elderly and groups and organizations representing aging persons. Task Force on Aging statistics.-DOE is a member of the Administration on Aging's Task Force on Aging Statistics. That task force has completed a directory of aging statistics existing within the Federal government. Regional office activities.-DOE regional offices continue to work with regional Administration on Aging counterparts concerning policies and programs affecting the elderly. Some of the specific activities conducted by DOE (then FEA) regional offices in 1977 are presented in attachment 1. Research related to biological aging.-The Energy Research and Development Administration, now part of DOE, conducted a substantial amount of research related to the health effects of emissions from energy technologies on the aging. Attachment 2 presents this in detail. Similar research of this kind will continue in 1978. I hope you find this information useful and that it proves to be the same for the many people who look forward to receiving the Special Committee's annual report. Sincerely, ALVIN L. ALM, Assistant Secretary for Policy and Evaluation. [Enclosures.] Attachment 1 REGIONAL OFFICE ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE AGED Region I A report entitled \"The Energy Crisis and New England's Elderly\" was pre- pared through the Federal Regional Council and the Federal Executive Board. The report outlines accomplishments, problems, and future directions of existing energy related programs affecting the elderly. Region III Through the Federal Regional Council a plan was developed to enable elderly persons in West Virginia to obtain home heating coal. In West Virginia some elderly persons have been unable to obtain coal for home heating because small mines have gone out of business and dealers are unable to accommodate residential end-users.Region V An information and referral system on energy information for the aged was developed taping radio and television programs with local networks to inform citizens about local aging programs. Region VI Participated in four 2-day public forums on energy and the elderly, cosponsored by the southwest regional council and various State agencies. Forums were held in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. 48 Region VII In conjunction with the Federal Executive Board's Committee on CommunityServices, sponsored an energy conservation seminar for the elderly in the KansasCity area. Region VIII A slide presentation was developed to acquaint elderly citizens and otherswith utility rate structures and the regulatory process. Attachment 2 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESEARCH RELATED TO BIOLOGICAL AGING A major category of biological research administered by the division of bio-medical and environmental research seeks to define the kinds and severity of healtheffects that are induced by long-term exposures to physical or chemical agentsassociated with the energy technologies. Research of this type includes lifetimestudies of biological responses in human and animal populations exposed tomeasured or estimated doses of toxic agents, alone or (less frequently) in combi-nation. Lifetime studies yield data on life span, morbidity, mortality, and causesof death in exposed and control (unexposed) populations. Analysis of such dataprovides essential information on life shortening and diseases responsible fordiminished life span in exposed animals. In order to develop predictive capabilities,the magnitude of life shortening and of the increase in incidence of life-shorteningdiseases must be quantitatively correlated with the magnitude of the total doseand the dose rate. The manner in which these critical biological responses may beaffected by different modes of exposure to toxic agents, by biological factors, orother variables must also be defined, as must pathophysiological and mechanisticaspects of response parameters. For more than 2 decades, the department (and its predecessors) has sponsoreda large-scale program of lifetime studies concerned with late (delayed), lifeshortening effects of ionizing radiation. Not only have these studies stimulatedinterest in life span, mortality patterns, and life shortening, they have also raisedquestions regarding radiation effects on the aging process and about age as avariable affecting radiosensitivity. Such interests have estimated research on theaging process and on age-related phenomens. While research of the latter type hasbeen pursued on a limited scale, overall, sustained efforts have developed, particu-larly at the Argonne National Laboratory and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.Lifetime studies of human and animal populations constitute the predominantelement in the ongoing program of research related to biological aging. Support-ing research necessary for an understanding of life-shortening health effects isconducted at the organ, tissue, cellular, and molecular levels. Animal studies em-phasize interspecies comparisons and include research with both short-lived andlong-lived species. The goal of the lifetime studies and supporting research is todevelop realistic predictive models that may be used to estimate human healtheffects under various conditions of exposure. Since lifetime studies related to thenonnuclear technologies are just now getting underway, the preponderance ofongoing work deals with populations exposed to ionizing radiation.It is worthy of note that several of the major Department of Energy laboratoriesare contributing data to a laboratory animal data bank that is being developed bythe Battelle Columbus Laboratories under support from the National Library ofMedicine and other Federal health agencies. The Department of Energy laborato-ries are providing data on life histories, pathology, hematology, and clinical chem-istry for control (unexposed) animals, both short-lived and long-lived. Thesedata are being processed for computer storage, retrieval, and analysis along withdata from other sources. Research more directly related to the aging process itself is also currently inprogress, but on a much smaller scale. Continuing interest and research persist atthe Argonne National Laboratory and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Mr. George A. Sacher, leader of the Argonne aging research group, is currently serving. as president-elect of the Gerontological Society and was the recipient of thesociety's 1976 Kleemeier award in recognition of his distinguished research on aging.The Oak Ridge research program is conducted jointly with the University ofTennessee Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and is supported in part by atraining grant from the National Institute on Aging. Other research on aging iseither conducted on a small scale or on a short-term or periodic basis. Ongoing research on or related to aging is summarized below: LONG-TERM STUDIES OF HUMAN POPULATIONS Although these studies are not concerned with the aging process per se, they do produce valuable data on the extent and causes of life shortening in human popu- lations exposed to identifiable energy-related stresses. Additional information of in- terest on life span, mortality patterns, and causes of death in unexposed human populations is also collected. Since long-term human studies are costly, time con- suming, and inherently complex, they are initiated on a highly selective basis. The Radiation Effects Research Foundation (formerly the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission), which is sponsored jointly by the governments of the United States and Japan, is conducting a large-scale lifetime followup of survi- vors of atomic bombings that occurred at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Over 100,000 persons are under observation in this study. Detailed clinical and labora- tory studies as well as the collection of mortality and autopsy data are performed on both irradiated and control populations in order to obtain data on the diseased states that have contributed to elevated morbidity and life shortening among the survivors. Valuable quantitative data on dose-response relationships are being col- lected as well. From time to time, information on age-related phenomena are also reported. A group of some 200 inhabitants of the Marshall Islands, who were accidently exposed in 1954 to radioactive fallout released during the atmospheric testing of a thermonuclear device, has been followed clinically, along with unexposed controls, by medical investigators at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The clinical followup is continuing on a semiannual basis. Thyroid pathology has been prevalent in individuals heavily exposed to radioactive iodine. Nearly 2,000 persons exposed to radium occupationally or for medical reasons have been studied at the Center for Human Radiobiology of the Argonne National Laboratory. Many individuals in the study receive medical and radiologic (dosi- metric) examinations at the center. Autopsy data are obtained whenever possible. Current work emphasizes the study of persons with relatively low body burdens of radium. Valuable data on tumor induction by bone-seeking, alpha-emitting radionuclides such as radium-226 are being generated in this study. Included in the output are quantitative dose-response data. The center recently initiated an epidemiologic study of a large worker population occupationally exposed to thorium (an alpha-emitting radioelement) by inhalation during the period from about 1935 to 1974. This study utilizes vital statistics, employment histories, and Social Security Administration records to evaluate health effects of internally deposited thorium. Dosimetric measurements have been made on some 46 workers. Both a mortality study and a morbidity study are being developed. The center is also conducting a followup study in a small number of exposed humans to evaluate late-appearing health effects of plutonium. At the Los Alamos scientific laboratory, an epidemiologic study of plutonium workers, past and present, in six major Department of Energy facilities is in progress. This effort involves a lifetime surveillance of health and causes of death. An estimated 15,000-20,000 workers will be followed in a study of mortality data, and at least one-third of these will also be studied on the basis of detailed morbidity and personal history data collected periodically via questionnaires. Data on internal dosimetry will be routinely obtained in order to study dose-response relationships. Autopsy data will be acquired through the U.S. Transuranium Registry (see below). A population of some 170,000 past and present contractor employees at Depart- ment of Energy production and laboratory facilities is being analyzed in an epi- demiologic study (known as the health and mortality study) designed to evaluate health effects produced by long-term exposure to low levels of ionizing radiation. Worker populations at the Hanford (Washington) and Oak Ridge (Tennessee) plants plus a smaller group at the Mound Laboratory (Miamisburg, Ohio) are the subjects of the study, which has been directed by staff at the University of Pitts- burgh Graduate School of Public Health with assistance in data collection and processing from the three facilities possessing workers' records. Overall respon- sibility for the health and mortality study is currently being transferred to the Oak Ridge associated universities. The study involves the statistical analysis of work records, medical records, and vital statistics (including mortality data and causes of death). Radiation dosimetry as well as exposures to other toxic agents in the work environment are carefully evaluated. Most radiation exposures in the worker populations have been at a low level. The U.S. Transuranium Registry, which operates through the Hanford Envi- ronmental Health Foundation, collects occupational data of great value in the evaluation of mortality patterns and causes of death in worker populations occu- 50 pationally exposed to plutonium or other transuranium radioelements. In par- ticular, detailed autopsy data are obtained on workers registered with the Foundation at the time of their death. At the present time, some 4,264 workers from 10 facilities are registered, and 65 autopsies have been performed. The autopsy data are used in epidemiological studies, including the health and mortality study and the Los Alamos study of plutonium workers. Lifetime studies of human populations exposed to hazardous agents associated with nonnuclear technologies is still limited. However, one such effort is now getting underway at the University of Rochester where plans are being developed for an epidemiologic study of humans exposed occupationally or accidentally to mercury. Other nonnuclear studies are expected to be initiated in the future on a selective basis. LIFETIME STUDIES OF LONG-LIVED MAMMALS Although data from exposed human populations are indispensable in the assess- ment of health effects of any toxic agent, limitations inherent in human studies make it mandatory to acquire a substantial body of quantitative data from care- fully controlled lifetime studies of animals. For purposes of comparison and a better understanding of variables affecting response patterns, data from both long-lived and short-lived species are needed. The beagle dog, with a life expect- ancy about one-fifth that of man, has served for more than 20 years as the long- lived mammal used in lifetime radiation-effects studies sponsored by the depart- ment. Data from beagle studies significantly facilitate attempts to interrelate data on animal responses with human response patterns. At the Argonne National Laboratory, the University of Utah, the University of California at Davis, the Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, and the Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute (Lovelace Foundation), more than 5,000 beagles have lived out their lives under careful experimental observations. In lifetime studies at these research centers, periodic clinical examinations and laboratory analyses are performed on all populations, exposed and control, and complete data on gross pathology and histopathology are collected at autopsy. Accumulated data contain a wealth of information on life span, morbidity, mortality, and causes of death in normal animals, as well as alterations in these characteristics that are induced by super- imposed radiation stress. Approximately 3,000 beagles are currently under obser- vation in lifetime studies of late-appearing radiation effects. No energy-related agent other than ionizing radiation has yet been studied in beagle populations. It is anticipated that such studies will be performed in the future on a highly selective basis depending upon the outcome of preliminary toxicological screening and evaluation in simpler test systems, currently in progress. LONG-TERM STUDIES WITH OTHER SPECIES Small rodents with life spans of 2-3 years (mice, rats, hamsters) have been used extensively in large-scale studies of late somatic and genetic effects induced by low doses of ionizing radiation. At the Argonne National Laboratory and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory combined, more than 50,000 mice have been exposed to various doses of externally applied ionizing radiation delivered in different daily increments in order to characterize radiation-induced diseased states that contribute to life-span reduction under different exposure regimes. These studies, in which gamma and neutron irradiation have been used, have yielded valuable information on the importance of dose rate and radiation quality as factors affecting the nature of the mammalian response to radiation stress. In addition, unexposed (control) populations have been characterized in terms of life span, morbidity patterns, and causes of death. Extensive lifetime studies of tumorigenesis and other late somatic effects of ionizing radiation in rodent populations have also been carried out at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, the Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, and the Lovelace Foundation's Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute. Some 30,000 rodents are currently under observation in ongoing lifetime studies at the above-mentioned laboratories. In the toxicological evaluation of agents associated with the nonnuclear technologies, present emphasis centers on screening in simple cellular test systems and the use of short-term in vivo methods. As potentially hazardous substances are identified in the preliminary testing effort, followup animal studies are initiated as appropriate. At the present time, only a small number of lifetime studies of nonnuclear agents has been completed or initiated. Results from pre- liminary animal studies of trace metals, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and asbestos, all of which are of interest in the energy context, have been reported. 51 Study of the inhalation toxicology of manmade insulating fibers is getting under- way in the Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute. At the Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, rodents exposed by inhalation to coal dust and diesel exhaust, alone and in combination, are under lifetime observation in a study addressing the health hazards of coal mining. Long-term inhalation studies of fossil-fuel combustion products (particularly respirable particles, sulfur dioxide, and acid sulfate aerosols) have been initiated at several laboratories (Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute, and University of California, Davis). Additional studies of these sorts can be expected in the future. Increasing attention is also being given to long-term studies of interactive effects in animal populations exposed to more than one toxic agent. RESEARCH MORE DIRECTLY CONCERNED WITH AGING Although the Department of Energy does not attempt to sponsor a program of aging research, focuses of interest within the laboratory structure sustain a low level of research directly related to biological aging. Research at the Argonne National Laboratory addresses theoretical, genetic, and physiologic aspects of the aging process. In this work, extensive use is made of small laboratory and wild rodents with life spans ranging from 2 to 6 years in order to gain a better understanding of genetic and physiologic aspects of aging. Genetic research seeks to identify heritable factors that govern differences in longevity within and between rodent species. In addition to classical mammalian genetics, this study includes work on genetically determined DNA excission re- pair, the rate of which has been found to correlate with maximum life span among a substantial number of animal species tested. Physiologic studies at the Argonne National Laboratory have emphasized homeostatic control, localized in the brain, as a regulator of aging and determinant of lifespan. Current work in this area is concerned with defining what kind of role circadian or other biological rhythms (which, in higher animals, appear to be regulated by the brain) may play in the aging process. Genetic and physiologic aspects of aging are also under study at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Over the years, Oak Ridge investigators have completed a number of studies that have helped define and interrelate aging and radiation effects on the immune system. Particular emphasis in this work has centered on the immune surveillance mechanism that detects and destroys abnormal (includ- ing cancer) cells in body tissues. Results of recent experiments suggest that radia- tion induced immunosuppression may play a relatively minor role in radiation carcinogenesis in the mouse. Ongoing work includes the study of T-cell suppressor activity and tumorigenesis in aged mice. In another study area, work has begun on an effort to explore further the direct relationship that appears to exist between DNA repair efficiency and life span in higher animals. Since DNA repair is con- veniently studied in cultured cells, ORNL investigators have been developing cell lines from a number of short-lived and long-lived animals preparatory to repair measurements. Another study in the molecular genetics area has detected the existence of a slight age-related increase in the isoleucine content of human hemo- globin. Since human hemoglobin normally contains no coded isoleucine, its presence is presumed to result from an error in protein synthesis. Several problems related to aging have recently been addressed at the Brook- haven National Laboratory. A recently completed lifetime study has confirmed and extended the previous finding at Brookhaven that L-dopa, an amino acid synthesized in the brain, can substantially prolong mean life span in the mouse. Another study has identified the occurrence of an age-related decrease in the rate of collagen synthesis in skin and periodontal ligament of rats. Plans have also been developed for a study to determine if hematopoietic stem cell pools become de- pleted in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases as predicted by the Hayflick theory of cellular aging. Small scale and/or short-term studies of aging constitute a part of several othe laboratory programs including those at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Most of these studies are conducted at the molecular and cellular levels. TRENDS AND PROSPECTS Given the importance of lifetime studies of exposed populations in characterizing health effects of toxic agents, such studies will continue to play a key role in the department's risk assessment effort. An increasing proportion of ongoing lifetime 52 studies will evaluate agents related to the nonnuclear technologies as preliminary screening of such agents in simple test systems is completed and as advancednonnuclear technologies approach commercialization. Within the context of these program projections, the continuation of a modest program of research on theaging process seems likely.

INTRODUCTION The Older Americans Act of 1965 mandated the establishment of the Adminis-tration on Aging, now located within the Office of Human Development Services,Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The Administration on Agingwas created to serve as the Federal focal point and advocate for the concernsof the Nation's older persons and to foster coordination and increased com- ISee appendix 5, page 281 for report of the Administration for Public Service. 53 mitment of Federal resources to the field of aging. We are in'a transitional period in as much as we are changing from a young society to an older society. At the turn of the century only 4 percent of our population was over 65, while today it is 10 percent. By the year 2030 it will be between 17 percent and 20 percent and even higher in some communities. An increasing proportion of the elderly will be over 75. In 1977, 38 percent of the elderly population was over 75 years of age. By the year 2000 this number is expected to increase to 43 percent. Current data indicates that between 4 and 4.5 million older persons may need assistance in order to continue to live independently in their own communities. At least 18 percent of older persons are limited in their mobility because of chronic con- ditions. Recent estimates show that half of the elderly living alone had incomes under $3,000, while one-third of older families had incomes less than $6,000. Among elderly whites, one of every seven was poor, while over one-third of elderly blacks were below the poverty level. To serve these needs, the Administration on Aging focuses special concern on the poor, disabled, minority, and socially isolated elderly. Title I of the Older Americans Act declares the following 10 national objectives for Older Americans. (1) Adequate income, (2) Best possible physical and mental health, (3) Suitable housing, (4) Full restorative services, (5) Employment opportunity, (6) Right to retirement, (7) Involvement in society, (8) Community services, (9) Research benefits, and (10) Freedom and independence. In February of 1977, the Administration on Aging formulated four new long- range goals which guide the agency in seeking to meet these objectives for older Americans. These goals are: (1) To increase the number of older persons who receive needed services, with particular attention paid to low-income and minority older persons. (2) To increase Federal resources used to serve the needs of older persons. (3) To modify public and private policies to promote achievement of the objec- tives for older persons identified in title I of the Older Americans Act. (4) To promote increased involvement of Americans of all ages to solve the problems of older persons. The need to provide for assistance to the growing number of older persons is a national priority. AoA serves to meet this need in two ways. First, through ad- vocacy, AoA encourages others to assume a share of this responsibility. Second, AoA provides assistance where others cannot. In order to accomplish this, AoA has supported the development of a network of State and area agencies on aging. This network is encouraging communities to design and implement comprehensive and coordinated service systems to serve the needs of older persons. ORGANIZATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION ON AGING To carry out its mandates, the Administration on Aging has been organized in the following manner: (1) the Office of the Commissioner on Aging; (2) the Office of Planning and Evaluation; (3) the Office of State and Community Programs; (4) the Office of Research, Demonstrations, and Manpower Resources; (5) the Na- tional Clearinghouse on Aging; (6) the field liaison staff; and (7) 10 regional offices on aging.' The Office of Planning and Evaluation (OPE) serves as the focal point in the Administration on Aging for forward 5-year planning, policy analysis, legislation, budget formulation, and evaluation. It conducts policy analyses of program issues affecting AoA and programs for the aging, formulates the budget, develops and updates AoA's 5-year forward plan, prepares AoA's annual reports to the President and Congress, develops and carries out program evaluation for AoA, developes legislative proposals, and identifies and reports on policy issues regarding propose legislation and regulations which will affect the elderly. The Office of State and Community Programs (OSCP) has major responsibility for development and assessment of the State and community programs on aging (title III), the multipurpose senior centers program (title V), and the Nutrition I A reorganization is in process. 54 Program for the Elderly (title VII). In addition, OSCP developes regulations, policies, and guidelines for use by State and area agencies on aging, nutrition project agencies and, where appropriate, Senior Centers; develops optional models and disseminates \"best practice\" suggestions for use by the regional offices, State agencies on aging, area agencies on aging, and nutrition project agencies; develops and monitors, in cooperation with other AoA units, management information and reporting systems which provide information to facilitate planning and program adjustment for management efficiency at all organizational levels; and carries out other related functions. AoA's Office of Research, Demonstrations, and Manpower Resources has lead responsibility as a focal point for coordination of research on aging by Federal agencies; provides the chairman and secretariat services to the Interagency Task Force on Aging Research; develops policy, supports projects and monitors progress of research, demonstration, and manpower resources programs under title IV of the Older Americans Act and the model projects program authorized by section 308 of the act; and carries out other functions supportive of AoA's mandate to provide national leadership and expertise in encouraging new knowledge and upgrading competencies in the field of aging. AoA's National Clearinghouse on the Aging serves as the focal point within the Federal Government for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of in- formation related to the needs and problems of older persons and, wherever possible, develops and coordinates programs with other offices and agencies to fill gaps in information in the field of aging; develops policy for information and referral services; provides technical assistance for State agencies on aging in the development of information and referral services; provides the chairman of, and secretariat services for the Interagency Task Force on Information and Referral, and to the Federal Task Force on Statistics; produces a variety of professional and lay publications and audiovisual material on aging; publishes Aging magazine; develops special information campaigns; responds to letters and telephone inquiries; and performs other related functions in the area of public information. AoA's field liaison staff assists regional offices in keeping informed of con- tinuing developments relative to the objectives and programs of the Adminis- tration on Aging; identifies difficulties being encountered by regional offices in carrying out their duties and responsibilities; ascertains the degree of further assistance required from AoA headquarters to insure that regional offices achieve national and operational planning objectives; and provides other related assist- ance to regional office staff. Regional offices on aging are located in the 10 HEW regional offices. Each is headed by a Director, whose function is to represent and act for the Commissioner in serving as a regional office focal point on programs and problems concerning older persons and in providing leadership and advovacy to carry out the responsi- bilities of the Administration on Aging as set forth in the Older Americans Act. In performing its functions, the regional office of aging works directly with the State agency on aging, and through the State agency, with the Governor's im- mediate staff in each State in the region in developing the State's programs on aging. BUILDING COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEMS THROUGH THE NETWORK OF STATE AND AREA AGENCIES ON AGING A National Network on Aging has been put in place during fiscal years 1974, 1975, and 1976 to respond to the Older Americans Act Comprehensive Services Amendments of 1973. In addition to the preexisting 56 State agencies on aging,' there were, at the end of fiscal year 1977, 556 area agencies on aging located in 612 planning and service areas 2 which cover 92 percent of the Nation's older persons. In addition, 1,047 nutrition project agencies were operating 9,166 sites serving meals 5 days a week and providing support services. For the past 2 fiscal years the Administration on Aging's operational plans have focussed on providing policy and process tools. The purpose has been to build the capacity of the National Network on Aging to foster the development of a comprehensive, coordinated system of quality services for older persons in each planning and service area in the Nation; and to have each State and area agency on aging function as a focal point on aging for its jurisdiction. A Includes the 50 States plus American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia. I An additional 14 new area agencies are proposed by the end of fiscal year 1978. 55 The network agencies have established connecting links with many of the wide range of other agencies and organizations whose efforts and resources are, or should be, directed to helping meet the needs of older persons. The linkages are beginning to pay off in the expansion of services to older persons and the coordina- tion of these services so that they are more accessible and effective. During 1977 AoA determined that it was then appropriate to shift concern from building the network to achievement of expansions and improvements in service delivery systems through this network. TITLE III: COORDINATED, COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE SYSTEM FOR THE ELDERLY STATE AGENCIES Under title IIT, $17 million in Federal funds were available in fiscal year 1977 for State agency administrative activities through formula grants to each State with an approved annual State plan on aging. Title III grants pay up to 75 percent of the cost of staffing and operating the State agency on aging to: -Identify the needs and problems of older people,-Establish priorities for State and area planning,-Mobilize resources to carry out program plans,-Negotiate interagency cooperative agreements to expand and coordinate services, -Provide leadership and technical assistance to area agencies on aging,-Fund, monitor, and provide training and technical assistance to area agencies and other directly funded grantees. AREA AGENCIES ON AGING States awarded $122 million in title III grants to pay part of the cost of the operations of area agencies on aging and for the funding of social services by such agencies or by the State agency where no area agency exists. Area agencies on aging are responsible for developing an annual plan which seeks to foster a com- prehensive and coordinated system of services for older persons, with special emphasis on the needs of the low-income, minorities and impaired elder y. Area agencies on aging are public or private nonprofit agencies, designated by the State agencies on aging to: -Serve as the focal point and advocate on aging for a State-designated planning and service area, identifying the needs and problems of older people in the area, establishing goals and priorities, mobilizing resources from other public and private agencies to meet needs, and negotiating interagency cooperative agreements to expand and coordinate services. -Provide leadership, technical assistance, and the funding of priority services to foster the development of a comprehensive and coordinated service system. involving all available public and private agencies and funds, to meet the needs of older persons in the area. -Monitor performance of grantees and contractors. Area planning and social services funds are available at different matching ratios for three types of use: -Maximum of 15 percent available for the administration of the area agencies, at a Federal matching rate of up to 75 percent. -Up to 75 percent Federal matching share for services which are not provided as part of an area plan approved by the State agency. A maximum of 20 percent of the State allotment is available for nonarea plan services. -The remainder is available for the purchase of services needed by older persons at a Federal matching rate of up to 90 percent for services which are part of an area agency annual plan. Pooling resources to increase services: At the end of fiscal year 1977, State and area agencies had increased the amount of total dollars pooled from other public and private sources: I Fiscal year 1975 ------------------------------------------ $122, 541, 000 Fiscal year 1976 ------- ----------------------------------- 215, 190, 000 Fiscal year 1977 ------------------------------------------- 440, 403, 806 This increase of $225,213,806 results in additional resources to expand the level of services provided to increasing numbers of older persons.

Under this program $225 millionI in Federal funds were available for formula grants to State agencies on aging to establish and maintain community based nutrition program projects. These I Duplicated count, total served with all fund s-represents an increase of 5,140,007 from fiscal year 1076h.2 Low income definition to based on Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census- poverty threshold 1976 estimates and established by each State. o Number served under title III funds. Some older persons received more than one person unit of service each.4Actual appropriation was $203,525,000 ; $21,475,000 from p~rior year had not yet been committed to projects by the States. Therefore, a total of $225,000,000 was avisilable.Beginning in fiscal year 1977, States were required to commit all funds during the yearfor which they are appropriated. projects manage nutrition sites which provide low-cost, hot, nutritious meals,primarily in congregate settings, and provide support services as needed to persons 60 years of age and over and their spouses. Many projects also furnish home- delivered meals to the homebound. Each project must provide at least one hot meal per day, five or more days per week, all year long. The projects provide those supportive services needed to facilitate participation in the program. Such services include outreach, transporta- tion, and escort services. In addition, projects are encouraged to offer other sup- portive services such as health and welfare, education and counseling, information and referral services, shopping assistance, and recreational services. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also provides commodity and product support to the nutrition program, for which section 707 of the Older Americans Act provided a minimum level of 25 cents per meal for fiscal year 1977. The actual contribution was 27% cents per meal. The purpose of the nutrition program is to encourage and assist communities in significantly supplementing the nutritional and social needs of older persons who do not eat adequately for one or more of the following reasons: -They cannot afford an adequate diet, -They lack the skills to select and prepare well-balanced meals, -Their capacity to cook and shop independently is impaired, -They suffer from the depressive effects of isolation and lack incentive to prepare and eat a meal alone. During fiscal year 1977, the number of nutrition projects increased from 845 to 1,047. The number of meal sites increased from 6,672 to 9,166.

Nutrition services and related support services are vital components of such systems. TITLE V: MULTIPURPOSE SENIOR CENTERS A multipurpose senior center ideally means a community facility for the organization and provision of a broad range of health, social, educational, and other services for older persons. Title V sections 501-505 authorize the Commis- sioner to make grants or contracts to units of general purpose local government or other public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations for the purpose of acquiring, altering, or renovating existing facilities to serve as multipurpose senior centers. In order to assure that title V supported multipurpose senior center facilities are integrated'with the comprehensive and coordinated service systems being developed under title III of the Older Americans Act, priority is being given to applications from State agencies on aging in awarding of funds. The program was funded for the first time during the 1976 transition quarter. A total of 549 grant awards were made from the $5 million appropriated to initiate the program. A total of 49 statewide grants and 22 individual grants were awarded in fiscal year 1977 from an appropriation of $20 million. These grants were awarded at the close of the fiscal year. States are in the process of awarding subgrants or contracts within each State. THE NURSING HOME OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM The purpose of the nursing home ombudsman program is to enable State agencies to develop a process at the local or area level which is responsive to 58 complaints made by or on behalf of the elderly in nursing homes and to work in a variety of ways to improve the quality of care and quality of life of nursing home patients. In October 1977, nursing home ombudsman grants totaling $1,000,126 were awarded to State agencies on aging in 46 States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. The only two States not participating in the ombudsman program are Oklahoma and Wyoming, neither of which applied for funding. During the second year of funding (1976-77), many significant accomplishments were made by the State programs. State legislation mandating nursing home ombudsman services was passed and became effective in Connecticut, South Carolina, New Jersey, and Nevada. The Connecticut law establishes the ombuds- man office in the State office on aging and provides for five regional offices through- out the State. In addition to working for the passage of ombudsman legislation, ombudsman developmental specialists have been involved in shaping legislation and new regulations covering a variety of long-term care issues. These include provisions which would strengthen existing nursing home standards, bring boarding homes under State regulation, guarantee patients' rights, assure an adequate number of beds for medicaid patients, provide protective services for older people along with the establishment of criminal penalties for adult abuse, protect patients' personal funds, mandate unannounced inspections of care facilities, and provide more services to enable older persons to delay or prevent institutionalization. LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM In fiscal year 1977, the legal services program provided $1,125,000 in model project funds on a formula grant basis to support the establishment of a legal services development project in each State agency on aging. The program provides support for a legal services development specialist in each State. The objectives of the program include: (1) Working with area agencies on aging in order to help them design legal services programs for older persons; (2) Assisting, working through area agencies on aging, legal services corporation offices, and/or legal aid programs to expand services and outreach efforts to eligible elderly clients; (3) Assisting area agencies on aging in involving the private bar in increasing legal representation to older people; (4) Stimulating law schools and other educational institutions t6 provide research, law related training, and/or direct client services to the elderly; (5) Designing and coordinating through State and area agencies on aging legal and aging training programs for State and area agency staff and grantees, para- legals, lawyers, and older persons. The legal services development specialists are also working closely with the State bar associations to encourage the inclusion of the legal problems of the elderly in State conferences. On the national level, legal research and services for the elderly, an AoA grantee, is working with the American Bar Association in the development of an elderly law section of the bar. The Administration on Aging sponsored a 3-day conference in the summer of 1977 for legal services develop- ment specialists from States throughout the country. These development special- ists were thoroughly exposed to workshops and materials relating to the legal concerns and problems of the elderly. SUPPORTING ACHIEVEMENT OF THE NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND AoA GOALS TITLE IV, PART A: MANPOWER AND TRAINING This part of the Older Americans Act authorizes the Commissioner to award rants to public or nonprofit agencies, organizations, or institutions, including tate agencies on aging, and to enter into contracts for training projects. The purpose of this program is to increase the number of adequately trained personnel in the field of aging so as to improve the quality of services to older people. Career Training The Administration on Aging supports training programs at institutions of higher education that will provide students with the necessary gerontology knowledge and skills to enable them to serve the Nation's elderly in their chosen career or profession. 50 Through the career development program, students are prepared for employ- ment at baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate levels in such areas as: (1) State and Federal program planning and administration; (2) Community development and coordination; (3) Administration of retirement homes and homes for the aged; (4) Senior center direction; (5) Teaching and research; and (6) Serving older people through adult education, architectural design, counsel- ing, law, library service, recreation and other relevant fields. During the 1976-77 academic year $6.3 million supported 77 grant awards at 68 colleges and universities in 36 States. Approximately 15,000 students were en- rolled in courses and programs in aging; 801 students (240 minority) received financial assistance as part of fiscal year 1976 career training awards through universities. In addition over 400 students were supported in the summer institute program sponsored by the University of Southern California. University Multidisciplinary Development At the close of fiscal year 1977, $6.5 million was awarded on a national com- petitive basis to educational institutions to support activities relative to carrier training in aging. This included: Fifty-eight awards ($6 million) were made for \"development support for carrer training in aging\" with the program emphasis on multidisciplinary efforts of the grantee institutions; and 20 awards ($500,000) for \"planning grants for institutions of higher education\" to assist in the organi- zation and development of institutionwide faculty capability in the gerontology field. In-Service Training The Administration on Aging continued its grant awards to each State agency on aging for the support of training to meet priority in-service needs identified in each State. Although the awards were made during fiscal year 1976, they were used during fiscal year 1977. A total of $6 million supported in-service training in such areas as gerontology, information and referral, nutrition, program management and analysis, planning, and outreach. More than 130,000 persons now in the field of aging were trained as a result of these programs. At the close of fiscal year 1977. $6 million was awarded in new grants to State agencies on aging to support in-service training activities during fiscal year 1978. Manpower Development The Administration on Aging, together with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor, has continued to develop information on manpower needs in the field of aging. Activities conducted included: -The development and distribution of vocational guidance information on professional careers in the field of aging for young people enrolled in high schools, vocational and technical schools, colleges and universities; -Assessment of social work manpower in the field of aging; -Assessment of agency on aging manpower needs; -Study of the aging content of ongoing surveys; -Update on manpower needs in the nursing home industry; -Assessment of agency on aging manpower needs; -Study of the aging content of ongoing surveys; -Update on manpower needs in the nursing home industry. Documents referring to these studies will be made available through the National Clearinghouse on Aging during the early part of fiscal year 1978. Other Manpower and Training Activities Other significant accomplishments in the area of training and manpower are: (1) Continued support of clearinghouse on available in-service and other training materials (Duke University, Durham, N.C.). (2) Design of model program for training senior center personnel (National Council on Aging, Washington, D.C.). (3) Curriculum and materials developmet of videotape cassettes and instruc- tional materials which could be used in training State, area and other Network personnel (University of Maryland, College Park, Md.). 24-084 0 -78 -5 (4) Project to train trainers to develop self-help groups for older persons inareas of health care, safety, and consumer affairs (City University of New York,N.Y.). (5) Manpower development projects in specific areas:-Training for lay advocates, law students, and lawyers in law and aging,-Curriculum development and training in health related fields,-Sensitizing professionals to needs and concerns of minority older persons. TITLE IV, PART B: RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATIONS The research and demonstrations program ($8,500,000) supports projects whichexpand knowledge in a wide variety of subject areas that are critical to thenetwork's development and improvement of programs to promote a comprehensivesystem of services and benefits for older persons. Research program initiativesare designed to increase the Federal sector capacity to realize the national objec-tives stated in title I of the Older Americans Act, as amended. (See introduction.) Research to Improve Service Delivery Systems Sixty-two title IV-B awards ($5,703,951) support new and continuing projectsin response to growing service needs of increasing numbers of older persons. Infiscal year 1977 a major effort was undertaken to develop a research strategyinvolving the information needs of Federal, State, and sub-State administrators,planners, and local service providers in dealing with barriers to development ofcomprehensive service delivery systems. Research projects were solicited inresponse to the following five strategy areas: -The needs of older persons which may cause them to require services,-Alternative ways of meeting the needs of older persons other than publicprovision of services,-Social, political, and economic conditions which influence how the needs ofolder persons are met,-How services are now being provided for older persons,-The role of State and Area Agencies on Aging in providing services toolder persons. Policy Research in Support of Achievement of Title I Objectives During fiscal year 1977, seven new and continuing awards were made tosupport projects on research which contribute to the Federal capacity to realizethe national objectives of the Older Americans Act ($942,067). Five projectswere awarded to identify issues in the policy areas of income, housing, employ-ment, community services and health. This first phase in developing a policyresearch agenda related to achieving national objectives was completed inspring 1977. The second phase has now been initiated to develop a policy research agendabased on the findings of the initial issue studies. This phase will continue through fiscal year 1978 and is expected to form the basis for a large segment of the fiscalyear 1978 and fiscal year 1979 IV-B research program. Dissertation Research Twenty awards of $5,000 each were made during fiscal year 1977 to support dissertation research in the field of aging. New Initiatives The Administration on Aging launched a major initiative in 1977 to increase the Federal resources allocated for research on minority elderly and to encourage the conduct of such research by minority researchers. AOA organized two workshop conferences during the winter of 1977 where minority researchers and Federal officials who fund research on aging came together to discuss ways to increase the amount of such research. As its part in this effort, AOA committed itself to set aside at least 15 percent of new start funds for minority research projects and did meet this goal in fiscal year 1977 IV-B funding. TITLE IV, PART C: MULTIDISCIPLINARY CENTERS OF GERONTOLOGY Funds are made available through project grants to public and private non- profit agencies, organizations, and institutions for the purpose of establishing or 61 supporting multidisciplinary centers of gerontology to fulfill the following func- tions: -Recruit and train personnel at the professional and subprofessional levels; -Conduct basic and applied research on work, leisure, and education of older people, living arrangements of older people, the economics of aging, and other related areas; -Provide consultation to public and voluntary organizations with respect to the needs of older people and in planning and developing services for them; -Serve as repositories of information and knowledge with respect to the areas for which it conducts basic and applied research; -Stimulate the incorporation of information on aging into the teaching of biological, behavioral, and social sciences in colleges or universities; -Help to develop training programs on aging in schools of social work, public health, health care administration, education, and in other such schools at colleges and universities; and -Create opportunities for innovative, multidisciplinary efforts in training, research, and demonstration projects. Under the title IV-C multidisciplinary center of gerontology program, grants are made under two different categories: (1) Developmental grants to support the establishment of multidisciplinary centers, or alternatively to assist recently established institutes on aging in realiz- ing their potential for becoming multidisciplinary centers of gerontology; (2) Operational grants to already well established multidisciplinary centers of gerontology to expand and strengthen activities consistent with the provisions of title TV-C. In fiscal year 1977, the $3,800,000 appropriated for the title IV-C program was used by the Administration to fund second-year continuation costs of those center projects initiated in fiscal year 1976 and the transition quarter, and to make 23 new grants. Of the new awards, there were 8 operational grants to well established centers and 15 developmental grants to establish center programs. With the ex- ception of one operational grant to a free standing geriatric center, all fiscal year 1977 new awards were made to institutions of higher learning. As with the awards made in the previous fiscal year, new grants covered a two year project period. TITLE III: MODEL PROJECTS Model projects are designed to increase the effectiveness of the National Net- work on Aging in improving and expanding services for older persons by testing and initiating new services and innovative approaches. During fiscal year 1977 model projects initiatives were funded at $14,700,000 in 12 priority areas. MODEL PROJECTS Number of Priority areas projects Amount Housing --------------------------------------------------------------- 9 $758, 433 Continuing education ------------------------------------------------------ 2 119, 635 Retirement and preretirement ------------------------------------------------ 9 794, 806 Special services to mentally and physically handicapped ----------------------------- 7 744,912 Ombudsman services ----------------------------------------------------- 49 381,582 Improved services to underserved populations ----------------------------------- 8 722, 884 Senior ambulatory care day centers -------------------------------------------- 2 324, 238 Legal services ---------------------------------------------------------- 61 2, 540, 880 Communications media --------------------- -------------------------------- 2 2, 311, 860 Organization development. .....--------------------------------------------------- 9 1, 800,659 Elderly disaster victims-------------.---.. -.. -. -------------------------------- 5 148,834 Examples of Projects by Priority Area (1) Housing and living arrangements.-The city of New Haven, Conn., is devel- oping and testing ways of involving the elderly in neighborhood preservation and revitalization. A project in Roxbury, Mass., is developing a model in the involvement of older persons in the development and design of a major housing complex. (2) Continuing education.-Washington Center for the Study of Services devel- oped a unique approach to consumer education by providing evaluative infor- mation on service providers of home maintenance, health services, financial serv- ices, etc. 62 (3) Retirement preparation/employment.-AoA and the Environmental Pro-tection Agency are engaging in a joint effort to improve the environment andincrease employment opportunities for older persons. The senior environmentalemployment program is designed to demonstrate ways older Americans may beemployed in jobs which improve and protect the environment and which providealternatives to forced retirement. (4) Special services for the physically and mentally impaired.-New York CityDepartment of Aging, the Community Service Society and Bellevue HospitalGeriatric unit established a friendship center designed to serve the community'smentally impaired or at risk elderly, many of whom are non or limited Englishspeaking. The demonstration provides a basis for planning programs to enablethese older persons to continue functioning within the community.(5) Improved services to underserved populations (low-come, minorities, Indian,limited English speaking and rural elderly).-Several grants have been made toIndian tribes and organizations to developed service delivery systems for elderlyIndians previously underserved. A major effort by the National Indian Council onAging, supported by a model projects grant, is developing policies and initiatives,nationwide, to improve access for elderly Indians to the whole spectrum of Federal,State, and local resources. (6) Disaster assistance for older Americans.-A set-aside of $250,000 in modelprojects funds was authorized for Presidentially declared disasters. Older victimsof disasters have fewer resources to start over again and are often less aggressivein seeking help. Model project funds are encouraging increased involvement of theaging network in generating emergency food and shelter, and in assisting olderpersons to get loans and in restoring older victims' life styles when disasters occur.Two such projects have been jointly funded by the Administration on Aging andthe Federal Disaster Assistance Administration.(7) Senior ambulatory day care centers.-Demonstration projects are defining therole of the adult day care center and determining the place of this emerging level ofcare on the long term care service delivery continuum. The On Lok Senior HealthServices in San Francisco is providing the Nation a unique model of the multi-cultural social/health services day care center for the frail elderly. A demonstrationof two different models of day care programs under single management is beingconducted by the Lockport Senior Citizens Centre, Inc., Lockport, N.Y.In addition, model projects awards supported the following demonstrations ofnational importance: -Six statewide models of comprehensive home services involving multiple Stateagencies are being tested for adoption in other States under the auspices ofthe National Council of Homemaker Home-Health Aide Services, Inc. Thesemodels accommodate the need for both occasional and sustained health,social and other services in the home.-Crime prevention projects were started in six cities funded jointly with theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, Community ServicesAdministration, and the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration.-Organizational development support was provided national organizations inthe field of aging to increase their capacity, e.g., National Association of StateUnits on Aging; National Association of Area Agencies on Aging; NationalCenter on the Black Aged; Associacion Nacional Council on Aging. -Over Easy.-\"Over Easy\" is America's first daily television series for olderpersons. The series is being broadcast in prime time hours Monday throughFriday by most local PBS stations. Goals of the \"Over Easy\" series includefostering positive attitudes about aging in the society as a whole, but especiallyamong those growing older. The producers want to dispel myths and stereo-types about older persons and the aging process. They also intend to bringmillions of older persons into contact with information and services that aredesigned to improve their living conditions. Hugh Downs, formerly of the\"Today Show,\" is the program host. Each half hour program uses a magazinevariety format to report on subjects such as housing, transportation, nutrition,health and medicine, money management, consumerism, legal rights and otherconcerns of older people. TITLE II: NATIONAL CLEARINGHOUSE FOR THE AGING The National Clearinghouse for the Aging is charged with the collection,analysis and dissemination of information about older people and their needs.During fiscal year 1977, the clearinghouse continued to expand its activities 63 in the areas of public information, statistical analysis, public inquiries, publica- tions distribution, and information referral policy. Service Center for Aging Information.-The National Clearinghouse for the Aging major initiative in fiscal year 1977 was the development of the Service Center for Aging Information (SCAN). The purpose of SCAN is to expand access to the knowledge base related to the aging field, and to make that in- formation readily available. SCAN is an automated bibliographic information system designed to facilitate utilization of the growing body of gerontological literature and research findings. The implementation of the SCAN system, which is to be completed in phases, is scheduled for fiscal year 1978 and fiscal year 1979. The National Clearinghouse for the Aging will manage and administer the information system by establishing policies and guidelines that will be car- ried out under contract. This system is modeled after the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) established by the National Institute of Education. The SCAN system will consist of three decentralized resource centers which will be responsible for collecting, indexing and abstracting reports of journal literature within their respective topic areas. Organization of the centers will be along disciplinary lines to cover three major areas: biomedical, behavioral-social science, and social practice. Public Information.-Public information activities concentrated on pro- viding support for the network of public and private agencies working for and with older persons and on increasing public awareness of the circumstances, needs and contributions of the older population. Aging magazine entered its 27th year of publication publishing news of innova- tive developments in the field of gerontology, proposed programs, legislation and reports of studies in the field.Publications The National Clearinghouse for the Aging issued several publications produced by staff or other AoA offices, grantees, and contractors. Some of the most signifi- cant are as follows: -A National Directory of Education Programs in Gerontology: Information on gerontological activities of 1,275 colleges and universities in the United States. -Evaluative Research on Social Programs for the Elderly: Report of a seminar on evaluative research sponsored by the Committee on Research and Develop- ment Gerontological Society. -Facts About Older Americans, 1977: A statistical profile of older Americans and their geographic distribution. -The second of a series of AoA occasional papers in gerontology covering Manpower Needs in the Field of Aging: Homemaker-Home Health Aides Services. -Older Americans Act of 1965, as Amended: A new compilation incorporating the 1975 amendments. -Ombudsman for Nursing Homes-Structure and Process, Second Edition: A manual for the practitioner. -National Clearinghouse on Aging Thesaurus-Second Edition: A basic struc- ture and guide to the acquisition, indexing, and retrieval of material related to the field of aging. -Congregate Housing for Older People-An Urgent Need, A Growing Demand: Selected papers from the first national conference on congregate housing for older people conducted by the International Center for Social Gerontology. -Comprehensive Inventory and Analysis of Federally Supported Research on Aging, 1966-75 (microfiche edition). -Fact Sheets describing Federal resources in areas of transportation, nutrition, employment and voluntary services. Statistical Publications Statistical Reports on Older Americans-Report No. 3: Social Economic and Health Data for the American Indian Population. American Indian Population 55 years of Age and Older: Geographic Dis- tribution, 1970. Facts About Older Americans: 1977. Income and Poverty Among the Elderly, 1974.

Estimates of the U.S. population 60 and 65+ by State, counties, and planningand service areas. Increasing Public Awareness Continued distribution of \"Don't Stop the Music,\" an AoA supported filmwhich discusses problems of aging and ways in which communities can help.The film was seen by approximately 67,169 people in fiscal year 1977.Development and distribution to State and area agencies on aging of an In-formation Kit to promote \"Over Easy,\" a new public television program fundedin part by AoA. Statistical Analysis: During fiscal year 1977 a number of publications werecompleted and statistical information for professionals in the field of aging wasprepared. The statistical analysis staff also responded to 400 written requestsand a similar number of phone requests for demographic, socioeconomic and healthand other statistical information about the older population.Information and Referral Policy: During fiscal year 1977 the Administration onAging reaffirmed its commitment to \"information and referral services\" as a toppriority for the National Network on Aging.Two I & R documents were published: \"Information and Referral; ToDo Research Findings.\" These twodocuments are reports of AoA supported research and demonstration projectsdesigned to increase the knowledge base regarding information and referral servicedelivery. Technical Assistance Capacity strengthening initiatives during the past year addressed a wide rangeof areas. The Administration on Aging developed and issued in June a technicalassistance handbook for use by the network. This handbook is to be used toimprove equal employment practices, to increase the capabilities of State and localagencies in awarding grants and contracts to minority agencies or organizations,and to increase services to low income and minority persons.The Administration on Aging also contracted for the development of seventechnical assistance handbooks designed to guide State and area agencies in de-veloping and strengthening the following priority services for older persons:-Information and referral. -Legal services for the elderly.-Nursing home ombudsman. -Homemaker and home health. -Multipurpose senior centers.-Employment. -Residential repair and renovation.These handbooks, which will be available to State and area agencies in earlycalendar 1978, include information on the importance of the service to older per-sons, service definitions, alternative service models, and the role of State and areaagencies in service development. Handbooks for transportation and nutritionservices have already been disseminated to the aging network.During fiscal year 1977 a number of technical assistance memoranda were alsodisseminated to the network, covering such subjects as:-Establishing and financing adult day care services.-Senior center organization and management.-Insurance coverage issues affecting volunteers and older employees who pro-vide transportation for older persons. -Providing services to older persons with no fixed addresses.-Program information for nutrition project management. Evaluation During fiscal year 1977, AoA continued work on two major evaluation studies of the title III area planning and social services program and the title VII nutri-tion program for the elderly. Preliminary findings from both studies are outlinedbelow. During fiscal year 1977 evaluation projects were also completed on informationand referral and the first year of the implementation of title XX. A descriptionof their major findings is included. Finally, two new evaluations were begun.These are an evaluation of title IV-A career training and the use and effectiveness of interagency agreements at the Federal, State, and local levels. 65 Preliminary findings of the Longitudinal Evaluation of the Nutrition Program Highlights of the recent findings of the longitudinal evaluation of the nutrition program include the following: -Proportionally, the nutrition program is drawing significantly more low income and minority elderly than is found in the general elderly population and nonparticipant comparison group. -Twenty-seven percent of elderly participants in the program are minority compared with 8 percent in the general elderly populations (based on Census data), and 7 percent in the nonparticipant comparison group. -Sixty-eight percent of participants report an income below $4,000 a year compared with 22 percent for the general elderly population and 47 percent for the nonparticipant comparison group. -More than 50 percent of all program participants live alone while only about one-fourth of all elderly in the United States live alone. Preliminary Findings From Phase I of the Evaluation Study of Area Agencies on Aging At least two-thirds of the respondents assessed the area agency as being either highly effective or moderately effective in bringing about improved services for the elderly in the area. Two-thirds of the influential individuals in the community when asked to rate their area agency's impact on the local service delivery system, said that it had had \"a considerable impact.\" One-third of the service providers concurred with this assessment. The service providers receiving title III funds in the sample were also asked to evaluate the training and technical assistance received from area agencies: 61 percent of those who had received training from area agencies assessed it as 'very useful.\" There has been an overall improvement in the characteristics of services delivery to the elderly during the period studied. This improvement is found in all three of the goal areas: comprehensiveness, coordination, and concern for the elderly. Over 90 percent of the service providers improved on at least one of 17 charac- teristics of service delivery. They averaged improvement in 7 out of 17 areas studied while only 32 percent of service providers showed a decrease and they averaged a decrease in only 1 out of 17 areas studied. The study found that area agencies contributed to about one-fifth of all of the improvements in the 17 possible areas of change in services for older persons. In the 2-year evaluation period, about two-thirds of all service providers reported an increase in their volume of services for the elderly and that they had increased their expenditures for the elderly. The number of types of service available to the elderly rose by 23 percent. Twenty-six percent of the services offered in 1974 by service providers currently serving the elderly have been modified to include the elderly or increase the number of elderly served. Taking into account that the area agencies did not attempt to influence the services of all their service providers, our analysis showed that the area agencies were credited with contributing to an average of 31 percent of the improvements made by those service providers they attempted to influence. The study found that on the average, area agencies succeeded in about 60 percent of their attempts to improve services to older persons. Summary of Evaluation of I&R Services for Older Persons Overall, the I & R's designated by State and area agencies on aging visited were meeting AoA minimum requirements for I & R and were also meeting a number of the long-range goals. In general, I & R's were making an effort to provide the best quality I & R services they could within the limits of their resources. There were some exceptions, but generally the findings were positive. Highlights of the findings are: Services provided: -Most I & R's connected older persons with service providers who could meet their needs. -Most I & R's were already providing followup, escort, and transportation services. -The majority of I & R's were meeting publicity requirements and providing outreach services. Quality of services: -Resource files were generally comprehensive in their listing of availableresources for older persons. -A high level of planning and coordination activity was reported by a majorityof I & R's. -The majority of I & R's were meeting the confidentiality requirement tokeep personal information on users in locked files.Cost and quantity of services: -The average cost per inquiry was $4.60, with a range of less than $1 to morethan $20. -On the average, one inquiry was received by the I & R annually for everynine older persons in the area served. First- Year Evaluation of the Implementation of Title XX Administration for Public Services Regional Offices and Title XX State agencystaff perceptions of the role of State and Area Agencies on Aging in the first yearof Title XX were as follows: -Specifically, the majority of State Agencies on Aging have been more activeor influential in the making of social services decisions than they were prior toTitle XX. -Overall, the Area Agencies were seen as having been less active or influentialthan State Agencies. However, Area Agencies in 18 States were seen as moreactive during the first year of Title XX than they had been before. Amongthe most frequent actions in this regard were: (1) Development of cooperative agreements,(2) Participation in title XX advisory councils, (3) Exchange of plans and needs assessment material, (4) Review and comment on comprehensive annual service plans: (a) Attendance at public hearings,(b) Negotiating of purchase of service agreements. -Generally, where State and area agencies were perceived as being active inthe title XX process, the aging were seen as benefiting from title XX. Some example of results of State and area agency on aging involvement: (1) Raising eligibility levels for aging persons and/or services to the aging, (2) Adjustment in States' fee policies,(3) Elimination of barriers to aging services, (4) Expansion of services to the aging. Findings in relation to the amount of title XX services going to older persons:-In most States, the percent of title XX services to aged SSI recipients is below the percent of aged in the population. In some States, it is half or lower. However, 7.2 percent of all title XX social services go to aged SSI recipients. -Of the 14 top ranked services in terms of expenditures under title XX, only five show major expenditures going to older persons as SSI recipients. These are homemaker, chore, health related, home management, and transportation services. -I & R and protective services show a low percent of expenditures to SSI aged recipients. However, both are available to the general population without regard to income. -Day care and foster care also show a low percent of expenditure to SSI aged recipients. -In only 8 States, the percent of title XX services to SSI aged recipients is equal to or slightly higher than the percentage of aged in the State's population. Even where States are \"at ceiling,\" there is substantial opportunity for State and area agencies to increase the amount of title XX services going to older persons by such activities as: -Getting involved in the State budget process, since governors and legislatures have the power to reallocate social services funds. -Encouraging substate planning. -Lending staff to the title XX agency to participate in title XX advisory committees, planning groups, and to conduct needs assessments. Evaluation of the Title IV-A Career Training Program in Aging In fiscal year 1977 an evaluation project, to be completed in July 1978, was undertaken to meet the following objectives: (1) To determine whether students who have received support under the career training program are, in fact, able to obtain jobs in the field of aging. (2) To determine how universities decide on the level, type, and recipients of student support and the factors involved in the decisionmaking process. (3) To determine characteristics of students enrolled in AoA supported pro- grams and whether the characteristics of students receiving AoA support differ from those not receiving AoA support. (4) To determine the extent of faculty and institutional involvement in the field of aging at those universities receiving AoA support and, to the degree pos- sible, the relationship of this involvement to the existence of AoA support. (5) To determine the relationship between the AoA supported training pro- grams and the National Aging Network at all levels. Evaluation of the Use and Effectiveness of Interagency Agreements at the State Level An evaluation contract was awarded to evaluate the use of interagency agree- ments at the State level as tools to increase coordination among State agenciey and to measure the outcomes of specific interagency agreements. The evaluation is being expanded to include an analysis of Federal and area agreements. Area agencies will be involved. The formal interagency agreements within all the States will be analyzed, looking at such factors as parties involved, objectives, and steps to be taken to accomplish these objectives. This analysis will be presented in an independent report. ADVOCACY AND COORDINATION FEDERAL COUNCIL ON THE AGING History The Federal Council on the Aging was created by Congress under the 1973 amendments to the Older Americans Act for the purpose of advising the President, the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Commis- sioner on Aging, and the Congress on matters relating to the special needs of older Americans. The Secretariat for the Federal Council on the Aging is housed in the Administration on Aging for administrative purposes. The Council is composed of 15 citizen members appointed by the President for 3-year terms and is chaired by a member designated by the President. The present Chairman of the Council, has also been designated by President Carter as his Counsellor on Aging. The Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Commissioner on Aging are ex-officio members. Ten members of the Council are themselves older persons. They and the other members are drawn from older Americans, national organizations with an interest in aging, business, labor, and the general public, as called for in the law. Advocacy In fulfillment of its mission of advocacy for the elderly, the Council has made a number of recommendations to the executive and legislative branches of Govern- ment. Aside from specific projects on health manpower, minority elderly, assets, and the frail elderly, the Council is concerned with and monitors major legislative and administrative initiatives in such areas as social security financing, welfare reform, mandatory retirement, national health care, long-term care, Older Ameri- cans Act, and title XX. A recent Council study on \"The Interrelationships of Benefit Programs\" examined the negative effect that one or more programs may have on an older person's eligibility for benefits from other programs. As a result of the findings of this study, the FCA commissioned a study on the treatment of assets and asset income in determining eligibility for income-conditioned benefit programs. This study is being conducted by the Institute for Research on Poverty at the Uni- 68 versity of Wisconsin. Technical papers were published in late 1977, presenting a range of policy options to the Council as the basis for recommendations to the President and the Congress on a national policy for treatment of assets. The FCA continued to develop recommendations for services to the frail elderly. These oldest of older Americans are seen as a subgroup within the aging population who should have an entitlement to case assessment and case management for them to cope with daily living. This social support would be complementary to income maintenance, shelter, and health benefits. To assure that the special needs of the elderly are fully considered as the Nation debates the role of the Federal Government in providing better health care for its people, the Council has adopted \"Principles for National Health Care and the Elderly.\" The FCA advocates inclusion of the elderly in any Federal initiative to improve health care and urges the development of a national health policy empha- sizing the maintenance of health, treatment of illness, and care of the sick, rather than merely focusing on a method of financing. The Older Americans Act mandates the Council to inform the public about the problems and needs of the aging. The Council carries this out through broad dis- tribution of its reports and publications. In early 1977 a periodic status report was initiated to provide the field of aging with a summary of major actions of the Council taken in connection with its quarterly meetings. INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS In its role as the Federal focal point for action to benefit older Americans AoA works to mobilize and coordinate existing Federal resources to meet the service needs of older persons. In this capacity AoA has negotiated and signed 23 working agreements with Federal Agencies. During fiscal year 1977, AoA negotiated six new intra- and inter-departmental agreements, concerned with health services, nutrition services, crime prevention, legal services, disaster assistance, and edu- cational opportunities. Other agreements previously negotiated include informa- tion and referral services, title XX services, medicaid, housing, rehabilitation services, transportation, energy, and public health services. There are 320 State level interagency agreements currently in effect. These agreements serve to focus the attention of the Federal agencies involved on the service needs and concerns of the elderly. The agreements call for specific actions which commit the Federal agency to using its leadership and technical assistance capacity to focus the attention on meeting the needs of older persons. Interagency agreements contribute to and support the goals of the National Net- work on Aging in its effort to establish comprehensive coordinated service systems on the community level to realize the objectives of the Older Americans Act. OTHER FEDERAL COORDINATION ACTIVITIES Besides the negotiation and implementation of interagency agreements, the Administration on Aging was engaged in other Federal coordination activities dur- ing fiscal year 1977. Federal regional councils.-The Federal Regional Councils (FRC's) have es- tablished committees on aging which include representation from departments and agencies with programs that impact on the elderly. These committees serve to identify and ameliorate program coordination problems and to assist State and local officials to improve programs which affect older persons. Some of the com- mittees also include voluntary organizations such as the American Red Cross, the American Association of Retired Persons, and others. Examples of FRC activities include the following: -Providing technical assistance to area agencies on aging in developing effec- tive program coordination and in developing interdepartmental agreements; -Conducting joint meetings with Federal program personnel and State govern- ment counterparts; -Publishing regional newsletters with information about programs for the elderly; -Developing and distributing directories of Federal services for the elderly; -Working with Indian tribes on problems of program coordination involving Federal and State resources. Federal executive boards.-The Federal executive boards are organized in 26 major metropolitan areas. Membership consists of the highest ranking Federal officials in each city. Under AoA assistance the FEB's have been involved in 69 helping area agencies on aging establish adequate information and referral sources for the elderly. In addition, program efforts have been direct red toward making the Federal agencies themselves more responsive to calls from the elderly. Some FEB's are giving Federal employees orientation in the characteristics of the elderly in order to promote better communication. Programs address fuel and energy, crime prevention, and other problems of older persons. Directories of local services for the elderly have been updated and distibuted. Efforts have been made to unify and publicize information and referral numbers. The FEB's also focused on problems on residents in nursing homes. Federal Inter-Agency Task Force for Research on Aging As in past years, AoA exercised its lendership role in the Federal Inter-Agency Task Force for Research on Aging. The task force serves as a coordinating body for Federal agencies which fund research related to the aging. In a previous project under the sponsorship of the task force, AoA funded the development of a nine-volume inventory of federally sponsored research on aging, 1965-75. During fiscal year 1977, AoA funded a contract for dissemination of the inventory to the State and area agencies and major research centers. The Interdepartmental Task Force on Information and Referral The Interdepartmental Task Force on Information and Referral has con- tinued to meet and is currently concentrating on two major objectives of the I & R agreement: (1) To extend and coordinate efforts of participating depart- ments and agencies in information and referral; and (2) to encourage their counter- parts in States and communities to cooperate in making information and referral services immediately available to older people. In fiscal year 1977, the Inter- departmental I & R Task Force developed and published a brochure entilted \"I & R Guide\" which identifies and describes the five building blocks which are essential to the delivery of effective information and referral services. Another publication, soon to be printed, is the first annual report of I & R activities of the agencies which comprise the interdepartmental task force. The Interdepartmental Task Force on Statistics: Working Group on Aging The Interdepartmental Task Force on Statistics sponsored by AoA has pre- pared a draft copy of the \"Inventory of Statistical Programs on the Elderly.\" This document will contain descriptions of all Federal statistical programs in which age is collected as a data item, the purpose of the survey, limitations of the data, the level of geography at which the data are collected and tabulated, the publications in which the results of the tabulation can be found, and so forth. The final document can then serve as a data resource to coordinate and improve the collection of data on the elderly and to develop and produce special tabu- lations. SPECIAL PROJECTS AoA Role in Disaster Planning Continuing to build on previous experiences in the area of disaster planning and followup, the Administration on Aging was able to make additional progress toward enhancing the capacity of the National Network on Aging to respond to needs of elderly disaster victims. The booklet \"Planning for the Elderly in Natural Disaster,\" produced under a grant from the Administration on Aging as an outgrowth of the first National Conference on Disasters and the Elderly held in Omaha, Nebr., in 1976, was distributed to the National Network on Aging along with a technical assistance memorandum in March 1977. The memorandum was a sequel to the planning document and the Administration on Aging's memorandum of understanding issued the previous September. In addition to spelling out the responsibilities of the various components of the National Network on Aging, the memorandum included a sample regional office/State agency on aging agreement on disasters, a sample State agency on aging instruction to all of the State and sub-State agencies involved in disasters, and a sample section of an area agency on aging plan covering disaster activities. Based on this material several regions have held training sessions for State agency on aging staffs, and a number of States have held training sessions for aging personnel in their States. The Federal Disaster Assistance Administration has assisted in the training. 70 The Administration on Aging has continued to work with State and area agencies in individual disasters. AoA field liaison staff and regional office staffs provided substantial assistance to a number of States during the severe winter. For example, in the Presidentially declared disaster in the Buffalo, N.Y., area, AoA gave extensive help, including a $119,655 model project grant designed to develop information on severe weather assistance to older persons and establish a county-by-county statewide disaster assistance program for the elderly as a model for the network on aging. As a followup to this winter effort, older persons were encouraged to respond to the invitation of the Energy Policy and Planning Office to comment on hardships and economic problems caused by the severe weather. A subsequent report on the public's response noted the substantial num- ber of comments received from older persons. The Administration on Aging provided considerable disaster assistance through- out the year. The following examples are only a few of the many network efforts. The Administration on Aging was likewise involved with staffs in regions III and IV in the April flooding in Appalachia. In region VII, staff worked with the State agency and affected area agencies to meet the needs of elderly victims when a series of tornadoes hit Missouri. The State of Hawaii's County of Hawaii Office of Aging evacuated older persons from the town of Kalapana, when they were endangered by the lava flow from a potentially destructive volcanic eruption on the island of Hawaii. The threat lasted for 6 days and the elderly and their possessions were removed from the area and assisted by the aging program. When older persons in large numbers suffered losses as the result of the July 20 flood in Johnstown, Pa., the Federal coordinating officer for the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration called on the aging network at all levels to work closely with his office. The House Select Committee on Aging held the first hearing on the issue of \"Weather Disasters and the Elderly\" on June 29, 1977, concentrating their interest on the 1975 Omaha tornado, the 1976-77 Buffalo blizzard, and the 1977 spring Appalachian States floods and the cooperative efforts of the Administration on Aging and the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration. The Commissioner was one of the principal witnesses. Physical Fitness for the Elderly As the result of successful demonstration programs in physical fitness for older persons conducted in 1976, the National Association for Human Development was funded by the Administration on Aging for a nationwide program. In most instances headquarters and regional office staff worked with the National Associ- ation for Human Development and the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports to bring together the network on aging and the practitioners in health, physical education, and recreation to develop cooperative programs at the com- munity level. Nearly all State agencies on aging, including Hawaii, were involved in the training programs aimed at involving older persons in physical fitness pro- grams in title VII nutrition projects, senior centers, public housing, homes for the elderly, and other congregate settings. Direct Deposit Program The Department of the Treasury requested technical assistance from the Administration on Aging in intensifying its efforts to encourage recipients of Federal checks to have them deposited directly in their personal bank accounts, because of the large number of older persons receiving checks from social security as beneficiaries and through the supplemental security income program, railroad retirement, Civil Service Commission annuities, and Veterans Administration AoA headquarters and regional office staffs worked with Treasury staff on the development of training materials, on the testing of the training, and then on train- ing all regional office staffs, who in turn trained State agency on aging staffs. The State staffs then trained area agency and title VII project staffs in the direct deposit program so they could present the information to older persons. AoA also worked with Treasury in the involvement of other departments and agencies with access to groups of older persons in the regional training programs. It is expected that the direct deposit program will provide some degree of protection to older persons who are preyed upon at the time when Federal checks are delivered by mail. 71 Experience Exchange At the Commissioner's request the field liaison staff investigated the possibilities of developing a program for exchanging experiences and expertise within the National Network on Aging. The area agencies on aging ahd requested in-depth information on innovative programs which had been developed to the point where they might be replicated without trial and error. The program developed as the result of the study consisting of monthly informational sheets called \"Experience Exchange.\" Each issue was devoted to a single subject, reported on one or more innovative experiences, and provided information on available literature and the availability of a person or persons with expertise. Subjects covered were: health fairs, employment, aging and blindness, mental health care and aging, fire safety for the elderly, cardiopulmonary resuscitation/Heimlich maneuver, elderly deaf, and burglar proofing of residences. Response from the network was positive with numerous requests for materials and for sharing of expertise. Based on the response, decision was made by the Commissioner to include the \"Experience Exchange\" in Aging magazine. White House Conference on Handicapped Individuals The White House Conference on Handicapped Individuals took place May 23-27, 1977. The Conference brought together 3,700 people from every State and territory. These delegates were designated to represent the concerns of more than 35 million Americans with mental or physical disabilities. The Conference pro- vided the first opportunity for persons with handicaps to speak up in their own interest and vote for recommendations which present approaches to the problems that directly affect their lives. Prior to the Conference, members of the Administration on Aging staff, who had been members of the staff of the White House Conference on Aging in 1971, provided considerable assistance to the Office of Human Development in pre- liminary plans for the White House Conference on Handicapped Individuals. AoA provided State agencies on aging with background information so they could work with State conference directors in the involvement of older persons in sec- tions relevant to the needs of the handicapped aged. The important findings of the Conference have been documented in the form of recommendations, resolutions and a summary of the proceedings. The mission of the Conference was: -To stimulate a national assessment of problems faced by individuals with mental or physical handicaps, -To generate a national awareness of those problems, -To develop recommendations for legislative and administrative actions which help handicapped individuals live independently, with dignity and integrated into community life. In April 1977, just prior to the White House Conference, final DHEW reg- ulations were signed implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 504 prohibits discrimination against handicapped persons in programs and activities which receive Federal funds. As a result of the White House Con- ference and section 504, the Administration on Aging reaffirmed and strengthened its longstanding commitment to serve disabled older persons. State planning guidance issued in June required action plans for the implementation of section 504 throughout the aging network.

Though the A & TBCB is charged by Congress with responsibility for enforcing the law requiring access for handicapped persons, needs of the aging are included. The advance of age brings with it physical limitations similar to those resulting from disease, accidents, and congenital problems. Thus architectural and trans- portation barriers impede many older people too. Section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Public Law 93-112) established the A & TBCB as a quasi-independent agency whose primary purpose is to ensure compliance with the Achitectural Barriers Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-480). This law applies to buildings and facilities designed, constructed, altered, or leased by the Federal Government since August 12, 1968, and to those financed wholly or in part with Federal grants or loans. In carrying out its regulatory responsibilities, the A & TBCB is empowered through the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974 (Public Law 93-516) to issue a final and binding order of compliance which may include the suspension or withholding of Federal funds with respect to any building of any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States subject to the Architectural Barriers Act. The A & TBCB is also responsible for initiating investigatory approaches into the nature of architectural, transportation and attitudinal barriers confronting handicapped individuals, particularly with respect to public buildings, monuments, parks and parklands, residential, and institutional housing. The A & TBCB is composed of cabinet-level representatives of nine Federal departments and agencies including Health, Education, and Welfare; Trans- portation; Housing and Urban Development; Labor; Interior; Defense; General Services Administration; U.S. Postal Service; and Veterans Administration. The Board originally functioned with technical, administrative, and other assistance provided by the members, departments, and agencies. In 1974, the law was amended to add the Department of Defense to the original eight-member Board and to direct the agency to appoint a separate staff headed by an executive director who was named in 1975. The Board staff includes units for compliance, public information, general counsel, and policy, planning, and program develop- ment. The Board meets bimonthly and the full-time staff carries on its work in con- tinuous contact with the Board members and their designated liaison personnel. Other responsibilities of the Board are to: (1) Determine what measures are being taken to eliminate barriers from public transportation systems, to prevent the incorporation in new or expanded transportation systems and to make housing available and accessible for handicapped individuals; (2) recommend to the President and Congress such legislation and administrative action \"as it deems necessary or desirable to eliminate barriers.\" The Board has a National Advisory Committee, the majority of the members of which are handicapped, to provide guidance, advice, and recommendations. Membership of the Committee includes persons with a variety of disabilities and also several aged persons. The Board's objectives and emphases are summarized in these statements: 1. To provide accessible and usable transportation for handicapped people in transportation systems. 2. To encourage the production in adequate amounts of a variety of residential accommodations in the community for the severely disabled, and to provide housing alternatives with the objective of producing satisfactory noninstitutional living arrangements. 3. To promote generally the utilization of a barrier-free criteria in planning and design of all elements of our man-made environment, and to require these criteria with respect to that which is federally assisted. 4. Through a national awareness campaign, to promote the elimination of attitudinal barriers and greater public understanding of environmental problems faced by disabled people. 126 5. To implement measures which will ensure that all Federal buildings andcommunity facilities such as hospitals, schools, parks, airports, etc., areaccessible to and usable by physically handicapped persons. 6. To provide access for handicapped people to national parks and monu-ments and to encourage States and localities to take similar action with respectto comparable State and local facilities. 7. To promote a barrier-free environment within business and industry,allowing for the employment of the disabled. 8. To promote and develop guidelines for the use of the InternationalAccessibility Symbol on public facilities which comply with the standardsunder Public Law 90-480. 9. To identify any conflicts between Federal, State, and local barriers,legislation and programs and to coordinate future planning. 10. To establish a system of assembling information on barrier removaland to make data available to States and localities. 11. To assure maximum utilization of revised ANSI standards and theirevaluation and revision on a systematic and continuing basis. PROGRAM AcHIEVEMENTS IN 1977 , The A & TBCB published in the Federal Register its enforcement rules to beused to ensure that federally financed buildings are accessible to people withdisabilities. A pamphlet, \"Access America: The Architectural Barriers Act andYou,\" was published and has been widely distributed. It explains the enforcementrules and spells out the complaint process by which anyone may file a complaintwith the A & TBCB about any federally funded buildings that are inaccessible.The A & TBCB issued its first four citations-the initiations of legal actionagainst Federal agencies or departments responsible for buildings that aren'taccessible-based on complaints from consumers. The citations were issued to:(1) The Departments of Interior and Transportation for failure to provideaccess for handicapped persons to lower level train platforms at UnionStation in Washington, D.C., and failure to provide accessibility and usabilityto visually physically handicapped persons. (2) The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Social SecurityAdministration, and the General Services Administration, for failure toprovide adequate access for physically handicapped persons at the SocialSecurity Administration's Southeastern Program Center in Birmingham, Ala.(3) The Department of Transportation for failure to provide on a pedestrianoverpass in Omaha, Nebr., safe and convenient access to physically handi-capped persons including those who are semiambulatory or have disabilitiesrelating to sight, coordination, or aging. (4) The Department of Housing and Urban Development for failure toprovide access to physically handicapped persons to the Susie Venson Resi-dence for Women and the Wesley Lueksing Residence for Men at OralRoberts University in Tulsa, Okla. The two dormitories were constructed in1972 with loans and grants given to the university by HUD.As required by the legislation which established the A & TBCB, a NationalAdvisory Committee on an Accessible Environment was appointed to provideguidance, advice, and recommendations to the A & TBCB. During its first yearthe committee's thrust was sponsorship of public awareness conferences throughoutthe Nation. These conferences are designed to create awareness of environmentalbarriers and to exchange information with the public about enforcement ofFederal laws requiring access to buildings and transportation. A guide to the state-of-the-art knowledge and literature on architecturalbarriers and barrier-free design was published. The guide is intended for profes-sionals working to create barrier-free environments and for the interested public.Some subjects covered include architects, transportation, recreation, standards,legislation, legal matters, statistics, human factors research, attitudes, types ofdisabilities, aides and devices, etc. The guide was distributed nationwide to alluniversities, schools of design, departments of architecture, and vocational re-habilitation centers. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's Officeof Civil Rights also distributed the guide to aid recipients of HEW funds in dealingwith barrier-free design.In cooperation with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, theA & TBCB began constructing a pilot accessibility compliance system to ensurethat accessibility is dealt with in all new construction and that involving renova-tions, contracts, grants, etc. A contract was awarded for the purpose of developing, implementing and distributing materials in support of a national public awareness project. The goals of the project are: (1) Increased realization among both disabled and non-disabled popula- tions that legislation guarantees right of access to and use of buildings with Federal funding involvement (since 1968) to all persons, and provides a formal complaint process to be used by persons denied such access. Further, that information of filing complaints may be obtained from the A & TBCB. (2) Creation within the general public of an awareness of the problems caused by the presence of barriers in the environment, and of the fact that a handicap is more a function of a hostile environment than of a disability. (3) Enlightenment of the public to appreciation of the benefits of barrier- free design to all persons-elderly, temporarily incapacitated, families of disabled, etc. A national hearing on recreation needs of handicapped persons was conducted by the A & TBCB in Boston, Mass. Twenty-two witnesses from around the nation were invited by the A & TBCB to present their views on the recreation needs of handicapped persons and how these needs may be met. Many others were invited to submit written statements. \"Access to Recreation,\" a report on the hearing, was published. PROJECTED ACHIEVEMENTS FOR 1978 Completion of a comprehensive compliance system that will enable the assem- bling and processing of data concerning construction projects being undertaken. This system will allow the A & TBCB to monitor federally funded construction and deal with barrier problems in beginning stages. An internal compliance system is being developed through a pilot project with HEW. The elements can then be transferred to other departments. The A & TBCB's process for handling complaints will be further strengthened. Materials for the media-oriented public awareness campaign \"Access America\" will be completed and the campaign begun. The project will include posters and television and radio public service announcements creating awareness of barriers. To follow the media-oriented public awareness campaign, an educational program will be developed to enable the A & TBCB to coordinate and support State and local efforts working for a barrier-free environment. Conferences on architectural barriers will be held in five regional cities in the nation. Participants will be architects, builders, lending agents, and Federal, State, and local officials with responsibilities for administering building codes and architectural barriers laws. The A & TBCB's legal staff will further develop the agency's enforcement program. The General Counsel's office will play a significant role in developing administiative and legislative recommendations for the A & TBCB to make to the President and Congress. This office will also prepare comments on pending legislation and regulations proposed by other Federal agencies which affect the handicapped population. OFFICE OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS JANUARY 30, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: In response to your request, enclosed is a summary of the Office of Consumer Affairs (OCA) activities during the past calendar year relating to the elderly. OCA is pleased to have the opportunity to have input in the committee's annual report on aging. We are keenly aware of the needs of the elderly and we anticipate that during the coming year our activities will be expanded to enable us to provide even greater assistance to older Americans. Sincerely, LEE RICHARDSON, Director-Designate. [Enclosure.] The Office of Consumer Affairs (OCA) assures that the consumer's interest is reflected in Federal policies and programs, cooperates with State agencies and voluntary organizations in advancing the interests of consumers, promotes improved consumer education, recommends legislation of benefit to consumers, encourages productive dialog and interaction between industry, government, and the consumer, and provides continuing policy guidance to the Consumer Produict Information Coordinating Center. 128 Its major activities, however, fall primarily within these categories: (1) Con-sumer advocacy, (2) consumer education and information, and (3) planning andanalysis. While these activities in general are initiated on behalf of all consumers,it should be noted that the elderly consumer shares fully in the benefits of OCA programs. Highlighted below are major activities in each of these categories with specialemphasis on those having the greatest impact on older Americans. 1. CONSUMER ADVOCACY INTERAGENCY COMMITTEES OCA is represented on the following HEW interagency committees which have special impact on the elderly.Planning committee of the 1979 White House Conference on Families. The conference will highlight the special needs of infants, children, young adults and the elderly which make up the extended family.Secretary's Task Force on the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. The Task Forceis responsible for developing general guidelines. Scheduled to go into effect January1979, the law provides that no person can, on the basis of age, be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiv- ing Federal financial assistance.Policy group of the HEW Task Force on Deinstitutionalization of the MentallyIll and Mentally Retarded. The Task Force is developing Department strategy on deinstitutionalization of community care and treatment.Congressional Black Caucus \"Brain Trust\" on the Elderly. Among otherthings, the Brain Trust assists the Caucus in developing legislation to benefitminority and poor elderly citizens.University of Pittsburgh's National Consumer Advisory Council. The counciladvises the university in carrying out its Administration on Aging grant to researchthe fraud problems of the elderly. LEGISLATIVE/REGULATORY COMMENTS AND CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT OCA has acted on behalf of the elderly primarily through its comment on variouslegislative and regulatory proposals that would have significant impact on olderAmericans. OCA encouraged the Federal Trade Commission to make in its proposed ruleon mobile home sales and services specific modifications that would strengthenconsumer protection provisions without necessitating an unreasonable increase inthe purchase price. Such efforts would retain mobile homes as a realistic housingalternative for the elderly and other low-income consumers.The Office has become increasingly involved in air transportation regulations,especially those concerning air charters. Since a substantial portion of the chartermarket consists of retirees, every government action affecting the operation ofcharter tours also affects the pocketbooks of older consumers, as well as the enjoy-ment of their vacations. Two issues in which OCA actively participated were:advertising of charter tours and liberalization of charter regulations.During the course of analyzing a wide variety of subjects for consumer impact,several topics were of special interest to the elderly. Those included: food labelingregarding disignation of fats and oils, condominiums, energy efficiency ratings, warranties, consumer product safety rules, funeral industry practices, over-the-counter drugs, and imitation foods. STATE AND LOCAL CONSUMER PROGRAMS OCA through day-to-day liason continued to encourage and assist State andlocal governments in their responsiveness to consumer problems, including thoseof the elderly. Currently, there are 141 State consumer offices, 150 county officesand 67 city consumer offices. A growing number of these offices now have or areconsidering, special information and education programs for the aging and forconcentrated enforcement efforts against frauds and deceptive practices whichare directed toward the elderly.OCA's \"Directory of Federal, State and local Consumer Offices\" includes alisting of toll-free telephone lines in operation to help facilitate consumer contactswith these offices. The 1977 directory also includes a listing of Federal InformationCenters, Federal Consumer Information Centers and State public utilities com- 129 missions. These will insure that the directory is of special assistance to the home- bound and/or handicapped consumers. The directory is available to the general public through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office,Washington, D.C. 20402. OCA's \"Guide to Federal Consumer Services\" has a listing for Older Americans which is free from the Consumer Information Center, Pueblo, Colo. 81009. VOLUNTARY CONSUMERS DIRECTORY The Office of Consumer Affairs published a \"Directory of Consumer Organiza- tions.\" More than 400 international, national, State, and local nongovernment consumer organizations are identified. These are groups which derive funding support from voluntary membership and include many low income, elderly and minority organizations. The directory was compiled in order to encourage more interaction among these groups. OCA sees the directory as being of special assist- ance to the homebound and/or handicapped consumer. TELEPHONE/HEARING AIDS OCA is working with telephone industry officials and representatives of the hearing-impaired to help ensure that the latter have an opportunity to have input into policy decisions of phone companies affecting them. AIR CHARTERS The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) has relaxed its regulation governing air charters, thus providing low-cost air charters to larger numbers of consumers. OCA developed a multiphased study to determine consumer perception of the adequacy of air charter advertising. OCA wanted to know if consumers, including the elderly, were getting sufficient information to pick the best bariains. 2. CONSUMER EDUCATION AND INFORMATION PUBLICATION OF \"CONSUMER NEWS\" BY OCA In addition to carrying articles in every issue of general interest to consumers- \"Consumer News\" focuses on specific news of Federal activities of special concern to the elderly. A few examples: Federally funded nutrition and transportation programs, as well as other federally funded programs especially designed for older Americans, high costs of medical care, tips on energy conservation, widowers' benefits, and memorial societies. In addition, \"Consumer Register,\" which carries summaries of Federsl regula- tions, includes material of special interest to older Americans such as those dealing with social security, nursing homes, and prescription drugs. ''DEAR CONSUMER\" AND HELP\" \"Dear Consumer\" columns, which are provided as a public service to more than 7,000 weekly newspapers, occasionally deal with topics that primarily concern older Americans. OCA's 4-minute Public Service Radio program \"HELP,\" which is sent over 1,200 radio stations, frequently has programs designed for the elderly. \"HELP\" and \"Dear Consumer\" have dealt with such specific topics as: retirement living, concerns for older women, pensions, Gray Panthers, nursing homes, and elderly taxpayers. CONFERENCES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE Besides providing information on an individual basis, OCA has participated in national, regional, and State conferences and workshops designed to address issues affecting low income, minority and elderly consumers. In addition to pro- viding materials and information regarding possible funding sources and technical assistance, OCA has continued to alert these groups to proposed legislation, regula- tions and policies that may impact on them. OCA has contributed to national senior citizen organizations to plan and convene consumer education and protection seminars and workshops. OCA invited representatives of senior citizen and other public interest organiza- tions, business, and the academic sector to participate in the November 3-4 130 National Warranty Update Conference. The purpose of the conference was toreview the results to date of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty/Federal Trade Com-mission (FTC) Improvement Act of 1975. Most participants emphasized the needfor FTC to move toward issuing final rules and regulations that would clarifyneeded enforcement provisions of the act. The economic impact of the regula-tions on low-income groups and those on fixed incomes was highlighted through-out the 2-day discussions. Plans are underway for OCA to hold a conference on life insurance in latespring 1978. The conference will bring together consumers, government, industry,and academic representatives to discuss and develop approaches to meet consumerneeds in the area of life insurance, a subject of importance to the elderly.OCA also is planning a conference on household moving public interest groups,including the elderly, and interstate moving companies will discuss, among otherthings, the need for simplification of terminology used in household movingforms, a source of considerable confusion and economic impact for some olderconsumers. OCA will hold a Consumer Education Catch-Up Conference March 2-3, 1978.Representatives from senior citizens organizations have been invited to participate.One of the workshops planned is on \"extending consumer education to the elderlyand handicapped.\" Other conference issues will also impact on the elderly con-sumer. OCA also served on the planning committee and developed a 2-day consumerworkshop for the fifth annual Conference on the Black Elderly. Additionally, theOffice addressed and answered questions from 80 congressional senior citizeninterns during a \"Consumer Problems of the Elderly\" workshop at the RayburnHouse Office Building. NUTRITION EDUCATION A new series of print advertisements in the Advertising Council's food, nutritionand health campaign sponsored by OCA-for HEW-and the Grocery Manufac-turers of America includes an advertisement specifically for the elderly. Headlined\"if you're over 55, you shouldn't eat like you're still 25.\" The ad copy explainsthat people between 55 and 75 need 150 to 200 fewer calories daily than they didwhen they were younger. The ad copy also encourages the elderly to write for afree booklet which tells them more about their specific nutritional needs. Createdin 1977, the ads will run through 1978. 3. PLANNING AND ANALYSIS CONSUMER COMPLAINTS Many of the approximately 20,000 complaints received by OCA during 1977were from elderly consumers. About one-fourth of these complaints were referralsfrom the White House, members of Congress, and other Federal agencies. Eachcomplaint is given careful consideration and brought to the attention of the ap-propriate Federal, State, county or city government agency, trade association, orbusiness firm that can be of assistance to the consumer. A special effort is made tobe of direct help to senior citizens when it is possible. OCA has funded a four-phase study to improve the handling of consumer com-plaints in the public and private sectors. The final report is scheduled for comple-tion in April 1978. It is expected that this study will serve as the catalyst for sub-stantive changes in complaint handling procedures and will enhance the impactcomplaint data has on management directives and formulation of policy. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION Laws enforced by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are designed toprotect the health, safety, and pocketbooks of all consumers regardless of age.But this protection is particularly important to the elderly consumer, who hasinterests and special problems peculiar to this age group. During 1977, there weremany events and actions which illustrate the significance of FDA's protection ofthe elderly. 1977 ACCOMPLISHMENTS PNEUMOCOCCAL PNEUMONIA VACCINE LICENSED In November, FDA licensed the first vaccine against pneumococcal pneumonia,a common form of pneumonia. Despite the wide use of antibiotics, pneumonia 131 today is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States, killing an estimated 25,000 Americans annually. The type of pneumonia against which the vaccine protects accounts for a major portion of these deaths. The vaccine is effective in at least 80 percent of the people who receive it. BLOOD LABELING REGULATIONS PROPOSED In February, FDA proposed regulations to require the labeling of blood for transfusion to specify whether it came from a paid or volunteer donor. The regulations are designed to reduce the risk of transmitting hepatitis, a serious liver infection, through blood transfusions. Blood from paid donors and commercial blood banks has been shown to be three to ten times more likely to cause hepatitis than blood from volunteer donors. SAFEGUARDS SET FOR INTRAOCULAR LENSES In May 1977, FDA established new safeguards for the use of intraocular lenses. Intraocular lenses are plastic lenses surgically implanted in the eye following removal of the natural lens, most frequently because of cataracts. These safe- guards were needed because there have been reports of more than 100 serious injuries, including five eye losses, after intraocular lens implantation. The injuries appear related to inadequate quality control and manufacturing practices. Under the new regulation, manufacturers have 90 days to submit proposed plans for manufacturing, sterilizing, and testing of their products. The new requirements also limit intraocular lenses, including those now on the market, to investigational use only. Patients must also be informed in writing about the risks and benefits of intraocular lenses before implantation. HEARING AID RULES TAKE EFFECT Important safeguards for the prospective hearing aid customer were established in August when new rules on how hearing aids must be labeled and sold went into effect. These rules give consumers the information they need to protect themselves from buying hearing aids that will not help them; to assure that consumers who can be helped have complete, accurate, and understandable information before they buy; and to make sure that those people who need medical attention for their hearing loss will not be sold a hearing aid instead. FDA TACKLES DIAGNOSTIC X-RAY NONCOMPLIANCE PROBLEM Over the past 3 years, FDA has been field testing medical and dental diagnostic X-ray equipment for compliance with the Federal radiation safety performance standard. The results have shown a high rate of noncompliance, particularly for the medical X-ray industry. During 1977, the Agency notified manufacturers of the problem and the need for positive remedial action. FDA emphasized that the Agency considers the industry's present rate of noncompliance to be unacceptable and that manufac- turers are responsible for correcting any items of noncompliance. FDA also advised manufacturers that the Agency will continue to analyze the compliance field test data and initiate enforcement actions, as appropriate. WARNING LABELS PROPOSED FOR PROTEIN SUPPLEMENTS In December, FDA proposed to require a warning label for all protein supple- ments. In addition to proposing the mandatory label, FDA asked for public and legal comment on the possible need for a banning action and the most appropriate statutory basis for such action, if required. FDA's actions on the protein diets were based on growing evidence of serious medical problems, including death, associated with their use. On the basis of CDC findings, there was reason to believe that the liquid protein diet was a contributing factor or cause of the death. BIOAVAILABILITY-BIOQUIVALENCE REGULATIONS PUBLISHED In January, FDA published the final order establishing bioavailability/bio- equivalence regulations. These regulations play an important role in assuring the quality of generic drugs. The regulations are particularly important to States with 132 legislation allowing for generic drug substitution, as well as States and otherorganizations presently attempting to establish purchasing programs. FDA ACTS TO REQUIRE ESTROGEN AND PROGESTIN PATIENT LABELING FDA has ordered manufacturers of estrogen drugs to provide a lay-lanuagebrochure to women who have had the female hormone prescribed for relief ofmenopausal symptoms and after menopause.The action, which was effective in October, is a continuation of the Agency'seffort to provide information on certain prescription drugs directly to patients, andhelp them participate more fully in decisions with their pyhsicians. The estrogenbrochure will warn women that the higher the dosage and the longer the treat-ment, the greater the risk of cancer in the uterus.In a related action, FDA also proposed the same kind of brochure for womenusing progestins, another type of female hormone. Progestins have been used toprevent miscarriages and for menstrual disturbances. Use of the drugs has beenshown to increase the risks of birth defects and, in female offspring, of vaginal orcervical cancer. FDA urged manufacturers to begin providing such a brochurewhile final regulations are being completed. PROJECTED 1978 AcCOMPLISHMENTS Over the past several years, legislation has been proposed by the Department ofHealth, Education, and Welfare, as well as by individual members of Congress,that would alter the current provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct regarding the regulation of drugs for human use. In the Congress, for example,major changes have been suggested by Senator Edward Kennedy (8.1831),Senator Harrison Williams and Jacob Javits (S. 2040), Senator Gaylord Nelson(S. 628 through S. 643), and Representative Paul Rogers (H.R. 8891). A numberof other bills have been introduced that address single specific sections of the actdealing with drugs for human use. After reviewing the key issues, FDA believes that, at a minimum, any new drugshould have the following features:-a system that sets a consistent standard governing the marketing of all drugs;-a system that will allow the Agency to put promising drugs on the marketfaster, without compromising safety, and that will encourage competition, notstifle it;-a system for careful surveillance of all drugs on the market and promptremoval of drugs when problems appear;-a system that will make public all revelant scientific and testing data whilestill providing needed proprietary protection to encourage the development of new drugs; and -a system that will provide maximum information and education to the healthyconsumer to foster careful and informed use of drugs.With these features in mind, FDA spent much of 1977 developing a legislativeproposal that could be introduced to Congress early in 1978. HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION On March 8, Secretary Califano announced a major reorganization of the De-partment of Health, Education, and Welfare. For the first time the medicare,medicaid, and quality assurance activities of the Department are consolidatedinto one organization, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA).The consolidation of previously separate medicare, medicaid, and qualityassurance activities should greatly assist coordination and resolution of majorissues relating to the Department's long-term care policies. Another purpose of thereorganization is to assist internal efficiency and economy and to encourage pru-dent financial management as well as to strengthen the ability to control fraudand abuse in the medicaid and medicare programs. The Secretary has recognizedthe major involvement of HCFA in long-term care programs by designating HCFAas the \"focal point\" within the Department charged with \"responsibility for en-suring coordination in the development of the Department's long-term carepolicies.\" Health Care Financing Administration programs are the principal source offunding for long-term care services in the United States. HCFA spent approxi-mately $7.2 billion in Federal and State funds for long-term care services in fiscalyear 1977. The medicaid program financed the greatest part of these expenditures, 133 with Federal and State payments of $3 million for skilled nursing facility services, $3.2 billion for intermediate care facility services, and $150 million for home health care services. The medicare program spent approximately $360 million for skilled nursing facility services and $460 million for home health services in fiscal year 1977. LONG-TERM CARE STUDIES AND DEMONSTRATIONS I. ANALYTICAL STUDIES A. General Summary HCFA studies started or completed during fiscal year 1977 concentrated on the development of prototype prospective reimbursement (PR) systems for nursing homes and the analysis of costs in settings serving as alternatives to institutional long-term care. Research on PR systems for nursing homes involves a three-part strategy. Abt Associates is developing a formula PR system which addresses the industry's operating costs; Battelle Northwest is studying issues surrounding reimbursement for capital costs; while Urban Institute is assessing the successes and failures of ongoing State medicaid PR systems for nursing homes. On the alternative side, Stanford Research Institute has reviewed the literature on alternatives to long-term care, reviewed the legislative and regulatory barriers at the State, local, and Federal levels to implementation of alternatives, identified and described a number of long-term care alternatives that were operating without large amounts of continuing Federal support nationwide, and assessed their long- term viability. In another study, Abt Associates developed and field tested a methodology for determining, classifying, and comparing costs for comparable services in 11 different long-term care settings that serve as alternatives to in- stitutional long-term care. B. Individual Project Summaries 1. Reimbursement a. Prospective Reimbursement for Nursing Homes The objective of this study is to develop a formula prospective reimbursement system for nursing homes. The research design calls for the development of a behavioral model of the industry which identifies the degree and direction to which the nursing home operator responds to a variety of mechanisms established by the rate setter and other regulators. The study is designed to provide infor- mation about these responses, with particular attention to incentives and penal- ties implicit in prospective rate-setting methods. The end result of this study will be a list of policy choices with their implications for public budgets, cost contain- ment, availability of care to public patients, and other public objectives, as well as a prototype formula PR system. b. Risk and Rate of Return on Equity Capital This project by Battelle examines and analyzes the effects of reimbursement policies on the profitability of the nursing home industry. It does so by focusing on four major areas: (1) examination of the effects of varying State medicaid policies on the growth in nursing home beds and the change in nursing quality; (2) calculation of accounting rates of return to determine systematic differences across four States and across facility classifications; (3) examination of the risk inherent in the industry and its relationship to measurable financial characteristics of the industry; and finally, an attempt to measure whether vertical and hori- zontal integration is positively related to profitability or not. These studies have been designed with a view to improving the understanding of how the reimburse- ment systems affect the profits and growth of nursing home industry, and to produce research products which will directly help to determine the proper method for setting returns on equity capital in a formula based prospective reimbursement system for nursing homes. c. Case Studies of Selected States' PR Systems The main task of this project is to study in a descriptive fashion the selected States' experiences with prospectively reimbursing nursing homes. The Urban Institute has met with officials from seven States (California, Colorado, Connecti- cut, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and New York), and has collected infor- mation to perform a number of study tasks. These include an investigation of the 134 formal, informal, and perceived goals of each States' PR system; a detailed description of the reimbursement methodology; identification of the formal meansby which the regulatory agency gauges the impact of the reimbursement system on the industry; and a description of each States' information (data base) systemwhich it may use to establish and monitor the PR system. 2. Alternatives a. Methodology for Finding, Classification, and Comparing Costs for Services inLong-Term Care Settings The objective of this project was to develop a cost-finding methodology andclassification structure useful for (1) comparing costs and services by patientcharacteristics, and (2) comparing these costs and services across the spectrum oflong-term care alternatives. It has two distinct parts. During phase I, a systemof classifying patient characteristics, a consistent set of definitions of costs andservices, and procedure for surveying costs, were developed. The \"patient profilesurvey\" and the \"patient service questionnaire\" were developed to collect infor-mation to classify patients. The \"cost-finding survey\" was developed to collectinformation on costs. Techniques were developed for interpretation of the datacollected. The data collection instruments were pretested in nine settings.In phase II, the methodology was further tested and refined by application ofthe methodology in 11 different long-term care settings at 29 sites. b. The Feasibility and Cost-Effectiveness of Alternative Long-Term Care Settings The main tasks on this project were to define methods and outline conditions fordetermining the feasibility of setting up service programs such as geriatric settings,chronic care centers, comprehensive service delivery organizations for extendinglong-term care to the chronically ill and disabled outside of nursing homes andlong-term hospitals. Its approach called for an in-depth analysis of selected service programs todetermine viability for continued operation. Institutional facilities within thesame catchment areas were compared with these services to analyze the relativecost-effectiveness of the alternative care setting and the nursing home for popula-tions of like functional capacity. State-of-the-art studies augmented that on-sitestudies. Concurrently, general analysis of legislative, regulatory or organizational re-quirements which impinge upon the establishment, operation and payment sys-tems through which long-term care services operate were undertaken. Guidelinesfor innovators through which the feasibility of establishing services similar to thestudies programs were developed. II. DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS A. General Summary Nineteen research demonstrations nationwide are in various stages of progress.Five are demonstrating the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of community widecoordinating systems for social and health care services designed to prevent pre-mature or inappropriate long-term institutionalization and (in some areas) toreturn people to the community who no longer need the nursing home level ofcare. These five projects are located in Wisconsin, Washington State, Georgia,New York, and Colorado. Four projects are demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of day health care as analternative to long-term institutional care. They are located in California (two projects), Kentucky, and Maine. One project in New York is exploring the cost-effectiveness of a day hospital. A Vermont project is exploring the cost-effectiveness of review of long-term care by a PSRO; and a Utah study is attempting to develop a long-term care payments system that is related to reasonable costs of care. A study in Texas is exploring the feasibility of congregate housing for the permanently and severely disabled. Four projects involve the concept of \"swing-beds\" in rural low occupancy hos-pitals. These are being conducted in Texas, Utah, and South Dakota, Two. proj-ects in Oregon and Massachusetts will determine the effects of waiving the 3-dayprior hospitalization requirement for coverage in skilled nursing facilities. 135 B. Individual Project Summaries 1. The Community-Wide Coordinating Systems a. Wisconsin The long-term objectives are (a) to demonstrate that a substantial segment of the elderly and functionally disabled population may be maintained in their own homes or in community settings at a cost lower than that of the present pattern of institutionalization through the provision of a packaged continuum of health and health-related social services; and (b) to demonstrate that the quality of care can be improved over that which is the experience of the medical assistance program. The operation is basically the establishment of an administrative structure, called the \"community care organization\" (in cooperation with the State medicaid program and the particular county department of social services), which (a) identi- fies indigent disabled persons appropriate for care within the community; (b) cer- tifies their eligibility for medicaid financed health-related services; and (c) provides services. The community care organization (CCO) assumes responsibility for providing health-related services itself or subcontracting with other community agencies for specific services and arranges for required professional medical services in its role of coordinator. Thus the CCO is a central contractor, funder and coordinator of services to CCO clients. For a price negotiated in advance, it assumes responsibility for maintaining disabled persons in their homes or in the community at an appropriate level of quality care. The first CCO was established at La Crosse, Wis., and is an urban/rural mix site. It has four contracts for day services: (a) for the multiple handicapped (St. Francis Hospital); (b) for older people (St. Francis Home); (c) for the mobile mentally handicapped; (d) for the older adults who are socially, physically and/or mentally impaired (adult day care, Park Terrace Nursing Center). The CCO provides a vast array of health, therapeutic, nutritional, nursing, personal care and home maintenance services designed for individual patients to meet their individual needs. Two additional sites have been developed; Milwaukee County CCO (urban site) and Barron County (rural site). b. Washington The research objectives are: (A) To assess and interpret the impact of a coordinated system of community- based and institutional services which emphasizes the avoidance of inappropriate and unnecessary institutionalization through the use of two experimental sites and one control site. Specifically: (1) To assess the changes in patterns of service utilization in the project site for both community based and institutional services. (2) To compare the capacity of agencies and providers to render competent and appropriate service in the three project sites. (3) To compare the impact of the program on the costs of meeting the supportive service and long-term care needs, both institutional and com- munity based, of disabled persons in the three project sites. (4) To determine the characteristics and numbers of functionally disabled clients served by the community and institutional-based network in the demonsti ation sites. The project became operational at two sites in October 1976, Benton-Franklin Counties and Cowlitz-Wahkiakum Counties. Total caseload was 808, of which 503 were nursing home patients. In May 1977, the total caseload was 940, of which 543 were nursing home residents. The ratio of nursing home residents to total cases showed a strong decline especially in the Benton-Franklin Counties area. The ratio would be greater if additional services were available in the Cowlitz- Wahkiakum area, e.g., adult day care, mental health services, protective services. Efforts are being made by project staff to assist in the development of these services during the third year. The client population includes all individuals 18 and over who are (a) function- ally disabled, (b) eligible for title XIX and/or title XX services, and (c) at risk of nursing home placement. The \"at-risk\" factor is further defined as individuals (a) being discharged from hospital or other acute facilities who would be placed in a long term care facility; (b) residing in the community who are unable to manage the tasks of daily living because of physical disabilities; and (c) residing in nursing homes and not in need of that level of care. The list of medical and health-related supportive services which are availableaccording to the assessed levels of need is extensive, from in-home to institutionalcare. On August 1, 1977, \"in home care services\" were introduced to replace choreservices. During the third year, movement will be made toward preparing for statewideimplementation of the project's successful components and providing input forpossible changes in the State's medicaid plan.There is strong support for the project in the legislative and executive branchesof state government. On June 30, 1977, the Governor signed SSHB 251, an actwhich continues the services and funding initiated by HB 1316, the Senior CitizensServices Act of the previous legislation. It provides $11,820,000 to develop andexpand alternative services and forms of care for senior citizens. The State hasindicated interest in, and willingness to extend, this form of health and socialservices delivery statewide should the demonstration prove feasible and costeffective. c. Georgia The Department of Medical Assistance for the State of Georgia is attemptingto demon'strate that the use of three major alternatives to nursing home institu-tionalization for medicaid within the State of Georgia would make possible theprovision of more efficient and effective medical care to persons for whom suchservices are both appropriate and conducive to more independent living. Thealternative services being tested are: (1) adult supportive living services (adultfoster homes, board and care homes); (2) home-delivered services (health andrelated services to beneficiaries in own or foster homes); and (3) special medicalservices (medical and health care related services for beneficiaries at a centralfacility on a day care basis).Should the project succeed, the State would seek legislative and administrativechanges through which these programs could be continued on a statewide basis.The project looks at the recipient of alternative services within the experimentalareas as an experimental group and the nonrecipients of alternative services (i.e.recipients of institutional nursing home care) as the control group. The threehypotheses to be tested deal with cost measures and serve to demonstrate thatless expensive alternatives to nursing home care are possible and can be imple-mented. The average cost data for the new services will be compared with averagenursing home cost data within the experimental districts.The project also seeks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the experimentalproject in increasing the recipient's capacity for independent functioning. Effec-tiveness will be measured in two ways: (1) an evaluation of the health, mobilityand activity levels of the patients; and (2) the patient's degree of satisfaction withthe services he received. Assessment and comparisons of quality of care and pa-tients' attitudes will be made. d. New York The New York project is a unique attempt to divorce long-term care servicesdelivery within a community from barriers which are seen as inhibiting the develop-ment of coordinated health and social service programs which focus on preventingpremature institutionalization. At the same time, it is an experiment with com-munity response to the options of community decisionmaking concerning theforms of, and financing for, long-term care.This demonstration will study procedures, community organization, servicedelivery, premium and payment control systems, and policy for community-controlled long-term care. Planning for the demonstration will consider the entirepopulation at risk in the county as defined by the communitywide organizationand in conjunction with a patient assessment center. Contracts will be arrangedwith State and local organizations, and the State department and its affiliatedlocal agency will monitor the community organization's activities.The major thrusts of the evaluation will be to (1) determine differences in cost-quality and overall satisfaction between the existing and the new systems to bemodeled and demonstrated, and (2) evaluate the ease and relative importance ofachieving different organizational arrangements for accomplishing the primaryobjectives. e. Colorado The objectives are: (1) to develop a communitywide, coordinated, and inte-grated system for the organization, delivery, and financing of health care andrelated support services for the medicaid-eligible elderly and adult disabled in 137 their own homes or in the community, utilizing existing and new public and private health and social services resources, including institutional services; and (2) to demonstrate that thbse alternatives to the present fragmented \"nonsystem\" of out-of-institution delivery of health care and/or institutionalization (a) will be more cost-effective, (b) will reduce substantially the number of inappropriate placements in institutions, and (c) will improve quality of life through inde- pendent living with applied personalized medical and supportive services. This demonstration will study the structure and processes of the Boulder County service delivery system before and after the demonstration at the first CCO site; community organization, participation and control; and service premiums and cost. Planning for the demonstration will consider the elderly and adult disabled Medicaid population at risk in the demonstration county as identi- fied by the CCO staff through outreach, nursing home patient review, hospital discharge planning and referrals from other agencies, in conjunction with the interdisciplinary team at a patient assessment center. Contracts will be arranged with State and local organizations. The department of social services, assisted by an advisory group (composed of representatives from the department's various units and from other departments of the State) will monitor the demonstration activities. 2. Day Health Care Systems a. California (1) On-Lok.-The long-term general objectives are (a) to test day health services as a new health care delivery system designed to meet the special needs of the elderly by maintaining them in the community as long as it is medically, socially and economically feasible; (b) to prevent premature or inappropriate institutional- ization; and (c) to develop/test the licensing and program regulations for a funded adult day health services program that is both cost-effective and cost-beneficial when compared to traditional health services delivery. The State of California initiated this demonstration effort in the Chinatown area of San Francisco. The administrative office and the medical facility, referred to as the \"On Lok Senior Health Center,\" are operative and services are being provided to program participants. These services include medical care and nurs- ing supervision; health-related social services; physical, occupational, speech therapy; nutrition, including diets and counseling; podiatry; psychiatry; activities of daily living, such as grooming and bathing; transporta- tion; portable meals and in-home services. Emphasis during the present year will be on (a) the development of appropriate health care packages at different costs and eligibility criteria; (b) obtaining management information (MIO) beneficiary profiles for all persons involved in the second-year program, with followup to determine persent status; (c) a longi- tudinal retroactive analysis, utilizing program participants from December 1974 as a baseline; and (d) revision of reports to obtain service and fiscal information for testing various levels of day health services. (2) Sacramento, San Diego.-This application is to support adult day health services in San Diego and Sacramento. Although the overall purpose of the adult day health services demonstration models is to test the cost, effectiveness, and satisfaction (California requirement) afforded by these services, expand the data base for supporting (or rejecting) the service as a Medi-Cal benefit, and determine reimbursement experiences and rate setting procedures to support prospective legislation, each of the projects incorporates additional variations which may be used to compare models. The Sacramento Senior Health Day Care Center established as a California Office on Aging model project, will expand services from physical therapy and nursing to include medical/nursing, physical therapy, occupational and speech therapy, and social casework as primary services and ADL, meals, transportation, health education, reality therapy and recreational/socialization as supportive serv- ices. Podiatry, hearing and vision screening will be provided on an as needed basis. Unlike the AoA model, there will be no over 60 age restriction, a congre- gate feeding center will be combined with the day health program, and a nurse practitioner will be introduced as an onsite intake and assesment team member. (This does not eliminate the personal physician but replaces the staff physician on the assessment team). Variation from On Lok include the nurse practitioner, combination with elderly nutrition project, and in-home services provided by existing services. Feasibility and relative cost will be evaluated. 138 The San Diego County adult day care program, operating since 1973, is testingthe provision of these services on a countywide basis: a central administrativeunit combined with five autonomous centers. Four centers are currently in opera-tion, a fifth is to be opened. The core staff consists of social services specialists ateach site with the health care professionals (physical therapists, occupationaltherapists, public health nurse and psychiatrist) traveling from site to site.Medical assessment will be done by the participant's physician and not a partof the team. Primary services include nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, psychiatry, and social casework. Supportive services includegroup therapies (art, music, reality, exercises), socialization, health education,group counseling, meals, transportation, recreation, ADL. b. Kentucky Objectives: (a) To compare the offering of day care service and homemaker services asalternatives to the traditional nursing home services. By offering these services,optimum rehabilitation can occur and at least delay or prevent the need forinstitutionalization. (b) Determine the unit costs of these alternative services so that a comparisoncan be drawn between these costs and the costs of nursing home care.This project is designed to test the null hypothesis that there is no significantdifferences between the service appropriateness of homemaker services, daycare services, home health services, and skilled nursing facility care services forpersons who require posthospital or long-term care. The hypothesis is made thatthe service clusters of each alternative provide equally effective service outcome.Further consideration will be given to the hypothesis that there is a significantdifference between the cost of the services provided in the experimental group(adult day care and homemaker) and the control group (home health and skillednursing facility). c. Maine The objective is to determine the effectiveness of adult day health care in anurban-rural setting in preventing premature institutionalization and improvingthe functional capabilities of those adults who are incapable of full-time inde-pendent living because of mental and/or physical impairments. In order to makesuch a determination, the State will explore the concept from several points ofview; absolute and relative efficiency of service delivery mode, monetary andsocial costs and benefits, individual and system utilization patterns, optimalmix of social and medical program models and potential for system impact.The State of Maine proposes to initiate this demonstration effort in the cityof Waterville and six surrounding towns of the Kennebec Valley area. This areawas selected because of its urban-rural mix; because it contains 5.8 percent ofthe State's population and 5.6 percent of the elderly; and because three quartersof the area's elderly citizens are low income. The growing population of peopleover 65 and the high rate of low-income elderly suggest that in the near futurethe need for institutional care, or alternative services, will severely strain avail-able resources. Within Waterville's city limits there are two hospitals, with atotal of 349 acute care beds, and several nursing and boarding homes. Existingservices in support of independent living for the elderly include: homemakerservices, home health care, transportation services, meals-on-wheels, a mentalhealth center and a day hospital. The adult day health center will be housed ina wing of Lakewood Manor. 3. Day Hospital-New York The objective of the demonstration is to deliver intensive rehabilitation servicesto severely disabled persons over the age of 15 in a day hospital setting. Theseservices are now available only in an inpatient hospital setting. The goals are to(1) deliver intensive rehabilitative services in a day hospital setting without harmto the patient, (2) insure and provide quality of care at least equal to the qual-ity of conventional inpatient rehabilitation treatment, and (3) establish that thecost of day hospital service can be significantly less than the cost of inpatienthospitalization. The control group of 30 medicaid and medicare inpatients randomly selectedby a physiatrist would be admitted to the rehabilitation unit in the hospital,where they would reside until they are no longer in need of, or able to benefit 139 from intensive therapy. Both the experimental and control group would receive the same rehabilitative services prescribed by a physiatrist as defined in NCHSR contract HRA 230-7C-0115(6). The dependent variables to be studied are: (1) total cost of providing intensive rehabilitation services (from admission to discharge), (2) per diem cost of the services per patient (3) length of treatment, (4) change in level of dependence, and (5) degree of recovery. Measurement of cost of services will be based on daily records setting forth the type and amount of professional services, tests, etc., provided. A 12-month followup will be maintained after discharge. Measure- ment of treatment effectiveness will be based on five types of data (1) medical and demographic identifiers, (2) functioning of self-care and mobility activity, (3) mental status, (4) functioning in role-related activities and instrumental activities of daily living, and (5) participation in group and individual leisure activities.4. Utah-Payments Systems The objective is to develop a cost-related payment system for long-term care patients and to determine its effectiveness on a statewide basis. System should be transferable to other States. The statewide experiment will enable a compre- hensive test of the concepts, procedures, cost, controls, and quality of care con- tained in the cost-related payment system. The project will develop two distinct profiles: A facility cost profile and a patient care profile. Data from these two profiles will be used to determine the payment an individual nursing home should receive. A point compliance system is being developed to monitor services provided by long-term care facilities. The compliance monitoring system is in the developmental stages and is subject to negotiation with providers within the State. An evaluation of the project, its structure, processes, results, and effects on quality of care will be conducted by an independent contractor. This evaluation will include the feasibility of duplicating the project elsewhere as well as assessing the social and economic effects of the project. 5. Texas-Congregate Living The project will attempt to provide services to permanently and severely physically disabled adults, aged 21 to 64, who are eligible for SSI as well as titles XIX and XX benefits. The intent is to enable these individuals to live in apart- ment clusters and thereby avoid inappropriate institutionalization. Housing will be adapted to provide barrier-free living. Alternative care services will either be provided as needed or the needy disabled will be referred to and helped to obtain services already available in the community. Fifty persons will be selected, on a volunteer basis, to participate in the demon- stration. Some of those are already living in two apartment complexes in Houston which now constitute a less developed prototype of the proposed project. Specific services to be provided include homemaker/chore services, home health care, architectural modifications, limited meal service, transportation and general social services, and counseling. 6. \"Swing-Bed\" Projects a. Utah Cost Improvement Project (UCIP) In January 1973, a 3-year contract was signed with the Utah De artment of Social Services, Utah State Division of Health, to administer UCIP. The contract was subsequently extended twice and is scheduled to terminate on December 31, 1978. Originally, only 16 hospitals were approved for participation. Currently, 25 hospitals are participating. Generally, these hospitals have fewer than 100 acute beds, experience a chronic low occupancy rate of 60 percent, and are located in areas where long-term care beds are unavailable or inaccessible. The rate of reimbursement for long-term care patients is the rate which each third-party payer (medicare, medicaid, private insurers) pays for the particular level of long-term care provided to the patient. For the medicare program, which only pays for SNF care, the rate is equal to the Utah title XIX SNF rate which was $25 per day in 1977. The medicaid rates for SNF, intermediate, and custodial levels of care are $25, $20, and $15, respectively. As with all \"swing-bed\" sites, the rates, which vary from site to site, only apply to routine services. Ancillary services are determined by whichever method of cost determination the hospital uses at the time of final settlement (either the ratio of charges or the combination method). 24-084 0 -78 -10 Hospitals are eligible for an incentive payment from the medicare program but notfrom the medicaid program. A contract was signed in March 1974 with the University of Colorado toevaluate UCIP. The final summary report will be published early in 1978, Theevaluation focuses on financing, utilization and patterns of care, organization, andthe hospital's capacity to provide long-term care in addition to acute care.The patterns-of-care area focuses on the effect of the UCIP on patterns of acuteand long-term care in communities serviced by the program. Preliminary resultsfrom the first 2 years of the demonstration indicate that rates of use of long-termcare in communities serviced by UCIP hospitals have increased with little or nochange in patterns of acute care. Distances traveled to obtain long-term care havedecreased during the demonstration. The administrative evaluation area deals with such issues as attitudes ofparticipants, implementation problems, and quality of care. A study of the avail-ability of long-term care services and nursing resources in UCIP hospitals, ascompared with Utah SNF's generally supports these conclusions: (1) The diagnos-tic casemix for UCIP patients is roughly the same as for patients from rural areasof Utah SNF's. Thus, physicians appear to admit the same kind of patients to bothgroups of providers. There is no evidence from this study that physicians sendpatients with different types of diagnoses to UCIP hospitals. (2) Nursing timestudies in 6 of the 25 UCIP hospitals showed that slightly more nursing time (forall categories of nurses: RN, LPN, and aide) was available to long-term patients inUCIP hospitals than in Utah SNF's. (3) Most nurses in UCIP hospitals supportedthe idea of providing long-term care in their hospitals. b. Reducing Acute Care Costs (RACC) Based on the initial data from UCIP, it was decided to replicate the Utahexperiment. As a result of a competitive solicitation, 3-year contracts were signedin July 1975 with the Texas Hospital Association and Blue Cross of WesternIowa-South Dakota to administer the RACC \"swing-bed\" experiments. Hospitalsbegan admitting long-term care patients in July 1976. The experimental phasewill terminate on June 30, 1978, and the contracts will expire on December 31,1978. Approximately 40 hospitals participate in Texas and 20 in Western Iowa-SouthDakota. All of the hospitals satisfy the following conditions: (1) location in a ruralarea where long-term care is inaccessible or unavailable; (2) low acute patientoccupancy rates, averaging less than 80 percent; (3) less than 100 acute beds;(4) staff/patient ratio not exceeding two standard deviations of the average of allhospitals in the State of the same bed size; and (5) total full-time equivalents(FTE's) not exceeding the FTE average for the hospital for the preceding 5 yearsby more than 20 percent. Medicare reimbursement for SNF routine services is at a fixed rate, per patient,negotiated between HCFA and the individual contractor. The negotiated medicarerate does not exceed the medicaid rate for the highest level of long-term carerecognized by each respective State's title XIX program. The Texas SNF rate wasoriginally $20.50, and was later adjusted upward to $23.37. The Western Iowahospitals receive $33.78 and the South Dakota hospitals, $17. All participatinghospitals are eligible to receive financial incentives from the medicare program,defined as 50 percent of the difference between the medicare long-term care rou-tine rate reimbursement and the incremental cost of providing long-term care.The Texas medicaid program is expected to begin participation for SNF level ofcare in January 1978. The medicaid program in South Dakota makes paymentfor SNF, intermediate, and custodial level of care. Although the Iowa medicaidprogram is not participating in RACC, it makes the coinsurance payment forthose beneficiaries who are medicare and medicaid eligible.The evaluation of both RACC experiments is being performed by the Universityof Colorado under a 3-year contract. The final RACC evaluation report is due tobe published early in 1980. The evaluation will follow the general scheme of theUCIP evaluation; however, more emphasis will be placed on an examination ofthe quality of skilled care in participating hospitals. c. Blue Cross of Iowa In November 1975, Blue Cross of Iowa (BCI) submitted an unsolicited pro-posal to conduct a \"swing-bed\" experiment. An 11-month contract was signed inFebruary 1977 and was subsequently extended so that the experiment will ter-minate on December 31, 1978. Twenty-four hospitals are participating in this project and began admitting long-term patients in April 1977. The Medicare SNF routine service rate is $40. A major distinguishing feature of this experiment is that the hospitals are not eligible for an incentive payment, as permitted in Utah, Texas, and Western Iowa-South Dakota. Therefore, a direct comparison of Western Iowa-South Dakota and BCI results will permit a determination of whether an incentive is necessary to obtain the cooperation of small rural hospitals in providing SNF level services in their institutions, or whether it is sufficient to permit hospitals to use \"swing-beds\" to provide long-term care. Another unique feature of the BCI experiment is that a penalty will be imposed when a hospital exceeds its previous highest level of full-time equivalent personnel. Unless additional peisonnel were previously approved by HCFA, the cost of these additional employees cannot be included in the routine costs of the hospital. The penalty will provide a direct control over the increase in personnel costs. The Univeristy of Colorado will conduct an evaluation of the BCI experiment as part of its RACC evaluation. 7. Waiver of 3-Day Prior Hospitalization Stay Requirement The 3-day prior hospitalization requirement is intended to limit the payment of SNF benefits to persons for whom such care may reasonably be presumed to be required in connection with continuous treatment followlng inpatient care, to lessen the likelihood of unduly long hospital stays, and to assure that medical conditions and needs of medicare patients admitted to SNF's have been adequately medically appraised prior to admission. Many believe, however, that the 3-day prior hospitalization stay requirement has resulted in unnecessary hospital stays for medicare beneficiaries preceding transfer to SNF's. The Senate Finance Com- mittee recommended that the Secretary conduct experiments to determine the effects of eliminating or reducing the requirement. In response to a competitive solicitation, HCFA contracted with Blue Cross of Oregon and Blue Cross of Massachusetts, respectively, to administer experiments with the waiver of the 3-day prior hospitalization requirement. The contracts are effective from September 30, 1977, to Septmeber 30, 1980. Both contracts provide for a developmental phase, a 24-month experimental phase, and a 6-month final phase. Blue Cross of Massachusetts will initiate the experimental phase in 30 SNF's on February 1. 1977, and Blue Cross of Oregon will initiate its experimental phase on April 1, 1977, in 28 SNF's. By waiving the requirement at the participating SNF's, extended care coverage will be provided under several types of conditions, such as: followup extended care services after receiving initial treatment or care in a hospital outpatient department, emergency room, or hospital clinic; direct admission to an SNF after examination and certification by a physician of the need for extended care services; and, followup extended care services after a hospital stay of less than 3 days. 1978 PROJECTED ACHIEVEMENTS A major home health study conforming essentially to the provision for a full study of home health services outlined in the Medicare and Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Act will be implemented. Major areas to be studied include availability, administration, provision, standards reimbursement, and cost of home health and other in-home services under titles XVIII, XIX, and XX. Interprogram coordi- nation issues, utilization control, and prevention of fraud and abuse are other issues that will be included in a report to Congress. HCFA's demonstration activities in 1978 will focus on five areas. Major effort will be given to an expansion of the community care organization concept to include coordination of services outside the health area. These would include housing, income security, and transportation. These projects will go beyond the \"demonstration effect\" (proving that such a system can be implemented) of these programs and investigate the cost implications, organization and delivery of care, and the national applicability of this type of program. Research on prospectively reimbursing nursing homes will continue with the implementation of PR demonstrations in several States. A Request for Proposals will be issued soliciting proposals to implement a formula reimbursement system for the operating costs of nursing homes. Further study will be undertaken to integrate a method for reimbursing capital costs into the demonstration experi- ments. Research will also begin on the development of a quality of care measure to be used in the reimbursement of nursing homes. 142 Demonstration projects on coverage of home health services provided byhospices will be implemented. Hospices are a new category of providers, currentlynot recognized by medicare or medicaid, which provide specialized services to theterminally ill. A request for proposals will be issued inviting hospices which arecurrently certified as medicare home health agencies to participate. During thedemonstrations, waivers will be granted removing the \"homebound\" requirementand permitting the reimbursement of palliative drugs. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING DEVELOPMENTS IN AGING This decade is one in which aging has become a topic of great interest. Mediagiants such as Time and Newsweek have paid public tribute to the impact of this\"gray revolution\" with cover stories on the revolt of the old and the graying ofAmerica, respectively. Aging is in vogue-depleted oil wells are now described as\"senile\" and the slumping stock market is referred to as a \"little old lady\"-both acknowledging the force of gray America and revealing the deep-seated, andperhaps unconscious, prejudice against the old that pervades our culture, oureconomic and social systems, and the provision of medical care. Improvementsin health care, especially the abolition of many childhood diseases, have givenAmericans a greater opportunity to live longer. This longevity is now beingmatched by increasing attention to the quality of life. GERIATRIC MEDICINE Each of us in America ought to be able to expect good health care for the wholeof a lifetime-however many years that may be. But the Nation has few physicianstrained in the special skills of caring for the elderly, and our reasonable expecta-tions may not be met as we grow older. At the National Institute on Aging, we are confronted daily by the need forexpanded education in geriatrics. We serve a constituency of overmedicated andundertreated older people who must seek help from physicians who are not yetfully equipped to care for them. Despite the growing number of elderly, manyphysicians have had to chart their own learning programs for care of the oldbecause training is not regularly available. Their efforts, combined with scientificadvances in our understanding of the aging process, have led to the developmentof a special body of knowledge about the aged and aging. We believe that the timeis right for this information to be incorporated into the medical school curriculum.Abetted by an Institute-sponsored conference on geriatric medicine and the privateendowment of our country's first chair in geriatrics at the Cornell New YorkMedical Center, there has been a marked increase in interest in geriatric medicinethroughout the country. However, a great deal remains to be done before geriatricmedicine extends beyond a relative handful of people working in isolation andbecomes a fundamental part of primary and speciality care training. DEMOGRAPHY Predictions of the growth of the older population are not guesswork. Thosepeople who will be old in 2030, when the segment of our population over 65 willbe more than double what it is today, are now alive. They are the children of theWorld War II \"baby boom,\" the youth who \"greened\" America and will go on to'gray'' America. The vast increase in the absolute number and relative proportion of older peopleis the most startling demographic characteristic of the twentieth century. Indi-viduals over 65 comprised 4 percent of the population in 1900, nearly 10 percentby 1972, and will comprise a projected 17 percent to 23 percent of the populationin 2030. In only 45 years, it is possible that one out of every five Americans willbe over 65. HEALTH CARE COSTS The older population is increasing rapidly, but the cost of health care is risingat an even faster rate. Fifty-six cents out of every Federal health dollar-a totalof $20 billion in 1976-was spent through medicare and medicaid on health carefor the elderly. A substantial portion of this was connected with nursing homes. 143 In 1976, the nursing home industry cost $10 billion of private, State, and Federal money. One million older Americans are in our 23,000 nursing homes-more than in our short-term hospitals. Because medicaid is a State/Federal matching plan, there is variation in costs from State to State, but overall the expenses are ex- tremely high. Last year, for example, a nursing home bed in New York State cost $15,000 per year; in Nebraska, the cost was about $11,000. It is only through the judicious application of new knowledge acquired through research that existing services and health care can improve. Without new knowl- edge, we will continue to do the same things in the same ways while our health care costs continue to soar. Research is the ultimate service and the ultimate cost- container. Imaginative thinking about new ways to prevent disease and disa- bility, support the family, and develop better systems of self-help and self-care may help us contain the spiraling costs of health care. In addition to considering cost-containment, attention can also be directed towards a more humanistic attitude toward care, particularly the care of the dying. Consideration should be given to the hospice concept and to reexamining the way we administer narcotic drugs for relief of pain. Within the health care community, we must continually coordinate our efforts to translate new laboratory findings into appropriate medical applications in a timely but cautious fashion. SENILE DEMENTIA A key example of the potential contributions of research is in the area of senile dementia and other chronic brain diseases. People fear few things more than losing their minds and being \"put away\" in a nursing home. We now know that some of the conditions that have been mislabeled as \"senility\" simply because the patient is old are reversible if diagnosed and treated in time. It is extraordinarily important to recognize these dementias as diseases or symptoms of other diseases, for since they are not an inevitable outcome of aging they can be studied, treated, and ultimately prevented. In 1977, the NINCDS, NIA, and NIMH co-sponsored an international workshop/conference on Senile Dementia/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders to summarize the state of knowledge in this area.and stimulate further research. That meeting was followed by another, smaller workshop at which groups of experts began the process of forming a consensus as to how to approach the problem of the reversible organic brain syndromes through research, treatment, and prevention. PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT Epidemiology In recognition of the importance of epidemiology, the study of diseases and conditions in various populations, the NIA appointed its first Associate Director for Epidemiology, Biometry, and Demography. Beginning with this appointment, the Institute hopes to initiate a broad program that might consider a range of areas, including the following: race, gender, and ethnic factors influencing dis- ease; and collaborative studies of hypertension and nutrition and their relation to disease in the elderly. Toward this end, the Institute has designated nutrition/ prevention as a special initiative for the year 1978. Our new Associate Director has already established channels of communication with the National Center for Health Statistics, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Center for Disease Control, and other NIH Institutes which are involved in data collection in the area of nutrition. In the fall of 1977, NIA convened a special group of physicians, research scientists, ethicists and lawyers to discuss special considerations in protecting elderly research subjects. This area and that of the translation of new technologies into prosthetic devices for the elderly are among the duties of the NIA's newly appointed Special Projects Officer. During a unique planning exercise in the fall of 1977, the NIA identified special priority areas. This was done by applying the following criteria: -The burden of illness and disability-whether or not a significant portion of the population is affected. -The potential for reducing family anguish. -The potential for containing health care costs. -Ripeness for research and likelihood of research advances. -Availability of scientific manpower. 144 -The degree to which major clinical problems are addressed.-The degree to which research in each area utilizes available resources suchas cell lines or animal models.Brief descriptions of some of these priority areas are listed below: Nutrition and Aging It is clear that because nutrition influences all of life's processes, it is a subjectof primary importance in any program on prevention. NIA research on nutritionwill be broadly aimed at establishing the interrelationship between dietary intake, disease prevention, and optimal health maintenance in the aged. Although the present research base on nutrition in aging is modest, primarily limited to a few studies on nutrition and health status and on the influence of dietary intake onphysiologic and pathophysiologic response, the NIA is planning the developmentand programing the expansion of its research base on nutrition and aging. This program is already under way. A request outlining the important areas of research on nutrition and aging has been developed and circulated to the scientific community to catalyze research investigations. Pharmacology and Aging It is quite clear that the process of aging is characterized by changes and deterioration of many of the body's functions. Physiologic impairment of theheart, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive tract, and nervous system can alter the body's ability to metabolize and respond to drugs. This presents serious medicaland social problems. At the present time, medical treatment of the diseases anddisabilities of old age is based primarily on experience gained in the use of drugs in people with similar diseases but who by and large are young and middle-agedadults. The goal of the NIA's pharmacology program is to illuminate the dif-ferences between the geriatric patient and the rest of the population in responseto drugs, thereby improving the effectiveness with which drugs are administeredto the old. Clinical observation of older patients has revealed many adverse or paradoxical reactions to drugs that have no unusual effects on younger people.For example, some mild tranquilizers can cause confusion and behavioral dis- turbances in the elderly that are often mistaken for chronic brain disease. Pheno-thiazines, drugs given for sedation and to treat nausea and anxiety, can increasevulnerability to accidental hypothermia, a progressive loss of deep body tempera- ture leading to death if not diagnosed in time and treated properly.In the spring of 1977, the NIA expanded its efforts in this area and formallynotified the scientific community of its interest in receiving more grant applicationsin pharmacology. An innovative cooperative inter-Institute arrangement with theNational Institute of General Medical Sciences provided the \"personpower\" for the interactions with investigators who responded, as well as for the planning and organization of a pharmacology/aging research workshop held in the fall. In aneffort to maximize the use of available resources, NIA contracted with the Bostoncollaborative drug surveillance program (BCDSP) to study the age-related effectsof drugs. The BCDSP has been engaged, since 1966, in the collection and analysis of adverse drug reactions, drug efficacy data, and the acute and long-term effectsof drugs on patients of all age groups. As a result of the contract, the BCDSPwill now survey their massive files for information and observations relating to special drug problems of the elderly. Immunology and Aging Immune function over the lifespan of the individual increases rapidly in the earlyyears of life, reaches a peak in adolescence, and then declines progressively. Sinceimmunologically incompetent individuals are highly susceptible to infections, aweakened immune system is probably one of the major sources of the healthproblems of the elderly. There is good evidence that decline in immune functionis involved in the development of a variety of age-related diseases, such as cardio-vascular disease, kidney disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.Most research on aging immune function has been in the mouse; research inman has been limited to a few investigations on antibody levels and health status.An effort is now underway to study the importance of the relationship betweenaging and genetics with regard to immune function. Preliminary results indicatethat a decrease in immune function in women beyond the age of 70 is associatedwith a failure in one specific gene. Retirement With the fall 1977 passage by both houses of Congress of legislation changing mandatory retirement laws, the Institute has initiated a special \"think tank\" within the NIH to examine the social, behavioral, and medical ramifications of revised retirement policies. This task force is comprised of representatives from NIA; the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke; the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases; and the National Institute of Mental Health. Until now, chronological age has been the sole criterion in assess- ment of ability to continue working or in determining time of retirement. Attention is now turning to the possibility of using functional ability as a basis for deter- mining competency. Behavioral and Social Sciences and Aging The NIA's congressional mandate clearly includes support of behavioral and social research on aging. A major portion of the research supported in the be- havioral area is concerned with the identification and description of the intellectual and cognitive changes that occur with aging. When we have obtained accurate information about these changes and the related physiological and biological changes which may underlie them, we may be able to modify or at least develop means of coping with them. Recent research findings have cast doubt on the earlier reported findings that there is a general decline in intellectual abilities with age. At least, results based on longitudinal rather than cross-sectional studies indicate that such decline may not appear until the latter years of old age. While in the early part of the century the notion of a three-generation family was not very prevalent, today it is a reality. Many families face enormous emo- tional and financial struggles to maintain older relatives at home as long as possible. If through research we can determine which types of personal relationships and living arrangements are most beneficial for our old people and their families, we can consider changes in our social policies to enhance these optimal situations. Hormones and Aging The effects of aging on the endocrine system are varied, being marked in some glands and slight or undetectable in others. Of the glands of the endocrine system, the most dramatic changes that occur with increasing age are those related to the sex glands leading to the menopause in women and a decrease in the secretion of testosterone in men. It is apparent in other glands such as the thyroid and adrenal that there is a gradual decrease in function with age. The influence these decreases have may be related to some of the deteriorative changes in mental function and in strength that occur with age. The National Institute on Aging has begun to establish an integrated program of human and animal model studies on endocrine and neuroendocrine changes that occur with age. This program is aimed at characterizing and quantifying many of the changes in endocrine function that occur with age. These studies may provide the basis for understanding the causes and consequences of age related decline in endocrine function. Thus, such studies may provide the means to modify or moderate some of the degeneration or disease changes of endocrine decline or dysfunction that occur with age. Of more immediate concern is whether substitution therapy with replacement hormones or nonhormonal agent moderate the effects of age changes in endo- crine function, or increase the risk of adverse side effects in other tissues or organ systems. The previous controversy over safety of use of oral hypoglycemic drugs to treat diabetics and more recently estrogen replacement therapy in the menopause illustrate the complex and poorly understood interrelationships be- tween functional endocrine decline and the effects of substitution or replacement therapy on target tissues or organs as well as other body systems. Intermediary Metabolism From investigations in the intermediary metabolism program of the NIA, the Institute hopes to find the key to understanding some fundamental mechanisms responsible for overall decline in the capability of an organ, tissue or cell to func- tion properly and to devise means for successful intervention to modify or reverse these changes. One area of interest is the impaired communication between tissues when sugar molecules are absorbed into the blood stream. The presence of sugar 146 is recognized by the pancreas which responds by presenting insulin, which inturn signals other tissues, such as muscle, fat, and liver. Recent experimentalresults indicate that in old rats, there may be a lesion or defect in the processwhich determines the effectiveness of individual molecules of insulin. Furtherwork is underway to determine if the defect is in insulin production or function.Information is also being obtained on age-related changes in collagen, the majorstructural protein of connective tissue. BALTIMORE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF AGING Longitudinal studies, which follow groups of individuals as they age, can helpreveal those aspects of aging that are truly a result of the body's maturing process.The study of the same people over a period of years enables scientists to identifycharacteristics of individuals and environmental factors which may be used topredict the success with which a person ages. Over 650 male volunteers, rangingin age from 20 to 96 years, have participated for nearly twenty years in the Balti-more Study conducted at the Gerontology Research Center, NIA's intramuralresearch facility. The study has provided valuable scientific information.For example, even in elderly people, functional lung damage, caused by heavycigarette smoking, can be almost completely reversed when they stop smoking.Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the more complex functions of asystem in the body decline more rapildy with age than do simpler functions.For example, the muscle strength of the arms and shoulders shows less declinewith a simple task, such as pulling or pushing a stationary object, than doesthe overall ability to use muscle in coordinated movement, such as turning acrank. Another discovery is that diabetes may not be as prevalent in the elderlyas was previously thought. The glucose (sugar) tolerance test which is used todiagnose diabetes was administered to the longitudinal study volunteers, andrevealed that with age the body's ability to handle glucose decreases. Fifty percentof the longitudinal study subjects over 60 showed \"abnormal\" glucose toleranceand would therefore be considered diabetic. Nevertheless, many of them neverhad any diabetic symptoms-excessive loss of weight, general weakness, coma-or complications such as increased coronary disease and atherosclerosis (hardeningof the arteries). Since, in the past, the standard for normality was arrived at byrecording the responses of younger people, such as medical students or hospitalemployees, a great deal of diagnostic error may occur in determining if an olderperson is diabetic. A more realistic standard for glucose tolerance would have tobe age-adjusted. The addition of women to the Baltimore Longitudinal Study is an appropriateway to mark its 20th anniversary, and will enable us to examine sex-linkeddifferences in life expectancy and risk of disease. CONFERENCES AND WORKSHOPS Conferences and workshops offer an emerging Institute the opportunity toidentify areas of special interest or need, while at the same time stimulatingnew and established investigators to view their areas of expertise from the per-spective of aging. These meetings also provide an excellent means to disseminateinformation across disciplines. Alone and in collaboration with the other Institutes,the NIA has conducted or partially supported workshops/conferences in a varietyof areas, including: -Animal (vertebrate) models relevant to processes of aging.-Economics of aging. -Immunology and aging. -Geriatric medicine. -Cell tissue and organ cultures in neurobiology (international workshop).-Epidemiology of aging. -Physical fitness and aging. -Research on health problems of the Black aged; minority aging.-Alzheimer's disease/senile dementia. -Protection of elerly human research subjects.-Aged mammal organ, tissue, and fluids bank; new approaches to agingresearch via cell culture. -Pharmacology of aging. -Autopsies and the pathology of aging. 147 In addition, the NIA, the Fogarty International Center and the World Health Organization had the privilege of cohosting a meeting on the \"Graying of Na- tions\" with the directors of other nations' programs in aging research. RESEARCH ADVANCES Studying Aging in the Laboratory Normal human cells are known to age in a laboratory culture medium. Institute grantees have noticed that cell cultures from individuals suffering from certain life-shortening conditions \"age\" Very rapidly in a test tube by losing various abilities, including the capacity to proliferate. In 1974, the NIA established a cell bank for aging research at the Institute for Medical Research in Camden, N.J. Thus far, more than 161 distinct lines of cultured cells have been acquired from normal donors of both sexes and all ages. Some of these cell cultures are derived from patients with accelerated aging or growth disorders, probably of genetic origin, or from patients with tumors both before and after radiation and chemo- therapy. To meet worldwide research needs for standard cell lines, the Institute has established two special lines of cells: IMR 90, derived from female lung tissue; and IMR 91, from the lungs of a male. These cells lines have been banked in large quantities to assure that they remain available for many decades to researchers studying the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of aging. In addition, over 200 individual human cell lines have been established by NIA laboratories using skin samples taken from Baltimore Longitudinal Study volunteers. At GRC, scientists have effectively demonstrated that the ability of cells to reproduce is impaired with aging. This decline in cell proliferation also appears to contribute to the reduced rate of wound healing sometimes observed in older people. Another example of the decline in cell proliferation with aging is in the immune system. Certain-Though Not All-Functions Do Decline With Age Research indicates that certain brain diseases and a general intellectual decline are not inevitable with aging. However, other studies suggest that certain func- tions do decline late in life. For example, one grantee reports that the elderly are about 50 percent slower than the young in their ability to shift attention among many objects in a field of vision. This finding may have important implications for the elderly in such areas as driving or reading. For example, driving ability could be impaired by the older person's slowness in shifting attention from one item to another: from stoplight to pedestrian, to an approaching car, or perhaps to the policeman in the rear view mirror. Another study by the same grantee shows that the old are as capable as the young of deriving and retaining ideas from meaningful information. But when the amount of information increases and older subjects try to recall it on their own, they are noticeably less able to recall meaningful information than young adults. Other research by scientists at the Gerontology Research Center indicates that learning, memory, and problem-solving ability declines very late in life, even among educated, relatively healthy people. However, for some individuals-even the oldest-there was no decline in learning, memory, and problem-solving per- formance, raising the still unanswered question of why some individuals decline with age and others do not. Mnemonic Devices for Older Learners One way to improve the quality of old age is to provide the elderly with new ways to minimize difficulties in learning and remembering. Researchers at the Gerontology Research Center have devised an effective aid for learning items on a list. The older person can learn a list of words, for example, by mentally picturing his or her residence and visualizing an item from the list at each predetermined, natural sequence of stopping places. These stopping places are effective cues for remembering the words on the list. Older people can readily learn this simple memory scheme because it is based upon well-established habits. It also prevents an overload of information that many older learners might not be able to handle. Future research will hopefully produce a mnemonic device for recalling names that go with familiar faces, a common memory difficulty of the aged. 148 Estrogens and the Postmenopausal TP oman The known dangers of estrogen use in young women-including increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction-suggested that the effects of estrogens on older women be studied as well. NIA contractors have shown that (1) postmeno- pausal women use oral estrogens with surprising frequency; (2) they continue to do so intermittently until well beyond age 80; and (3) in one sampling, 15 percent of 15,500 postmenopausal women were found to use oral estrogens. This figure exceeds earlier estimates of oral estrogen use among 45- to 64-year old women by about two percent. Investigators studying some of these adverse affects on a retirement community population of postmenopausal women aged 57 to 98 found no association between estrogen use and myocardial infarction. However, the low dosages involved and the short duration of estrogen use, plus an already high coronary risk in this age group, may account for this result. There is some evidence that estrogen may prevent or lessen the development of osteoporosis, a softening of bone that leads to hip fractures and other debilitating injuries in many elderly women. Institute grantees are now comparing the risk of hip fracture in older women who do and do not use estrogen to learn whether such a protective effect exists. Other research is exploring the relationship between breast cancer and estrogen use in older women. Studies of this relationship in younger women taking oral contraceptives have revealed no increased risk of breast cancer. The same contractors have shown that while estrogen use did not increase the risk of stroke in 15,500 post menopausal women, there was a statistical association with hypertension at all dose levels in women aged 58 to 98. This is one of the first reports that estrogens predispose older women to hypertension. The finding un- covers a major public health problem since estrogen use among postmenopausal women is so widespread. In the same study, estrogen use was found to be associated with stroke in a subgroup of women aged 70 to 79. But this association does not seem to exist in the absence of hypertension. Another serious consequence of estrogen therapy was suggested by studies of women from the same retirement community who contracted cancer of the uterine lining. They had taken high dosages of a common form of estrogens made from the urine of pregnant mares. The risk decreased when subjects took smaller dosages of estrogens or stopped taking the drugs for intervals of four days or longer. This finding is significant because of the rising number of new prescriptions for this estrogen preparation (from 1.6 million in 1958 to 5 million in 1974), because of estrogen's known ability to cause endometrial cancer, and because of the in- crease between 1969 and 1973 in endometrial cancer among American women. Given this newly reported relationship between estrogen use and endometrial cancer, increasing numbers of American women may be expected to contract endometrial cancer in the near future. Reduced Hormone Response in Aging Man Certain cells in animals, including man, have specialized parts called hormone receptors. These receptors control the cells' ability to respond to specific hormones and other body chemicals. The receptors may be located on the cell's surface or in its interior. At the GRC, members of the longitudinal study have contributed to furthering our information about the body's ability to respond to hormones with age. It was shown for the first time in man that concentrations of a specific cell membrane receptor for a common type of hormones (B-adrenergic agents) decline progressively with age. Eighty-year old subjects have only half as many of these receptors as do twenty-year old subjects. Earlier studies showed similar receptor losses in aging animal tissues. Other results suggest that many animal tissues also lose their ability to respond to various hormones during aging. Thus it appears that loss of hormone receptors is a common part of aging and these losses may be responsible for decreased ability of the body to respond to hormones during aging. Obesity and Long Life A vast medical literature associates obesity in middle and late life with athero- sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, gout, osteoarthritis and gallbladder disease, to name but a few life-threatrning conditions. Yet other major studies, including the Baltimore Longitudinal Study, have been unable to show that mild and moderate obesity, both in middle-aged and older age groups, shortens life span. Further 149 research is needed to elaborate on this surprising result, and determine whether obesity enhances survival in some way that counteracts the recognized hazards of being -overweight. Studies of the same subjects reveal that while their cholesterol levels rose markedly between 1963 and 1971, during the past 6 years the trend has reversed sharply and cholesterol levels dropped. These men also lowered their intake of fat and especially of saturated fatty acids, and increased their intake of poly- unsaturated fat, a shift that may explain the altered cholesterol levels. Biofeedback Applied to Some Problems of Aging The technique of biofeedback-an operant conditioning procedure in which subjects learn to control such physiological processes as heart rate or bowel function-is being investigated in Institute laboratories and applied to some special problems of the elderly. Researchers are using biofeedback to teach patients with angina pectoris to slow their heart rate upon signal. The patient watches a panel of lights while reclining on a hospital bed. A red light means he should lower heart rate, and a yellow light signals when he has done so. Once he begins to show ability to lower heart rate, he is taught to respond without the light panel feedback. While learning heart rate control he is evaluated to see whether he can transfer this skill to mild activity. Finally, after laboratory training is completed, he is tested to see whether he can modulate his heart rate during exercise testing on a treadmill. Urinary incontinence is another special problem correlated with age. Patients with chronic urinary incontinence often have catheters implanted in their bladders, and this increases the risk of infection of the urinary tract. In addition, urinary incontinence is socially disruptive and places many otherwise functional people in extended care facilities because their families cannot provide for their care. A project is now underway to investigate whether patients can learn to control some forms of urinary incontinence using biofeedback techniques. A third project is aimed at improving the rehabilitation of patients who suffered myocardial infarctions. The impatience and overactivity of many of these in- dividuals interfered with their recovery and placed them at some risk for aggravat- ing their cardiac condition. In this study the patients were told about the nature of their illness, asked to develop concrete goals for their own rehabilitation, and encouraged to gradually increase habitual activities. They were also taught to take their pulse to monitor their heart rate as an index of their heart's ability to deal with physical stress. All patients were seen regularly to review their data, and to discuss their clinical progress. Eight patients participated in the study and all were rehabilitated within the limits imposed by their cardiac condition. Exercise in the Elderly Among the greatest costs of aging is declining ability to perform daily activities which contribute not only to personal well-being but to society at large. A variety of studies show how aging undermines physical strength and psycho- motor performance. Other studies show exercise can counteract some of the harm- ful effects of aging. In one project investigators at the Gerontology Research Center measured the blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide elimination of 200 healthy men before, during and after exercise. One finding revealed that the main reason for reduced work capacity in the subjects was loss of muscle tissue. Another finding, according to preliminary data, showed that during heavy exercise such as brisk walking on an inclined treadmill, the secretion of growth hormone is stimulated more in young people than in people over 50 years of age. Growth hormone has been shown to stimulate protein replication (which equates to muscle growth) in the diaphragm of the rat. Researchers hope that this process might someday be demonstrated in humans. Other measurements of light to moderate exercise showed that men in their 60's were as efficient as men in their 20's, although the older men used a higher percentage of their total capacities to perform work or exercise. Hopefully, identi- fication of the factors that affect physical strength and performance may event- ually reveal ways to stop these total capacities from declining with age. Exercise may, on the other hand, be the most effective anti-aging \"pill\" ever discovered. A three-day conference on the role of exercise in preventing physical 150 decline, jointly sponsored by the Institute and the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, re-emphasized that: -Exercise benefits pulmonary and circulatory function, helps preserve bones,maintains body weight, relieves depression and anxiety, and enhances self- esteem. -people of all ages, including the sedentary and the physically handicapped, can benefit from exercise. -one unique study showed marathon runners, who can cover 42 kilometers or 26.2 miles on foot, appear immune to atherosclerosis. The study suggested that factors in the marathon man's lifestyle and diet may contribute to this result. Strenuous Exercise Fends Off Heart Attacks One study of 16,936 men, aged 35 to 74, reveals that those who participated in strenuous sports had fewer heart attacks than those who were more sedentary. The study followed male alumni of Harvard University for 6 to 10 years. Through questionnaires, the subjects described sports participation. Followup questionnaires and death certificates revealed 257 fatal and 315 nonfatal heart attacks. Sports requiring greater total energy output and bursts of output-running,swimming, basketball, handball, and squash-were the most beneficial. More casual sports like golf, bowling, baseball, softball, and volleyball offered the least protection against heart attack. Tennis depended upon how the game was played: a vigorous, competitive game had a high exercise value, while a slow, lazy game ranked low. The researchers then measured the total energy each subject expended in sports plus other activities like stair climbing and walking, and calculated the total calories burned each week. Men who burned fewer than 2,000 kilocalories weekly showed a higher heart attack rate (57.9 per 10,000 person-years of observation) than men who burned 2,000 or more calories weekly (35 .3 heart attacks per 10,000 person-years of observation). Thus, the heart attack rate was 64 percent higher for the less active group. These rates applied regardless of other risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, family history of heart attack, and previous participation in athletics. However, no one should undertake a program of strenuous exercise without supervision. Another study compared the energy output/heart attack risk experience of the Harvard alumni with 3,686 San Francisco longshoremen who were followed for a period of 22 years. Although energy levels were higher for longshoremen, the same trends applied. Longshoremen who spent fewer than 8,500 kilocalories per week had an 80 percent higher risk of fatal heart attack than the men of the same age who expended more energy. Sexual Activity in Later Years Sexual functioning in older males is known to be influenced by degree of sexual vigor throughout the lifespan. For example, sexually active subjects in a study of men participating in the Baltimcre Longitudinal Study of Aging reported a higher frequency of coitus during early marriage and throughout the intervening years than did the least sexually active group. The study of 188 males aged 60 to 79 has identified some previously unrecognized factors which appear to influence sexual functioning. Much sexual inactivity of the older male, for example, stems from apathy or indifference to stimuli which previ- ously caused erotic reactions, and not from negative attitudes about sex. Sexually inactive subjects stated that they felt no pressure to perform, and the vast major- ity had never sought help for their condition. This lack of anxiety made their importance far less disturbing than this condition is commonly assumed to be. Subjects were divided into three groups of least active, moderately active and most active sexually, according to the number of sexual events reported during the preceding year. The least active group averaged 3.8, the moderately active group 20.0, and the most active group 62.3 sexual events for the year. The most active group tended to be strongly committed to religious values, had lived on a farm before age 20, had received post-graduate training, and held pro- fessional and technical jobs, attributes whose significance for sexual functioning remains obscure. 151 On the other hand, age at marriage, number of years married before age 60, age at first coitus, and number of coital partners before age 40 proved independent of sexual functioning. Most subjects considered regular sexual activity important for good health, and most rated their current marital situation as highly successful. However, these factors were also not significantly related to current levels of sexual activity. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS, METABOLISM AND DIGESTIVE DISEASES SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES RELATED TO AGING-1977 The National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases (NIAMDD) is responsible for the conduct and support of research in a wide array of chronic and disabling diseases as well as in some which are associated with a high degree of mortality such as diabetes and kidney disease. Several diseases under the purview of this Institute occur commonly in aged persons and are of considerable concern because of the degree to which they limit activity or may become outright crippling; they increase dependence on others and often require extended hospitalization. Diseases such as osteoarthritis (degenerative, arthritis), osteoporosis, benign prostatic hyperplasia and maturity-onset diabetes afflict many aged persons; they constitute health problems of great magnitude not only through the degree of human suffering which they cause, but also through their social and economic impact. Osteoarthritis Nearly one-half of the population over 55 years of age is affected to some degree by degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis. Survey data from the National Center for Health Statistics indicate that 28 million Americans have some mani- festation of osteoarthritis. The severity of osteoarthritis spans a spectrum from mild symptoms to complete disability depending on the disease and the individual. The NIAMDD's major research efforts in osteoarthritis involve conduct and sup- port, of research to increase our fundamental understanding of the chemical, functional, and structural alterations which occur in joints with advancing age and to develop medical and surgical methods of intervention to prevent or ameliorate this process, to prevent progression of functional or anatomic joint damage maxi- mally, to ease the attendant pain and to preserve motion for the afflicted individual to the greatest extent possible. Eventually if an osteoarthritic joint has lost its function and has been damaged beyond repair so that the individual is crippled, the implantation of artificial joints can restore function in many cases and can give the individual a new lease on active life for many years. Considerable research supported by this Institute is devoted to these latter aspects which lie in the province of orthopedic surgery. Here the research of previous years has made possible the implantation and use of artificial hip joints, a means of prosthetic intervention which has become increasingly successful in recent years. Other research efforts involve the development of artificial joints for knees, elbows, shoulders and fingers, all of which are showing increasing progress. Specific facets of this research involve mechanical, physical, and chemical proper- ties of the materials used in these protheses, their compatibility with human tissues, their durability and wear and tear properties, and their optimal size and configuration. Of equal importance is the method of fixation of these artificial joints in the patient's bone ends, and the cement used for this purpose. Other research involves the surgical implantation of these devices, the clinical results of total joint replacement, and-an important aspect as the longevity of patients with osteoarthritis increases-the functional durability of these prostheses with the passage of time. New initiatives concerning arthritis are underway within the Institute following passage of the National Arthritis Act (Public Law 93-640) and the recommenda- tions of the National Arthritis Commission in 1976. During 1977 NIAMDD has awarded grants in support of 15 new multipurpose arthritis centers. These re- sources will consist of the facilities of a single institution or a consortium of cooperating institutions through which cooperating health personnel can demon- strate and foster prompt and effective application of available knowledge and de- velop urgently needed new knowledge. In addition to ongoing research in arthritis, each center will have or will develop a balanced program in education, research and community related activities. These centers will have or will develop special 152 competence in one or more areas; osteoarthritis will be one of these areas receiving special emphasis. In 1978 the Institute, within the limitations of available resources. will further expand its research activities related to osteoarthritis and orthopedic surgery and will further increase the number of multipurpose arthritis centers. Also, in col- laboration with the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgery, the Institute is organizing a workshop which will take place in May 1978 which will be devoted to the various aspects of mechanical failure in total joint replacement. Part of this workshop will be devoted to a discussion of the directions of future studies and research needs in this area. Osteoporosis This bone-weakening condition occurs characteristically and frequently in elderly postmenopausal women, and to a lesser extent in men in the sixth decade and beyond. This disorder is the underlying cause for most fractures of spinal vertebrae seen among the aged and leads to the many fractures of the hip which disable elderly women in particular and in many cases initiate the downhill course of their health in advaced age. The Institute's research activities are aimed pri- marily at the production of new knowledge about bone formation, structure and metabolism which can form the rational basis for devising new means of therapy and, hopefully, prevention of osteoporosis. Three major factors appear to play a role in the causation of this demineralizing disorder of the skeleton: a decline of the tissue-building sex hormones with advancing age, a lack of available calcium for constant remineralization of bone, and progressive skeletal atrophy which comes with reduced physical exercise among the aged. Ongoing research is aimed at defining precisely the contributions of these and other factors to emergence of the disorder and to its progression. The possibility that bone formation might be stimulated in.the thinned bones of patients by fluoride salts is also being examined (in conjunction with increases in calcium and phosphorus in the diet) in a clinical study supported by the Institute. In 1978 the Institute will continue at an accelerated pace its research activities related to osteoporosis. To stimulate new ideas and to discuss specific approaches to overcome current impediments to more rapid progress, in February 1978 the In- stitute will convene a \"Strategy Workshop for Osteoporosis Research\" in Bethesda which will be cosponsored by the National Institute of Dental Research and the National Institute on Aging. The organizers of this workshop, Dr. G. Donald Whedon of NIAMDD, and Dr. R. P. Heaney of Creighton University, Omaha, Nebr., another well-known research worker in the field of osteoporosis, have struc- tured this strategy workshop specifically for the purpose of discussing any possible new research approach which can rationally and productively be brought to bear on a disorder of utmost importance to our aged population in which more rapid progress is called for. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) This disorder involves a benign enlargement of the prostate glknd of men which encroaches upon the urethra and produces bladder outlet obstruction with advanc- ing age. Recent studies have suggested that more than 80 percent of men over the age of 40 have some degree of bladder outlet obstruction secondary to BPH, and it is estimated that more than 10 percent of these men will eventually require a major surgical procedure for its correction. Secondary infection may result from bladder outlet obstruction which in turn can lead to infection of the bladder and upper urinary tract and accompanying urinary incontinence of varying degrees. Complications of the condition include infection with damage to the kidneys and a predisposition to urinary stone formation. Because in the past this area has not received optimal research attention by the qualified scientific community, in 1975 the Institute organized an international workshop to review and evaluate ongoing research efforts and to identify and stimulate new directions in BPH research. Consequently, new interest has been engendered. The Institute is presently supporting fundamental and integrated clinical research involving both animals and man and new interdisciplinary studies have been stimulated. These research efforts have strengthened the belief that the development of BPH in the aging individual is the result of aberrant hormonal balance. One direction of research pursues a better understanding of the action of androgens (male hormones) and their antagonists in the prostate. Evidence is accumulating that male and female hormones can (and do) exert competing effects on prostatic tissue. Research in another direction has shown that BPH can be 153 produced in dogs by administration of steroid compounds, a promising advance since heretofore an experimental animal model was not availalbe to help provide insight into the pathogenesis of this disorder. Urolithiasis Stone formation in the urinary tract affects many ages but especially men in the older age group and persons with indwelling catheters such as patients who have had strokes or who have sluggish urine flow. In 1977, this area received new emphasis through funding of five specialized centers of research in urolithiasis. The research conducted in these centers covers many aspects of urinary stone formation from physical chemistry through epidemiology and formulation of rational therapy. In 1978 the Institute will continue its research activities in urolithiasis. Maturity Onset Diabetes Today's clinician distinguishes between two disease entities when he thinks of diabetes: (1) juvenile diabetes, a serious and acute disease which is life-threatening when untreated, and even when treated reduces the life span of the patient con- siderably and leads to progressively grave clinical complications with the passage of time, and (2) maturity onset diabetes, a considerably less acute disorder which emerges in middle age or old age in genetically predisposed individuals. The latter disorder, maturity onset diabetes, is mentioned here briefly primarily because its long-term complications related to the blood vessels, peripheral nervous system, and kidneys, particularly afflict the aged. Some authorities believe that the impact of this disorder on the aged individual may depend to a large extent on the degree of success in controlling and managing the diabetes. The majority of patients with this disorder can be maintained in a symptom-free state by adequate exercise and a reduction of their body weight to the lean side of normal, and only a minority requires diet or insulin therapy. In 1977 research related to diabetes was expanded significantly by the Institute consonant with the recommendations of the National Diabetes Act and the National Diabetes Plan proposed by the National Diabetes Commission. Research grant support was greatly expanded and a new type of diabetes research and train- ing center was initiated. In 1978 research in diabetes will see further expansion through the provision of additional diabetes research and training centers. The NIAMDD is acutely aware of the tremendous public health problems most of the above diseases represent and of the considerable social and economic burden they place on our aged citizens. There will continue to be considerable commitment on the Institute's part to sustaining the long-term efforts required to make significant improvements in the outlook for these diseases of such importance to the aged. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM ACTIVITIES DURING 1977 RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH AND AGING The incidence of psychopathology, in general, and depression, in particular, rises with age; a conservative estimate is that 10 to 25 percent of the over-65 population suffers from significant mental impairment. Those over 65 comprise 28 percent of the resident patients in State or county mental hospitals, and approximately 80 percent of those over 65 in nursing or personal care homes have sme degree of mental impairment. Death rates by suicide are the highest in the 55-plus age group, 19.9 per 100,000, as compared with 12.7 per 100,000 for all ages. In order to focus attention to this area, the Center for Studies of the Mental Health of the Aging (CSMHA) was established in 1975. The major role of CSMHA is to stimulate, coordinate, and support research, training, and technical assistance efforts relating to aging and mental health. CSMHA was involved in an intensive planning effort which included national conferences in research, training and services. The supplemental appropriation of 1977 provided $2 million to be admin- istered by CSMHA for the support of research grants and contracts. The projects begun in 1977 will be continued in 1978, and new research as well as training projects will be initiated. The formal establishment of CSMHA as an operating unit of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) will take place in early 1978. 154 Including projects supported under the $2 million supplemental appropriation,support of all aging projects in the Institute for 1977 was: Research: Primary ------------------------------------------ $4, 292 Training: Primary --------------------------------------------- 629, 857 Partial focus on aging population (includes other population groups) ------------------------------------------- 1, 280, 099 1 Primary projects are those in which aging Is the main focus of the research and train- ing. In addition, the progress of other projects is monitored by staff of the Center forStudies of the Mental Health of the Aging for their potential contribution to aging. Theintent of the investigator may not include a contribution to the field of aging, but staff judgment is that the project contains a significant aging component. 2 Aging is not main focus, but is Important accompanying focus. 3 Although aging is not explicit focus of research, findings of research could be applicable to aging and mental health. The Center for Studies of the Mental Health of The Aging is the NIMH focal point for aging. It has program responsibility in the following areas: I. Research CSMHA supports those studies which have a primary focus on the mental health and illness implications of the aging process and of old age. It supports a wide ranging, multidisciplinary set of studies which have both theoretical as well as policy or applied implications. These include: A. Mental Health of the Aging and Etiology, Diagnosis, Course, and Prevention of Mental Disorders in Later Life (1) Studies of the psychological, social, and biomedical factors (and their interplay) that affect mental health and mental illness in later life. (2) Clinical and diagnostic studies of the nature and types of mental disorders in later life. (3) Studies to assess and measure the extent of cognitive, affective, and social function impairment in later life. (4) Studies of the onset, course, and natural history of mental illness in later life; and (5) Studies of developmental life crises, stress, adaptation, and morale in later life with special attention to the prevention of mental disorders. B. Treatment and Delivery of Mental Health Services (1) Treatment of mental disorders in later life. (2) Coordination of mental health and other aging services in the broader health and community services systems. (3) Services provision to special populations. (4) Structuring of services; and (5) Research into new types and more effective services. C. Program Development, Social Policy, and Social Problems Research in Mental Health and Aging (1) Institutional program development and alternatives to institutionalization. (2) Formal and informal community support systems. (3) Financing/reimbursement mechanisms. (4) Policy and legal or administrative dimensions in technical assistance and program design. (5) Models for research utilization, and (6) Models of technical assistance for research development. II. Training The Center for Studies of the Mental Health of the Aging works closely with the NIMH Division of Manpower and Training Programs, with a specific focus of filling gaps in training for the delivery of clinical services to aged persons and in 155 developing research scientists to study specifically mental health and illness in the aging. In the clinical area the grants are focused on providing support for the development, implementation, and evaluation of innovative training models and curricula which will concentrate on clinical services to aged persons with mental health problems. CSMHA is particularly interested in funding clinical training models which will be of national significance. The following types of training projects are of special interest to CSMHA. A. Training for Service Delivery to Aging Persons with Mental Health Problems (1) Geriatric Career Development Models.-Projects which will assist in the prep- aration of mental health professionals, particularly, but not exclusively, psy- chiatrists and psychologists, who desire further specialization for roles in the delivery of services to the elderly. (2) Continuing Education Models.-(a) Projects providing training for qualified mental health professionals who wish to develop their capabilities in dealing with the mental health problems of older persons, with particular consideration given to in-service training projects for all levels of Community Mental Health Centers' staff who want to acquire these capabilities; (b) continuing education, in-service training or special training projects providing short-term training for community- based professional health care providers who deal with aging persons with mental health problems, e.g., physicians, nurses, etc.; and (c) continuing education for community persons (within the formal as well as informal support systems) who may need special training to understand and refer older persons for assistance with their mental health problems. (3) Model Training Curricula and Special Personnel Development Projects.- Model curriculum development, conferences and studies focusing on problems and issues in training and personnel development, and deployment in dealing with mental health problems of the aging. B. Research Training National research service awards, including individual fellowships and institu- tional awards at the predoctoral or postdoctoral levels, to provide support for the training of research scientists in the areas of mental health and aging. C. Technical Assistance The Center for Studies of the Mental Health of the Aging provides technical assistance for the development of research, training, and services for the purpose of enhancing the mental health of aging persons. Technical assistance through consultation is available for the stimulation and development of research and training proposals focused on the mental health of the aging. Major technical assistance efforts, however, are focused on public and private agencies at regional, State, and local levels with the objective of improving programs affecting the mental health of aging persons and especially the delivery of services to aged persons by community mental health centers. For this latter effort, the CSMHA specialist has worked with regional offices and with individual community mental health centers. This has been especially important due to Public Law 94-63 which mandates services to the aged by community mental health centers. Technical assistance is carried out through consultation, active participation at national, regional, and local meetings and conferences, the development of publications or other written materials and the dissemination of these publica- tions and other information. As a focall point for the activities on mental health of the aging at the Institute, the CSMHA specialists on the mental health of aging handled inquiries from professionals and public alike, and much time and. effort are spent in responding to such inquiries. In 1977, the Institute, through CSMHA, issued the following publications: Blank, Marie L. \"Research on the Mental Health of the Aging, 1960-1976.\" DHEW Publication No. (ADM) 77-379. (An overview and summaries of NIMH extramural research projects in aging.) Dobrof, Rose, and Litwak, Eugene, \"Maintenance of Family Ties of Long-term Care Patients: Theory and Guide to Practice.\" DHEW Publication No. (ADM) 77-400. Steury, Steven, and Blank- Marie L. eds., \"Readings in with Older People.\" DHEW Pub' lication No. (ADM) 77-409. For 1978, the following publications are planned by the Institute: (a) Proceedings of CSMHA's conferences on goals for research , training, and services. 24-084 0 -78 -11 1,56 (b) A monograph on the mental health aspects of institutional living bya consumer who lives in a long-term care facility. (c) Reports on a sampler of NIMH extramural research and serviceprojects on mental health and aging. (d) \"Rape and Older Women: A Guide to Prevention and Protection.\"Also in 1977, CSMHA responded to many requests from community mentalhealth centers for program descriptions which they could adapt for their own usein developing programs mandated under Public Law 94-63. For this reason,during 1977 and 1978, descriptions of eight community mental health centerprograms serving the aging will be prepared and disseminated. Center programsselected represent different approaches of models to mental health care of theaged. As these descriptions are completed, they will be made available startingin spring of 1978 as a continuous effort of the technical assistance program. D. Collaborative Activities with National Institute on Aging, Administration onAging, and Other Agencies 1. Staff of the Center for Studies of the Mental Health of the Aging serves on inter-and intra-agency committees on.-Policy, home health services, education/trainingin long-term care, Native Americans, community support systems, retirement,mental health services, training, research, and rural mental health. A variety of co-funding mechanisms has been used between NIMH and other institutes or agen-cies for the joint support of research projects, training projects, and conferences.2. Administration on Aging/NIMH Interagency Agreement.-In 1977 an inter-agency agreement between the Administration on Aging and NIMH was signed. Itcommits the agencies to a mutual program of collaboration in the following areas:deinstitutionalization of aged mental hospital patients, consultation and educationservices, disaster assistance, joint planning by area agencies on aging and communi-ty mental health centers, in-service training in mental health and aging, technicalassistance, research and demonstration, and followup to the Committee on MentalHealth and Illness of the Elderly. 3. National Institute on Aging.-A considerable array of formal and informalrelationships exists between the NIMH Center for Studies of the Mental Healthof the Aging and the National Institute on Aging. The two organizations haveworked out an arrangement by which research applications of interest to bothorganizations are dually assigned. Following each assignment, responsibility isgiven to the Institute having the greater interest in the project.In 1977 NIMH, through CSMHA, collaborated with the National Institute onAging and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseasegand Stroke in the planning and support of an international conference on thebiology of Alzheimer's disease/senile dementia. The proceedings of this conferencewill soon be published. NIMH, through CSMHA, is taking lead responsibility for1978 followup, international conference on treatment psychosocial and policy as-pects of Alzheimer's disease/senile dementia. This pioneering effort should succeedin heightening scientific concern with all aspects of the problems in this very im-portant but largely neglected area. 4. Secretary's Committee on Mental Health and Illness of the Elderly.-This com-mittee, established under Public Law 94-63, completed its deliberations in 1977.Committee management activities were provided by the Center for Studies of theMental Health of the Aging, and financial support for the Committee's activitieswas provided by NIMH, the National Institute on Aging, and the Administrationon Aging. The committee reviewed the state-of-the-art and made recommendationsin the following areas: prevention, services, research, training, and minorities. Thereport has been reviewed in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,and will be transmitted to Congress in 1978. OFFICE OF EDUCATION 1977 ACTIVITIEs AFFECTING THE AGING The Commissioner of Education and the Commissioner on Aging signed a jointworking agreement on December 22-23, 1976, the purpose of which is \"to promotethe more effective and efficient use of the resources available to the Office of Edu-cation and the Administration on Aging in order to maximize the educationalopportunities for older persons.\" The agreement defines 19 goals and objectives 157 which are being implemented through a series of strategies delineated in the agreement. The strategies which call for action by both agencies include: -Establish an interagency committee to continue providing leadership and coordination in carrying out the agreement. -Support and participate with the National Institute of Education in estab- lishing and operating an Interagency Panel on Research and Development in Adulthood. -Promote the appointment of representatives of the elderly on education councils and of educators on councils for the aging. -Promote the development of policies and programs designed to eradicate age-ism, stereotyping, and discrimination. -Encourage and support the use of volunteers of all ages in education activities for older persons. -Encourage the development of agreements between agencies at regional, State, area and local levels; and -Support joint research and demonstration projects and the development of technical assistance materials. Copies of the agreement were distributed by the Commissioners to the State and local networks of each agency and program managers were encouraged to take similar steps at those levels. Information from States and local activities indi- cate that agreements are being made and/or strengthened. An interagency committee was established in July 1977 and on September 7, 1977, the Commissioner of Education and the Commissioner on Aging met with the committee to discuss implementation procedures and priorities. In carrying out its responsibility, the interagency committee meets regularly and is making plans for the preparation of the first annual report to the commissioners. Other working agreements have been made between particular programs in the Office of Education and the Administration on Aging. These include: Community education, vocational home economics, right-to-read, and ACTION. Office of Education major program activities for the older American are con- centrated in four areas: Adult education, community services and continuiug education, public library services, captioned films and television. Additionally, the Bureau of Occupational and Adult Education is developing strategies for BOAE administered programs in order to implement a policy to increase educational services for older persons. ADULT EDUCATION The adult education program authorized under the \"Adult Education Act of 1966,\" as amended, provides undereducated adults (persons 16 years of age and older) an opportunity to continue their education to at least the level of comple- tion of secondary school and makes available the means to secure training that will enable them to become more employable, productive, and responsible citizens. The program is a State grant operation administered by Sate education agencies according to State plans submitted to the U.S. Office of Education and appioved by the U.S. Commissioner of Education. States are allocated grants to pay the Federal share of the cost of establishing or expanding adult education programs in local educational agencies and private nonprofit agencies. The matching requirement for the State Grant Program is 90 percent Federal funds and 10 percent State and/or local funds. The regulation of the adult education State grant program requires an annual review of priorities in the field in order to examine and update currently estab- lished priorities, identify new areas of national concern, and recommend new priorities for programs of national significance. For fiscal years 1976 and 1977, the following priority statement was distributed to the States for their guidance: Involvement of Older Citizens in Adult Education The Congress, the National Advisory Council on Adult Education, and other interested persons and groups have recommended to us (Office of Education) that we find ways of improving cducational opportunities for adults who are 45 years of age or older. The adult performance level study also confirms that many older persons have a critical need for acquiring functional competencies and life coping skills. Of those persons who ranked in the lowest APL competency level, the study's findings show the largest percentage of persons in the age group of 60-65, followed by the age group of 50-59. In response to this need, it is recommended that special consideration be givento assessing the educational needs of older citizens, to designing delivery systemsfor counseling and instruction, to developing curricula to provide competency-based adult education for older citizens, or to evaluating the effectiveness andimpact of programs for the elderly. Established community facilities and programsshould be utilized to involve older persons in adult education through cooperativeefforts with community agencies and voluntary groups that serve the elderly,such as: Senior centers, nutrition programs, nursing homes, home-maker-healthaid, and other home-based services.Reports from the States indicated the following age distribution of participantsin the adult education program during 1976. The number of participants isexpected to increase in 1977. Age group: Estimate Percentage16 to 24------------------------------------ 687, 654 4225 to ------------------------------- 259, 1645 to 54-- --------------------------------- 139, 782 855 to 64------------------------------------- 67, 277 465 and over---------------------------------- 50, 463 3 Public Law 93-29 amended the \"Adult Education Act\" by authorizing theCommissioner to make grants to State and local educational agencies or otherpublic or private nonprofit agencies for programs to further the purpose of thisact by providing educational programs for elderly persons whose ability to speakand read the English language is limited and who live in an area with a culturedifferent that their own. Such programs shall be designed to equip such elderlypersons to deal successfully with the practical problems in their everyday life,including the making of purchases, meeting their transportation and housingneeds, and complying with governmental requirements such as those for obtainingcitizenship, public assistance and social security benefits, and housing. However,to date no appropriations have been requested or made to implement this section. COMMUNITY SERVICE AND CONTINUING EDUCATION Title I of the \"Higher Education Act of 1965\" (Public Law 89-329, as amended)authorizes grants to the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, AmericanSamoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The intent ofthese grants is to strengthen the community service programs of colleges anduniversities for the purpose of assisting in the solution of community problemsthrough the continuing education of adults. The program is administered ineach State by an agency designated by the Governor, under a State plan approvedby the U.S. Commissioner of Education. The State agency establishes programpriorities and approves and funds institutional proposals. Funds are providedon a 66% Federal and 33% non-Federal basis. A community services projectunder this act means an educational program, activity or service, includingresearch programs and university extension or continuing education offerings.The State grant program has supported a number of projects designed to assistthe older American. During 1977, more than 165,000 individual participants wereinvolved in 69 projects (including multiproblem areas) in 36 States at a cost ofapproximately $1,121,378 in Federal funds. Activities supported by these fundsincluded special programs to meet educational needs of the aging, legal aid andhousing assistance, professional and paraprofessional gerontological human rela-tions training for those providing care and services to the elderly.Special projects, authorized by section 106, permits the Commissioner to reserve10 percent of the funds appropriated in order to suppoit special projects whichare designed to seek solutions to regional and national problems brought aboutby technological change. Such special projects are limited to demonstration orexperimental efforts. Projects must be based on a design for and the implementa-tion of organized continuing education activity for adults. In 1977, two projectsfor the aging received final renewals at a total cost of $58,851. A renewal awardof $45,487 was made to the Maricopa County Community College District inArizona for their project, \"Six Dimensions for People Over Sixty.\" This statewideproject involving six community colleges has targeted services to senior adults.Each college has developed and will operate separate programs focusing on adifferent part of the senior adult population and its continuing education needs.Individual projects have used the mass media and direct instructional approaches. 159 In addition, 813,364 was awarded as a final renewal to the University of Ten- nessee (Nashville) for \"Development of an Institutional Model for Community Service and Continuing Education for the Elderly.\" Ways and means have now been searched out to increase higher education access for the elderly. During this year, several processes will be further developed and then all will be tested. A consortium of four colleges and universities in Tennessee (Dyersburg State Com- munity College, East Tennessee State University, Tennessee Technical University, and the University of Tennessee) are conducting this project. A new 1977 funding was awarded the Institute on Aging at Portland State University in Portland, Oreg. A first year funding of $71,000 will initiate a demonstration model to help solve work-related problems of middle-aged and older workers. The project will identify alternative work roles and leisure options, develop a curriculum, test and evaluate the processes, and then synthesize and diffuse the products nationwide. Total appropriations for fiscal year 1977 were $14,125,000. Of this sum, $1,300,- 000 was reserved by the Commissioner for special projects, with the remainder, $12,825,000 being distributed to the States and territories. Total appropriations for fiscal year 1977 were $14,125,000. Of this sum, $1,300,000 was reserved by the Commissioner for special projects, with the remainder, $12,825,000 being distributed to the States and territories. PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES Library and information services for the aging are supported by the Office of Education through projects funded under the \"Library Services and Construction Act\" (LSCA). In fiscal year 1977, numerous public library projects made educa- tional, informational, and recreational materials and activities widely available to senior citizens living both independently and in institutional settings. Since the elderly reader represents one of the highest user groups of public libraries (according to a 1973 LSCA-supported national study) and \"aging\" is a special project area designated in LSCA program guidelines, libraries are actively and creatively serving this vital and often neglected segment of the population. Librarians are responding to the social, economic, and physiological problems of the aging in many ways. By providing information and education on aging to professionals and laymen working with senior citizens, and by fostering coopera- tion among agencies concerned with the elderly's needs, the libraries contribute substantially to the achievement of a positive attitude towards the aged. Library- sponsored preretirement counseling and information has eased the transition from full-time work to productive and satisfying leisure for many older adults. Involvement of the elderly in the planning process, employment of senior citi- zens in programs specifically designed to serve this age group, volunteer work, and participation on library boards and advisory councils are all means by which li- braries utilize the time and talents of the elderly for mutual benefit. In recognition of the growing number of older Americans in our population, library interest in service to this group is also increasing and a greater awareness of the types of services and materials desired by older persons is needed in the library field. OE had addressed itself to this need through publication of a dissem- ination sourcebook which contains examples of many successful library programs in operation across the country. Among the programs described in \"Library Programs Worth Knowing About\" are some excellent examples of special projects for the aging which hopefully will act as a stimulus to the initiation and further development of similar projects. OE has also applied itself to furthering cooperative ties with other Federal agencies in order to strengthen the services provided for senior citizens. As a result of the aforementioned joint agreement, some State library agencies and local public libraries have established cooperative activities among existing State and community agencies for the benefit of older persons. Working with and through other Federal programs operating at the local level, libraries expand and enhance the total array of services being offered. At local nutrition sites, supported by Federal funds from the Administration on Aging, libraries have provided education and entertainment through books, audio-visual presentations, discussions, etc., and information through consumer pamphlets, tax forms, applications for various government benefits, etc. Libraries have also provided the forum for National Endowment for the Humanities' programs that delve into social issues of special concern to elderly citizens. Cooperating with national, State, and local community groups has also proven effective in providing library services to older people. Through organizations such 160 as the American Association of Retired Persons and senior citizens groups, librariesexperience the benefits of working with active senior citizens and can therebykeep abreast of the special needs and desires of the elderly.Providing the special information older people need is a library responsibilitythat takes many forms. Lending and reference services, along with immediate in-formation and referral (I & R) services. connect the elderly with front-line com-munity agencies and governmental programs (for example, social security,medicare, medicaid, veterans' programs, etc.) that provide for their well-beingand indeed their survival. I & R services in general, and those specifically designedfor the aging population, are rapidly increasing in number. Cognizant of theelderly's special information needs, libraries are developing innovative I & Rservices such as the OASIS (Older American Special Information Services) programin California in which public libraries used LSCA funds to implement an I & Rservice delivered to rural areas from a roving van. The van is staffed with personnelknowledgeable about community agencies, specially those concerning the elderly'swelfare, and equipped with communications devices which provide contact withthe main library for additional resources. The resource collections of some libraries have also been expanded to includespecialized \"Life Skills and Coping\" collections. These materials are made readilyaccessible in neighborhood branch libraries and offer adults of all ages survival andcrisis information and education in easily understandable formats.Since the educational background of senior citizens is as varied as that of othercross sections of the population, ranging from illiterate to highly skilled, librariesoffer learning opportunities in a large number of ways. Adult basic education,including literacy instruction, taught in groups or on a one-to-one basis, reachesmany older persons who need these important skills to make their retirementyears more satisfying, enable them to cope with life's demands and become lessdependent on others. For the increasing number of elderly citizens pursuing alifelong learning pattern, library-centered independent learning programs offer abroad range of interests and are geared to individual study goals. For instance,retired and senior citizens are taking advantage of cultural enrichment and con-tinuing education offered by \"learn your way\" centers in New York, Brooklyn,and Queens Borough public libraries. By making appointments to confer with\"learning advisors,\" specially trained librarians who help patrons find informationor special materials, these people can be put in touch with a wide range of resourcesand be given continuing assistance on whatever their current interests may be.Learning and recreational interests can also be pursued by the older person byparticipating as an active member of the community in regular library programs.These programs include discussions, films, arts and craft demonstrations, programson health concerns, exhibits of senior citizens' hobbies, forums on consumerissues, etc. One LSCA program in Louisiana brings classical music-opera,symphony, and chamber music-performances to senior citizens in isolated ruralareas. Many library programs are brought directly to retirement and seniorcitizen centers and, in some cases, the elderly are provided transportation to thelibrary for special programs. Librarians and volunteers, often older adults them-selves, make person-to-person visits to the homebound, residents of nursinghomes, and the aged in State-supported institutions.The approximately 5 percent of senior citizens who reside in institutions are alsoserved by libraries. An LSCA project in the Woodville State Hospital in Pennsyl-vania addresses the need for effective communicaton skills in long-term agedresidents of psychiatric hospitals. Operating under the theme \"There's a WorldOut There,\" project librarians developed special library services and programs toreawaken skills in reading, writing, observation, listening, and oral communica-tion. All types of media are utilized in this effort to convey a sense of reality to theinstitution's residents. Such use of audio-visual materials has been shown to be aneffective way of reaching geriatric populations. Travel films, old-time radio shows,cassette recordings, etc., provided by the public library also bring pleasure to theelderly who have much leisure time. In addition to audio-visual materials, special equipment is made available bylibraries to facilitate reading opportunities for the blind and physically handi-capped, a large percentage of whom are aged. LSCA and Library of Congressprograms complement each other in serving the elderly handicapped with talkingbooks, Braille, and other special reading materials loaned through a network of 154regional and subregional libraries for the blind and physically handicappedthroughout the country. Those elderly persons disadvantaged both by physicalhandicaps and by a limited ability to speak English can also receive library service 161 in the form of talking books, large print materials, recordings and reading aids, all in their mother tongue. Older Americans from all ethnic backgrounds are served with special bilingual programs and services that recognize their diverse needs. Outreach programs bring information, education, survival skills, cultural pride and communication cap- abilities within the reach of bilingual cltizens. In one program in Texas, for example, the service included a Spanish-English large print card with the phone numbers of important community service organizations (police, fire, social security office, ambulance, etc.) distributed for free by the library that produced It. Another bilingual project,' the \"Asian Community Library,\" located ia California, serves all members of its multiethnic population, but the bilingual books, magazines, films, etc. have special significance for the aged clients who strongly desire to maintain ties with their homelands and cultures. Preserving the cultural heritage of ethnic groups and the history of geographical locales is another library activity in which the aging play a prominent role. The talents, memories, and insight of older persons are tapped by many library- sponsored oral history projects, some of which are also bilingual. An important feature in the gathering of oral history tapes and memorabilia collections is the unifying effect such an activity has on persons separated by many generations. Sharing past and present experiences can be meaningful to both young and old as demonstrated by an oral history project in Vermont which used an intergenera- tional approach. Entitled \"Young People Save Yesterday,\" the project employed high school students, trained by the library in techniques of interviewing and preservation, to conduct extensive interviews with the oldest members of the community. By promoting interaction among different generations, the project had positive impact: the elderly felt pride in the contribution only they could make to this effort and the students gained in self-awareness and ability to relate to older people. Serving persons of all generations often necessitates tailoring activities to better serve a particular age group. For example, public and State library outreach programs which send bookmobiles out to isolated rural areas and to poverty pockets in the city have been, in some cases, specially adapted for use by the aged population. An LSCA grant in Ohio provided for a custom-designed bookmobile which facilitated service to elderly readers in Cleveland's senior day-care centers, nutrition centers, and other locations. A hydraulic lift that raises patrons into the bookmobile makes the \"Senior Bookshelf\" accessible even to readers confined to wheelchairs. Another library delivery system, \"books-by-mail,\" also has notable impact on elderly persons whose mailbox can connect them with free, prepaid mailings of selected readings, framed art prints, recordings, etc. Some libraries have made this popular service even more suitable for the elderly's needs by not only provid- ing large print books, but also large print material selection catalogs. These examples illustrate the basic goal and concept of public library service to older Americans: making library materials, services, and programs available in all usable formats and providing them in the most convenient ways for the client. The 1973 amendments to the \"Older Americans Act\" included opportunities for strengthening library services to older adults through a new LSCA title IV, \"Older Readers Services.\" With no funds for the new title, special services for the aging continue to be provided fromn funding available from title I, \"Library Services\" of the \"Library Services and Construction Act.\" CAPTIONED FILMS AND TELEVISION Under the \"Education of the Handicapped Act,\" part F (Public Law 91-230, as amended) films and television are captioned for the deaf. The program pro- vides a free loan service of captioned theatrical movies to groups of deaf indi- viduals across the Nation. A considerable number of the people served by this program are over age 65. Of great importance is the extension of the film program to include captioned television. Captioned television programs may reach as many as 5 million hearing impaired individuals over the age of 65. Public television captioning has taken two forms: \"open captions\" which are visible to all viewers and \"closed captions\" which are visible only on sets and stations with decoding devices. The open captioned rebroadcast of the ABC evening news which was begun in November 1971 is the most extensive of these programs. The Bureau of Education for the Handicapped has expended over $2 162 million since its inception on this program. The current funding level which in-cludes the captioning cost of ZOOM, a children's program, and other special pro-grams for the hearing impaired is $573,141. Since 1973, the Bureau of Education for the Handicapped has developed, inconjunction with PBS, a closed system of captioning. This system will make itpossible for hearing impaired persons to have a wide variety of captioned televisionprograming that will not interfere with the normal viewing habits of the generalpublic. The system has been approved by the FCC. Current efforts are directedto the development of the decoders for the home television set and the deliveryof encoder equipment to place the captions into the system.The deaf and hard of hearing population is estimated at 13.4 million. A largepercentage of this population is made up of older Americans whose hearing hasdeteroriated with age. These individuals are a prime audience for captioned tele-vision. OTHER PROGRAMS Right-to-Read The national reading improvement program is authorized under title VII ofPublic Law 93-380 as amended by Public Law 94-194. The \"right to read\" effortcurrently provides for reading assistance and instruction for children, youths, andadults, as well as funds for State leadership and relies heavily on the use of olderAmericans as volunteers.In fiscal year 1977, the right to read effort continued to fund the National Re-tired Teachers' Association's reading academy project. This project is designedto provide reading assistance and instruction to in-school as well as out-of-schoolyouths and adults, utilizing volunteers as tutors.The right to read effort has a \"memorandum of understanding\" with the olderAmericans volunteer programs, ACTION. The purpose of this memorandum ofunderstanding is to indicate the intent of the right to read effort and the office ofolder Americans volunteer programs to work cooperatively in improving the de-livery of reading assistance and instruction through maximum involvement ofolder American volunteers in reading and literacy programs sponsored by theright to read effort. Consumers' Education The Consumers' Education Program, authorized by title IV, section 407 of the\"Education Amendments of 1974\" (Public Law 93-380) provides funds to stimu-late in both school environments and community settings new approaches to con-sumers' education efforts through competitive contracts and grants. These awardsare used for research, demonstration, pilot projects, training, and the developmentand dissemination of information on curricula. In addition, funds may be used todemonstrate, test, and evaluate these and other consumers' education aztivities.Fiscal year 1977 was the second funding year for this program and the Officeof Education has continued its support for projects addressing the consumer needsof the elderly. Thirteen of the 57 programs funded included the elderly among thetarget groups to be served. However, only two of the thirteen programs dealtextensively with the elderly. Some of the activities were directed towards creatingmore effective linkages among older Americans and senior centers to carry outconsumers' education workshops directed toward older people and strengtheningthe peer-advising system by developing bilingual miniprograms on a variety ofconsumer topics related to the elderly. Community Schools The community schools program, authorized by title IV, section 405, PublicLaw 93-380, providcs grants to State and local educational agencies for programsto stimulate further community education through awards for educational,cultural, recreational and other related community services. Additional awardsare made to institutions of higher education to encourage the training of personsto plan and operate community education programs.In order for any community to receive Federal funding under this program,its project must meet eight minimum elements, including the potential to serveall age groups in the community including the elderly. Forty-eight local educa-tion agency projects were funded in fiscal year 1976 and 48 projects were fundedin fiscal year 1977. All of the projects may include academic, educational, socialand recreational programs for the elderly. 163 Two agreements of understanding have been signed by the U.S. Commissioner of Education and the U.S. Commissioner on Aging pledging close cooperative arrangements between the Administration on Aging and the U.S. Office of Education/Community Education Program. These agreements encourage greater utilization of schools for services to the elderly as well as greater volunteer oppor- tunities for senior citizens. A steering committee on community education and aging comprised of national leaders in both areas has been established and is exploring further cooperative efforts. Women's Educational Equity The women's educational equity program, authorized by title IV, section 408 of Public Law 93-380, provides funds for public agencies, private nonprofit organizations, and individuals to carry out such activities as thc development of materials, preservice and inservice training, research and development, guidance and counseling, etc., which will further educational equity for women. Fiscal year 1977 was the second funding year. Programs to provide educational opportunities for adult women, including the unemployed and underemployed, are one of the activities authorized under the legislation. The program's regula- tion requires that all projects reflect understanding that racial, ethnic, social- economic, age, or regional groups \"have differing approaches to the provision of educational equity for women.\" Metric Education Program The metric education program, authorized by title IV, section 403 of Public Law 93-380, provides grants and contracts to institutions of higher education, and State and local education agencies, and other public and private nonprofit agencies in order to prepare students to use the metric system of measurement. The system of weights and measures is used in everyday consumer activities, as well as in international commerce. In order to make effective consumer decisions and sound economic judgments, it is essential that all practicing parties fully understand the units by which goods and commodities are exchanged or pur- chased. For the most part, the elderly must live within fixed incomes. An effort to meet their educational needs in this regard is critical. One strategy used under the metric education program is to strongly encourage all grantees and con- tractors to incorporate and delineate techniques by which they will actually teach parents and other adults, including the elderly, to use the metric system as a part of their regular educational and training program. Indian Education The Office of Indian Education is cooperating with the Office of Human Development, the Office of Native American Programs, Indian Health Service, Public Service Administration of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Office of Environmental Affairs of the Department of Trans- portation in increasing the base of knowledge about educqtional opportunities for elderly American Indians and to focus the involvement of Indian tribes and Indian organizations in the decisionmaking processes on problems of elderly Indians. During 1977-78, the Office of Indian Education in its national adult educa- tion meeting has and will continue to make its grantees aware of its commitment to the elderly American Indians. OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS RELATED To AGING The functions of the Office of the Inspector General have an effect upon the quality, scope, and cost of services to the aging in numerous ways. Described below are major activities of the Office in 1977 which had an impact directly or indirectly on services for the aging, along with some discussion of planned activities in 1978. GENERAL The mission of the Inspector General is to prevent and detect fraud and abuses in HEWY programs and to promote economy and efficiency in the Department's operations. He also is charged with reporting to the Secretary and to the Congress 164 on deficiencies and problems related to HEW programs and on the necessity for and progress of corrective actions. The Inspector General's Office is the first statutory position of its kind ever established in the Federal civil government. It is the result of Public Law 94-505,enacted on October 15, 1976. The law itself is the result of congressional initiative,inspired at least in part by disclosures of fraud, abuse, or waste in Federal/State medical and welfare programs. The legislation balances the functions prescribed for the Inspector General between preventing or ferreting out wrongdoing and recommendations for program improvements anywhere in HEW. Thomas D. Morris is the first Inspector General, taking office on April 1, 1977. He is a former Assistant Comptroller General of the United States. ORGANIZATION The Inspector General's Office has three main elements prescribed by statute: The Assistant Inspector General for Auditing heads the HEW Audit Agency a long-standing professional staff of auditors that comprise a sizable and,highly proficient resource for the department. This staff prepares or reviews more than 7,000 audits of HEW and its contractors and grantees annually. Its responsibilities include auditing of some 50,000 universities, schools, and nonprofit activities. It also serves as the auditor for other Federal agencies for their grants or contracts awarded to universities and colleges. One of the agency's most valuable resources is its computer analysis expertise that is being adapted to new initiatives of the Office of Inspector General. The Assistant Inspector General for Investigations heads a staff that in- vestigates HEW-related activity of a potentially criminal nature. Until 2 years ago, HEW had no investigations staff of its own and relied on the FBI and State investigators, as appropriate. At the time the Inspector General's Office was formed, the Office of Investigations had developed a staff of about 50. It is now authorized a staff of 114, and is rapidly approach- ing that strength. Its backlog of cases has grown rapidly since it became a part of the In- spector General's Office. In addition, it has a high-priority role of overseeing the investigation of more than 2,400 cases by Federal or State Jeams under project integrity. The Office of Investigations also has a new role of assisting in certification and monitoring of the State medicaid fraud control units authrorized under H.R. 3 legislation. The Assistant Inspector General for Health Care and Systems Review heads a new small staff of senior experts with specialized experience across the range of HEW activities. Now numbering about 20 people, it is expected to grow to about double this strength. This office heads the program delivery assessment staff, and the review of the fraud, waste, and abuse activities of the major units of HEW. It also plans new initiatives to combat fraud, abuse, and waste, some of which are discussed further on in this report. ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER ORGANIZATIONS A basic philosophy of the Office of. Inspector General is to seek use of existing departmental resources in a cooperative way to accomplish its mission. Close working relationships have been built with the Health Care Financing Adminis- tration, the Social Security Administration, and other major elements of the Department in order to maximize resources devoted to common problems. The Inspector General also maintains close liaison with the Justice Department, the Treasury Department, and the Postal Service, and has obtained significant help from them, especially in investigations. MAJOR PROJECTS IN 1977 Program Delivery Assessments One of the most broad-scale tasks that the Secretary has asked the Inspector General to undertake is evaluating how well HEW programs work at the recipient level. He has asked the Inspector General to design, test, and monitor the imple- mentation of nationwide series of \"program delivery assessments\" which seek to determine the cost and effectiveness of services being delivered to bene- 165 ficiaries. The measurement of the effect of the Department's services on its clients is an area in which data generally is too weak or nonexistent. In this effort, the Inspector General is being assisted by other elements of HEW, including a small assessment staff in the newly reorganized regional offices. These staffs need to work closely with State and local agencies, and the Inspector General has re- ceived many assurances of State support in this effort. One of the first evaluations in this service delivery assessment is the effective- ness of home health care agencies-a matter of special concern to older Americans. The initial studies are being done in Florida, in cooperation with the State, which was already planning such a review. We have also begun an evaluation of Head Start and will be measuring effective- ness of other social programs to determine their worth versus alternatives in the coming year.Departmental Program Reviews Another major long-term task given the Inspector General by the Secretary in 1977 is the systematic review of how effectively each HEW program is organized and staffed to combat fraud, abuse, and waste. In reviewing management of programs, particular attention will be given to management information systems, quality control systems, program integrity, and technical assistance to States. The Secretary asked the Inspector General to give first priortiy to such a review of the aid to families with dependent children program. This effort is underway, with a small but highly qualified team working with the Social Security Administration.Project Integrity One of the first initiatives begun by the Office of the Inspector General im- mediately upon formation of the Office is aimed directly at fraud and abuse in medical services supported by the Department. Project integrity seeks to use computer technology to find the initial indications of wrongdoing, thereby elimi- nating laborious manual screening of records. In its first phase, project integrity is concentrating ona physicians and pharmacists in the medicaid program. For analysis purposes, reasonable limits were established by experts for 22 services or procedures by physicians, and for 26 procedures by pharmacists. Services in excess of those limits were turned up by the computer as aberrant or abnormal. For example, more than 25 prescriptions for Valium for the same patient in a year were considered abnormal. Examination of some 250 million billings across the country rendered in 1976 produced some 47,000 cases of pyhsi- clans and pharmacists that appeared to exceed reasonale limits in some way. The Inspector General then selected approximately 2,500 of those that appeared most flagrant, choosing about 25 physicians and 25 pharmacists from each State for field investigation. The States are cooperating in this effort and have committed more than 350 personnel to the effort. Some 170 Federal officers are participating. Most of the cases turned up by the computer, including cases selected for early investigation, will not be fraudulent. But those in which fraud is indicated will be referred to U.S. Attorneys for prosecutorial decision. The technique will be extended to examining records of other health care professionals and institutions in the future, and it is also applicable to medicare. For nursing homes, special studies are being conducted in three States in an effort to learn the best techniques for computer analysis of nursing home records in order to apply these on a nationwide basis. For hospitals, a special study is being conducted in New York State that may lead to development of computer analysis of hospital records to disclose abnormal costs or procedures. Project Match Under this project, begun by the Inspector General in mid-1977, computer comparison is made between Federal pay records and welfare rolls (aid to families with dependent children) to screen for Federal employees improperly receiving welfare benefits. This project was undertaken after reviewing results of efforts by U.S. Attorneys in Detroit and Chicago, who worked with State welfare authori- ties to indict a surprising number of Federal employees for welfare fraud. The Inspector General is conducting this effort in cooperation with the Family Assistance Administration, the Department of Justice, and the States. In the initial effort, comparisons were made of welfare rolls and Federal payrolls in 21 major jurisdictions or States. Raw matches amounted to about 26,000 persons, 166 about half of whom are currently employed by the U.S. Government, the othershaving been employed in the recent past on either a full-time, part-time, ortemporary basis. By the end of 1977, some 13,358 cases had been turned over to the appropriateFederal agencies for verification of employment and salary. This information willthen be furnished to the State welfare agencies for redetermination of eligibility.Undoubtedly, a sizable portion of the Federal employees on the rolls will be foundto be drawing benefits properly, due to low income or large family, or both. Butothers will be found totally ineligible or overpaid or underpaid in benefits. Caseswhich appear seriously fraudulent will be turned over to U.S. Attorneys forpossible prosecution, and other cases involving improper benefits will be dealtwith administratively. The Civil Service Commission, Justice Department, and HEW have agreed onprocedures to insure protection of privacy for the 2.8 million Federal employeeswhose records are being screened. No data on individuals will be disclosed publiclyunless this becomes necessary during prosecution of that person. ACTIVITIES IN 1978 Program Delivery Assessments We plan to expand considerably our evaluation of HEW social and health pro-grams at the recipient level during 1978 and a number of these studies are expectedto relate directly or indirectly to services for the aging. At this writing, most of theseassessment efforts have not been selected. However, the Inspector General andregional assessment staffs will complete their evaluation of home health care, andhave already decided on four new assessments in 1978. These include:(a) Disability insurance benefit determination, in which the client's ex-periences in the Social Security Administration's disability determinationprocess will be evaluated. (b) Education for the handicapped, to ascertain the extent to which handi-capped children benefit from educational services.(c) Foster care services. (d) Family planning for teenagers. Departmental Program Reviews As part of his major assignment to review the efficiency of the Department'sprograms in combatting fraud, abuse, and waste, the Inspector General expects toreview the medicaid program in 1978. This is one of the Department's most rapidlygrowing programs in terms of costs, and it is one that many aged people depend onfor their medical care. Project Integrity The first phase of this project should be completed, with administrative orcriminal action taken against a few hundred physicians and pharmacists in 1978.The results should also lead the Department to correction of management orsystems weaknesses. New categories of health-care providers whose medicaid billings will be ana-lyzed in 1978 are expected to include dentists, certain other non-physician prac-titioners, and some institutional providers, including outpatient services. Project Match In 1978 the Inspector General expects to complete action concerning Federalemployees drawing improper welfare benefits. For such employees, one or moreof the following actions, as appropriate, will be taken: remove from the rollsadjust benefit, seek restitution, and refer for prosecution.A new statute, Public Law 95-216, mandates that social security wage recordsbe made available for comparison with welfare rolls (aid to families with dependentchildren) in those States that do not have unemployment compensation wagereports for checking to determine welfare recipients' incomes. After October 1,1979, the law requires that the States check their welfare rolls against either ofthese wage reports.The Inspector General will work with the Social Security Administration andthe States to determine the most effective means for carrying out this extensionof project match in 1978. 167 HEALTH RESOURCES ADMINISTRATION PROGRAM RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE AREA OF AGING 1. NURSING Special emphasis is given in the Nurse Training Act of 1975 to the problems and health care of the aging. Grants and contracts are authorized for special projects to improve curricula in schools of nursing for geriatric courses and to assist in meeting the costs of developing short-term inservice training programs for nurses aides and nursing home orderlies. The latter programs emphasize the special problems of geriatric patients and include training for monitoring the well-being, feeding and cleaning of nursing home patients, emergency procedures, drug properties and interactions, and fire safety techniques. Under section 822, of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), grants and contracts are authorized to educate nurses in the provision of primary health care to the elderly. Six contracts totaling $2,030,876 were awarded in fiscal year 1975 for geriatric nurse practitioner training programs. The University of Colorado Medical Center received a $134,988 grant in fiscal year 1976 to prepare nurses to become geriatric nurse practitioners in long-term care (LTC) facilities within the six-State area of region VIII. Westbrook College (Portland, Maine) was given a grant ($70,900) to provide basic instruction in the skills of caring for the geriatric patient in LTC facilities and to enhance a deeper concern and awareness for elderly patients. The agency has nine active training programs ($1,266,926 to date) to prepare registered nurses (RN's) as geriatric nurse practitioners. Nurse practitioner programs preparing RN's to deliver primary health care have also had an impact on the training needs of home health agencies. A contract will be awarded in fiscal year 1978 to focus on a model inservice training program for nurses aides and orderlies who care for patients in nursing homes. Active advanced nurse training grants are held by the (1) University of Rochester for graduate concentration in geronl- tological nursing ($298,210 to date), (2) San Jose State University to establish a gerontological nurse specialist program ($258,763 to date), and (3) University of Kansas for the training of gerontological clinical nurse specialists ($352,589 to date). A notice of proposed rulemaking for such grants was published on January 24, 1978,1 with geriatric nursing proposed as an area for funding priority. Two nursing research grants focusing on the care of elderly patients have also been awarded. Wayne State University Institute of Gerontology received a grant in 1977 ($54,992 to date) for the measurement of a job performance (RN's and nursing aides) in nursing homes. The Medical Care and Research Foundation (Denver, Colo.) was awarded a grant ($147,927) to study ways to improve the health care of elderly and chronically ill by altering the typical roles of nurses and physicians to provide additional means of entry into the health care system and to ensure care that relates to more than the disease process. Future special projects, nurse practitioner grants, and research grants will continue to provide special emphasis on meeting the training needs of nurses to provide better health care to the elderly. Awards will focus on improving curricula by incorporating new concepts that have been developed under the research grant program. An understanding of the daily living problems and illnesses of particular concern to the elderly and their required therapeutic techniques, is largely dependent on the instruction and followup care provided by nurses. This is very important with the greater reliance on out-of-hospital care for the elderly. Much more could be done in health care settings where the patients' primary needs are for nursing care as opposed to cure. For example, nurses are the principal providers of care for patients in rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, and home health agencies. Such settings could be developed into model nursing centers, offering unique opportunities to test nursing theories in practice, to promptly apply findings from promising research, and to develop new modes of nursing service. 2. ASSOCIATED HEALTH Allied health professions special project grants have been awarded to (1) University of Alabama for student-paced instruction in gerontology for 2 years ending June 30, 1977 (total $85,577), (2) University of Northern Colorado for training in geriatric aural rehabilitation ($193,734 for 2 of 5 years), and (3) Quinnipiac College (Hamden, Conn.) for coordination, education and licensuru in LTC administration ($122,980). Other awards have been made through allied health professions special improvement grants to SUN Y at Stony Brook -for 168 gerontology curriculum development ($75,496 for 2 of 5 years) and to the Univer-sity of Texas for gerontology services administration ($40,171 for 1 of 5 years).The University of Puerto Rico has a current public health project grant ($182,430)for the development of curricula for chronic diseases and aging.Public health short-term traineeship grants were awarded in fiscal year 1975to the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing for nursing home adminis-tration ($12,710/100 trainees) and to the South Carolina Department of Healthand Environmental Control for the development of interdisciplinary team ap-proach in home health service ($10,000/100 trainees). In fiscal year 1976, YaleUniversity received a traineeship grant for an infection control training program inLTC ($9,368/70 trainees). Two such grants were awarded in fiscal year 1977 to(1) Columbia University School of Public Health for administration and manage-ment of home health service ($9,100/26 trainees) and (2) Donnelly College (KansasCity) for improving nursing home administration and services ($19,000).A $457,835 contract was awarded to the University of Pittsburgh for worktoward a baccalaureate external degree in health services administration-LTCadministration major. A completed contract with the American Podiatry Associa-tion to assess foot health problems and related health manpower utilization andrequirements also impact on the health of the aged. Late fiscal year 1978 con-tracts will be awarded to look into alternative methods of increasing the geriatricaspects of the pharmacy curriculum (estimated cost $65,000), and for planningthe development of educational programs in rehabilitative optometry ($125,000).The Agency has also provided LTC funds for training support as follows: Fiscalyear 1976-$1,319,453 and fiscal year 1977-$335,081. Other past, present, andfuture contract/grant activities involving such areas as curricula, delineationand verification of functional roles, and data collection have some (although lessdirect) impact on the aged. Additional future efforts are limited by availablefunds and legislative authorization. 3. DENTISTRY A methodology is currently being developed under contract ($9,970) for astudy of the effect of community water supply fluoridation on demand for dentalcare among older adults. While the beneficial effects of fluoridation in youngerage groups are unambiguous, the implications for older groups are less clear.Their need and demand for dental resources could be increased if the retentionof more natural teeth implies a greater risk of dental caries and periodontaldisease. Another effort that is underway will develop, implement and assess amodel program for the training of dental and dental-auxiliary students in thedelivery of primary preventive services in a community setting. Among thesites involved, two relate specifically to the aged. First, a group of four dentalteams implemented a screening, in-service, education, denture-cleaning, scaling-and-polishing, and referral program for institutionalized elderly persons in anursing home. The second site involved noninstitutionalized elderly (90 percent)and handicapped adults (10 percent) in an apartment building. Four dentalteams, under the supervision of a faculty dentist, planned an oral cancer screening,a dental health education program, and a referral program for the residents.This includes scalings and polishings as well as instruction on the proper care andmaintenance for prosthetic appliances possessed by the residents. It is proposedin fiscal year 1978 that a pilot training program be developed and implementedfor the dental auxiliary in denture care (estimated cost $227,750). This will leadto more services being available (including the elderly) and the containment, ifnot reduction of costs. 4. MEDICINE Publlc Law 94-484, section 788(d), authorizes training in the diagnosis, treat-ment and prevention of the diseases and related medical and behavioral problemsof the aged. The agency has promoted geriatric training as a part of its overallsupport for activities in primary care. Also, support for training in the social,psychological and medical problems of the aged has been possible as a componentof other programs for some time, but without separate funding. Under section783 of the PHS Act, the University of Nebraska has received a 3-year grant for$390,000 which emphasizes education in physician's assistant training. Granteescan request graduate training program support which incorporates geriatrictraining for family medicine residencies under section 786 and primary care-oriented residencies in internal medicine-pediatrics under section 783 of the 169 PHS Act. Funding constraints preclude the award of a proposed fiscal year 1978 contract to develop a model geriatric curriculum. The agency is continuing to develop a knowledge bank on geiatric activity, both national and international, and one of its staff is taking a graduate-level gerontology course. Future research is needed to determine the weaknesses in health care education pertaining to the needs of the elderly, as well as curriculum, content development to assure that each type of health professional is fully prepared to deal appro- priately with their needs. There should be a greater integration of geriatrics into existing undergraduate medical education (less than 45 percent of schools offer such an elective) and its increased emphasis as a critical component within primary care residency training. Continuing education in geriatrics and long-term care is an important need. Geriatric training in internal medicine and family medicine residencies (one-third of internal medicine physician patients are over 65) needs increased emphasis. Training in providing service to patients at home and in nursing home settings is an important element in approved family medicine resi- dencies. Conferences, workshops, or institutes are needed for chairmen of family medicine, internal medicine and psychiatry departments to encourage communi- cation, education and research development on aging and geriatrics. Demonstra- tion projects in medical schools could integrate clinical care in geriatrics, teaching and research while interdisciplinary centers bring together experienced profes- sionals to deal with the many interrelated problems of the elderly. There should be encouragement to use nursing homes, extended care facilities, day care and home care programs as training sites (less than 100 nursing homes out of over 20,000 in the United States have any formal or informal training arrangements with medical schools). Joint geriatric/gerontology projects could be conducted with other ;governmental agencies (e.g., AoA, NIA, SS, and H LID). Geriatric focal points could be established in each medical school via contract (individuals will need orientation to promote attitudinal changes about the elderly among medical school staff, faculty and students). An effective transfer mechanism from geriatric research to medical education is needed (e.g., the effects of specific drugs react differently on the elderly thai' on those of middle age). Various he atti professionals have been underutilized in elderly care, partly because of the difficulty to expand and improve multidisciplinary health service approaches. 5. OTHER ACTIVITIES During the past eight months, representatives of the agency have attended several interagency meetings involving the Administration on Aging and the National Academy of Science for the purpose of developing an inventory of the present state of gerontology/geriatric understanding and educational activity. During the same period, Agency staff has been involved in the planning of a 1-day conference on aging to be held later this year in Washington, D.C., for 10 institutional vice presidents for health affairs. Although it will be funded by the Administration on Aging, the agency will join the National Institute on Aging n providing staff support. HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION JANUARY 16, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your letter of December 14, 1977, requesting a summary of the Health Services Administration's major actions on aging during 1977 and some mention of our planned activities for 1978. The Health Services Administration',s (HSA) 1978 budget is approximately $1.8 billion. The services funded by this money are provided as either direct health care services or in the form project and formula grants to supprot such services. HSA has three operational bureaus: the Bureau of Community Health Services, the Bureau of Medical Services, and the Indian Health Services. Our summary, three copies of which are enclosed as you requested, is organized in accordance with this structure. I hopA. this material will be a useful addition to your committee's annual report. We appreciate the opportunity to be included. Sincerely yours, GEORGE I. LYTHCorr, M.D., Assistant Surgeon General Administrator. 170 [Enclosures.] BUREAU OF COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES The Bureau of Community Health Services (BCHS) provides health services tothe underserved or disadvantaged through the development and maintenance ofprimary health care delivery capacity in medically underserved urban and ruralareas. In determining medical underservices, four factors are taken into considera-tion: (1) The proportion of aged people in the area; (2) the proportion of poorpeople; (3) the number of doctors in the area; and (4) the infant mortality rate.Use of the number of aged, as well as the poverty factor, focuses attention on theelderly. Bureau activities which impact most significantly on the aged are pro-moted through the community health centers, migrant health, national healthservice corps, hypertension, and home health programs.During fiscal year 1977 an estimated total of 3,424,000 people received a rangeof preventive, curative and rehabilitative services in 455 community health centers.It is estimated that approximately 15 percent of these people were age 65 or older.In 1978, we expect to have about 574 of these centers serving approximately4,565,000 people. The migrant health program provides access to health care services for migrantand seasonal farmworkers and their families. Migrants live and work in pre-dominantly rural areas where health resources are scarce. Although they faceproblems of shortage and maldistribution of health resources which other ruralresidents must cope with, the migrants' problems are compounded by suchfactors as the need to travel from place to place in search of work, language andcultural differences. In addition, the elderly migrant is further handicapped bythe multiplicity of problems which accompany aging. In 1977 services wereprovided at 363 sites to an estimated 499,000 migrants and seasonal farmworkersand their families. Approximately 2 percent of those served were 65 years of ageor older. The projected total number to be served in 1978 is 537,000.The national health service corps was designed to improve the delivery ofhealth services to persons residing in communities where health resources areinadequate or nonexistent. The approach is to: (1) Recruit and place healthprofessionals in those areas; (2) assist the communities in developing the capacityto independently maintain their own systems of care; and (3) design policies thatwill encourage health professionals, once placed, to remain in shortage areas ona non-Federal basis. Because older people residing in these areas often havereduced mobility, the presence of health personnel in their communities is ofspecial importance. While age specific data are not available, a total of 670,000people were served by 861 providers at 398 sites in 1977. Special emphasis in1978 will be given to the use of corps' recruitment and placement resources inhelping to provide medical staff for community health centers, migrant health,and like programs. The Bureau has recently expanded its focus on specific health problems whichaffect a significant proportion of the aging population. These include effortsdirected to the screening, detection, diagnosis, prevention and referral for hyper-tension. This activity is concerned with identifying persons with hypertensionand helping to assure that they establish and maintain a proper, medicallysupervised treatment program. Guidelines have been published for the develop-ment and operation of State hypertension programs; regional personnel have beenidentified as focal points for assistance to the States; and as a means of enhancingthe knowledge of State and Federal personnel involved in hypertension controlprograms, a conference was cosponsored by the Bureau and the National Heart,Lung and Blood Institute. Regional, State, and territorial health and Federalrepresentatives exchanged information on planning and operating high bloodpressure control programs and States discussed undertaking regionally operatedhypertension control programs. ,Another recent area of Bureau expansion, the home health program, is specifi-cally directed toward meeting the needs of the aged. Home health agencies aredesigned to offer medically desirable and often cost-saving alternatives to insti-tutionalized care in hospitals and nursing homes by attempting to maintain elderlypeople in familiar surroundings. In awarding project grants, funding priority isgiven to areas in which a sizeable proportion of the population to be served iselderly, medically indigent or both. In 1977, 56 service projects were funded, 14for the development of new home health agencies and 42 for expansion of servicesnot previously provided in existing home health agencies. These agencies served approximately 15,000 people. Plans for 1978 call for the funding of 70 service projects, 40 new and 30 expansion. In addition, 20 training projects will provide training for professional and paraprofessional personnel providing home health services. Finally, the Bureau of Community Health Services has initiated discussions with the Administration on Aging (AoA) with a view toward furthering interre- lationships between community health centers and projects supported by AoA and the various State agencies on aging. As these activities develop and evolve, additional support will be given to improving approaches to health care of the aged in BCHS projects. INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE Through its Committee on Aging, organized in 1976 to give impetus to the development of special programs to serve elderly Indians and Alaska Natives, Indian Health Service reports the following accomplishments for 1977: (1) Distribution of the first health profile of the aging and aged service popu- lation-prepared initially for inclusion in the final proceedings of the 1976 Na- tional Conference on Elderly Indians. (2) Development of data for more detailed studies of the health and health needs of the elderly on a service unit-by-service unit basis in some IHS areas, with one comprehensive report for the Alaska area being finalized and distributed and special data collections completed in the Billings and Aberdeen areas; and resource inventories, for example, in the Navajo and Portland areas. (3) Beginning of a model geriatrics program within one area, Phoenix, in which the services of a physician, nurse and social worker are utilized as a team. (4) Participation in a number of special tribally sponsored projects which have resulted in: (a) Plans for a multipurpose center for the aging in the Laguana Pueblo, with additional funding secured to extend the study of needs to eight other Pueblos (Albuquerque area). (b) Development of food service programs servicewide. (c) Exploration of the potential for establishing home health services, nursing home and custodial care facilities, and special housing for the elderly servicewide. (d) Training programs for tribal members working with the elderly, par- ticularly in the Oklahoma City area through conferences sponsored by the new Indian councils on aging and through a Governor's conference in the Aberdeen area. The IHS Office of Research and Development, Tucson, developed a training program for tribal community health representatives working with the elderly. In addition to these activities, Indian Health Service has implemented title IV, Public Law 94-437, providing Indian and Alaska Native medicare and medicaid eligibles an opportunity to use their entitlements in IHS facilities. This became operational during 1977, to some extent, in all areas except Alaska and Portland. The Bemidji program office received the first medicaid reimbursement from th State of Minnesota; and the Oklahoma City area office, the first from medicare 1978 Plans (1) IHS will give full support to preparation for the 1978 Indian conference on health of the elderly being convened by the National Indian Council on Aging. Each IHS area, through its representative on the IHS Committee on Aging, will prepare a booklet describing at least one successful tribal health program for the elderly that might be adapted elsewhere. (2) IHS will fund the development of four background papers for use during the national conference. Two will cover the physical and mental health status of elderly Indians and Alaska Natives, with descriptions of selected leading causes -of death and disability as these occur among this population. The other two papers will deal with long-term care and community support services required. (3) IHS will fund the development of a paper describing accidents among elderly Indians and Alaska Natives, together with recommendations for reducing these. A kit of educational and safety promotional materials is to be included. (4) IHS will seek to provide a survey instrument to assist tribes in determining needs of various types of care facilities.

BUREAU OF MEDICAL SERVICES The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has a legislative mandateto provide direct health care services to specified beneficiaries under provisions ofthe Public Health Service Act and the Dependents' Medical Care Act. This re-sponsibility is discharged, in part, through the Bureau of Medical Services (B MS)of the Health Services Administration and, within the Bureau, through its Divi-sion of Hospitals and Clinics and Division of Federal Employee Health. The pro-gram authorities of the Bureau's Division of Emergency Medical Services doesnot encompass the direct delivery of health care services.The Division of Hospitals and Clinics provides comprehensive health careservices to American seamen, active duty members of the U.S. Coast Guard, mem-bers of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and to active dutycommissioned officers of the U.S. Public Health Service. Services may also be pro-vided to retired members of the uniformed services, to dependents of active dutyand retired members of the uniformed services under the authority of the Depend-ents' Medical Care Act and to selected community residents.In addition, the Public Health Service Act permits the providing of limitedhealth services to Federal employees by the Bureau's Division of Federal EmployeeHealth. Health care services within the Division of Hospitals and Clinics (DHC) areprovided by eight general medical-surgical hospitals, one specialized treatmentcenter (Hansen's disease), 26 free-standing outpatient clinics, and more than 300contract physicians and hospitals located throughout the United States. Thismajor system constitutes a nationwide network within the Department for thedelivery of comprehensive health care services, for training, and for research. Inaddition, the Division of Federal Employee Health operates 143 clinics in Federalinstallations across the country. As compared to fiscal year 1976, total workload increased throughout the sys-tem, particularly with respect to ambulatory care visits which registered 3.3 per-cent increase during fiscal year 1977.Funds for clinical research studies are distributed through the Central Investi-gations Committee of the Division of Hospitals and Clinics, a formally constitutedbody, that is also responsible for monitoring and evaluating research programs.During the year, approximately $250,000 for fiscal year 1977 funds of the Divi-sion of Hospitals and Clinics were expended for clinical research, of which $172,820was allocated to research related to aging or the aging process. During fiscal year1977, 19 clinical research projects related to aging were operational in five USPHShospitals (in Baltimore, Boston, SanFrancisco, Seattle, and Staten Island). Otherstudies in PHS hospitals received $279,000 from the National Institutes of Healthand $600,000 from the National Center for Health Services Research during fiscalyear 1977. Most of the PHS beneficiaries are adults and the proportion of beneficiaries whoare 60 years old and older is increasing, as is true in the general population. Whileit is known that all of the USPHS hospitals and outpatient clinics treat personsaged 60 and over, precise data regarding the number and services rendered to thisage group on an outpatient basis cannot be obtained at this time. During the first 6months of fiscal year 1977, of the 16,401 discharges from USPHS hospitals in 2,719instances, the patient was 65 years of age or over. Annualized, it is estimated thatapproximately 87,000 patient days were utilized by this group at an estimatedcost of $11,397,000 based on an average daily rate of $131. The average length ofstay for this age group is somewhat longer than for younger individuals. Americanseamen constitute a major PHS beneficiary group and there are probably moresingle males in this category than in the population at large. As a consequence,finding suitable nursing homes for those in need of long-term care constitutes oneof the major difficulties in discharge planning.Early in the calendar year 1976, the Geriatric Day Treatment Center (GDTC)located on the campus of the USPHS hospital in Baltimore became operational.This program is jointly sponsored by the Family and Children's Society of Balti-more and the USPHS Hospital in Baltimore. Through a contract, with the Mary-land State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Office of the Chronically 173 Ill and Aging, the GDTC receives title XX funds. The amount of title XX funds from the State has increased each year the GDTC has been in operation. This program provides an alternative to institutionalization and services are delivered by a multidisciplinary staff. The program is structured around an organized regime of activities of daily living (ADL) and health services during the day in a protective group setting. Additional important program components include nutrition, coun- seling, and transportation. Program participants are persons 60 years of age and older referred from PHS beneficiary groups, the geriatric evaluation service of the Baltimore City Health Department, community organizations and private physicians. Program objectives are: (1) Enhance activities of daily living by providing instruction in self care, health maintenance, consumer education and/or referral to other services required to assist the aged to remain in or return to their homes or communities. (2) Increase effectiveness of the individual through! the service and consultation of experts provided by the hospital to develop health care plans to meet the needs of the individual applicants or development of general program. (3) Improve health status by providing necessary diagnostic, remedial or treatment services and arrangements for obtaining physician or hospital services in case of emergency and by maintaining necessary liaison with other providers of health services to assure the provision of services necessary to carry out medical recommendations. (4) Reduce isolation by providing the means for aged persons restricted in their mobility to get out of the house; and encourage regular attendance on individually scheduled days providing transportation. (5) Promote socialization by offering companionship in a pleasant, safe and comfortable environment and stimulate interests by offering satisfying leisure time activities. (6) Conserve family interest and support by offering respite as required during part or all of the work week and by providing individual and group counselling. When the GDTC was established it was anticipated that it would offer exten- sive opportunities to serve as a demonstration model and research laboratory in the development and operation of day care programs for older persons. This aspect has been realized through the consultation and technical assistance that the GDTC has been able to offer to staff at several other USPHS hospitals, associates working on various levels of local and State government and colleagues who are program managers of other geriatric programs in Baltimore and in other parts of Maryland. This past year has been a period of increased activity and accomplishment for the GDTC. In addition to more than doubling its patient load so that they now average about 30 patients per week (75 percent of whom are in wheelchairs), other accomplishments include: (1) Increased capacity to treat more severely impaired patients particularly those with communication disorders. (2) More extensive collaboration with local speech pathology and hearing organizations. (3) Weekly consultation from the psychiatry department for patient manage- ment and staff consultation. (4) Participation in the evaluation of patients from other hospitals to consider patients for admission to the GDTC at the time or later on in the treatment process. (5) The GDTC is now the site for field work experience for nursing students from the University of Maryland and mental health students from the Commutity College of Baltimore. Other hospitals in the USPHS hospital system are developing programs in aging. Early in 1977, the USPHS hospital in San Francisco started a program of geriatric screening and referral for older people living in one of the San Francisco health districts near the hospital. This program works closely with the local city health center and is an integral part of a coordinated effort to improve the health status of older persons in San Francisco. Potentially, the multiple facilities of the Division of Hospitals and Clinics could be used to study, develop and/cr apply in new ways, various methods and techniques leading to the improvement of the delivery of services to older persons. In this regard, the Division believes it could play a significant role in a vigorous intergovernmental effort. 174 NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH Current Status of NCHSR Commitments to Research on Care of the Elderly Attached are all compendium entries summarizing research in the National Center for Health Services Research regarding care of the aged. These summaries are divided into two groups according to funding comittments for FY 1978, and those prior to and including FY 1978 so that current priorities will be visible. Dollar breakdowns by category for FY 1978 are as follows: I FY 1978 Funding Non-institutional Care 3 $388,000 Institutional care 2 92,000 Dental care 1 158,000 The three projects in non-institutional care include and experiment with transportation and its impact on mobility and mental health; the effects of family structure on home care; and a study of the. dietary habits of the aged in order to improve nutrition in home meal delivery. Institutional care projects relate to the economic behavior of nursing homes with respect to pricing patterns under various reimbursement schemes, and with respect to state regulatory policies on investment in the nursing home industry. The dental services project is aimed at determining the needs of the elderly and costs of meeting those needs under various insurance plans. Two projects deserve mention with respect to those funded under FY 1977 and previous commitments. The first, based on the 222 (d) demonstration projects and conducted in the NCHSR Division of Intramural Research by Dr. W. Weissert relate to adult day care for the elderly. His findings report a cost saving of 37-60% to the health care payor and therefore may prove a cost-saving candidate for Medicaid and Medicare coverage. The second, done on a contract awarded by the NCHSR, compares alternative modes of geriatric day care and identifies two models for conceptualizing these services. The first is a physical rehabilitation program and the second includes a variety of program goals such as social rehabilitation,nutrition, and recreation. Therapies in Model I were administered by professionals at a cost per day of $43.09 while Model II relied on unlicensed, unregistered personnel at a program cost per day of $20.56. With regard to other research included here representing funding commitments prior to and including FY 1977, Dr. Joyce Lashoff's testimony of September 21, 1977 before the Committe on Aging provides a good overall summary of research supported by the NCHSR, as well as a statement of the 222 (d) Demonstrations to that date, A copy of the testimony is included for your convenience.

Total Funding \"Experimental Transportation (HS02693) Vera Institute Justice 1978 $165,000 -Objective. To evaluate a multi-purpose transportation system for the elderly and disabled for impact on mobility, relationship with other provider agencies and cost- effectiveness. -Scope and Approach. The grantee will compare demographic factors, patterns of tripmaking, degree of functional incapacity and mental well-being of a sample of elderly and disabled persons having access to the experimental system with a matched group. Personal interviews will be conducted, validated by examination of secondary data sources. -Actual/expected findings and relationships to legislative or policy issues. Evaluation of the experimental system is expected to show greater mobility among the users and a move- ment toward positive mental health. In addition, an increase in trips to physicians and out-patient facilities is predicted with a corresponding reduction in emergency room visits, hospitalizations and lengths of hospitalization.

To examine the effects of family structure on the probability of being placed in an institution which provides long term care as opposed to receiving home care. -Scope and Approach. This project utilizes data from twoefforts, an initial survey conducted in 1965 and a follow-up in 1974. From this longitudinal study one sample will bedrawn to investigate the influences of placement in a longterm care facility and a second sample of disabled personsliving at home drawn to describe the formal and informal home care received. -Actual/expected findings and relationships to legislative or policy issues. This study will provide important infor-mation on the factors that determine delivery of homecare from formal and informal sources and the impact of home care on informal care providers.

To study the dietary habits of residents of a nursing home in an effort to identify ways to improve the nutrition of the elderly. -Scope and approach. The researcher will look at and experiment with various methods for improving food item choices, dining conditions and assistance with feeding which will provide the residents of a 100-bed skilled nursing facility with the recommended dietary allowance of nutrients. -Actual/expected findings & relationships to legislative or policy issues. Sample menus vill be written and recommendations will be provided on how to improve nutrition to these elderly persons. If specific methods for improving nutritional intake of the elderly prove useful, these may be implemented in other nursing homes and given to caretakers of the non- institutionalized elderly in an effort to improve the health status of the elderly possibly reducing the cost ,of health care through prevention of dietary deficiency diseases. FUNDING COMMITMENTS, FISCAL YEAR 1978: INSTITUTIONAL CARE Project Title and Summary Contractor/grantee Project Dates Total Funding \"Regulation of Investment in Long Term Care The Urban Institute 5/73 -8/78 $150,366Facilities\" (HS 02620) (Washington, D.C.) FY 1977 ------ $109,366 FY 1978 ------ $ 41,000 -Objectives. To analyze the impact of State regulatorypolicies on the growth of the nursing home industry. -Scope and approach. An economic model based on datafrom nursing home regulation in 15 states will bestatistically analyzed to assess the effects ofalternative forms of investment control on nursingservice supplier decisions concerning investment inbeds, resident mix, quality of care, price of care,number of admissions, and the share of patients covered by Medicaid. -Findings/relevance. Because there is every indication that regulation in the medical care sector and, partic-ularly, the nursing home sector will continue toexpand rapidly, it is important to understand theprovider response to regulation in terms of being ableto both predict and explain it. FUNDING COMMITMENTS, FISCAL YEAR 1978: INSTITUTIONAL CARE--Continued project Title and Summary Contractor/grantee Project Dates Total Funding uEconomics of Nursing Romes; Ownership Duke -Objectives. To study the determinants of cost variation among nursing homes emphasizing two important factors: ownership and reimbursement method by government agencies. -Scope and approach. Data from the 1973-1974 National Nursing Home Survey conducted by the National Center for Health Services Research will be used to construct statistical economic models for estimating nursing home cost functions, production functions (where the \"product\" is a cost weighted patient day), and functions pertaining to service intensity, wage level, and patient type. -Findings/relevance. Understanding the economic behavior of nursing homes. with respect to their pricing patterns under various reimbursement schemes and with respect to their output decisions such as the scope of offered services is a prerequisite to more effective regulation of the nursing home industry where the expectation is for more rather than less regulation in the future. FUNDING COMMITMENTS, FISCAL YEAR 1978: SPECIAL PROJECTS Project Title and Summary Contractor/grantee Project Dates Total Funding \"Provider Response and Cost of Dentistry for the Elderly\" (HS 02179)University of Washington Seattle -Objectives. To determine the characteristics of elderly dental care utilization and needs and the costs of treating needs under various insurance plang. -Scope and approach. Dental histories will be taken and examinations performed on a sample group of elderly people in order to construct a typical profile of elderly dental care needs. These profiles will be presented to a sample group of dentists who will determine a treatment plan for each type of case given one of three insurance benefit constraints. Finally, a comparative cost study will be performed across the three insurance alternatives. -Findings/relevance. Given that the aged population is growing, becoming more politically active, and achieving greater access to care through dental insurance programs, it is important from a planning perspective to know rates of utilization and the extent of unmet need, and how differences in insurance coverage affect the cost of treating unmet needs.7/77 -6/79 $294,864 FY 1977 $146,864 FY 1978 --- $158,000 COMMITMENTS, PRIOR TO AND INCLUDING FISCAL YEAR 1977: NONINSTITUTIONAL CARE Prolect Title and Summary Contractor/grantee Project Dates Total Funding \"Triage: Coordinated Delivery of Services to the Connecticut State 4/76 -3/78 $735,457Elderly\" (HS 02563) Department of Aging FY 1977 ------ $427,440 FY 1978 0 -Objective. To evaluate a model system of health and social care for the elderly. -Scope and approach. \"Triage\" is a system developed by the Connecticut State Department of Aging to assure referral and follow-up for all physical, social, psychological and life support needs for clients by a single-edtry process. A comparative analysis will be performed between \"Triage\" clients and a sample drawn from the existing care system, stratifying by sex, age, marital status, and activity in daily living scores. In addition, the grantee will compile a descriptive study of \"Triage.\" -Actual/expected findings and relationships to legislative or policy issues. It is expected that the analysis will show that \"Triage\" clients will have better functional status outcomes, lower per capita health care expenditures and fewer days of institutionalization than those in the control group. Thus the quality of care would be increased while costs are contained.

To develop a demonstration model for the computer-coordinated delivery of comprehensive services for the aging. -Scope and approach. In conjunction with existing experimental programs in the community the project studied the aged's .use of health and welfare services, and facilitated identification of unmet needs and coordination of those services. This system was evaluated in terms quality of care, increased cost-effectiveness, and increased ac- cessibility to care. -Actual/expected findings and relationships to legislative or policy issues. The computerized system provides an approach to coordinating human services for the elderly. It avoids duplication and allows for informed planning of additional services based on an in-depth analysis of the utilization of existing resources.

The \"Life Line\" system, which automatically dials for help if a disabled or high- risk patient living alone does not respond in a preset time, will be field tested. With before/ after measures taken on experimental and control groups, outcomes will be studied including effects on; (1) health status; (2) quality of life indicators (morale, social isolation, etc.); (3) institutionaliza- tion; (4) time of death; and (5) costs of both infor- mal and formal health & welfare maintenance services. A number of alternative solutions to care for the elderly and severely disabled will be considered in addition to the feasibility and acceptability of the alarm devices. -Actual/expected findings & relationships to legisla- tive or policy issues. If this passive monitoring device proves successful, effective, and economical, it can find application by those in many high-risk situations, such as persons with heart disease, severe asthematics, dialysis patients, etc. FUNDING COMMITMENTS, PRIOR TO AND INCLUDING FISCAL YEAR 1977: NONINSTITUTIONAL CARE--Continued Project Title and Summary Contractor/grantee Project Dates Total Funding \"Evaluating Information and Referral Services for the County of San Diego 6/76 -10/75 $24,003 --------- 0 -Objective. To evaluate the effectiveness of information and referral service for the elderly, with particular empphasis on the homebound. -Scope and approach. Two types of information and referral services were evaluated--a telephone service and a face-to- face service using non-professionals. Questionnaires were administered to individuals using these information sources and a description of the subsequent use of recommended ser- vices was obtained from those agencies to whom clients were referred. -Actual/expected findings & relationships to legislative or policy issues. The rate of completed service referrals was 84 percent in the case of the telephone sample and nearly 100 percent in the face-to-face group. The telephone ser- vice was utilized appropriately and not excessively. Approx- imately 80 percent of the cases referred were accepted by the agency providing services. The average unit cost per client served by phone was $1.30. The cost of referrals ranged from $1.33 to 2.22 for simple cases and $32.00 for complex. The Home Helps costs were higher because of outreach, escort, and transportation services that were also provided. A further finding was that formal referral ser- vices are far superior to informal and traditional methods of communication.

A 208-unit apartment house for the aged and handicapped, adjacent to a hospital with various supportive services is evaluated. Persons living in the medically oriented housing are matched with a control group and measured for social integration, psychological well-being, functional health status, need for hospitalization and longevity. In addition, intensive cost analysis and a supplemental study of patients admitted from long-term care facilities is being conducted. -Actual/expected findings and relationships to legislative or policy issues. Preliminary findings show those residing in medically oriented housing have a significantly lower death rate and fewer returns to long-term care facilities. This finding reflects increased quality of care and indicates cost savings though no hard cost data is yet available.

Patients at six demonstration sites were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. Under authority of Section 222(d) of the Social Security Amendments of 1972, Medicare payments for day care and/or homemaker services provided by the demonstration contractors were authorized for the experimental group for the year. The services of an evaluation contractor were procured for the development of a uniform experimental protocol, oversight of the data collection, and data processing. Primary analysis of differences in patient functional levels, costs, and service utilization associated with the provision and reimbursement of the experimental services will be conducted by NCHSR staff on an intramural basis. -Actual/expected findings & relationships to legislative or policy issues.

To determine whether adult day care and/or homemaker services are cheaper than nursing home care, whether they are effective, and whether they are used by patients who might otherwise use nursing homes. -Scope and approach. Data have been collected from six demonstration projects which ran for a year and served about 900 patients in day care or homemaker services. Another 900 patients were followed as a control group. Data collected includes cost, health status change, utilization, and organizational information. -Actual/expected findings and relationships to legislative or policy issues. We need to know if those who use day care are actually substituting it for nursing homes rather than other delivery modes, and we need to know for whom day care is effective. Concerning homemaker services, we need more information on costs as well as on who uses it and how effective it is. If either or both of these new care modes prove to be effective and cheaper substitutes for other modes of care, Medicare, Medicaid or national health insurance might be made more cost effective by covering them.

Such a classification scheme could be an important tool for patient placement, for predicting utilization, and for planning and evaluating both institutional and non-institutional long-term services. 196 SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: In response to your letter of December 14, 1977, toCommissioner Cardwell, enclosed is a summary of the Social Security Administra-tion's activities relating to aging during 1977. As requested, we have also includeda summary of SSA's planned activities for 1978-79. If we can be of further assistance, please let us know. Sincerely yours, ELMER W. SMITH,Associate Commissioner for Program Policy and Planning.Enclosure. The Social Security Administration (SSA) administers the Federal old-age,survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI) program (title II of the SocialSecurity Act). OASDI is the basic method in the United States of assuring incometo individuals and families when workers retire, become disabled, or die. Thebasic idea of the cash benefits program is that while they are working, employeespay social security contributions through an earmarked social security tax whichis matched by their employers. Self-employed people also contribute a percentageof their net earnings. Then, when earnings stop or are reduced because of retire-ment in old age, death, or disability, cash benefits are paid to partially replace theearnings that were lost. SSA also administers the supplemental security income (SSI) program for theaged, blind, and disabled (title XVI of the Social Security Act). SSI provides aFederal floor of income for eligible individuals with limited income and resourcesand, in most cases, supplements income from other sources, including socialsecurity benefits. SSA is also responsible under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act,for payment of black lung benefits to coal miners and their families who appliedfor those benefits prior to July 1973 and for payment of black lung benefits tocertain survivors of miners. Under a reorganization of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfarein March 1977, Federal administrative responsibility for the medicare programwas transferred from SSA to a new organization, the Health Care FinancingAdministration. Local social security offices will continue to process applicationsfor entitlement to medicare and assist individuals in filing claims for benefits.The reorganization also resulted in the transfer to SSA of certain administrative functions formerly administered by the Social and Rehabilitation Service. One major change is that SSA now has Federal administrative responsibility for thecash payments part of the aid to families with dependent children (AFDC)program (title IV-A of the Social Security Act). AFDC provides financial aid to needy families with children. The cost is shared by the Federal, State, and localgovernments. The program is operated by State, local, or county authorities within a framework of conditions set forth in the act and Federal regulations. Also transferred to SSA in the reorganization were the Indochinese refugee and Cuban refugee programs. In addition, the Commissioner of Social Security wasmade Director of the Office of Child Support Enforcement. That office has Federal administrative responsibility for the program to enforce the support obligations owed by absent parents to their children, locate absent parents, establish paternity, and obtain child support. Following is a summary of beneficiary levels today, selected program activities and social security-related legislation during 1977: I. OASDI BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES At the beginning of 1977, about 93 percent of all Americans age 65 and over were drawing social security benefits or were eligible to draw benefits if they ortheir spouses retired; about 95 percent of the people who reached 65 in 1977 were eligible for benefits. Probably 96 to 98 percent of the aged will be eligible for social security benefits by the end of the century. At the end of September 1977, 33.7 million people were receiving monthly social security cash benefits (an increase from 32.7 million in September 1976). Of these beneficiaries, 17.6 million were retired workers, 3.6 million were dependents of retired workers, 166,000 were uninsured individuals receiving \"Special Age-72\" (Prouty) benefits, 4.8 million were disabled workers and their dependents, and 7.5 million were survivors of deceased workers. 197 The monthly rate of benefits for September 1977 was $7.1 billion compared to $6.3 billion for September 1976. Of this amount, $4.7 billion was paid to retired workers and their dependents, $889 million was paid to disabled workers and their dependents, $1.5 billion was paid to survivors, and $13 million was paid to special age-72 beneficiaries. Retired workers received an average benefit in September 1977 of $241 (up from $223 in September 1976), while disabled workers received an average benefit of $264 (up from $244). Retired workers receiving their first social security benefits in September 1977 averaged $254, while disabled workers received average initial benefits of $295. During fiscal year 1977 (October 1976-September 1977), $82.1 billion in social security cash benefits were paid compared to $71.0 billion in fiscal year 1976 (July 1975-June 1976). Of that total, retired workers and their dependents received $52.1 billion, disabled workers and their dependents received $11.1 billion, sur- vivors received $18.7 billion, and special age-72 beneficiaries received $162 million. In addition, lump-sum death payments amounted to $321 million. II. SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES Beginning in July 1977, maximum monthly Federal (SSI) payment levels in- creased from $167.80 to $177.80 for an individual, and from $251.80 to $266.70 for a couple. During fiscal year 1977, slightly over $6 billion in benefits (Federal and federally administered State supplements) consisting of $4.7 billion Federal funds and $1.4 billion in State supplements were paid. Of the 4.2 million bene- ficiaries on the rolls as of September 1977, 77,000 were blind, 2.1 million disabled, and 2.1 million aged. During September 1977, total payments of $531.2 million were made; $203.1 million to the aged, $12.4 million to the blind, and $315.7 million to the disabled. Total payments in fiscal year 1977 of slightly over $6 billion represent an increase of about $0.1 billion over fiscal year 1976 payments of $5.9 billion, which included $4.5 billion Federal payments and $1.4 billion federally administered State supplementary payments. III. BLACK LUNG BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES During September 1977, about 476,000 individuals received $77.1 million in black lung benefits from general revenues which were administered by the Social Security Administration. Of these individuals, 155,259 were miners who received $46.2 million, while 144,280 widows and 176,322 other dependents received $30.9 million. During fiscal year 1977, SSA administered black lung payments in the amount of $939.5 million. Black lung benefits increased by 7.05 percent in November 1977 due to a general cost-of-living increase adjustment under the law. The monthly payment to a coal miner disabled by black lung disease increased to $219.90 from $205.40. The monthly benefits for a miner or widow with one dependent is $329.80, and with two dependents is $384.80. The maximum monthly benefit payable when there are three or more dependents is $439.70. IV. OMBUDSMAN PROJECT In October 1977 SSA completed a 12-month demonstration of an ombudsman service in four locations throughout the U.S.-Boston, Dallas-Fort Worth, and the States of Georgia and Washington. The mission of the ombudsman was to attempt to resolve social security prob- lems which persons felt they had been unable to resolve satisfactorily through regular channels. Data collected during the 12-month period is being evaluated. The independent contractor selected for the evaluation of the project will provide an overall eval- uation report during 1978. In addition, SSA has studied the types of problems brought to the attention of the ombudsman to try to identify areas where improve- ments in policies, procedures or services might be beneficial. V. PLAN14ED ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS 1978-79 Five major SSA initiatives have been approved by DHEW for monitoring at the secretarial level, with goals targeted for achievement by March 1979: -Initiative number one is concerned with improving the operation of the dis- ability insurance program by achieving a 70-day mean processing time for 198 initial title II allowed claims and by increasing the clear decisional accuracyof initial, title II, State disability determinations to 99 percent and overallaccuracy to 90 percent. -Initiative number two is concerned with developing and beginning implemen-tation of a comprehensive plan for improvement of AFDC administration.Included is a goal to reduce the national AFDC payment error rate to 7.3percent. -Initiative number three is concerned with improving the operation of the sup-plemental security income program through achievement of the following ob-jectives: reduce the payment error rate below 6 percent; process 2.2 millionoverpayment disposition decisions; and reduce initial claims mean processingtime for aged cases to 27 days, and for blind and disabled cases, to 50 days.-Initiative number four is concerned with improvement of the administrationof the child support enforcement program by (1) increasing the number ofcases in which collections are made from 650,000 to 750,000 (15 percent) andby increasing the amount of collections from $120 million to $148 million (23percent), and (2) completing the first round of annual audits required by lawto assure that each State is operating an effective child support enforcementprogram; and -Initiative number five is concerned with reducing the volume of pending hear-ings from the September 1977 level of 92,000 to 76,000 by March 1979, andmaintaining the number of appeals pending at the current level of 6,000throughout the period. VI. SOCIAL SECURITY-RELATED LEGISLATION DURING 1977 On December 20, 1977, Public Law 95-216 (H.R. 9346), the Social SecurityAmendments of 1977, was signed by President Carter. This legislation will assurethe financial stability of the social security OASDI program well into the nextcentury. The legislation includes a number of important changes in the benefitstructure, in addition to increasing the revenue available to the OASDI program.The enclosed Committee on Ways and Means' \"Summary of the ConferenceAgreement\" provides a brief description of the provisions of the legislation.Other legislation affecting the social security programs include the followingpublic laws: -Public Law 95-30 (H.R. 3477), signed May 23, 1977, terminates special $50payments authorized under the 1975 Tax Reform Act; extends the earnedincome tax credit through 1978; changes the effective date of the provisionsin the 1976 Tax Reform Act regarding exclusion from coverage of self-employment income earned abroad by U.S. citizens to taxable years beginningafter December 31, 1976; amends the rules under which Federal payments,including social security benefits, can be garnished under applicable Statelaws and establishes specific percentages of the Federal payments and benefitsto be garnished; and makes technical changes in the child support enforce-ment program. -Public Law 95-59 (H.R. 1404), signed June 30, 1977, extends present lawprovision for food stamp eligibility for certain SSI recipients and extends for 2 years the Federal funding for child support enforcement for families not eligible for welfare. -Public Law 95-113, Omnibus Farm bill (S. 275), signed September 29, 1977,includes amendments to the Food Stamp Act which requires the development of a system under which (1) a single interview would be conducted to determine eligibility for food stamps and AFDC when the same agency administers both programs; (2) a single application would be used to determine food stamp and AFDC eligibility when all members of the food stamp household are included in the AFDC grant; (3) information available in an open or recently closed AFDC file would be used as a basis for certifying a household's food stamp eligibility to the extent that reasonably verified information is available in such file; and (4) households composed entirely of SSI recipients could apply for food stamps at SSA offices and be certified for eligibility utilizing infor- mation in SSI files. The act also (1) authorizes (but does not require) regula-tions permitting social security applicants and beneficiaries to apply and be certified for food stamps in SSA offices; and (2) requires the establishment of uniform national standards of eligibility (with specific variances prescribed for Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) and setscertain poverty guidelines as the basic income standards of eligibility for the food stamp program. 1199 -Public Law 95-145 (H.R. 7769), a supplemental appropriations bill, signed on October 28, 1977, contains a provision relating to the treatment of Indo- chinese refugees. As enacted, the bill (1) creates a record of admission for permanent residence in the case of certain refugees, (2) phasesdown the Indochinese refugee program over a 4-year period at 100 percent Federal funding the first year, 75 percent the second, 50 percent the third, and 25 percent the fourth, and (3) authorizes a total of $25 million for special projects over the 4-year period. -Public Law 95-171 (H.R. 3387), Child Program Amendments, signed on November 12, 1977, includes an SSI amendmens which extends the disaster relief payments exemption to all disasters occurring after May 31, 1976, and provides that disaster relief payments and any interest on the payments would not be counted as income or assets for a period of 9 months after receipt of the funds. ITEM 6. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT MARCH 1, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in reply to your letter requesting this Depart- ment to submit a summary of our major actions on aging during 1977. We are pleased to submit this information in order to cooperate with the efforts of your committee, as well as to provide the public with as much informa- tion as possible concerning actions of the Department of Housing and Urban Development which respond to the housing environment needs of our older citizens. Sincerely' GENO C. BARONI, Assistant Secretary. [Enclosure.] NEIGHBORHOODS, VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATIONS AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ELDERLY PROGRAMS DIVISION The Elderly Programs Division (formerly the Office of Elderly and Handi- capped Policy), located in the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Neighborhood and Consumer Affairs, serves as a liaison within HUD for matters pertaining to housing and related facilities and services for the elderly. Major responsibilities assigned to the organization include participating in the development or revision of all HUD policies, programs and procedures affect- ing the elderly; coordinating HUD elderly initiatives and responses; and repre- senting HUD in activities with other Federal, State and municipal or private organizations relating to the elderly. During 1977, the Elderly Program Division actively participated in the revi- sions of the section 202 program and participated in the screening and evaluation of applications for direct loans under this program. Funds totaling $630,000,000 were awarded to sponsors for the construction and rehabilitation of over 24,000 units of housing for the elderly and handicapped. Throughout the year, the office arranged numerous meetings and discussions between HUD executives and representatives of various major organizations representing older Americans. The sessions served to bring to the attention of the Department the immediate concerns of these organizations regarding elderly/ handicapped housing and to suggest ways in which the Department could respond to them. In turn, the Department was afforded an opportunity to explain its programs and policies with respect to housing the elderly and handicapped. NVACP CONDOMINIUM ACTIVITIES AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE FAMILY According to the 1970 census, one-third of condominium and cooperative owners were older than 65 years. Although the HUD Condominium/Cooperative Study indicated that elderly now represent a much smaller percentage (19 per- cent) of such owners, it is clear that condominium housing is a major housing form for the elderly. Thus any HUD action which improves condominium ownership will have significant positive impact on the elderly. The proposed Condominium Consumer Protection Act developed by the real estate practices staff and OGC would benefit the elderly in several ways. The standards and disclosure provisions will provide all condominium consumers with better protection in areas such as escrowing deposits and with better informationby requiring that the purchaser receive a variety of information. The provisionson recreation leases should particularly benefit the fixed-income elderly in Floridaby voiding escalator clauses and providing a means for declaring such leasesunconscionable. Those tenants in conversions, a significant proportion of whomare elderly, would receive a 180 day notice to vacate under the proposed bill.The work of the Condominium Task Force composed of FNMA, FHLMC,VA and HUD should also result in benefits to the elderly. Although the effectof the task force cannot be determined until its work product has been imple-mented, the task force's objective is to reduce costs through a uniform applicationform and facilitate resales through uniformity of documentation. The elderly,along with all condominium owners, should benefit from this effort. HOUSING CONSUMER PROGRAMS DIVISION Throughout the year, the Division of Housing Consumer Programs has main-tained liaison with the Administration on Aging and with national voluntaryorganizations dealing with the elderly. Numerous meetings have been attendedand materials and information on services to the elderly have been exchanged.Agreements in effect between HUD and AoA on nutrition and social servicesfor the elderly in HUD-assisted housing, as well as-agreements between HUDand DOT and HUD and HEW, continue to produce programs and services.Approximately 800 local housing authorities have provided facilities for thenutrition program during the past year, with some housing agencies acting asgrantees and providing additional services such as recreation, health and nutritioneducation, information and referral, and transportation. These services have alsobenefited elderly residents in surrounding neighborhoods.The Department is represented on the AoA Task Force on Nutrition, as wellas on the Interagency Task Force on Information and Referral. In addition, thedivision is represented on the HUD Task Force on Elderly. Through regionaland field office Community Services Advisors, the Division has continued toprovide technical assistance on services to the elderly. INTERSTATE LAND SALES REGISTRATION Congress passed the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act in 1968, to givethe public a measure of protection against fraudulent and deceptive land salesoperations. The act is administered through HUD's Office of Interstate LandSales Registration. Although the act is intended to provide protection for allconsumers, it is evident that a great number of potential victims of fraudulentland sales could be the elderly. The property report is the key to the protection available to consumers underthe act, since developers are required by law to give the prospective purchaser aproperty report before or at the time of signing a contract. The disclosure con-tained in a property report covers such items as (1) existence of mortgages, liensand other encumbrances; (2) whether contract payments are set aside in a special (escrow) fund; (3) availability of recreational facilities, where and when; and (4)availability of water and sewer facilities or of wells and septic tanks.During 1977, the Office of Interstate Land Sales Registration has continued withits project to make the disclosure documents easier to understand and to simplify compliance for developers while improving the effectiveness of the act in protecting the interests of consumers including the elderly. The project included the publica- tion of proposed rules for comment as well as the hiring of a contractor to assist in the development of a revised disclosure document which will be easier for the con- sumer to understand. The process will result in the publication of revised proposed rules sometime in 1978. OFFICE OF POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH Title V of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 authorizes and directs the Secretary to undertake programs of research, studies, testing anddemonstrations relating to the mission and programs of the Department. Section 815 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 strengthened the role of HUD research in the areas of elderly and handicapped by specifically encouraging demonstrations into the problems of members of special user groups,including the elderly and handicapped. 201 The HUD research program serves as a stimulus for positive change by con- ducting technological and managerial research, and by demonstrating new methods for application of government and private expertise. The program serves as a national focal point for housing and community development research, and as a central point for research, analysis, data collection and dissemination. The focus on research related to the problems of the elderly and handicapped is in our program of special user reserch, although other program areas such as community design research and economic affairs also support research which im- pacts on the elderly and handicapped. The mission of the special user group research program is to design, conduct and support research and demonstration projects whose results will improve housing conditions and related housing and community services for the elderly, the handicapped, and other members of identifiable special user groups. The special user research program is conducted in the Officc of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Research and Demonstration. CURRENT SPECIAL USER RESEARCH The Office of Policy Development and Research has recently completed or is currently sponsoring several projects related to the housing problems of the elderly and handicapped, and additional projects will be undertaken during 1978. The following list demonstrates the scope of these recently completed and ongoing projects: p A guidebook on the design of low rise housing for the elderly based on be- havioral criteria has been completed. The purpose of the book is to translate the available social research on the needs of older people into performance criteria and possible design solutions in a format useful to the design professional. -The results of a conference on congregate housing for the elderly funded by both HUD and the Administration on Aging have been published. Papers included in the book cover the following topics: the current situation of the elderly, the market for congregate housing, a design program, research utiliza- tion, management, and the financing of both the physical structure and the necessary services. -An interagency study of elderly victimization is currently being sponsored by HUD, the Administration on Aging, the Community Services Adminis- tration, and the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration in six cities around the country. The project has two purposes: to prevent victimization of the elderly and to provide services for those who are victimized. HUD is providing the funding for the evaluation of the project. -The Division of Special Studies of the office of Policy Development and Research has conducted an evaluation of the section 202 program. They looked at 78 projects in 6 areas of the country and compared them to 145 projects built under sections 231, 236, and 202/236. Preliminary analysis shows the viability of the program resulted from its small size, the careful selection of sponsors, and HUD's flexibility in providing assistance to troubled projects. The new 202 program is likely to differ considerably because of its higher interest rates, its tie to Section 8 and its larger size -Work continued on the development of a new American National Standard for accessibility for the handicapped, ANSI A117.1. The first round of balloting resulted in numerous changes to the document, which, according to ANSI's regulations, required a second ballot. We are now awaiting the results of that ballot, and hope to submit the standard to ANSI early this Spring. -As a follow-up to the ANSI project, a contract has been signed to construct several single-family and multi-family units according to the new standard. Detailed costs analyses will be conducted, as will marketability surveys. Once the units are occupied, follow-up visits will be made to discuss the usability of the special features of accessibility. -A study of the implications in terms of construction, management and service costs of providing integrated housing for the disabled and able bodied has been completed. Depending upon building type, the construction cost increases are minimal, as are the needs for management services. The final report contains design and service recommendations and a detailed cost study. -A demonstration of small group homes for the handicapped authorized under Section 815 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 is being undertaken to develop a better understanding of the small group housing approach as an alternative to institutionalization. This project will provide technical assistance to, and evaluate the development experience of a group of sponsors who are building community-based residential facilities for the handicapped through the use of the section 202 and section 8 pro- grams. As a result of this demonstration project, HUD will be given recom- mendations for establishing a small group home program within the Department. -In cooperation with the New Communities Administration, the Office of Policy Development and Research is also sponsoring a project to develop barrier free villages within two of the title VII new communities. The con- tractor is working with the developers of St. Charles and Harbison, providing them with technical assistance in the design of these two villages and their component parts such as residential, commercial, recreational and industrial facilities. The products resulting from the project will allow other developers to incorporate these features of accessibility in their new towns, planned unit developments, and other large scale projects. FUTURE RESEARCH During this fiscal year the Department will be starting several new projects which relate to the needs of the elderly and handicapped: -A follow-up to our small group home demonstration which will evaluate these projects after occupancy in an effort to see how well the site, design, manage- ment and service program serve the residents. -A cost study of the implications of section 504 for the retrofitting of public housing, combined with a similar analysis of the costs of retrofitting for energy conservation and modernization. -Analysis of the determinants of elderly homeowners undertaking maintenance and making repairs to their units with emphasis on effects of income, health, and household structure. -Analysis of the extent to which the provision of housekeeping and chore services affects the quality of housing occupied by elderly homeowners. This analysis will also contrast the characteristics of households receiving publicly provided services with those who are not. FEDERAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE ADMINISTRATION In response to service proposals by the affected State and Area Agencies on Aging, FDAA financed in part the cost of providing disaster services to the elderly following three major disaster declarations by the President in 1977. In southeastern Kentucky, funds in the amount of $20,196 were obligated; in southwestern West Virginia, $18,934; and in the Johnstown, Pa. area, $51,404. These amounts represent the contribution of FDAA over and above the amount provided by the Commissioner on Aging for the required services, according to the provisions of the September 10, 1978 memo of agreement between FDAA and AoA. In order to comply with the legislative authorities in the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-28S) and the Older Americans Act of 1965, the funds were made available to the respective agencies on aging for services such as out- reach programs (including salaries and transportation for outreach follow-up services for elderly and other disaster victims to avail themselves of the various services offered under the Disaster Relief Act) and transportation for disaster victims. FDAA continues to recognize the valuable services AoA can provide under its own statutory authority, and also recognizes the areas where, with funding assist- ance, AoA can use its expertise in providing and supplementing services authorized by the Disaster Relief Act. In 1978, FDAA will continue to meet the identified needs of elderly disaster victims by working closely with the Administration on Aging and will continue to work under the memo of agreement, which provides for cooperation on the regional level, provision of services under the Older Americans Act, coordination between the area aging agencies and the Federal Coordinating Officer, and provision of special services under mission assignment to AoA (as described above). 203 The FDAA Administrator and the Commissioner on Aging signed an agreement on September 10, 1976, which sets forth common goals and procedures in disasters affecting the elderly. The agreement provides for: (1) Cooperation between the Regional Office on Aging and the FDAA Regional Office, in assessment of the needs of the elderly; (2) Provision of services under the Older Americans Act (such as meals, transportation outreach services) to elderly disaster victims; (3) Cooperation of the area agencies on aging with the Federal coordinating officer, whose role in the disaster area is to oversee the provision of all Federal disaster assistance. (4) Outreach programs conducted by the area agencies; and (5) Provision of special services to the elderly and others when a mission assignment is given to AoA by the FDAA Administrator under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974. The Federal Disaster Assistance Administration recognizes that the Adminis- tration on Aging (AoA) is a valuable source of assistance to elderly disaster vic- tims under its own statutory authority, and desires to cooperate during presi- dentially-declared disasters for our mutual benefit. The AoA continues to support elderly disaster victims by providing services immediately after the disaster and in conjunction with disaster assistance centers established by FDAA. In Idaho Falls, Idaho, following the collapse of the Teton Dam, AoA provided outreach services, meals, transportation services, and clean-up crews to assist elderly dis- aster victims. These services enabled them to resume daily activities, and to avail themselves of the other disaster assistance programs available. In recent disasters in Colorado, southern California and Illinois, the network established by the AoA provided a link between the elderly disaster victim and the disaster centers by conducting effective outreach programs. As a follow-up to the large and successful programs of assistance to the elderly after the Omaha, Nebr. tornadoes of 1976, AoA has produced a planning docu- ment which can be made available to area agencies on aging for use in disaster situations. NEW COMMUNITIES ADMINISTRATION Through legislation passed in 1970, the Federal Government can guarantee mortgages for developers of large scale new communities which meet certain re- quirements, including provision of an economic base, provision of substantial amounts of low and moderate income housing, good physical and social planning, and provision of adequate community amenities and facilities including education, health, culture and recreation. New community projects approved for Federal assistance will provide housing, community facilities, and amenities which will have special value to the elderly and handicapped. These include barrier-free access to public buildings, pathway systems separated from vehicular traffic, and ready access from homes to shopping, recreational facilities, and neighborhood facilities. RESEARCH STUDY In coordination with HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research, the New Communities Administration has sponsored a research study to design whole villages in new communities to be barrier-free and thereby accessible to the elderly and handicapped. The 14-month study to be completed in February 1978 used two new communities, St. Charles, Md. and Harbison, S.C. as case studies to develop a process, manuals, and design and cost materials for barrier-free planning. Using a sensitizing program, nonhandicapped members of the development staff \"as- sumed\" temporary handicaps as blindness, rheumatoid arthritis, and paraplegia, while they attempted to perform daily tasks including shopping, eating in a public cafeteria, using public transportation, sidewalks, etc. After the sensitivity program, development staff and consultant staff replanned whiole villages to be completely barrier free. The changes or additions required to achieve a minimum level of barrier-free accessibility were found to be small-between 2-3 percent of total development costs. Both new communities have pledged to implement the recommendations of the study. In addition, the report will be made available to the public, as will a slide presentation which describes the sensitivity process used in the study. NEW COMMUNITY PROJECTS Two of the title VII new community projects have completed housing projects for the elderly. On Roosevelt Island, N.Y., 284 units for the elderly and handi- 24-084 0 -78 -14 204 capped have been completed, and rented. The developer continues to work withthe city of New York on programs to utilize the 8,000 square foot ground flooractivity center, which contains offices, meeting rooms and a fully equipped kitchenand dining facilities.Roosevelt Island residents have ready access to health services offered by exist-ing hospitals on the Island. Barrier-free access to building and facilities is providedin the new community design, the apartement structures are multiuse, some con-tainiug schools and social services. Private autos are banned from the Island'sstreets and minibus transportation provides ready access throughout the Island.An aerial trainway is now operating between the Island and Manhattan.St. Charles, Md. opened a 96-unit housing project assisted by 221(d)(4)financing. Half of these units are expected to be rented by elderly persons. St.Charles is also proceeding with what it calls the third age project. This project willconsist of 100-units of 236 housing for elderly and handicapped. Both these proj-ects consist of single-story quadraplex housing, making them more easily acces-sible to elderly and handicapped. Additionally, they are sited to be convenient toshopping and transportation. Harbison, S.C. was approved in 1977 for a 110 unit 202 project. It is scheduledto open in 1979. HOUSING SECTION 8 IMPLEMENTATION The problems of aging and particularly the housing needs of the elderly arecontinual concerns of the Department. The implementation of the new section 8housing assistance payments program will both assist the construction of elderlyhousing projects and provide an alternative for those who prefer to avoid livingin projects housing only elderly persons.The section 8 housing assistance payments program authorized by the U.S.Housing Act of 1937, as amended, replaces and considerably expands and improvesupon the section 23 leasing program which enabled low-income families includingelderly families to occupy existing standard rental units, as well as to permit afamily to shop for and choose its own dwelling, rather than leaving the selectionto HUD or the local housing authority.The section 8 program provides assistance to encourage the construction of newunits, the substantial rehabilitation of units, and the use of standard existingunits. It encourages the participation of both private developers and housingagencies. An importantly, section 8 can maximize the use of the existing housingstock, while inducing production of additional units in markets where the supplyof existing units is inadequate to meet all housing needs, including those of theelderly. The legislation requires the section 8 projects serve lower-income and verylow-income families. Further, some projects may be developed with a mix ofassisted and unassisted families. In addition, the act recognizes that the elderly have special housing needs. Thepreference for projects with 20 percent or less of the units subsidized under section8 does not apply in cases of projects for the elderly.No family assisted under section 8 may pay more than 25 percent of its incomefor rent, but the rental payment may be as low as 15 percent, depending on familyincome, size, and medical or other unusual expenses.Several other features of the section 8 program should be of special advantage toolder Americans: Eligibility for section 8 assistance has been expanded to include two or moreunrelated elderly, disabled, or handicapped persons, who are living together,or one of more such individuals living with another person who is essential totheir care or well being; FHA multifamily mortgage insurance programs will be made available toboth section 8 developers and nonprofit sponsors to provide the projectfinancing they need for new construction or substantial rehabilitation. Publichousing agencies also may use FHA's section 221(d) (3) market rate multi-family insurance program to finance construction or rehabilitation of section 8 assisted units. (Development for profit-motivated mortgagors will generallyuse the section 221(d) (4) program or conventional financing.)Another program feature of particular relevance to elderly citizens is the pro-vision of congregate facilities. The term \"congregate housing\" generally refers toprojects in which some or all of the dwelling units do not have full kitchens, wherethe residents are served by a central kitchen and dining facility. This arrangement 205 permits some of the conveniences and economics of communal living to be built into rental projects. Assistance for such housing will be available under the public housing, section 202 and section 8 programs. However, there is a statutory limit of 10 percent on the amount of annual contributions contract authority which may be used for this purpose in any fiscal year. sECTION 202-DIRECT LOANS FOR HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY OR HANDICAPPED The section 202 program was first introduced as a part of the Housing Act of 1959 to provide direct Federal long-term loans for the construction of housing for the elderly or handicapped. The program was intended to serve elderly persons whose income was above public housing levels but still insufficient to secure ade- quate housing on the private market. The section 202 program was amended by the 1974 Housing and Community Development Act to change the method of determining the interest rate (previously set at 3 percent and to provide for the use of section 8 housing assistance payments for projects constructed or substan- tially rehabilitated under the program. The interest rate, applying to all loans closed through September 30, 1978, is 7% during the construction period and 6% thereafter. HUD has been authorized to lend $2.35 billion through fiscal year 1978. At the end of fiscal year 1977, 492 projects totalling more than 50,000 units had been approved. As of December 1, 1977, 42 projects with 5,500 units were under construction. Regulations are being amended to provide for a decentralized program in fiscal year 1978. Funds totalling $750 million, for fiscal year 1978, which will provide about 24,000 units, are available. As soon as final regulations are ready, an invita- tion will be published in the Federal Register advising prospective sponsors how to proceed. OTHER SUBSIDIZED HOUSING PROGRAMS FOR THE ELDERLY Rental Assistance-Section 286(f) (2) and Rent Supplement Section 236(f) (2) also was added to the National Housing Act by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. It is designed to assist tenants in section 236 projects who cannot afford to pay basic rents within 25 percent of their income. It provides that HUD will make rental assistance payments to project owners on behalf of such tenants. The program has been structured along lines similar to those for the rent supplement program. Generally, rental assistance payments are not made with regard to more than 20 percent of the units in a project. However, in the case of projects for the elderly, this may be increased to 40 percent, and in some cases to even higher levels. During calendar year 1976, 1,253 section 236 units occupied by the elderly were made eligible for rental assistance payments. In November 1975, OMB issued an instruction that no further unit allocations could be made under the rent supplement program. Since that time only dollar increases have been provided for existing unit allocations to cover increased operating expenses. Section 236 Project Applications Firm commitments for 21 projects consisting of 3,250 units were issued during the year ending September 30, 1977. During this same period construction started on 51 projects consisting of 7,188 units. As of September 30, 1977, 460,901 units in 4,220 projects have been insured under section 236. A significant number of these projects are partially or totally available for the elderly. Public Housing for the Elderly The public housing program was initiated by the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (Public Law 412, 75th Congress), \"to provide financial assistance to the States and political subdivisions thereof for the elimination of unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions, for the eradication of slums, for the provisions of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of low-income and for the reduction of unem- ployment and the stimulation of business activity.\" HUD provides technical, professional, and financial assistance to public housing agencies (PHA's) for the planning, development and management of low-income housing. 206 Today, the primary goal of public housing is to serve families who cannot afford to pay enough to cause private enterprise in their locality to build an ade- quate supply of decent, safe and sanitary dwellings for their use. Single persons who are elderly, handicapped, or displaced, are also eligible. To assure that only such families and individuals will be served, income eligibility limits are set and enforced locally. Amendments to the U.S. Housing Act by the Housing Act of 1956 made it possible to admit as tenants in public housing low-income single persons who were 65 or older. It also authorized the construction of units specifically designed forthe elderly. Subsequent legislative changes, such as the Housing Act of 1959,changed the age requirements for elderly persons and families to conform to theSocial Security Act (at that time, 65 for men and 62 for women), and included as\"elderly\", disabled persons 50 years of age and over; the Housing Act of 1961changed the eligibility age for males from 65 to 62 as a result of the 1961 amend-ment to the Social Security Act, eliminated the minimum age requirement forpersons qualifying as elderly by reason of disability. The Housing Act of 1964permitted admission to low-rent housing of single low-income persons who aredisplaced by urban renewal or other governmental action, or who are handicapped.Although new applications were not accepted between January 1973 and early1976 (there was a moratorium on the public housing program), the Department continued to process bona fide commitments during this suspension period. Inaddition, $50 million was provided from the fiscal year 1976 Appropriations Actto fund public housing programs. The Department utilized these funds to allowPHA acquisition of HUD-owned, HUD-held and HUD-insured properties. Recent authorization and appropriations acts have reinstituted the program and on January 31, 1977, final regulations were published to be effective February 7, which will govern the implementation of the traditional public housing program.Housing for the elderly may be provided if a determination is made by the HUD field office that the housing needs of the elderly are not being met by other HUD- assisted programs proportionately to their share of total housing needs in the jurisdiction of the PHA. The 1977 appropriations act established a set-aside of $120 million for the public housing program, and this amount (together with roughly $50 million from prioryear balances) will be used for public housing in the current year to fund new projects, amendments to previously approved projects, and to the extent needed, will also be used for the small number of remaining bona fide units. It is anticipatedthat after funding the outstanding pipeline, the available authority will permit the approval of roughly 15,000 units of new construction and 13,000 existing units. UNSUBSIDIZED PROGRAMS Section 231-Mortgage Insurance for Elderly Housing Under section 231 of the National Housing Act, as amended, the Department is authorized to insure lenders against losses on mortages used for construction or rehabilitation of rental accommodations for older persons (aged 62 years or more,married or single). Section 231 is HUD's principal program for unsubsidized rental housing for the elderly. Nonprofit as well as profit-motivated sponsors are eligible under the program, and section 8 housing assistance payments can be made available in connection with it. During the year ending November 30, 1976, firm commitments were issued for 104 projects consisting of 10,825 units, bringing the total activity under section 231 mortgage insurance to 371 projects consisting of 53,382 units. Sections 221(d) (3) Market Rate and 221 (d) (4) of the National Housing Act-Mortgage Insurance Programs for Multifamily Housing While these programs are not specifically geared to the elderly, they also are available to sponsors as alternatives to the section 231 program. Section 221(d)(3) authorizes the Department to provide insurance to finance the construction or rehabilitation of rental or cooperative structures for housing low and moderate-income single persons under 62 years of age. Priority in occu- pancy is given to those displaced by urban renewal or other governmental action. (Because they tend to be residential occupants of old and deteriorating urban neighborhoods, a greater proportion of older persons than younger persons are affected in these areas.) The above features are present in the section 221(d) (4) program except that this program is available to public and private profit-motivated sponsored as opposed to nonprofit sponsors under section 221(d) (3). Section 223(f) Mortgage Insurance for the Purchase or Refinancing of Existing Multi- family Housing Projects This program offers mortgage insurance for existing facilities, including housing for the elderly, where repair costs do not exceed 15 percent of project value. The program can be used either in connection with the purchase of a project, or for refinancing only. To the extent that real estate liquidity is enhanced, the avail- ability of section 223(f) encourages investment in residential real estate of all kinds. Prior to its being added to the National Housing Act in August 1974, project mortgage insurance could be provided only for substantial rehabilitation or new construction. Section 232-Mortgage Insurance for Nursing Homes/Intermediate Care Facilities The primary objective of the section 232 program is to assist and promote the construction and rehabilitation of long-term care facilities. Since 1959, when the program was enacted, the Department has insured mortgages for 1,110 facilities providing 125,289 beds. Approximately 90 percent of the residents of nursing homes are elderly. HEW's medicare and medicaid programs have made it possible for many, who would not otherwise have been able to do so, to benefit from the services provided under this program. During the year ending September 30, 1977, firm commitments for insurance covering 85 section 232 projects were issued representing 11,190 beds. Construc- tion starts were achieved for 90 projects representing 11,468 beds. The recent addition of subsection (i) to this program provides for FHA-insured supplemental loans to finance installation of fire safety equipment in these facilities. These loans are not limited to section 232 facilities and may prove useful in enabling conventionally financed nursing homes to comply with HEW and State requirements concerning fire safety. COMMUNITY PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT The Office of Community Planning and Development administers programs impacting on the elderly and handicapped under the authority of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 and the \"701\" comprehensive planning and management assistance programs. The authorization is for the conduct of both the community development block grant (CDBG) program and the compre- hensive planning program. Neither program is specifically directed to the elderly and handicapped, but activities benefiting these persons are eligible under the 1974 act and may be carried out at the discretion of communities receiving com- munity development funds. 701 COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING ASSISTANCE The comprehensive planning assistance program provides two-thirds matching grants to all States, some 330 areawide planning agencies, several hundred cities over 50,000 and about 700 localities. Planning for the elderly is a specific eligible activity under the 701 program. Grantees at their option may undertake plan- ning for such elderly concerns as availability of affordable housing, the develop- ment of improved transportation systems serving the elderly, and the provision of health and other social services for senior citizens. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS Chart I presents information on the programing of community development block grant funds for activities in neighborhoods where there is a low (0 to 9 percent of the population), medium (10 to 19 percent) and high (20 to 100 percent) concentration of elderly citizens. Entitlement communities are programing 50 percent of their CDBG funds for areas with a medium (10 to 19 percent) concen- tration of elderly. Chart II shows the distribution of CDBG funds programed for major com- munity development activities by areas of elderly concentration. In areas of high 208 elderly concentration, communities plan to increase the percentage of expenditure for code enforcement, housing rehabilitation and clearance related activities. In areas of medium elderly concentration, communities plan to decrease their per- cent of expenditure for all residential CDBG funded activity except code enforce- ment. The distribution of housing assistance varies by the type of housing assistance planned by local communities. Forty-nine percent of the new construction planned by communities is targeted for elderly and handicapped households. This per- centage of assistance would meet nearly 50 percent of the housing assistance goals for the elderly and handicapped in the third program year. Another 28 percent of their housing assistance goals would be met by rehabilitation housing and 22 percent by existing units. Local plans for fiscal year 1977 call for 37 percent of their total housing assistance to be distributed among the elderly and handicapped. Elderly and handicapped households represent 33 percent of the total needs population. A performance report for fiscal year 1975-76, based on a 147 cities sample, shows that of housing for which a financial commitment was made, 44 percent of the units are to benefit the elderly and handicapped. In this same time period, the elderly need was 33 percent of the total need for local housing assistance. Per- formance data also shows that 68 percent of new construction financially com- mitted during fiscal year 1975-76 was for the benefit of the elderly and handi- capped.

INTERDEPARTMENTAL AGREEMENTS Nutrition-Title VII HUD recognizes that it and the Administration on Aging (AoA) share a com- mon interest in serving residents of elderly housing through the title VII nutrition program for older Americans and that a number of HUD housing developments for the elderly can offer facilities in their community space to serve as sites for the AoA nutrition projects, serving at least one hot meal a day not only to residents of the development but also to other elderly of the community. Therefore, local housing authorities and the management of other HUD assisted housing for the elderly were alerted by HUD field offices to make contact with the State agency on aging. They also identified the number of elderly residents reachable through the housing development; informed the State agency on aging about the community space and facilities that can be made available; ascertained from the State agency on aging how and when participation may be brought about; and were instructed by HUD that modernization program funds can be utilized to accomplish alterations necessary in community space to accommodate meal preparation and service. Transportation-DOT Management of HUD-insured housing for the elderly, section 202 direct loan projects, and local housing authorities have been urged to establish and maintain relations with their local transit authority and to explore: Working with the local government to implement reduced rates for the elderly and handicapped; rerouting of transit lines to serve housing projects for the elderly and handicapped; adjusting schedules to accommodate the special transportation needs of the elderly and handicapped; and obtaining from the local transit authorities special services, facilities or lowered fares. The management of HUD-assisted housing for the elderly and handicapped and local housing authorities also post the transit maps and transit schedules of local transit authorities.Energy The Department advises its field offices about elderly-related energy conserva- tion efforts and suggests that these offices provide State and area offices on aging with information concerning HUD home repair programs. In addition, the Department suggests to its field offices that they initiate discussions with State and area agencies on aging concerning the use of community space in HUD- assisted elderly projects for energy conservation related activities. Information and Referral The Department is providing to the National Clearinghouse on Aging, on a continuing basis, directories of HUD-assisted housing for the elderly and HUD issuances pertaining to the elderly, and has reaffirmed the fact that HUD area and insuring offices can answer general questions on elderly housing availability, eligibility for occupancy and questions of this nature. In addition, the Department has agreed that HUD-assisted projects can provide a conduit for appropriate aging information and materials, and that these elderly projects may, in some instances, be able to provide information and referral sites in community space. 210 A member of the community services staff represents HUD and attends regular meetings of the interdepartmental task force on information and referral. The task force has produced an \"I & R Guide,\" which will be distributed to all HUD field offices for their information and distribution to agencies and organizations in their jurisdictions. HUD/AoA Agreements Efforts have begun to review both the nutrition (title VII) and the social services (title III) agreements for updating and for combining into a single agree- ment. In addition, community development programs affecting the elderly will be included, together with all HUD programs affecting the elderly. ITEM 7. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS FEBRUARY 1, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This responds to your letter to Secretary Andrus with regard to a report for Developments in Aging. Following is our submission: The Bureau of Indian Affairs' program of social services undertakes to provide necessary assistance and social services on reserva- tions when such assistance and social services are not available through State or local public welfare agencies. The bureau administers such program on every major Indian reservation. Indians on reservations are eligible for benefits under the Social Security Act on the same basis as non-Indians. Persons eligible for these programs are not eligible for BIA financial assistance. An exception is made for elderly Indians on reservations who are eligible for SSI benefits but whose cost of care in a nursing home or other nonmedical facility exceeds the amount of the SSI payment. In these instances, BIA financial assistance is provided as needed and an application for SSI benefits is not required as BIA assistance, unlike that of the States, is considered income under SSI legislation. The Bureau of Indian Affairs also provides technical assistance and support to the tribes and to Indian organizations. It provided certain support services for the first National Indian Conference on Aging, in Phoenix, Arizona, June 15-17, 1976, where the National Indian Council on Aging was established. Certain support services are being continued for the council and the 1978 conference. r The Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs is reviewing bureau programs to determine if any change in position is needed relative to services for the Indian elderly. We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to your report. Sincerely,. THEODORE C. KRENZKE, Director, Office of Indian Services. HERITAGE CONSERVATION AND RECREATION SERVICE FEBRUARY 1, 1978. DEAR. SENATOR CHURCH: I am pleased to reply to your letter of December 14 1977, to Secretary of the Interior, Cecil D. Andrus, concerning Federal actions and programs related to aging. The Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service (HCRS) has launched a determined campaign to provide access to public recreation facilities and to enhance opportunities in the recreation field for the physically handicapped and other persons with special needs, such as the aged. The HCRS is also seeking to break down attitudinal barriers which often discourage the handicapped and the aged, even when physical access to park and recreation areas is offered. We intend to bring individuals with special needs into the mainstream of park and recreation programs. One of our most successful programs benefiting the aged is the Federal recrea- tion fee program. Under this program the golden age passport is issued free for the lifetime to persons 62 years of age or older who are citizens or permanent residents of the United States. The passport entitles them to enter, at no charge, the national parks, monuments, and recreation areas managed by the Federal 211 Government. It also provides a 50 percent discount on Federal \"use\" fees charged for facilities and services such as camping, boat launching, parking, etc. It does not cover fees charged by private concessioners. The passport may only be obtained in person after showing proof of age such as a State driver's license or birth certificate. Passports are available at National Park Service offices and areas of the National Park System where entrance fees are charged, most Forest Service offices and ranger stations, and Bureau of Land Management offices. It is not available at post offices. Sincerely yours, CHRIS THERRAL DELAPORTE, Director. ITEM 8. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE ADMINISTRATION) PROGRAMS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS Crimes against the elderly are of major concern to the Law Enforcement As- sistance Administration. The unhappy circumstances in which many of the elderly live out their lives are well documented. In the constellation of problems facing senior citizens, crime and fear obviously loom large. Any discussion of \"numbers\" can create a misleading impression. Statistics seem cold and impersonal and a discussion of victimization rates may seem to be an expression of callous disregard for the human element. But crime victims are people, not numbers. No matter how large or small, victimization figures represent physical or mental anguish suffered by real people and the loss of property which diminishes the quality of life for individuals. LEAA is sensitive to the fact that the ultimate value of victimization statistics is the opportunity they present to address the human needs they represent. STATISTICAL INDICATORS Despite what common sense and newspaper headlines seem to indicate, statistics show that the elderly are not more likely to be victimized by crime. In fact, a substantial body of data indicates that the more than 20 million elderly throughout the country are far less likely to be criminally victimized than are young persons, whether by personal offenses or by crimes against household property. LEAA established and funds the national crime panel, which is a program designed to develop information not otherwise available on the nature of crime and its impact on society by means of victimization surveys of the general popula- tion. The surveys are conducted for LEAA by the Bureau of the Census. Within each locality surveyed, samplings are made of households and commercial estab- lishments representative of the area, in order to elicit information about experi- ences, if any, with certain crimes of violence and theft. Events that were not re- ported to the police are included, as well as those that were. These victimization surveys are supplying criminal justice officials and legisla- tive bodies with new insights into crime and its victims. Among the information being produced by the surveys is data on types of victims and information neces- sary to compute the relative risk of being victimized. The first results of the na- ticnal crime panel programs were made available in three reports during 1974. These were followed by additional reports in 1975, 1976, and 1977 The victimization studies show that the highest rate of victimization occurs in the young age groups, with each older group having progressively lower rates. Persons 65 and over had the lowest rates of all. This was true for each of the cate- gories crimes of theft, crimes of violence, and household crimes. Only for the category personal larceny with contact-purse snatching and pocket-picking- did older per sons record rates at parity with those for all citizens within the scope of the surveys. 212 A summary of the pertinent data from the victimization survey follows: PERSONAL AND HOUSEHOLD CRIMES: VICTIMIZATION RATES FOR THE GENERAL AND ELDERLY POPULATIONS, UNITED STATES, 1973 Rate for the Rate for the Type of crime general population elderly population Based on 1,000 Based on 1,000 persons age 12 persons age 65 and over and over Personal crimes: Crimes of violence I.--.-------------------------------- 32 8 Robber -------------------------------------------------- 7 5 -Ro bery with injury ------------------------------------- 2 2 Robery without injury------------------------------------- 4 3 Assault.-------------------------------------------------- 25 3 Aggravated assault 10 1 Simple assault ------------------------------------------ 15 2 Crimes of theft.----------------------------------------------- 91 22 Personal larceny with contact2 -------------------------------- 3 3 Personal larcency without contact.----------------------------- 88 19 Based on 1,000 Based on 1,000 households headed households headed by persons age 12 by persons age 65 and over and over Household crimes: Burgula ry---------------------------------------------------- 91 5 Household larceny --------------------------------------------- 107 47 Motor vehicle theft --------------------------------------------- 19 5 1 Includes data on rape, not shown separately. Includes purse snatching and pocket picking. Note: Detail may not add to total shown because of rounding. The surveys show that the personal crime rates among senior citizens were six or seven times lower than those for persons age 20 to 24. However, additional survey findings on personal crimes have shown a distinct correspondence between in- creased age and a greater chance of victimization at the hands of strangers. In 82 percent of the surveyed crimes of violence against elderly persons, the offender was identified as a stranger, compared to 66 percent among victims in the general population. The survey data have led to some tentative conclusions about the physical burden of crime. Although they were victimized relatively less often by personal crimes of violence during the surveyed period, about 12 percent of victimizations involving crimes against persons age 65 or over resulted in hospitalization. With respect to crimes against household property, there is again clear evidence of an association between increasing age and diminishing victimization. Among households headed by persons aged 20 to 24, for example, burglary rates were more than two times higher than those for households headed by the elderly. For household larcency, the rate was about three times higher for the younger age group.These lower victimization rates in no way minimize the severity of crime's effects upon older people. These statistics may cast a cold light on reality but they do not measure the misery of fear, the apprehension, and the terror, which keeps many of the elderly in our cities virtual prisoners in their homes and apartments. More than one-half of the oldest persons surveyed indicated that they had limited or changed their patterns of living in order to minimize their risk of victimization. Add to this the diminished activity and increased infirmity that may accompany aging, and there appears a group of people who are infrequently in high-risk crime situations. In the usual sense of the word, they may not be victimized, but such fragile \"safety\" exacts a high price by restricting their freedom to go about normal activities and lessening their peace of mind. There is little question about the vulnerability of senior citizens-physical, psychological, and financial. The theft of a television set to a younger person with a relatively good income is certainly a misfortune; to an elderly person on a fixed income and living alone, it can be a tragedy. Similarly, the fear of physical violence is particularly debilitating to the elderly, and the theft of a social security check may deal a devastating blow to meager financial resources. LEAA is aware that for this group of people the needs are immediate and the response must be prompt. 213 THE LEAA PROGRAM Under the LEAA block grant program, the major portion of funds is distributed to the States on a population formula basis. Each State, through a designated state planning agency, distributes these funds in accordance with a comprehensive statewide plan for improvement of law enforcement and criminal justice. The plan reflects the State's determination of its own needs and priorities. LEAA neither approves nor disapproves grant applications for funds under the jurisdiction of the State planning agencies. When the LEAA program was extended for 3 years in 1976, Congress took note of the special needs of senior citizens. Each State's comprehensive plan must provide for the development of programs and projects for the prevention of crime against the elderly. The 1976 amendments also established an Office of Community Anti-Crime Programs, with responsibility to disburse funds to community and citizens groups to enable their participation in crime prevention activities. Services to assist the elderly was specifically identified in the reports accompany- ing the legislation as one area of appropriate focus under this program. A small portion of LEAA's appropriation for action programs is retained by the agency for use as a discretionary fund. LEAA utilizes this money to assist programs of national scope and to provide special impetus for innovative and experimental programs. LEAA is supporting research and action projects which we hope will help diminish the impact of crime and fear of crime on older people. ACTION PROGRAMS TO ASSIST THE ELDERLY Particular emphasis has been given to the problems of the elderly poor in public housing. In Syracuse, N.Y. for example, LEAA block grant funds have been used for special security patrols and safety measures for elderly public housing residents. Plainfield, N.J., is equipping its senior citizens' housing complex with closed- circuit television equipment and resident security aides. Montgomery County, Md., has initiated a project which will create a specially trained criminal justice response team consisting of a police officer and social worker to assist elderly crime victims. In the St. Louis County, Mo., prosecuting attorney's office, an educational program is being launched to alert and advise the public, especially those in high school and the elderly, how to protect themselves from criminal consumer fraud. A senior citizen escort service and an emergency telephone response system for elderly residents of the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, N.Y., is underway. Other programs for the elderly are underway in South Bend, Ind., Trenton, N.J., Cleveland, Ohio, and Portland, Oreg. LEAA has also joined with HEW's Administration on the Aging in supporting a $211,000 program to aid Kansas City's elderly crime victims. Kansas City found that its elderly citizens were being particularly victimized by burglaries. This project includes public education programs on ways to reduce crime, target- hardening efforts-better locks and so forth- and involvement of social service agencies with the criminal justice system to provide better service to older citizens. This project is emphasizing citizen and community involvement to help reduce crime against the elderly. Citizens are participating in the planning of priorities and activities, as well as being part of the decisionmaking process. The Pennsylvania Governor's Justice Commission, the State planning agency, recently awarded $150,000 in block grant funds for a program designed to reduce crime against the elderly, as well as fear of crime, in west Philadelphia. The police department of Philadelphia and the Citizens Crime Commission are joining in the project, which will increase special police patrols, develop a media campaign to focus attention on crime prevention for the elderly, and help reduce losses from stolen Social Security checks or cash. If successful, the program will be broadened to protect the more than 230,000 persons over age 65 living in Philadelphia. As part of a major LEAA program designed to promote better treatment for crime victims, witnesses, and jurors, the eastern Oklahoma development dis- trict, which includes 49 incorporated communities, has begun a program which will compile statistics on crimes against the elderly and their special needs. Crime prevention programs geared to the age group will be created and law enforcement officers will be trained in special techniques for responding to elderly crime vic- tims. Problems which confront older citizens when they are called upon to be witnesses or jurors will be identified and eased. 214 The National Council of Senior Citizens has launched a nationally coordinatedprogram designed to reduce crime committed against senior citizens and to assistelderly crime victims. Called the \"Program on Criminal Justice and the Elderly,\"both LEAA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development are con-tributing $200,000 to the effort. The program assists, coordinates, and evaluatesseven projects in six cities: New York (two projects), Los Angeles, Chicago, NewOrleans, Milwaukee, and Washington, D.C. All the projects have similar objec-tives, but each has a local sponsor and are planning approaches unique to the cityand neighborhoods served. Another LEAA program which has direct implications for the elderly is theNational District Attorneys' Association's Economic Crime Project. The targetsof this 3.5 million dollar effort are the fraudulent schemes-auto repair, homeimprovements, land swindles-that bilk millions of dollars from unsuspectingcitizens, many of them in the older age bracket. Forty-four district attorneys'offices throughout the country are affiliated with the project, reaching approxi-mately 29 percent of the population of the United States. RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION LEAA's research center, the National Institute of Law Enforcement andCriminal Justice, is moving creatively on several fronts to bring some measureof relief to the elderly. Several devices developed under institute research couldmean new freedom and security for older people. The institute has developed areliable low-cost burglar alarm for homes and apartments. Current estimatesindicate that the alarm device could be marketed at a lower cost than currentsystems, thus putting it within reach of people on fixed incomes.Many crimes are crimes of opportunity, encouraged by the ready accessibilityof doors and windows that can be opened fairly easily. Through institute-sponsored tests, standards have now been developed for doors and windows which,if incorporated into State building codes, could make them far more resistant toillegal entry. CRIME PREVENTION THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN In many communities, the environment is custom-made for crime. Streets arepoorly lit and deserted. Bus and subway stops offer natural lurking places for thecriminal. People are afraid to venture out-especially the elderly-or they moveabout in fear and suspicion. Little by little, the sense of community which onceexisted in our cities and neighborhoods crumbles. Several years ago, the national institute sponsored a landmark research studyof public housing units in New York City by planner-architect Oscar Newman.Newman tested the effects of changes in the physical environment on crime andfear. The results were dramatic. Comparisons were made in two housing projectsidentical in population density and social characteristics. The only difference wasphysical design-one was principally high rise; the other a group of small, walkupbuildings. The difference in crime rates was amazing: The high-rise building had65 percent more crime. High-rise buildings studied were unwatched and unwatchable. Hallways,elevators, and lobbies were accessible to everyone, watched by no one, and feared by all. In the walkup building, where a few families shared a common hallway orentry, the residents knew each other and more actively observed what was goingon in and around their building. Other housing units were redesigned, and the results were the same. Alteringthe physical design of the buildings encouraged residents to look out for their families and neighbors. For the elderly, this protective approach, called \"Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design,\" can help restore confidence andpeace of mind. Environmental design projects particularly aimed at the elderly are underwayin Portland, Ore., and Minneapolis, Minn. Residents are encouraged to carry aminimum of cash. Low-cost transportation, improved bus shelters, and telephones for summoning emergency aid are being utilized. Special financial services for low income elderly people are being implemented by local banks. It is hoped that the programs will reduce incentives for purse snatching and street robbery where elderly persons have been particularly victimized. 215 COMPENSATION, RESTITUTION, AND OTHER AID TO VICTIMS OF CRIME Certainly prevention of crime before it occurs must remain the first priority of law enforcement officials. However, the criminal justice system must also be responsive to the needs of persons who have been victimized. The problems of victims of crime must be regarded with at least the same concern as is given the human and civil rights of criminals and those accused of crime. The LEAA program is designed to promote adoption of innovative operational programs. Thus, the agency does not provide funds to make direct compensation to victims of crime. The effects of direct compensation programs have been studied, however, and support is being provided to other efforts to assist victims. The LEAA victim/witness program supports the provision of assistance to victims of and witnesses to crime so that these persons will not only be given relevant and sensitive attention, but will be motivated to cooperate more readily with personnel in the criminal justice system. If victims and witnesses receive sensitive and concerned treatment, they will respond by being less apathetic and more willing to report criminal incidents to appropriate authorities. Increased crime rates seen in recent years are due, in part, to increased reporting of crime and better information collecting methods. Many citizens have renewed faith in the fact that they can be helped by the criminal justice system. A key feature of LEAA's program is the establishment of victim and witness centers. Victim centers are often located within police departments. There, specially trained officers concentrate on the alleged offenses and try to relate to the victims to provide the direct assistance needed. Centers are often geared to meet the needs of special classes of victims, such as rape victims or elderly persons. Witness centers are usually established in a court. Here the witness is able to receive orientation as to what will be expected of him or her in court. The centers provide a climate supportive of tne witness. Services may include transportation, child care services, scheduling notification, and any necessary protection. A recent study by the Center for Criminal Justice and Social Policy at Mar- quette University examined the needs and problems of citizens in their roles as victims and witnesses, both in relation to the criminal act and citizen participation in the criminal justice system. The study found that victims frequently incur a number of financial costs not reimbursed by insurance. The average nonreimbursed medical costs for 300 victims experiencing physical injury was about $200. The average noninsured costs for property replacement and repairs was $373 as a result of the crime incident. While nearly two-thirds of victims are likely to have some insurance protection, one-third, largely in the lower income population, do not. These are the persons commonly victimized by violent crime. Another Marquette study for LEAA analyzed the different and proposed operational programs for crime victim compensation. The study indicated that victim compensation programs could be effective, particularly in reducing the impact of crime on lower income persons. Many State victim compensation programs have an indemnification feature, where convicted offenders pay fines used for compensation payments to victims. All offenders pay into one general fund. Recently, the concept of restitution has received a great deal of attention as an alternate method of compensating victims. Where the offender contributes cash or services to a victim, the offense becomes more closely linked with the sanction. Restitution can take the form of repayment for damages or losses directly to the victim by the offender or it can be in the form of work or services to the com- munity. LEAA is interested in this concept and is supporting a program to help fund and evaluate projects in several States. The potential benefits of restitution programs for elderly crime victims is obvious. While restitution cannot alleviate the pain of crime, its application can surely help lessen the burden for those upon whom crime impacts most severely. SENIOR CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT IN ANTI-CRIME PROGRAMS In addition to the numerous efforts supported by LEAA to directly reduce crime and fear of crime experienced by the elderly, the agency is supporting activities which seek to involve senior citizens as participants in anticrime pro- grams. One example is the San Diego Police Department's crime analysis unit, which has been using the services of 13 senior citizens since August 1977. 216 Four couples and five single retirees translate raw data from crime reports into coded messages and feed them into a computer file used by police to help solve serious crimes through faster suspect identification. The \"integrated criminal apprehension program\" (ICAP) augments police ability to deploy patrol forces. The key is rapid access to information about crime and criminals. During one five-week period, the senior citizens coded more than 700 robbery cases. The program frees police for police work, while providing a part-time job for the workers. These senior citizens play an important role in deciding likely suspects in violent crime. It is but one example where the services of elderly persons are being utilized to help reduce crime.In Cottage Grove, Oreg., a small group (f older people visit the homes of other elderly persons and provide tips on household security. The volunteers learnedthat many senior citizens had problems dealing with certain public service agencies and they now help handle such situations. In Sun City, Ariz., retirees are active in \"neighborhood watch,\" a self-helpcommunity crime prevention program supported by LEAA. It encourages neigh- bors to look out for each others' property and guard against burglary. The group also assists police with traffic control at community, civic, and athletic functions.In Maricopa County, Ariz., retired engineers designed and built a collapsible leg restraint for use by police officers transporting prisoners. They developed the device in a laboratory they built in the department's crime resistance bureau. Police in the 101st Precinct in Queens, N.Y., caU on elderly and disabled persons to back up various positions held by civilian employees. For example, older persons monitor police radio, take messages, and handle telephone calls. While the Nation's elderly have special needs which must be effectively ad- dressed by the law enforcement and criminal justice community, they can also make a significant contribution. The Law Enforcement Assistance Administration plans to continue to encourage projects aimed at senior citizens. ITEM 9. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION FEBRUARY 13, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: In response to your letter of December 14, 1977, I am pleased to send to you the enclosed report which summarizes significant actions taken by this department during the past year to improve transportation facilities and services for older Americans. If we can assist you further, please let us know. Sincerely, BROCK ADAMS, Secretary. [Enclosure.] SUMMARY OF AcTIVITIES TO IMPROVE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY INTRODUCTION The following is a summary of major actions taken by the U.S. Department of Transportation during 1977 to improve transportation for the elderly.' The information included in the report was furnished by the following operating elements of the department: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federa Highway Administration (FHWA), National Highway Traffic Safety Admin- istration (NHTSA), Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA), and Research and Special Programs Directorate. REGULATIONS Federal Aviation Administration During 1977, FAA issued regulations designed to ensure that as many physically handicapped persons as possible can enjoy the benefits of commercial air travel with safety and comfort. Under the new FAA regulations, each airline must I Many of the activities highlighted in this report are directed toward the handicapped. However, more than one-third of the elderly are handicapped and will benefit from these activities. establish procedures for carrying passengers needing assistance in an emergency that will maximize their access to air transportation in a manner consistent with safety. FAA will review each airline's procedures and may direct changes if needed in the interest of safety or in the public interest. Urban Mass Transportation Administration On May 19, 1977, the secretary mandated that only ramp-equipped, low floor Transbuses be purchased in all DOT-supported full size bus procurements adver- tised after September 30, 1979. The regulation, published on September 23, 1977, amended the April 30, 1976 UMTA regulations which included design standards or mass transportation facilities and equipment. MONITORING OF COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS Federal Highway Administration FHWA continues to monitor State compliance with section 402(b)(1)(F) of 23 U.S.C., which provides for curb cuts at pedestrian crosswalks. FHWA reports that through its financial and technical assistance programs, it continues to monitor the activities of metropolitan planning organizations to meet the \"special efforts\" requirement in planning public mass transportation facilities that can effectively be used by elderly and handicapped persons. This monitoring shows regional agencies and States are taking determined steps to define and locate special user markets, inventory the nature and adequacy of existing services, assess user needs, and evaluate alternative programs. POLICIES AND GUIDELINES Federal Aviation Administration FAA issued an advisory circular to identify the problems that handicapped air travelers face, and to provide guidelines to airline personnel to help alleviate these problems. The advisory circular explains how to assist blind and deaf persons, where to place dog guides, and where to seat handicapped passengers. Federal Highway Administration In March, 1977, the Federal Highway Administrator approved the use of the international accessibility symbol for the handicapped as a standard sign to denote parking spaces reserved for handicapped persons. This sign is included in the manual on uniform traffic control devices and is in addition to approved highway guide signs advising travelers of accessible services and facilities. Urban Mass Transportation Administration Every new hardware development project of UMTA's Office of Technology Development and Deployment must be accompanied by an experimental design- a structured plan by which the R&D project can be evaluated in quantitative terms. In the experimental design, the objectives for the project are laid out, the data that must be collected to learn if the objectives were met are enumerated, and the format to be used to present the results of the evaluation of the project is described. A standard part of the experimental design is an evaluation of the elderly and handicapped accommodations the new equipment or new system will offer. Performance specifications have been developed for an advanced type of auto- mated guideway system called advanced group rapid transit. The performance specifications require that provisions for elderly and handicapped travelers be included as an integral part of the design of these systems. CAPITAL ASSISTANCE National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Under the State and community highway safety program of NHTSA, States are encouraged to plan and execute projects to benefit the elderly. Through the use of Federal, State, and local funds, States are planning, preparing, and pro- viding programs for the elderly in areas of driver instruction, pedestrian safety, and driver licensing. New York is representative of most States-plans are being formulated to establish a senior citizens highway safety advisory committee. This committee will provide input for the development of pedestrian and driver pro- grams for the elderly. These types of activities are reported in the States' annual 218 highway safety work program plans that are to be accomplished with the assistance of Federal funds. Urban Mass Transportation Administration During fiscal year 1977, $22 million was set aside under section 16(b)(2) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, as amended, to provide grants to private nonprofit organizations in the acquisition of capital equipment for the provision of transportation services to the elderly and handicapped. Of the $22 million that has been set aside, grants totalling nearly $11 million have been awarded to 32 States on behalf of 527 organizations. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA provides States with technical assistance for implementing R&D developed programs. Additionally, guidance is provided to States and communities to plan and execute their elderly safety programs as well as other safety programs which are supplemented with Federal funds. INFORMATION DISSEMINATION Office of the Secretary of Transportation DOT's technology sharing program published a primer on rural passenger transportation issues, including the transportation problems of the rural elderly. A similar report was developed to summarize the available literature on trans- portation for the handicapped and elderly. Dissemination of previous state-of- the-art work on rural passenger transportation systems continued with the transportation systems center providing answers to users about queries prompted by the documents. The Transportation Task Force of the Urban Consortium for Technology Initiatives, representing the 28 largest cities and 6 major urban counties, identified transportation for elderly and handicapped users as one of the top 10 transporta- tion needs in large cities. A summary bulletin was prepared on all the top needs, and an outline of a manual on elderly and handicapped transportation is now under development. The task force is funded jointly by the office of the secretary's technology sharing program, FHWA, and UMTA. Federal Aviation Administration Making air travel easier and more convenient for elderly and handicapped persons is the aim of a new guidebook published by FAA. \"Access Travel: Air- ports\" lists design features, facilities, and services that meet the travel needs of the wheelchair-bound, the blind, the deaf, and the aged at 220 airport terminals in 27 countries. The guide was published as a joint venture by organizations in both the public and private sectors. It was based on a survey conducted by the airport operators council international of its member airports. WORKSHOPS Urban Mass Transportation Administration \"Accelerating Walkways and the Handicapped\" was the subject of one of the workshop sessions of the accelerating walkway program safety and human factors seminar held in New York City in April 1977. Members of several organizations concerned with elderly and handicapped persons participated in the seminar. Special problems involving the accelerating walkway and elderly and handicapped persons were identified and are being addressed in the program. RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATIONS COMPLETED Office of the Secretary of Transportation Recently completed projects supported by the Office of University Research include: (1) Determining the future mobility needs of the elderly, development of a methodology; and (2) mass transit development for small areas, a case study- Tompkins County, NY. Federal Highway Administration An FHWA research project on the problems of elderly or handicapped pedes- trians is complete and a manual on recommended countermeasures is being prepared for publication in the spring. 219 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Supplemental driver manuals of the possible problems that those over 55 years of age may encounter and should anticipate to be safe drivers were tested in Virginia. Results in 1977 indicate a significant increase in older drivers' knowledge and a reduction in at-fault accidents for drivers who were given the manual. Urban Mass Transportation Administration A study of future paratransit requirements, completed in 1977, was an attempt to define what assistance UMTA can provide to obtain meaningful improvements in paratransit services and vehicles during the period 1980 to 1995. The needs and services were based on projections of the socioeconomic environment of U.S. cities from 1980 to 1995 and the anticipated demand levels for these services. Results of the study were documented in a report under the title \"Study of Future Paratransit Requirements,\" which establishes and quantifies the need for vehicles suitable for the elderly and handicapped. RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATIONS ONGOING Office of the Secretary of Transportation A study of mobility of the handicapped and elderly is being supported by the Office of University Research in the Research and Special Programs Directorate. Other studies relevant to the needs of the elderly are: (1) New perspectives on urban transportation; (2) evaluating rural and public transportation demonstra- tions; (3) travel needs and solutions of low and middle income residents, a com- parative study; and (4) transportation to fulfill human needs in the rural/urban environment. Federal Highway Administration Elderly persons (over 65) are overrepresented in the statistics on pedestrian fatalities in major urban areas. In order to improve the safety of pedestrians in general, a pedestrian demonstration program has been launched with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to implement and evaluate at least three safety strategies. These improvements will also benefit elderly persons. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration A NHTSA study will identify vehicle design deficiencies that might lead, to accidents by elderly and handicapped drivers. The initial contract will determine vehicle design deficiencies needing improvement through motor vehicle safety standards and the additional research needed in the area. In another project, driver visual limitations (glare recovery, vision under nighttime lighting conditions, and ability to detect Moving objects) of the elderly driving population have been identified, and the visual performance limitations will be validated. There will be an attempt to determine what can be done to reduce the problem and its highway safety consequences. Driver licensing and improvement requirements of older drivers are being iden- tified. This study will identify driving problems of the elderly and techniques to overcome their safety problems. A contract has recently been awarded to determine the feasibility of developing a medical condition data collection system. This system will permit the identifica- tion of particular disease groups at risk with the driving population as a function of the natural aging process. The outcome of this system is intended to provide guidance to medical advisory boards in determining licensing requirements for individual members of these groups. A working arrangement is being sought with the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) to: (1) Better define the driver safety and mobility prob- lems of the elderly; and (2) develop and evaluate an AARP driver training program for the elderly. Urban Mass Transportation Administration In 1977, two prototype paratransit vehicles with improved accessibility for the clddrly and handicapped were tested by an independent laboratory and sub- sequently exhibited around the country. In 1977, Congress appropriated funds for the continuation of the paratransit vehicle development program, for up to three driveable preproduction prototypes. Particular attention is to be given to productibility and maintainability. UMTA will be assisted in the evaluation of the new designs by elderly and handicapped persons and by the paratransit indus- try. It is hoped that these actions at the Federal level will stimulate the motor 24-0840 -78 -15 220 vehicle industry to produce the paratransit vehicles of this type on its own inresponse to orders from the paratransit operating industry. Another UMTA research effort in 1977 concentrated on the shared-ride taxiconcept, a method of service that has potential significance for improving mobilityof elderly people. Under this system of operation, riders with compatible originsand destinations would be serviced in a door-to-door manner by a taxi acting asa small \"demand responsive\" vehicle. The taxi would make pickups either fromphone calls or by people hailing it from the street as the taxi travelled in a givendirection. The next step planned in expanding information about the use of the shared-ride-taxi system will be an operational experiment in a medium-sized city some-time during fiscal year 1978 or 1979. The main objective of the demonstration willbe to ensure that the concept meets the rigors of the real world.In September 1977, a five-man team travelled to Stockholm under UMTAsponsorship to evaluate the 36 inclined elevators in Stockholm's rail rapid transitsystem. Inclined elevators in Stockholm travel at the same angle as the escalator,alongside the escalator, and carry 12 people. The team was (1) to determinewhether the inclined elevator would be useful for helping elderly and handicappedpersons change floor levels in transit stations in the United States; and (2) toobtain factual engineering, architectural, operational, and user data about thisequipment, which-if the inclined elevator is deemed worthwhile-can be used inplanning and designing future transit systems in the United States. The projectreport is expected to be completed in the spring of 1978.The level-change problem in existing transit stations is being addressed in aproject for modifying escalators, to determine if it is within the state-of-the-artto make escalators more accessible to elderly and handicapped persons.During 1977, UMTA continued through Boeing Vertol to address the problemof entry into the standard light rail vehicle (SLRV) at those light rail stops wheresteps must be used. A prototype elevator device for the SLRV is to be developedwhich can be used by persons in wheelchairs and by other elderly and handicappedtravellers as well. Under a capital grant controlled by UTD awarded during 1977 to the WestVirginia Board of Regents for the phase II expansion of the Morgantown PersonalRapid Transit system, elevators will be installed in three existing stations as wellas in the two additional stations to be built. Other aids to the elderly and handi-capped are also being added. UMTA is currently sponsoring demonstrations of downtown people movers(DPM's) in a number of U.S. cities. During 1977, design guidelines for DPM'swere developed, including guidelines relating to elderly and handicapped travellers.The guidelines state that DPM's must be barrier free.UMTA is presently involved with three planning research projects which shouldprovide assistance to local planning agencies and transit operators. In conjunctionwith the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), UMTAwill make available reports providing elderly and handicapped service coordina-tion guidance developed during the early stages of the HEW transportation-coordination demonstration projects presently underway. The utility of secondaryinformation sources (such as social service agencies) will be documented in asecond effort. This will evaluate the performance of various transportation im-provements for elderly and handicapped persons and identify situations wherethey are likely to be most appropriate.In the continuing program of user subsidy demonstrations for the elderly andhandicapped, a project in Kinston, North Carolina, will allow eligible users topurchase transportation tickets at a reduced rate for use on trips with participatingprivate providers. The providers may redeem the tickets for the remainder of thefare. With a large number of private providers participating, changes in demand will be examined. The objective of a study being conducted in Brockton, Massachusetts, is toexplore methods of coordinating transportation programs of local human service agencies. Centralized administration and operation, and a broker system, to co-ordinate existing public and private providers are being examined. A plan for anoperating demonstration will also be developed. The mass transit district of Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, has received a demon-stration grant to retrofit 15 buses in its fleet with wheelchair lifts. The demonstra-tion will be in conjunction with a capital grant to purchase lift-equipped buses tomake the entire fleet accessible. The project will evaluate the benefits with lifts ina climate with severe winters. West Palm Beach, Florida, has received a demonstration grant in conjunction with a capital grant to make its entire transit fleet fully accessible. The impacts of a lift-equipped fleet will be evaluated. This project was funded in conjunction with one in Champaign, Illinois, to examine the effectiveness of accessible buses under varying conditions of demand and climate. ITEM 10. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY JANUARY 23, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: On behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury, I am furnishing you with a summary of Treasury activities benefiting the elderly during 1977. You may be assured that efforts will be continued during 1978 to improve our programs to facilitate the elderly. You will note that our submission (attached) is comprised of material furnished by several Treasury bureaus and offices. It is our understanding that your com- mittee has had contact with the Office of Revenue Sharing on matters relating to the Committee's endeavors and that they have responded with information directly to your office. Therefore, we have not duplicated these efforts in this transmittal. If we can provide additional assistance to the Commission, please contact us. With kind regards, Sincerely,WILLIAM J. BECKHAM, Jr., A8sistant Secretary (Administration). [Enclosure.] BUREAU OF GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL OPERATIONS Treasury's direct deposit program for Federal recurring payments, which was implemented in 1975 was expanded to include recipients of Civil Service and Rail- road Retirement Annuities during 1976 and recipients of Veterans Administration Compensation and Pension in 1977. The program allows the recipients of Federal recurring payments to have their monthly payments delivered directly to the financial organization of their choice for deposit to personal checking or savings account. A nationwide marketing campaign was undertaken in 1977 and will be continued in 1978, to inform more elderly recipients about the advantages of the program. Since October 1, 1976, when the third of the month payment date fell on a Federal holiday, Sunday or Saturday, social security payments have been dated the previous business day. Therefore, arrangements were made to have these payments delivered on that day when most financial organizations are open. It was recognized, however, that there would be certain unique situations where it would not be possible to avoid Saturday dating, such as instances when the third falls on a Monday Federal holiday, or on a Sunday when the preceding Friday is a Federal holiday. Delivery of the payments on the preceding business day in these instances would result in delivery prior to the first of the month which would have then been prohibited by the Social Security Act. Legislation was- passed in December 1977 which removed the restriction against dating the pay- ments in these situations prior to the first of the month. This action will further benefit social security recipients. OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, ASSISTANT SECRETARY (ADMINISTRATION); ACTIVITIES AFFECTING THE AGED The Equal Employment Opportunity Affirmative Action Plan for fiscal year 1978 reaffirms Treasury policy that, there must be equal opportunity provided without regard to age. To facilitate Treasury employees in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area, who are within 3 to 5 years of eligibility for retirement, the Office of the Director of Personnel conducted its biannual retirement planning seminar. The 12-hour program included presentations and discussions on social security-medicare; estate and gift taxes; health and physical fitness in retirement and legal affairs (wills). 222 OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY; ACTIVITIES AFFECTING THE AGED The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is responsible for thecompliance of the Nation's 4,700 national banks with the Equal Credit Oppor-tunity Act. Among the important parts of this act which are enforced by nationalbank examiners is the section which prohibits discrimination in the granting ofcredit on the basis of age. The OCC is expanding its role in the area of consumer rights. The elderly andolder persons are assumed to be a substantial portion of the consumer group.As such they will be benefited by the programs that the OCC is undertaking toinsure that national banks comply with the requirements of consumer legislationand that the individual consumer is fully advised of his rights.Early in 1978 the OCC will widely distribute a pamphlet which will instructconsumers in how to file complaints against national banks. The pamphlet in-cludes an addressed and stamped form which the consumer can utilize to make acomplaint. Also scheduled for 1978 is the distribution of a \"Consumer Brochure\" whichwill provide simplified explanations for the consumer of both bank services andconsumer rights under the law. The consumer rights section will provide consumeroriented information on the following topics: (1) Truth in lending; (2) fair creditreporting; (3) equal credit opportunity; (4) fair housing; (5) the holder in duecourse rule; (6) real estate settlement costs; (7) consumer leasing; and (8) intereston savings. A concluding section will list the enforcement agencies and discusshow consumers may request additional information or seek the assistance of theappropriate agency. The Comptroller of the Currency serves as a member of the Board of Directorsof the Urban Reinvestment Task Force. A principal program of this task forcehas been the Neighborhood Housing Services. This program seeks to revive theflow of private capital into declining urban neighborhoods. The elderly shouldgreatly benefit from the successful continuation of this program as they are as-sumed to constitute a substantial portion of the residents in such neighborhoods. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE ACTIVITIEs AFFECTING THE AGED Persons age 65 and over comprise approximately 11 percent of the U.S. popula-tion, and number over 23 million at this time.Because this represents a significant segment of the general population, theInternal Revenue Service places considerable emphasis on informing these peopleof their tax rights and responsibilities, a number of which apply only to this group.The IRS also makes a special effort to reach older Americans because it has foundthat these taxpayers, because of immobility, impaired health or any of severalother factors, may miss out on some tax benefits to which they are entitled unlessIRS reaches them directly. And, as is the case with many social programs, thepeople most likely to miss out on the benefits are those with the greatest needfor them. During 1977 the information materials directed at taxpayers 65 and overemphasized the following topics: -Those benefits common to all taxpayers 65 and over, including the extrapersonal exemption and the potential extra general tax credit, available forthe first time on 1977 returns.-The tax credit for the elderly available to many older Americans as a methodof reducing their income tax. -The nontaxable nature of at least some of the gain on the sale of a personalresidence by older Americans. Until 1976, taxpayers 65 and over who soldtheir principle residence for $20,000 or less were not taxed on the gain fromthe sale. A change in the law, effective for 1977 returns, has raised the non-taxable limit to $35,000. -Single taxpayers 65 and over can receive up to $3,700 in income before beingrequired to file a tax return; for singles under 65 the limit is $2,950. Thefiling requirements are more liberal also for married couples when at leastone of the spouses is 65 or over. Like the extra personal exemption, this isa basic tax benefit for older Americans and has been publicized widely.-The nontaxability of social security payments, railroad retirement benefits,and other benefits from a general welfare fund, such as payments for blindness. 223 -For retirees receiving pensions which are taxable, IRS has publicized the existence and usefulness of form W-4P, which authorizes the payor of the pension to withhold taxes at the source to avoid saddling the retiree with a large tax bill at the end of the tax year. -The necessity for part-time workers, many of whom are 65 and over, to file for a refund if there was any money withheld from their pay during the year, even though their income fell beneath the minimum filing requirement. -The various services provided by the IRS-sanctioned volunteer income tax assistance (VITA), a tax aide volunteer program designed to assist taxpayers who for one reason or another will not or cannot visit an IRS office for help with their return. Because of limited mobility this group includes a dispro- portionately large number of older Americans. -The services offered older Americans by IRS' taxpayer service personnel: Free telephone assistance, walk-in service at IRS offices, free tax information by mail, and temporary offices operating during the filing season. The means of disseminating this information during 1977 included the following: One filmed television public service announcement (PSA); three recorded radio PSA's; three recorded radio interview programs (2-to-4 min- utes long); several live-copy radio PSA scripts to be read on the air by local announcers; and various materials prepared for print media. These included press releases, feature articles, fact sheets, featurettes, question-and-answer columns and informational cartoons. These items were reproduced by daily and weekly newspapers, magazines and newsletters throughout the Nation. Additionally, a newspaper supplement was prepared and distributed to newspaper editors, with an article dealing with the tax considerations of older Americans prominent in it. In addition to the above, the following activities undertaken during 1977 were directly associated with providing tax assistance for the elderly. -Provisions have been made for qualifying taxpayers to have the service compute the tax credit for the elderly by checking the applicable boxes on schedule R or schedule RP for filing with form 1040. Under the credit for the elderly provisions, qualifying taxpayers may reduce their taxes by as much as $375, if single, or $562.50 if married and filing jointly. -We continued conducting \"retiree income tax seminars\" as part of our over- seas taxpayer assistance program. These seminars are designed to assist retirees and senior citizens residing abroad to determine their correct U.S. tax obligations. The seminars consist of discussions of tax laws and forms applicable to this particular taxpaying group. The discussions are followed by an exercise in the preparation of a tax return under the guidance and assistance of a tax assistor. -All employees who performed tax assistance work during the 1977 filing period were required to complete a workshop on schedule R and other tax issues affecting the elderly. -Emphasis on tax problems of the elderly was continued by providing special lessons geared to the tax situations of older citizens in the volunteer income tax assistance (VITA) portion of our Taxpayer Education Program. The special material included information on tax credits for the elderly, estimated tax payments and form W-4P. -In conjunction with the National Retired Teachers Association and the American Association of Retired Persons, a workshop was again conducted for senior citizen instructors. These instructors, in turn, recruited and trained other volunteers in the tax-aid program to the elderly. -With cooperation from the Social Security Administration, we continued distributing publications describing tax benefits for the elderly through Social Security Administration local offices. -Emphasis on securing first floor space or, alternatively, easy access to eleva- tors as an aid to handicapped and senior citizens was continued. -Special notices, calling attention to the earned income credit where it appeared that eligible persons failed to claim the credit on their returns, were mailed to low income individuals including the elderly. This was particularly signifi- cant in instances where the elderly had a disabled dependent child. -Computer preparation of form 1040A was initiated on a trial basis in three districts. This allowed the service to render a complete preparation service to older individuals less able to prepare their own returns. 224 -During 1977 regulations were issued to provide guidance to taxpayers relating to the deductibility of expenditures to remove architectural and transporta- tion barriers to the elderly and handicapped. In addition, regulations relating to the tax credit for the elderly and regulations relating to the exclusion from income of certain disability payments were under preparation though these were not published in 1977. -Emphasis was placed on the protection of retirement benefits for both rankand file employees and retirees. -Assistance is provided by our actuaries in answering questions relating to retirement programs and tax benefits available. -We published revenue rulings that related to organizations aiding senior citizens. Rev. Rul. 77-42, 1977-8 I.R.B. 6, held that an organization thatoperates a closed-circuit radio broadcasting system in a noncommercial manner aimed at the special needs of senior citizens is exempt as a charitableorganization. Also, Rev. Rul. 77-246, 1977-29 I.R.B. 11, held that anorganization providing low cost transportation services to senior citizensand the handicapped is exempt as a charitable organization. -Also, Rev. Rul. 77-382, 1977-43 I.R.B. 6, holds that a taxpayer who sells apersonal residence at a gain on the day he attains the age of 65 is consideredto be age 65 the first moment of the preceding day and may elect to excludethe gain from gross income to the extent provided by section 121 of the code if the ownership and use requirements of that section are satisfied. Rev. Rul.77-28, 1977-1 C.B. 27, shows how a sick pay exclusion may be allowable for 1974 and 1975 in the case of a Federal civil service employee who retired on a regular annuity though actually disabled when retired in 1974 at age 55,and who later was certified as eligible for disability retirement. -We also have in process proposed temporary regulations defining the term\"substantial gainful activity\" and illustrating the application of the definition,to help taxpayers, some of whom are aging, to properly apply the disability income exclusion provisions of section 105(d) of the Code. -Reviews were made of early filed returns to quickly detect processing prob- lems or inadequacies in forms and taxpayer instructions which could result in incorrect tax assessments. These reviews identified a significant number of taxpayers who had not received the correct credit for the elderly. As a result, management revised the tax forms, taxpayer instructions, computer controls and processing guidelines in order to resolve this problem.-Updated and published the following publications that deal with tax issues of particular interest to the elderly: Publication No.: Title 524 ------------ Tax Credit for the Elderly 554 ------------ Tax Benefits for Older Americans 559 ------------ Federal Tax Guide for Survivors, Executors, and Administrators 567 ------------ Tax Information on U.S. Civil Service Retirement and Disability Retirement 575 ------------ Tax Information on Pension and Annuity Income All of these publications are available free of charge at IRS offices. They are also used extensively in taxpayer education programs, often in coopera- tion with organizations especially interested in problems of retired people. In 1978 our plans will cover the following: -Public Affairs is continuing the information program for Older Americans in both electronic and print media. One recorded radio PSA, two filmed television PSA's, four recorded radio interview programs and six live copy radio PSA's have been produced and distributed to our offices around the country for personal delivery. On the print side, we will be issuing the same range of written materials as in the past, with an important addition. A package of items is now being prepared for distribution to publications across the Nation which have older Americans as their primary audiences. Many of these newsletters and magazines will be small ones, often being published by organizations of retired people. But we have found that these smaller outlets provide us with evidence of the \"multiplier effect,\" whereby an item appearing in one medium can spark an interest which can spread to others, increasing our effectiveness. 225 In addition our activities in 1978 will involve: -Requiring employees performing tax assistance work during the filing period to complete training on the credit for elderly and other tax issues concerning the elderly. -Expanding by some 50 percent the assistance to older Americans and other taxpayers through the volunteer income tax assistance (VITA) program. -Scheduling a workshop for the National Retired Teachers Association and the American Association of Retired Persons volunteers. This workshop will be similar to those conducted in 1976 and 1977. -Continuing to conduct retiree seminars to assist citizens residing abroad with their U.S. tax obligations. -Expanding the computer preparation of forms 1040A test to five districts. -Expanding training for VITA volunteers on issues relating to older taxpayers. -Also, our compliance program for 1978 will include a research project to determine whether qualifying taxpayers are taking advantage of the \"credit for elderly\" provisions of the tax code. ITEM 11. ACTION FEBRUARY 17, 1978. DEAR Mr. CHAIRMAN: In response to your request of December 14, 1977, I am enclosing a report summarizing ACTION's activities for older Americans during 1977, with plans for 1978. Since the OAVP (older Americans volunteer programs) is the basis focus of our programs for persons 60 years and over, the major portion of our report deals with those programs, In addition, we have submitted information on volunteers in service to America (VISTA) and the Peace Corps, which also enroll older volunteers. VISTA provides opportunities for adult volunteers of all ages to help meet the human needs of poor communities across the Nation, including the health, educa- tion, and welfare requirements of native Americans and migrant farmworkers; and to assist in the care and rehabilitation of the mentally ill, developmentally disabled, and other handicapped individuals. Attached to this report are examples of older persons in VISTA. In the Peace Corps, older Americans generally make good volunteers, and every effort is made to place them once they have been found ellgible for service. At the present time, in the age bracket of 61 and over we have 150 volunteers, (2.7 per- cent) and 17 trainees (1.3 percent) and in the age bracket between 51 to 60 there are 149 volunteers (2.7 percent) and 19 trainees (1.5 percent). Sincerely, JOHN R. LEWIB, Associate Director for Domestic and Anti-Poverty Operations. (Enclosure.] OLDER AMERICANS VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS ACTION administers three older Americans volunteers programs for persons 60 years and over: The foster grandparent (FGP), the retired senior volunteers program (RSVP) and the senior companion program (SCP). All three programs serve a dual purpose. The main thrust of volunteer service is to meet basic human needs of the community in which the volunteers live and serve. Older American volunteers help solve local problems and improve life in their communities. At the same time they enrich their own lives through service to others. Volunteers enrolled as foster grandparents and senior companions are drawn from the low income population. They receive a modest weekly stipend which makes it possible for them, without cost to themselves, to contribute their sup- port and personal concern to especially needy children and to vulnerable adults, particularly frail elderly in their homes. They serve 4 hours per day 5 days per week. RSVP differs from these programs. It draws volunteers without regard to income who are over age 60 and directs them to a great variety of community service opportunities. Many RSVP volunteers serve for only a few hours a week. Others 226 have become so involved that they serve virtually full time, reflecting the varyingpersonal needs and interests of people in the later years.In the 6 years of ACTION's stewardship of the older Americans volunteerprograms the programs have experienced marked growth: RSVP from 1,816 in 1972 to 225,000 in 1977FGP 4,221 in 1971 to 16,500 in 1977SCP from 900 in 1975 to 2,880 in 1977 In the year just ended, $1 million of foster grandparent program funds havebeen used to support the development of 10 innovative \"grass roots\", noninstitu-tional sponsors. The senior companion program has concentrated more of its resources on serv-ice to homebound older persons where the personal support and advocacy activ-ities of the volunteers decrease the chances that the person served will have to goto a nursing home. In order to enhance the existing strengths of all of the older Americans volun-teer programs, ACTION is assisting project directors through a series of technicalassistance papers to identify needs, marshal community resources and maximizethe impact of volunteers. In 1977, ACTION explored cooperative efforts with the National Para-LegalInstitute to involve RSVP volunteers as public advocates for counseling theelderly and others on fixed and low incomes.Discussions have been held with the National Indian Council on Aging toreview ACTION's policies and program operation handbooks for the older Ameri-cans volunteer programs, to overcome hurdles for programing for Indians, andto permit an expanded response to the needs of native Americans. RETIRED SENIOR VOLUNTEER PROGRAM In fiscal year 1978, approximately one-quarter million retired senior volunteersserve at an annual Federal cost of $80 per senior volunteer. Only 2 percent ofthe estimated potential of 9.6 million senior volunteers are now enrolled in RSVP.RSVP volunteers presently serve mainly in four of the basic human needssectors: Health and nutrition, community service, knowledge and skills, economicdevelopment, and income service.In the health sector, assistance to low income older persons in private andgovernment funded title VII nutrition projects accounted for half of the servicehours. Volunteers assist isolated, homebound seniors as well as persons able toparticipate in title VII nutrition programs. Delivery of direct health benefithis another aspect of health sector service. Volunteer participation in immunizationand bloodmobile projects are examples of actual delivery of preventive andcurative treatment to people of all ages.Over a third of all RSVP volunteer time was directed toward communityservices. Within this sector, the provision of person-to-person contact and supportto develop helping relationships accounted for most of the volunteer hours.Telephone reassurance, friendly visiting, widow counseling are examples of projectactivities. Another aspect of community service involves transportation systemdevelopment which links homebound seniors to necessary social and medicalservices. RSVP involvement in community organization indicates RSVP volunteers arein an especially strong position to counteract conditions in their communitieswhich go against their own good and that of other citizens.The RSVP project in Des Moines, Iowa is one example. Thirty-five volunteersin Des Moines are members of a senior citizens advocacy group which continuesto press for better health care, safety, transportation and legal services for them-selves and their peers. The advocacy group recently presented its views to the Iowa Commission onAging on social service needs for the elderly. RSVP volunteers documented theneed for ignproved State financing of long-term nursing home care, the availabilityof inexpensive housing for seniors and increased State rebates on property taxes andrental payments and the development of a State supported winterization programfor the elderly. Volunteers also served on a citywide task force on special transpor-tation services. Their recommendations led to establishing a door-to-door transpor-tation system, supplementing local transit authority service, which contributed tothe linking of isolated older persons to community services. 227 In Des Moines continuing advocacy activity involves the placement of RSVP volunteei s on four health care review boards. They are part of a team which monitors conditions in area nursing homes through regular inspection of buildings and interviews with residents. Recommendations identifying the need for improved conditions are submitted to nursing home managers and State officials. The Des Moines RSVP group recently organized a hearing for State legislators on senior citizens needs. There have been followup meetings to clarify issues with selected representatives. RSVP volunteers plan to organize senior citizens groups in 1978 to support State legislative proposals benefiting older persons. Special, primary and elementary education services are an important RSVP activity nationwide. Volunteers serve as teachers' aids, helping children with learn- ing problems in social adjustment hand-eye coordination, reading, math and arts and crafts. Special education involves basic skills development for children with physical and mental handicaps and general assistance to school psychologists and caseworkers.FOSTER GRANDPARENT PROGRAM Approximately 16,500 foster grandparents are providing perscnalized care to 41,000 children with special needs in 195 projects. Settings where foster grandparents normally serve include correctional facilities, pediatric wards of general hospitals, schools, day care centers, private homes, and institutions for the mentally retarded and physically handicapped. Sixty percent of the FGP volunteers serve the mentally retarded and physically handicapped. During fiscal year 1977 the volunteers became active partners in new State programs to return a limited number of institutionadized children to communities. Increasingly, volunteers are assigned to children with the potential to function in intermediate group and private home settings. There are, conservatively, 8,700 potential foster grandparents project waiting lists. A recent national survey indicates there are 500,000 potential foster grand- parents. If ACTION had the resources to enroll them, approximately 1 milion needy children could be served. In North Carolina, six foster grandparents are assigned to a newly organized community day care center for profoundly and severely retarded children who live with their parents and commute to the center. The foster grandparents assist in treatment programs with specific motor development and self-help skill goals for each child. Efforts to assign more volunteers to younger children in private homes is expected to help parents cope with the special needs of the handicapped, pre- venting or delaying the necessity of institutionalization. In many State institutions, foster grandparents are active participants in the development of a plan of care for profoundly and severely retarded children. They participate with professional staff in group discussions on the child's progress or lack of progress and offer suggestions which lead to improved treatment. Doctors in the pediatric ward of a large hospital report that the love and special handling given by foster grandparents assigned to babies diagnosed as failure-to-thrive infants has led to their interest in eating, thus increasing their chances for survival. Twenty-five percent of the grandparents are serving children in public and privately funded educational settings. Under the supervision of classroom teachers, they are providing regular personal attention to children with special learnig problems. The 150 foster grandparents assigned to children in the Broward County, Florida elementary schools help slow learners with eye-hand coordination problems and speech/reading deficiencies. In the community services category, assistance to runaway youths, abused and battered children, and juvenile delinquents account for 14 percent of the FGP service activities. Many foster grandparents have helped predelinquent and delinquent children overcome resistance to authority and have contributed to their resocialization and sometimes earlier-than-expected discharge. Ten female foster grandparents are assigned to a residential juvenile home for boys in Erie, Pennsylvania. They serve in an after school program supervising group recreation activities and counseling 7-12 year olds with emotional problems. A former resident of a juvenile correctional institution in California described his experience with a foster grandparent: Many times I was upset to the point of doing something I would have re- gretted later and if she hadn't given me the guidance and love I needed, I probably still would be locked up. 228 One of ACTION's most diversified foster grandparent projects is in Allegheny County, Pa. This project was originally funded in 1972 to enroll 100 volunteers to serve in institutions for the mentally retarded and otherwise handicapped children. The project was expanded to the present 120 foster grandparents. They serve in a variety of settings, including private homes and public schools. Because of the new \"right-to-education\" law, foster grandparents in the original institutional settings are being transferred to serve with young people considered sufficiently competent to live in \"cottage communities\" or halfway houses. Foster grandparents also provide inhome assistance to \"troubled families\" that find it difficult to cope with emotionally disturbed, abused and neglected children. Foster grandparents support normally functioning parents in their relationship with handicapped children; work with limited or retarded parents to assist in carrying out a stimulation program for children and support the family unit by strengthening relationships between the parents and handicapped children. The personal impact on participants in the foster grandparents programs is decidedly twofold. Both the grandparents and their foster grandchildren are positively affected by their contact. The greatest gains for the foster grandparents are noticeably improved health and self-respect. A local doctor near one project mentioned that he sees his elderly patients less frequently now that they are in- volved in the foster grandparents program. Other often-mentioned gains for the grandparents include: a feeling of usefulness, satisfaction from helping children; extra income, companionship, love, and independence. SENIOR COMPANION PROGRAM The senior companion program provides opportunities for low-income older Americans, aged 60-plus, to give help, support and companionship to adults with exceptional needs. The program is being directed primarily toward helping vulnerable, frail elderly persons maintain independent or semi-independent living in their own places of residence. Personal gains for homebound, isolated older people are clearly reflected in improved health, mobility and spirit. Senior companions also ease the impersonal nature of group care in nursing homes and institutions, developing a neighborly, helpful relationship that at times contributes to a client's return to their community. In fiscal year 1977, 2,941 senior companions addressed the substantive needs of 10,000 other older Americans in private homes, intermediate care facilities and residential institutions. The program has grown from 18 demonstration projects funded in 1974 to 46 projects in 37 States and Puerto Rico. SCP volunteers are developing new roles as advocates for clients who are depend- ent on others if they are to live independent or semi-independent lives in their own homes. In 1977, 68 percent of the senior companions were assigned to home- bound clients. Activities which companions best provide are peer support, monitoring a client's health, social and environmental conditions, aid in personal management of a household and provide advocacy for a client's social support through develop- ment of links to appropriate community services. In many cases the friendship and support of a senior companion has prevented an older person's entering a nursing home. In Yakima, Washington, an elderly man in a rooming house became depressed and withdrawn as a result of a serious arthritic condition. He was on the verge of being placed in a nursing home when a senior companion was assigned to him. The companion helped him obtain homemaker health aid assistance, encouraged him not to dwell on his aches and pains and escorted him to the local title VII nutrition center, where he now receives a nourishing meal. He no longer speaks of the possibility of having to go to a nursing home. Senior companions are also in the vanguard of the process of assisting insti- tutionalized older Americans to return to a community of support. Once they return, they receive continued support from senior companions which sustains their ability to maintain independent living arrangements. A senior companion in Goldsboro, North Carolina has helped a mental patient of 20 years reach the point where she may soon be transferred to a boarding home in the community. Hospital staff say the 3 years of personalized attention given by the senior companion has resulted in the resocialization of a 62-year old patient who had severe withdrawal and antisocial behavior patterns. The 77 senior companions assigned to settlement houses throughout New York are in the forefront of ACTION's national effort to enhance the capacity of vulnerable older persons to live at home and prevent their premature nstitutionalization. In its 3 years as an SCP sponsor, united neighborhood houses (UNH) com- panions have served over 300 clients in 12 sections of the city. With the support of volunteer station supervisors and project staff, companions have become im- portant facilitators in identifying and arranging for comprehensive medical, socialization and chore services for their clients. The program has enhanced the quality of the lives of senior companions them- selves. Approximately 50 percent of these low income volunteers were referred to the program to help prevent their own deterioration and isolation. All clients have received some form of support; help with shopping, nutrition services and advice on household management and personal care. In a typical 1-year period, senior companions in a section of New York City served as advocates for their clients in locating and utilizing the following city services: 41 persons received homemaking assistance, 37 received meals on wheels, 28 were assisted in obtaining income maintenance entitlements, 14 mental health assistance, and 55 were assisted in obtaining medical aid. In addition 14 received a variety of legal counseling assistance. In Colony South, Brooklyn, a 69 year old senior companion has helped provide a core of basic support services to two homebound clients. One is a Puerto Rican woman who lives in a third floor walkup apartment five blocks from a street drug traffic center. She was referred to the program by social workers following her hospitalization. The senior companion has enrolled her in the supplemental security income and food stamp programs, arranged for a title XX homemaker and secured needed mental health services to help with disorientation problems. Advocacy activities on behalf of the second client, a 71-year old retired female garment worker, include a successful housing court petition to secure a rent reduction and the use of private pension benefits for homemaker services and psychiatric help. PLANNED ACTIVITIES FOR 1978 Recognizing the capabilities of older Americans, ACTION plans to encourage and actively support efforts to provide increasingly meaningful opportunities for its older volunteers to address the most pressing human needs within their communities. Particular areas of emphasis will include the application of volunteers to maxi- mize the ability of vulnerable persons to remain in their own communities as opposed to being cared for in an institution; volunteer service in preventive and treatment programs in the health-care field; personal assistance to children and adults in basic language and reading skill development; consumer and financial counseling; legal rights assistance; individual support in rehabilitation of potential and ex-offenders in the criminal justice system, expecially juveniles; and the increased participation of volunteers in outreach and community needs assessment. As an extension of these efforts, ACTION will seek further cooperative inter- agency efforts-particular at the Federal level-to affect mutual concern for unmet human needs such as health care, education, transportation. On an interagency basis, coordinated projects are being developed between VISTA, OAVP, and OPP in efforts that should enable communities to more fully mobilize their resources on behalf of their less fortunate members. In addi- tion, ACTION will develop technical assistance materials to assist projects in emphasis areas and provide a forum for an exchange of information through the new older Americans periodical \"Prime Times\". OLDER PERSONS IN VISTA ACTION legislation requires that VISTA encourage, \"fullest participation of older persons and older person membership groups as volunteers and participant agencies ...7 A 1977 survey revealed that 21 percent of VISTA projects are involved in programs designed to serve older people living in poverty. As of January 1, 1978, 15 percent of all VISTA volunteers were 55 years of age or older, including 184 persons who are 70 and older among the 650 volunteers in the over 55 category. While 34 percent of all VISTA's are men, 42 percent of the 230 over 55 age category are men, which is interesting in view of some difficulty thathas been experienced involving older men in volunteer activities.Projects reported the following kinds of efforts on behalf of poor people whoare older: 43 percent social services delivery; 21 percent public assistance/advo-cacy; 13 percent transportation; 20 percent health services/nutrition; 12 percenthousing/energy conservation. Wisconsin-Milwaukee Association in Urban Development VISTA has been involved in establishing an outreach program to providetransportation services to needy elderly individuals. Funding-both grants anddonations-has been obtained; community volunteers have donated services tothe program. VISTA has also worked to publicize the problem of substandard nursing homecare in Milwaukee County and to take steps toward improving these conditions.This has involved developing questionnaires, visiting nursing homes to gatherinformation on care and working with task forces comprised of communitymembers. Tennessee-Metropolitan Inter-Faith Association 17 VISTA volunteers are assisting this organization in Memphis, Tennesseeto serve the needs of senior citizens. The focus of their efforts has been:(1) Developing a resource center for the elderly which includes a library,speakers bureau, and resource directory. (2) Supervision of the development of a countrywide home delivered needsprogram for the elderly using community volunteers as the primary deliveryservice. (3) Coordinating transportation to congregate meal sites for the elderly.(4) Providing ancillary support and advocacy to those senior citizens receivingpublic assistance but still have unmet needs. (5) Coordinating housing repair services for the elderly with other public andprivate human services organizations in Memphis. Utah-Snow College VISTA volunteers have been involved in serving senior citizens in numerousways: (1) Planning and implementing housing refurbishing/winterization loans andfinancial assistance programs. (2) Referring individuals to agencies (SSI, food stamps, etc.) to receive benefits. (3) Establishing transportation service program to needy elderly people. (4) Planning and implementing meals-on-wheels programs. (5) Obtaining discounts with local merchants for senior citizens. (6) Planning and implementing activities at nursing homes, as well as providingvisitation to individual senior citizens. (7) Providing consumer advocacy for the elderly. (8) Recruiting community volunteers-many which are senior citizens to pro-vide assistance in service delivery. (9) Obtaining grants from State and Federal sources. Texas-Project Bravo, Inc. Nine VISTA volunteers in El Paso, Texas have been serving the needs of seniorcitizens in the following ways: (1) Planning and implementing a senior citizen discount program in El PasoCounty in conjunction with 3-0 businesses. (2) Establishing a senior citizen homebound visitation program using telephone or home visits to reach 40 homebound senior citizens per month throughout theCity of El Paso. The average VISTA project serving the poor generated almost $45,000 in benefits accruing to the poor, including assistance in the areas of health, income, housing and community services. Assistance generated include supplies, equipment, facilities, donated services,transportation, recreation programs, reduced charges for goods and services, and job income. ITEM 12. CIVIL AERONAUTICS BOARD FEBRUARY 1, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Your letter of December 14 asks for a summary of ourmajor actions on the aging during 1977, for inclusion in a report by .the Senate 2i31 Special Committee on Aging. You ask also for a description of our planned activi- ties for 1978. In our letter to you of December 22, 1976, on this subject, we referred to the board's final opinion in October 1976, that senior citizen standby discount fares offered by Hawaiian Airlines for travel within the State of Hawaii were unjustly discriminatory and should be canceled, and to the concurring statement in which Members Minettti and West recommended passage of legislation authorizing such discount fares for the aged. The board in January of 1977 denied a petition by Hawaiian Airlines seeking reconsideration of that opinion. As you know, Congress amended the Federal Aviation Act in November 1977, to permit the carriers to offer reduced-rate transportation on a space-available basis to any person 60 years of age or older and retired, any person 65 years of age or older, and to handicapped persons and any attendants required by them. Congress defined the handicapped as persons with severely impaired vision or hearing, and any others as defined by the board, and the \"retired\" as no longer gainfully employed, as defined by the board. In late 1977, our staff began drafting a rule covering these definitions; it should be ready for submission to the board during the early part of 1978. So far, as a result of this recent amendment of the act, four carriers have filed tariffs with the board which offer space-available discount fares ranging from 33% to 35 percent to any person 65 or more years of age. In the case of two carriers, Allegheny and Continental, the elderly passenger is required to purchase an identification card at a cost of $20, which must be presented as proof of age. We would expect that some competing carriers will offer similar discount fares as a defensive response. We also anticipate that standby discount fares will be offered to persons 60 years or older and retired and handicapped persons, when the board defines these categories as the act requires. Other than formulating these rules and carrying out its responsibilities under the new law, the board does not contemplate any other activities relating par- ticularly to the aged and aging during 1978. I cannot refrain from calling to your attention recent board policies encouraging innovative, low-fare proposals by airlines, which, while not specifically geared to the aged, will nevertheless surely be beneficial to them. In addition, as an original cosponsor of the Cannon-Kennedy bill, you are probably aware that the board generally supports the bill, partly because it would make price competition and lower fares an important statutory responsibility of this agency. A vigorously competitive airline industry-competitive in price as well as service and other amenities-should help stimulate lower fares in some markets, and make travel more practical for everyone-and especially for people, like the elderly, living on fixed incomes. I trust this provides the information you require. Sincerely, ALFRED E. KAHN, Chairman. ITEM 13. CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION JANUARY 20, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in response to your letter of December 14, 1977, inviting us to submit a summary of our major actions on aging during 1977- Our report on these activities is enclosed and is entitled \"Major 1977 Activities of the Civil Service Commission Affecting Rights and Benefits of Older Ameri- cans.\" Our 1978 activities in this area should continue to focus on efforts to assure nondiscrimination on account of age in employment and to provide services and assistance related to administration of the Civil Service Retirement System and the Retired Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. In addition, there is increasing emphasis by the President and the Commission on expanding part-time employment, and older people are among those who might benefit particularly from these efforts. We hope this report will be a useful addition to your committee's publication. Thank you for the opportunity to participate. If any other information is needed, please let us know. Sincerely yours, RAYMOND JACOBSON, Executive Director. 232 [Enclosure.] MAJOR 1977 ACTIVITIES OF THE CIVIL SERVIOE COMMISSION AFFECT- ING RIGHTS AND BENEFITS OF OLDER AMERICANS ADEA (AGE DIscRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT) PROGRAM The Commission (and Federal agencies) continued the program to assure non- discrimination on account of age under the law, as amended in 1974, and imple- menting Commission regulations. This included policy interpretations; processing of complaints, appeals, and notices of intent to file civil action under ADEA; program evaluation; statistical data prcgram development; Department of Labor and other liaison-coordinative relationships; orientation, training, and other efforts to inform and publicize; and other ongoing activities. The ADEA defines the age group protected by the act as \"individuals who areat least 40 years of age but less than 65 years of age.\" Commission regulationsreflected this provision. However, on July 22, 1977, the Ccmmission amended itsregulations to comply with an appellate court decision (Christie v. Marston, 7thCircuit Court 1977, 551 F. 2d 1080) that Federal employees between ages 65 and70 who are subject to mandatory retirement at age 70 are also protected under theADEA. This change was made effective back to March 4, 1977, the effective dateof the court decision. On April 15, 1977, the Commission issued guidance to agencies regarding entryage limit proposals under two different provisions of law through which theCommission may establish, or concur in an agency proposal to establish, a mini-mum or maximum age limit for entry into Federal civilian positions. In thisissuance (FP. Letter 338-7), the Commission explained and created mechanismsto deal with the differences between (1) age limits as bona fide occupational quali-fication (BFOQ) exceptions under the ADEA and (2) age limits for entry intothose law enforcement or firefighter jobs which are covered by early mandatoryretirement and entry age provisions of P.L. 93-350 and which are thus consideredto constitute exceptions from ADEA coverage. It is clear that Congress intendedthat agencies could set entry age limits under P.L. 93-350, subject to a Commissiondetermination of reasonableness, and the Commission has given its concurrence to several agencies under this provision. However, under the ADEA age discrimina- tion prohibition and its rigorous requirement for establishing job-relatedness of maximum age limits, the Commission expects that the setting of a maximum entry age under ADEA will be rare. In fact, the Commission to date has neither approvedany proposal for nor initiated the establishment of a \"BFOQ\" age limit underthe ADEA provision. The Federal EEO discrimination complaints system has been available toindividual Federal civilian employees and applicants in the ADEA-protected agegroup since the May 1, 1974 effective date of the 1974 ADEA amendments. Agediscrimination was the subject of about 11 percent of formal discrimination complaints filed by individuals in fiscal year 1976 and about 12 percent of those filed during the fiscal year 1976-77 transitional quarter (latest information available). Effective April 18, 1977, the Commission issued regulations establishing admin-istrative procedures for the processing of class complaints of discrimination, including class complaints of age discrimination. The Mandatory Retirement Issue The Congress continues to consider bills to extend or remove the upper age limit of the ADEA-protected age group. One of the major effects intended by these legislative efforts would be to abolish or create drastic reductions in mandatory retirement based on age. In 1977, the Commission reviewed the statutory provision for mandatory age 70 retirement in the Federal employment sector. The Commis- sion concluded that repeal of this provision would be more in keeping with nondiscrimination and true merit principles. Attached to this report is a copy of Civil Service Commission Chairman Alan K. Campbell's June 23, 1977 testimony on this subject before the Subcommittee on Compensation and Employee Benefits, Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, House of Representatives. CIVIL SERVICE ANNUITANTS Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. section 8340, the annuities of retirees and survivor annui- tants under the Federal Civil Service Retirement System were increased to keep 233 abreast of changes in the cost-of-living. Annuities were increased by 4.8 percent ef- f ective March 1, 1977 and again by 4.3 percent effective September 1, 1977. These increases were made in accordance with Public Law 94-440, approved October 1 1976, which amended the retirement law to provide automatic cost-of-living adjustments at 6 month intervals (on March 1 and September 1 of each year) to reflect rises in the consumer price index. After a period of experimentation, the Commission instituted a nationwide system for the direct deposit of monthly payments to annuitants' bank (or other financial organization) accounts. This new service uses the electronic funds transfer (EFT) program which was developed jointly by the Treasury Department, the the Federal Reserve System, and the banking industry. For those annuitants who elect to participate in the program, the service eliminates the possibility of lost or stolen checks. The Commission approved 13 new comprehensive medical plans (Health Maintenance Organizations) for participation in the Federal empiloyees health benefits (FEHB) program. These plans provide health services on a piepaid basis to subscribers living in the specific geographic areas covered by the plans. During the annual FEHB open seasons, employees and annuitants can enroll in any plan for which they are eligible. Commission participation with groups on aging The Commission continued to participate in activities dealing with problems of older Americans. For example, in cooperation with the Administration on Aging, the Commission continued to make certain information and referral serv- ices available in its nationwide job information center network for use of older Americans. Intergovernmental personnel pro graims The Commission has proposed a revision in the Standards for a Merit System of Personnel Administration. The Merit System Standards are applicable to 25 Federal grant programs and over 300 State agencies receiving Federal grants. Since 1971 they have prohibited employment discrimination based on age. The discrimination provisions of the standards have been modified to include more detailed material which parallels the language found in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and other major national legislation on discrimination. It includes more specific requirements for affirmative action pro- grams and a better basis to further effective progress in equal employment oppor- tunity in State and local agencies. As proposed, the new language will provide as follows: \"Equal employment opportunity will be assured in the State system and affirmative action provided in its administration. Discrimination against any person in recruitment, exami- nation, appointment, training, promotions, retention, discipline or any other aspect of personnel administration because of race, national origin, or other nonmerit factors will be prohibited. Discrimination on the basis of age or sex, or physical disability will be prohibited except where specific age, sex, or physical require- ments constitute a bonia fide occupational qualification necessary to, proper and efficient administration. The regulations will include provisions for appeals in cases of alleged discrimination to an impartial body whose determination shall be binding upon a finding of discrimination.\"~ ITEM 14. COMMUNITY SERVICES ADMINISTRATION FE13RUARY 17, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: In response to your request, I am pleased to submit to the Senate Special Committee on Aging, a report of the activities and programs carried out by the Community Services Administration during fiscal year 1977 on behalf of the elderly poor. The Community Services Administration has a special concern for and commit- ment to the ever increasing number of older poor persons in our country. The problems of poverty they face in fiscal year 1978 are increasingly more acute as their declining health, limited resources and isolation make them more vulnerable to the pressures of inflation and rising energy costs. I sincerely hope the substance of this report will be of assistance to your com- mittee. I also want to take this opportunity to reaffirm the commitment of CSA 234 to contribute in every way possible to make the lives of older Americans more dignified, independent, and fruitful. Sincerely, GRACIELA (GRACE) OLIVAREZ,Director. [Enclosure.] In 1965, the first Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, R. Sargent Shriver created an OEO Task Force on programs for older Americans. Among the policy recommendations contained in a report entitled \"Poverty and Older Americans\" issued by the task force in August of that year was the following: Many governmental agencies cannot give preferences or priority in their services on the basis of poverty criteria. OEO has a specific mandate to develop and support programs precisely for the poor. OEO can exercise its mandate through the supplementation or enrichment of programs related to the services of these other by providing the additional resources which will give the older persons access to the available opportunities on a more equal basis. ... Twelve years later, these words still very adequately describe the policy of the Community Services Administration, the successor agency to OEO, with respect to advocacy, mobilization of resources and program support for the elderly poor. CSA funds programs assisting low-income older persons through section 221,Community Action Agencies local initiative, section 222, special programs and assistance and section 232 research and demonstration programs, Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 (as amended). CSA grantees, primarily community action agencies, function as a support network that links the various forms of public and private assistance to enable the elderly poor to gain their fair share of the benefits to which they are entitled. In 1977, the Community Services Administration spent a total of $222,500,000 in programs and activities designed to provide assistance to the elderly poor. Using figures drawn from CSA categorical outlays, the actual proportional contribution to the elderly poor is as follows: -$50 million of $327 million local initiative moneys was spent by CAA's to provide services for the elderly; -of $26.7 million in community food and nutrition program funds, approxi- mately $5.3 million went to elderly feeding and nutrition programs; -60 percent of the $200 million appropriated for the special crisis intervention program, $120 million was obligated to older poor persons for emergency energy assistance; -$64 million of a total $107 million available through the agency's energy conservation and weatherization program was provided to weatherize homes for the elderly poor or near-poor; -$12 million of SOS program funds. In terms of individuals or households served, CSA's activities for fiscal year 1977 are summarized as follows: Number of grantees Elderly persons served Funding category Rural Urban Rural Urban Local initiative ------------------------------------- 400 195 861, 442 1, 499, 202 CFNP ------------------------------------------- 338 99 934, 354 681, 052 SOS -------------------------------------------- 128 67 962, 530 783.,939 Energy -- ----- ------ ------ ----- 133 101 173,979 140,803 1 Units weatherized. Note.-Energy (crisis intervention), 1,583,352 elderly persons served nationwide. SENIOR OPPORTUNITIES AND SERVICES The Senior Opportunities and Services (SOS) program authorized as a special emphasis program for the elderly poor by the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 (as amended) has demonstrated exceptional versatility as a program vehicle with activities ranging from service delivery to advocacy. It serves as the Community Service Administration's primary program for identifying and meeting the 235 special needs of the elderly poor. Grassroots projects, most of them operated through community action agencies, are utilized by the program to help the elderly poor help themselves. In furthering this goal, the projects must serve and employ persons age 60 and over; provide the elderly poor with the opportunity to plan and design their programs; and deal with those specific problems of the low-income elderly not being addressed by programs serving multigenerational groups. Additionally, the SOS projects serve as a medium for the elderly and local programs designated to serve older Americans. In 1977, CSA funded 195 SOS projects at a cost of $12 million. These projects provided a variety of services ranging from recreation to employment for over 11% million aged poor. The projects in their design provided the maximum oppor- tunity for the elderly poor to develop, direct and administer such programs, while utilizing existing services and other programs to the maximum extent feasible. CSA grantee impact on the well-being of the elderly has been substantial despite static SOS funding levels. CSA's appropriation when measured in terms of resources mobilized for and on behalf of the elderly poor highlights the effective- ness of these funds as a leverage tool assuring the delivery of services to the elderly poor at the local level. Perhaps most importantly, SOS has provided an effective network of services to enable elderly persons to live independently in their own homes. One of the most innovative and successful of CSA's program operations is the funding of statewide organizations of senior groups. This new concept of organiz- ing on a statewide level older poor persons and other groups of seniors is currently functioning in eight States: New York, North Carolina, Colorado, Montana, North and South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. These statewide organizations, in addition to the Mountain Plains States Con- gress of Senior Organizations which coordinates the efforts of all six states in region VIII, continue to make rapid growth in their advocacy efforts resulting in new legislation and institutional change benefiting not only older poor persons but all the poor residing in their respective States. COMMUNITY FOOD AND NUTRITION PROGRAM According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 1977 Handbook of Agri- culture Charts, the absolute minimum cost of a week's food for a couple 55 years or older is $21.20 per week. The same report states an elderly couple with an income of less than $5,000 spends approximately 26 percent of their disposable income on food. Since the average disposable income for elderly couple on social security is $4,092 per year, the amount available for food is less per week than the minimum amount required for healthy survival. Realizing that good health, indeed survival, depends significantly on having an adequate diet, more than two-thirds of the CFNP funds were allocated in fiscal year 1977 towards advocacy or supplemental programs-both of which impact heavily on the elderly poor. Advocacy programs emphasize food stamp participa- tion and bring other Federal food programs \"To the Community\". Supplemental programs tend to center around the funding of Federal food programs (such as elderly feeding) for short periods until normal program funds can come into the community. In many cases, the alternative to CFNP funds is hunger. ENERGY AND THE ELDERLY The elderly comprise a significant portion of those hardest hit by rising energy costs. \"Colder ...Darker\", a study of the impact of the energy crisis on low- income Americans released last month by the Communtiy Services Administration, indicates that 37 percent of low-income households have heads 65 or older, com- pared with but 18 percent of all U.S. households. We are submiting a copy of this study, prepared for CSA by the Washington center for metropolitan studies, along with this report. The committee's attention is called to the final section of the report beginning on page 73. As pointed out there, not only do elderly make up a substantial portion of the low-income, but they are in many respects particularly hard hit by high energy costs. They are frequently \"overhoused\", in that they live alone in houses in which their entire families used to reside. As their income diminished and their children left, many costs of housing upkeep, particularly energy costs, did not diminish correspondingly. Consequently they are left with 24-084 0 -78 -16 230 expenses which in some respects are similar to those of larger families, which are aserious drain on incomes which for a larger family would be below the povertythreshold, but which, because of their small family size do not qualify them for some programs of assistance. The Washington center study also points out that the housing of the elderlyis less well insulated than other low-income households, with fully 50 percent ofhouses occupied by the elderly having no insulation at all. Furthermore, as thecommittee well knows, the elderly frequently have illnesses that are aggravatedby cold temperatures, and are generally less able to withstand the cold thanyounger persons. CSA has funded a demonstration project in the State of Mainewith the diocese of Portland, that is providing warm clothi ig to the elderly andwhich will be carrying out studies on the subject of hypothermia, which manysuspect is far more prevelant and serious than we have heretofore understood.The seriousness of the impact of the energy crisis on the elderly is reflectedboth in CSA's program regulations and in the reports of program progress onthe number and types of households served by all of CSA's energy programs.In addition to the regulation revisions already mentioned, both last summer'sspecial crisis intervention program (SCIP), and the anticipated energy emergencyassistance program set a priority on serving the elderly. More complete reportson both SCIP and CSA's regular energy conservation program are now beingtabulated, and we will be happy to share them with the committee as soon asthey are available. In the meantime, however, several sample States can becited: In the SCIP program, several States, including Texas and New York,served only the elderly. Of 80,000 heads of household certified for payment inMichigan, 76,000 were 65 and older. With regard to the CSA-funded weatheriza-tion program, Pennsylvania reports that 85 percent of the houses weatherizedhave elderly heads of households. In the most recent reports from Virginia andMaine, the figures were 525 of 841 houses weatherized, and 245 of 447, respectivelyfor the latest reporting periods. CSA's INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS Statement of mutual support between the Administration on Aging and CSA. The statement includes several activities common to the programs of bothagencies that lend themselves to joint endeavors ra iging from informationexchange to joint service delivery for older persons. The Administration on Aging and the Community Services Administration will promote programs andactivities which are designed to bring about maximum coordination between theresources available through joint planning, programing and implementation atthe Federal, regional, State and local levels. Activities that are common to theseprograms and lend themselves specifically to joint endeavors are: The exchange of information, planning and coordination, and research and demonstration.This statement of mutual support is currently under revision by CSA and AoA so it may be strengthened to include a wider variety of mutual activities on the State and local level. CSA is also cooperating with more than 10 Federal agencies to evolve a morecomprehensive and effective information and referral system to provide the elderly with current information on their entitlements and programs designedto serve them. RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS The CSA research and demonstration program supports projects which supple-ment existing knowledge in a variety of areas which are critical to the development and improvement of programs designated to serve the elderly poor. -Project EXITO (Spanish for success) was developed to assist elderly Hispanic- Americans obtain the support services necessary to remain in their homes. Essentially, a theoretical design for the intergenerational exchange of services, the project was tested in Natalia, Tex. and contributed substantially to the agency's body of knowledge on this type of service provision and likewise on the delivery of services to the Hispanic elderly. -A demonstration program investigating employment options for retired persons in a economically-depressed area in central Pennsylvania was under- taken by the Institute for Regional Affairs of Bucknell University. The purpose of the grant was to test the feasibility of establishing a business concern oriented towards employment and support of the elderly in rural and semirural areas. 237 -Elderly victimization prevention and assistance programs have been funded on a demonstration basis in New York City, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and New Orleans, La. The purpose of the project is to protect low-income, isolated elderly from burglaries and street crimes, to develop comprehensive, coordinated ap- proaches to the reduction of such problems in selected target areas, and to collect identifiable, assessable data on the impact of the project on elderly individuals and their immediate community. -CSA is engaged in this national research and pilot program with the Admin- istration on Aging (AoA), LEAA, and HUD. EVALUATION OF SENIOR OPPORTUNITIES AND SERVICES PROGRAM An impact evaluation is now in the design phase and will be implemented in this fiscal year. This will focus on the impact of senior opportunities and services program (SOS) as well as the impact of the SOS programs on the mobilization of other program resources. The evaluation will be designed by the new office of policy, planning and evalua- tion within CSA. The results will be made available to the committee up n completion. CHANGES IN CSA ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AFFECTING ELDERLY POOR In October, 1977, responsibility for the policy coorc'ination and overall moni- toring of CSA programs for the elderly was transferred fro n the special programs division of the office of operations, now abolished, to the new office of program development, which also has responsibility for re earch and demonstration activities on behalf of older Americans, coordinates its policy function regarding the elderly with the office of regional operations. The Office of regional operations administers the senior opportunities and services programs designed exclusively for the elderly poor, as well as the multi- generational programs conducted by the community aztion agencies which impact upon the elderly poor. The offices of program development and regional cpsrations are the main operating arms of the newly-created office of community a tion, which is headed by Robert N. Smith, an Assistant Director of the Community Services Administration.

ENCLOSURE 3.-GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE'S INTERNAL ACTIVITIES FOR THE ELDERLY Equal employment opportunity and merit promotion, two programs covered by GAO orders, provide the basis for our policy regarding employment of theelderly-from the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of age in employment and in selection for job vacancies, other policies and practices evolve. For instance,because training is important to enhance effectiveness and provide opportunitiesfor advancement, older employees are included in opportunities for training,both in-house and outside the agency. In keeping with the policy of nondiscrimination, persons over age 40 arerecruited for available positions with the office. Even with a limited level ofrecruitment, 43 persons aged 40 and older were hired during calendar year 1977. As of December 31, 1977, 1,494 persons aged 40 or older were on the rolls of the General Accounting Office. The employee health maintenance examination, a comprehensive and pro- fessional medical examination, is available on a 2-year cycle for all employees aged 40 and older. Employees nearing retirement age have available individual preretirement counseling. Our equal opportunity office also provides information and advice to persons regarding complaints of alleged discrimination because of age. ITEM 16. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY JANUARY 6, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: In response to your December 14, 1977 request, I am pleased to report the Environmental Protection Agency's involvement in the senior environmental employment (SEE) program. In September of 1976, EPA and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare's Administration on Aging (AoA) signed a joint working agreement which provided a basis for the National SEE demonstration. Work under this agreement is being carried out in two parts: Phase I-Project Planning Workshops (funded jointly), and Phase II-Pilot Demonstration Projects (funded exclusively by AoA). Based on the work accomplished in phase I, demonstration projects have been undertaken in 10 States. Each project is funded at a level of $100,000 a year for a 3-year period. Since the program began, it has provided meaningful part-time employment to over 200 older Americans in jobs relating to the prevention, abatement, and control of environmental pollution. The jobs include surveying toxic chemicals used in industrial areas, educating the public on areawide water quality planning,educating the public on programs in noise abatement, establishing and managing agency environmental libraries, presenting educational programs on the uses of pesticides and the hazards of poisoning to farmworkers, and working on surveys of environmental carcinogens. The utilization of senior citizens for environmental jobs was proven in an earlier program. Some 72 older Americans were utilized to conduct a pesticides inventory program in the State of Iowa with great success. Their activities in- cluded product registration, pesticide accident reporting, and, in general, develop- ing a statewide awareness of the dangers of misusing pesticides. The project was quite unique in that it involved cooperation and support of several organizations such as the State Agriculture Department, Commission on Environmental Quality, Commission on Aging, National Retired Teachers Association, American Association of Retired Persons, Iowa Public Community College System, and the Department of Labor. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency currently administers Federal legislation designed to control, reduce, and eliminate pollution in the areas of *Being performed at the request of committees or individual Members of Congress. 243 air, water supply, wastewater, solid waste, noise, pesticides, radiation, and toxic substances. Aside from its regulatory and enforcement functions, EPA provides technical and financial assistance to public and private agencies at all levels in support of pollution control and abatement programs and projects. A major concern in pollution control is the availability of qualified personnel at all levels to carry out the responsibilities mandated by Federal, State, and local environ- mental agencies. Moreover, environmental control activities have a relatively high potential for permanent unsubsidized employment in State and local govern- ment and in the private sector, especially in the subprofessional/technical occupations. EPA has placed a definite priority on the utilization of existing Federal and State human resource development activities for environmental needs. Co- operative Federal/State programing can provide increased numbers of qualified persons in pollution control occupations by using existing human resource de- velopment efforts. With the natural blend of EPA and AoA's program objectives, and the relatively high proportion of employable older Americans, we are examining the possibility of focusing future AoA support on other pollution abatement activities. Sincerely yours,DOUGLAS M. COSTLE. ITEM 17. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION JANUARY 3, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in response to your December 14, 1977 request for information on FCC actions and programs related to aging during 1977. The Federal Communications Commission has the mandate to regulate com- munications \". ..so as to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communications service. ...\" Consequently, our actions are generally broadly based and do not focus directly upon the needs of the aged or aging. From time to time, however, issues do arise which are of special interest or applicability to the aged; in such cases, we undertake to fully consider the special needs of the aged as they are presented to us. Recently, the commission acted on a matter pertaining to communications for the deaf and hard of hearing. According to recent data, some 52 percent of all persons with bilateral hearing losses are aged 65 or older, while only 10 percent of the general population are in this age category. Thus, consideration of tele- communications needs of the deaf is a matter of interest to the aged, although not specifically directed to the aged. In an action taken at the end of December, 1976, the Commission adopted regulations which will permit the transmission of \"closed captioning\" over a portion of the television signal. This system will allow deaf and hard of hearing citizens, by using specially designed decoders, to display captions on their television sets. Citizens with normal hearing need not acquire the special decoders, and their television pictures will remain unaffected. In this way, the deaf will be able to read the words that are spoken on television programs, without disturbing the viewing habits of the remainder of the viewers. In early 1978, we expect to institute an inquiry into the telecommunications needs of the deaf in the area of personal communications, i.e., using the telephone network. We expect to focus on the capabilities offered by new technology, particularly systems and equipment based upon micro-electronics. We appreciate receiving your report from 1976, and we intend to make it avail- able to the public and our staff. If we can be of further assistance, please do on hesitate to call upon us. Sincerely, CHARLES D. FERRIS, Chairman. ITEM 18. NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS JANUARY 23, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am pleased to report to you on the fiscal year 1977 activities of the National Endowment for the Arts related to programs for older persons. Since I have recently assumed the chairmanship of the arts endowment, I welcome the opportunity to review grants which have benefited the elderly. 244 Enclosed is a summary of the endowment's programs and grants which describes our efforts to ensure that the arts are accessible to older persons. While the endowment encourages all its grantees to make their programs accessible to the broadest segments of the population, many of our grantees have undertaken activities directed specifically at providing opportunities for seniors to attend performances and to participate in creative experiences. I trust this information will be helpful to you in completing your annual report to Congress. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. incerely, LIVINGSTON L. BIDDLE Jr.,hazrman. [Enclosure.] The National Endowment for the Arts believes that arts are integral to the lives of all citizens regardless of their physical and mental abilities, their age and their living environments. In 1976, the endowment designated special constitu- encies I as an area of agencywide concern and created the position of coordinator of special constituencies within the special projects office. The special constitu- encies coordinator is developing a multifaceted advocacy program which includes: (1) determining what arts programs already exist for special constituencies; (2) advocating more support for addressing the needs of special constituencies through endowment programs and other Federal agencies; (3) recommending ways in which the endowment can ensure that the arts are made more widely available to special constituencies; and (4) advising individuals, organizations, and grant applicants who are seeking assistance on developing arts programs for special constituencies. ATTITUDINAL BARRIERS During the last year, a great deal of attention was directed to the increasing number of individuals 65 years and older. The myriad of press articles and the widespread coverage of the congressional hearings concerning the abolishment of mandatory retirement at age 65 have served to more sharply focus public concern on how our society prepares for old age and treats its senior members. Many of the persistent stereotypes which have long prevailed about the needs and wants of older persons were seriously questioned, and in many instances dispelled. One such stereotype which happily has been diminished is that once individuals reach 65 years of age, they become unproductive members of society. We know that most older people have the desire and potential to be creative, to experience new activities, to continue \"to grow\" as individuals. The arts are playing an effective role in changing long-held stereotypes about the elderly because they provide opportunities in which older persons can explore and exercise their own creativity. One of the most persistent attitudes yet to be overcome is held by many adminis- trators in the fields of arts and of aging. It is the attitude that creative participa- tory experiences through the arts are not as important to the lives of older persons as legal services, counseling services and other social services. To foster a better understanding of how the arts contribute to the total well- being of older persons, the endowment continued its support to the National Council on the Aging's Center for Arts and Older Americans. The center attempts to stimulate a national awareness of the importance of including cultural activities as an integral part of social service programs supported by State and local agen- cies on aging. The center serves as an information resource to arts and aging administrators alike who seek technical assistance on how to develop an effective arts-related project. Through site visits, written materials, seminars and confer- ences, the center is becoming an effective means of changing arts and aging ad- ministrators' perceptions about how the arts can serve older Americans. During fiscal year 1977 the proceedings from the first national conference on arts and aging sponsored by the center were published and distributed to more than 3,000 arts and aging administrators. I am pleased to submit a copy of this sub- stantive document with this report. \"Arts and Aging: An Agenda for Action\"* contains a compilation of outstanding arts programs for older persons. It is a timely resource document for arts and aging organizations who wish to initiate similar efforts in their own communities. 1Special constituencies include: handicapped individuals, individuals 65 years and older; and institutionalized populations In hospitals, convalescent and long-term care nursug homes; mental and correctional facilities.* Retained in committee's files. 245 The endowment supported another major conference on arts and the aging in April 1977, sponsored by the associated councils of the arts, in San Antonio. This 3-day conference, attended by more than 300 arts and aging administrators, provided another opportunity for the sharing of information and planning. ARCHITECTURAL ACCESSIBILITY The absence of a barrier-free design often prevents older persons from par- ticipating in arts activities held within cultural institutions. Architectural barriers within performing arts centers, symphony halls, theaters, and museums limit an older person's attendance. The endowment continues to provide substantial support to the national arts and handicapped information service which serves as an information and technical assistance resource for solutions to architectural and program barriers for the disabled. The service encourages the development of barrier-free environments and accessible arts programs by publishing materials which illustrate how cultural institutions can eliminate these barriers. Three of the service's recent publications have addressed arts programs for the blind and visually impaired, new accessible arts programs and facilities, and architectural accessibility. The endowment's architecture, design and planning program supports archi- tectural research projects, some of which are directed at imporving the living environments of older Americans. In fiscal year 1977, a grant was awarded to support new research for bathroom design that would best accommodate the needs of older persons. In addition, all grants made for research and design of cultural facilities require the inclusion of barrier-free design. FINANCIAL BARRIERS Often economic factors are impediments to an older person's participation in arts activities. The costs of tickets and transportation may prevent the elderly from attending performances within their own communities. Various endowment grants have included matching funds to arts organizations to enable them to provide subsidies for the elderly. The following organizations have received endowment support for their efforts to make it financially possible for older audiences to participate in their programs: -ARTREACH, Milwaukee, Wis., continues to expand its ticket service and workshop series for aging and other special constituencies. -Baltimore Theatre Project's community services include performances at senior centers. -Bilingual Foundation of the Arts, Van Nuys, Calif. sponsors a program to enable low-income aging (especially Spanish) to attend cultural events. -City of Dubuque, Iowa, provides free tickets and transportation to arts events to people over 60. -Frederick Douglas Museum of African Art, Washington, D.C., maintains an outreach program to seniors, handicapped and disadvantaged teens. -Guthrie Theatre, Minneapolis, Minn., offers a series of student dramatic productions and workshops in senior residencies. -Kentucky Guild of Artists and Graftsmen, Berea, transports seniors and handicapped persons to two crafts fairs. -Ma Goose, San Francisco, Calif., is extending its youth theatre project to seniors and other target groups. -New Hampshire Music Festival, Center Harbor, is giving a series of monthly concerts by an ensemble of six musicians at senior centers and nursing homes. -New Stage Theatre, Jackson, Miss., is continuing ticket service for low-income seniors. -Old Creamery Theatre, Garrison, Iowa, includes in its community services discount tickets for seniors and performances at senior centers. -Scranton Theatre, Libre, Pa., provides transportation to cultural events. -Senior Citizens Council, Fredericksburg, Va., offers tickets and transportation to cultural events. -Una Noche Plateada, Tucson, Ariz., is continuing its performing arts series at hospitals and senior centers. -Watts Community Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles, Calif., gives two free concerts aimed at intergenerational audiences. -Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts, Vienna, Va., sponsors an arts exposure program for senior residents of public housing. 246 -Creede Repertory Theatre, Creede, Colo., supports community services in- cluding free performances for seniors. -Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival, Lakewood, Ohio, provides tickets to seniors to attend performances. -Huntington Theatre, Bay Ville, Ohio, supports a program of presentations for senior citizens. -New Theatre Festival, Baltimore, Md., extends the resources of the festival to disadvantaged groups, including senior citizens. -Pennsylvania State Festival Theatre, University Park, supports transporta- tion and ticket subsidies to the aged as part of a rural audience development program. -Pickle Family Circus, San Francisco, Calif., offers tours by a one-ring partic- ipatory circus with stops at senior citizens homes. -Nebraska Council on the Arts maintains a residency and ticket subsidy program for handicapped and older Americans. PROGRAM AcCESSIBILITY In addition to financial assistance to attend arts performances, programs that permit the elderly to become actively involved in the arts have also been encour- aged, and have increased in the 1977 fiscal year. Often when a program accom- modates seniors, the program is enriched through their participation. Grantees which are providing participatory creative programs directed by professional artists are: -Articulture, Inc., Cambridge, Mass., offers community arts programs featur- ing performance/lecture/film series for seniors and cultural planning for senior housing communities. -Ballet Folklorico de Albuquerque, New Mexico, sponsors senior dance troupe and cooperative efforts with senior groups. -Bronx Community College, New York, is providing research and support for a comprehensive arts exposure and skill development program for seniors. -Community Film Workshop, New York, is giving instruction in vido tech- nique to seniors. -Free Street Theatre, Chicago, sponsors and trains a theatre company of retired individuals. -Madison Civic Repertory Theatre, Wisconsin, sponsors a theatre residency in a nursing home which includes participation by the seniors. -Minnesota Opera Company, Minneapolis, supports music-theatre workshops involving professionals, youth and seniors and subsequent performances at community centers. -Pittsfield Council on Aging, Massachusetts, supports a gallery and workshop space for seniors. -Ames Society for the Arts, Ames, Iowa, provides senior workshops in visual arts and pupperty. -Durham Fund for Research and Development of Cultural Arts, East St. Louis, Mo., provides a multifaceted cultural enrichment program including senior citizens. -National Center for Afro-American Artists, Dorchester, Mass., supports a theatre company comprised of young adults and seniors. -Akron Rehabilitators of Community Houses, Ohio, provides ceramic arts training for seniors. -Birmingham Creative Dance Company, Georgia, gives performances, move- ment classes and workshops for senior citizens and handicapped. -Brookline Arts Center, Massachusetts, offers an intergenerational arts education program for seniors. -Frog Hollow Craft Association Middlebury, Vt., sponsors a community craft education program which includes seniors. -Manchester Craftsmen's Guild, Pittsburgh, Pa., is continuing its successful craft instruction program for seniors. -New Dance Theatre, Inc., Denver, Colo., sponsors a program which includes special dance dancercise classes for seniors.-ortheast Georgia Area Planning and Development Commission, Athens,Ga., is expanding its program of art classes for seniors. -Printmaking Workshop, New York, supports scholarship programs for children, adults, and seniors. -Camp Ella Fohs, Bronx, N.Y., supports an intergenerational program in dance and visual arts. 247 -PARKART, Birmingham, Ala., offers intergenerational multiart classes and performances. -University of Hawaii: Honolulu Community College, provides a series ofintergenerational classes in a variety of art forms. -Alabama State Council on the Arts and Humanities is adding two music teachers to its art workshop program for the disadvantaged and the elderly. -Iowa State Council is developing a program in performing, visual, and literaryarts in conjunction with the Iowa Commission on Aging. -Michigan Council for the Arts is supporting an artist-in-residence for the aged and disadvantaged groups. -South Carolina Arts Commission is offering workshops, presentations, and hands-on experiences for older Americans.-ARTKARE, Inc., Dayton, Ohio, is continuing its program of weekly visualarts workshops for seniors in nursing homes. -Community Center for the Creative Arts, Greeley, Colo., is providing anoutreach program to senior citizens. -Writers in Residence, Great Neck, N.Y., includes a drama workshop fordisadvantaged youth, hispanics, and the aging. The endowment's literature program supports and encourages writers andpoets to initiate workshops for older persons. Grants have been awarded forresidency programs in which poets and writers have conducted workshops on a long-term basis for older persons. The experiences and memories of older persons offer a wealth of material and inspiration to a writer or poet. Museums are cultural institutions which offer a myriad of experiences to all age groups. The Baltimore Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum ofArt have developed programs involving older persons which can serve as replicable models for other museums. Recently, the endowment provided support to theBaltimore museum for the production of a film expressing the creative needs of older people and how to engage them in visual arts activities. Several grants awarded by the music program have developed innovativeprograms for the elderly: -Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, Wisconsin, sponsors a \"matinee drop-in\"rehearsal program attended by older persons; -Tulsa Philharmonic Society, Oklahoma, makes performing ensemble groupsavailable to senior centers for lectures, demonstrations and concerts;-Berklee College of Music, Boston, Mass., sponsors a residency program forseptuagenarian jazz pianist and composer, Claude Hopkins in area schools and community locations; and -Monroe County Rural Heritage Alliance, West Virginia, employs musicians 55 years and older for a mountain music education program which providesinstruction in traditional instruments to community residents. The office of special projects has supported various interdisciplinary artsprograms for the elderly. Among these grants are:-Hospital Audiences, Inc., New York, sponsors performances, lectures anddemonstrations by professional artists in institutional settings, such asnursing homes, and arranges for unused tickets to be made available toseniors; and -ARTS/Boston, Boston, Mass., is cooperating with the Massachusetts De-partment of Elder Affairs to improve access to arts events for older persons.The endowment's city spirit program seeks to broaden the role of the artsin the everyday life of a neighborhood, town, city, county, region or State. Thisprogram seeks to stimulate and'encourage many community interests to cometogether to explore the ways in which the arts can be an integral part of com-munity life. While representatives of organizations serving the elderly, as well as the elderly themselves, are always involved in a city spirit project, several city spirit programs have been directly related to planning and implementingarts programs for older persons. These are: -Arts Council of Greater New Orleans, La., is working closely with the area agency on aging to complete an action plan designed to provide arts experi- ences for a large segment of the city's older population; -The Cambridge Arts Council, Massachusetts, has received support to develop a series of six cultural forums, including one on the elderly and the arts; and -Quincy Society of Fine Arts, Quincy, Ill., is augmenting its second year grant with more participation from older persons in the planning of com- munity arts activities. The National Endowment for the Arts, and its 26-member presidentially appointed advisory toard, the National Council on the Arts, will sustain the com- 248 mitment to providing opportunities for older Americans to experience and partici- pate in the arts. At the same time, the endowment is cognizant of its responsibility to encourage its grantees to integrate the elderly into their ongoing activities. During fiscal year 1978 it is anticipated that the endowment's advocacy efforts on behalf of special constituencies will increase as a result of the recent guide- lines issued by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare directing all Federal agencies to promulgate regulations for implementing section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act to ensure accessibility for the handicapped to all federally assisted programs. While the majority of older persons are not severely disabled, many of them suffer from physical impairments which impede their enjoyment of cultural activities. Ensuring that arts programs are accessible to disabled in- dividuals will directly benefit elderly individuals as well. With increasing awareness of arts administrators to the needs of older persons, I anticipate that the number of arts programs which include older Americans will increase in the coming year. ITEM 19. PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION JANUARY 13, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in response to your December 14, 1977, request for a summary of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's (PBGC) activities on aging. Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) established PBGC to provide termination insurance covering most defined benefit plans. On termination of a covered plan PBGC guarantees the payment of benefits vested under the terms of the plan within limits specified in ERISA. This includes payments to surviving beneficiaries under options such as joint and survivor annuities, as well as to the participants when they reach retirement age. Since almost all terminating plans filing with PBGC have sufficient assets to meet guaranteeable benefits, these cases are expedited to allow assets to be dis- tributed to participants and beneficiaries with a minimum of delay. In those cases with insufficient assets, top priority is given to maintaining continuity of benefit payments. If plan assets are not adequate to avoid benefit interruption. PBGC assumes trusteeship quickly so that benefits to the retirees and their beneficiaries can be continued. As of December 31, 1977, there were approximately 167 plans under PBGC trusteeship covering about 29,000 participants and beneficiaries. Under these plans PBGC has paid approximately $1,150,000 in benefits to about 10,100 individuals. Under many of these plans the participants and beneficiaries would not receive their promised benefits if PBGC were not in existence. Four of the plans under PBGC trusteeship are multiemployer plans, where PBGC exercised its discretion to guarantee benefits. (Under ERISA, as recently amended, mandatory coverage of multiemployer plans does not become effective until July 1979.) In May 1977 we exercised our discretionary authority to guarantee benefits for participants in three multiemployer plans in the millinery industry. Without PBGC protection the 2,700 plan participants, most of whom were in their seven- ties and eighties, would receive only about 25 percent of their promised benefits. In December 1977 PBGC exercised its discretion to guarantee the benefits of 1,700 participants in a milk industry multiemployer plan. It is apparent that in 1978 the number of elderly participants in insufficient terminating plans receiving guaranteed benefits from PBGC will increase. In addition, PBGC is charged by ERISA with the duty to provide advice and assistance to individuals regarding establishment of individual retirement accounts (IRA's), or other retirement savings, and the desirability, in particular cases, of transferring an employee's interest in a qualified retirement plan to a form of individual retirement savings upon termination of employment. In 1977, PBGC issued an updated booklet on the advantages and disadvantages of IRA's and continued to answer, by phone and letter, the many inquiries concerning the use of an IRA to provide income after retirement. With the possible advantages of establishing an IRA becoming mere widely known to employees, we anticipate that inquiries to PBGC will increase in 1978 as more employees seek to prepare for their financial needs in old age. We hope this information will be helpful to you. Sincerely, MATTHEW M. LIND, Executive Director. 249 ITEM 20. POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT FEBRUARY 17, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in response to your December 14, 1977, request for a report on the activities of the Postal Service related to aging. Although the Postal Service does not maintain age-group statistics on the number of individuals who benefit from our programs, experience shows the elderly are often the bene- ficiaries. One of our programs specifically aimed at helping the elderly, the handicapped or those who live alone is called \"postal alert\" or \"operation alert,\" depending on the community involved. The program amounts to a partnership effort be- tween the Postal Service and a local community group or agency. Under the plan, letter carriers keep an eye on mail delivery boxes marked with a bright red or orange sticker given to a customer registered in the program. If no one picks up the mail in a reasonable time, the carrier, through a supervisor, notifies the civic group that maintains a file on the people enrolled. That group calls a friend or relative who has agreed to investigate such a warning sign. Those same carriers provide their customers, including the elderly, with con- sumer service cards under another of our programs. These cards bring to our attention, here at headquarters and at all post offices, any problems affecting mail delivery or service. They are also available at post offices. By far our most significant activity on behalf of the elderly is our ability to pursue promoters who use the mails to cheat them. We are most aware that when senior citizens are the victims they often have less ability to recoup their losses than any other age group. Statistics released by the National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice in recent years indicate the elderly are the victims of crime more than any other age group; many because they live alone at a time when their physical agility and vigor is waning. Still others are victimized because they are weakened by disease. All are potential victims of promoters who attempt to steal from the elderly, without force, by telling a lie about a product or service. And, without question, many elderly victims are hit hard, since they live on fixed incomes and savings made meager by inflation. Medical fraud by mail ranks as the cruelest of swindles aimed at the elderly, especially for those willing to try anything to achieve a cure. One illegal practi- tioner, now serving a lengthy prison sentence, advertised a \"miracle pill\" in Connecticut claiming he could cure cancer. He got more than $1.5 million in return for his \"cure.\" His patients, postal inspectors found, got a pill that was mostly sugar. An advertisement that promises \"a new European discovery that not only relieves pain but actually cures arthritis\" is another example of how the sick are often promised quick, simple relief. A Rhode Island company, which zeroed in on the elderly crippled by arthritis, sold a worthless \"healing\" pad for $52. There was no medical evidence to sub- stantiate claims it could even reduce the pain of arthritis, much less cure it. Because of the False Representation Statute, the Postal Service was able to quickly stop the scheme. Thousands of elderly persons were protected from loss of money, and more importantly, possible further decline in health by relying on devices that didn't work. The False Representation Statute-title 39, U.S. Code, section 3005-author- izes the Postal Service, after a hearing, to stop the delivery of mail pertaining to a \"scheme or device for obtaining money or property through the mail by means of false representations.\" Section 3007 of the same law allows the Postal Service to obtain a temporary restraining order against an operator pending action under 3005. The advantage of using this statute is that proof of criminal intent, often difficult to establish, is not necessary. It is only necessary to show that advertising for a product or service contains a false claim. The Mail Fraud Statute, title 18, U.S. Code, section 1341, is the oldest and probably the most potent consumer protection law. Passed by Congress in 1872 to stop dishonest mail order promoters, it was later broadened to include any scheme furthered by using the mails. It provides penalties of up to 5 years in prison and/or a $1,000 fine for use of the mails in a fraudulent scheme. Another scheme aimed at the elderly involves nursing homes advertising by mail. Helped considerably by the fact that senior citizens are sometimes viewed as excess baggage to be stored somewhere, the operator typically provides a brochure that gives the nursing home the appearance, on the surface, of being well-equipped and professionally staffed. Actually, he uses only a small portion 250 of money paid by patients to maintain the home in semisqualor and pockets the bulk of the proceeds. Because many of the elderly live on fixed incomes, and are often confined to their homes because of illness or physical frailty, they are easy prey for the work- at-home promoters offering employment through magazine and newspaper ad- vertising. A fee is usually required for information about the nonexistent oppor- tunities. For example, a classified ad appeared in several newspapers offering women an opportunity to: \"Earn up to $1.68 an hour sewing baby shoes in your own home.\" It drew more than 200,000 inquiries from victims who paid a small registration fee and submitted a pair of wool-felt shoes to demonstrate their skill. After taking the fee and the shoes, the promoter found that virtually all of the job prospects failed to meet his high standards. Because many couples save for the day when they can buy a retirement home, usually in some warm climate, fraudulent land promoters find it extremely attrac- tive to entice the elderly with ads promising \"worry-free living in your twilight years.\" Prices are low enough that the victims buy a lot sight unseen. But what they get, even for payments of $10 or $20 a month, is expensive for land in the middle of a desert or in swampland. Postal inspectors recently arrested a New England resident selling senior citizens land he did not own and had no legal right to represent for sale. Converting their life-savings to his own use, he left many of his victims with no money, little hope and little time to recover. Con- victed of mail fraud, he is now serving a long prison sentence. Because those who live in private homes find it increasingly difficult to do even the most minor repairs as they get older, the dishonest home improvement contractor mails them a brochure offering a \"free\" home inspection and a gift if they will allow a visit from a \"building consultant.\" Typically, massive improve- ments are recommended even though everything may be in perfect working condition. Too often the elderly victims sign complex contracts that drain their savings or put them deeply in debt because they are fearful of being without essential utilities such as heat or water-and because they are often with no one to turn to for advice. Widows who have never handled the financial affairs of a family are also prime targets. When a woman's husband dies she often receives an insurance settlement. The predator who methodically watches newspaper obituaries moves in and convinces her he can take her savings and increase them many times over. Even if her needs are taken care of by the insurance settlement, she finds it difficult to brush off a letter that offers to make her wealthy enough to provide permanent security for her grandchildren and other loved ones. Debt consolidation is another scheme aimed repeatedly at the elderly. Offers to take care of rent, insurance, utilities and other bills are often hard to resist when the prospective victim is told he can simply mail a single check. Sometimes the results include imminent threat of mortgage foreclosure because the con- solidator took all of the initial payments as his basic fee and nothing was left to pay the victims' outstanding bills. Unfortunately, even the elderly occasionally take advantage of the < Iderly. A few years ago, postal inspectors arrested a 72-year-old man who scanned \"lonely hearts\" magazines for women interested in companionship or marriage to an older man. His persuasive letters brought him more than $60,000 from 37 women living all over the United States on his promise that he would visit them if they provided money for his transportation and expenses. Until he was caught, his standard reply to his victim, once they sent money, was that he was suddenly unable to travel because of illness. Although senior citizens cannot be considered prime targets, they are among those who lost $327 million in the last 3 years to commodity speculation carried on through the mail. Not long after his release on parole from Federal prison for a mail fraud conviction, an operator in Los Angeles set up a phony mining com- pany, acquired another company engaged in the fraudulent sale of silver, and opened up a \"boilerroom operation\" where telephone salesmen made unsolicited calls. In 10 short weeks he had sold more than $1 million in contracts for future delivery of nonexistent gold. Convicted of mail fraud a second time, he is now back in Federal prison. Most of his victims, by the way, could have avoided their losses if they had checked with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or a State securities agency, to determine if the commodities were registered. Again this year, I would like to urge any senior citizens who feel they have become victims of mail fraud or false representations to make their complaints known to a responsible employee at a postal installation near them. Their inquiries, 251 I can assure you, will receive both prompt and conscientious attention. And if they are considering the purchase of a product or service by mail, I hope they will investigate an offer before they invest in it. Sincerely, BENJAMIN F. BAILAR. ITEM 21. RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD JANUARY 12, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: With reference to your letter of December 14, 1977, I am pleased to enclose a statement summarizing major activities of the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board on aging during 1977. It is anticipated that pay- ments under the Railroad Retirement and Railroad Unemployment Insurance Acts will be somewhat higher during 1978 than in 1977. We look forward to your committee's 1977 report on developments in aging. Sincerely yours,R. F. BUTLER, Secretary. For the Board. [Enclosure.] The U.S. Railroad Retirement Board is the Federal agency that administers a comprehensive social insurance and staff retirement system for railroad workers and their families, separate from but coordinated in several ways with social security. Programs of the system include the following: (1) old age, survivor and disability benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act; and (2) unemploy- ment and sickness insurance benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. In addition, certain administrative services under the Federal health in- surance (medicare) program are performed with respect to aged and disabled railroad workers and eligible members of their familites. BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES During fiscal year 1977, benefit payments under the railroad retirement and railroad unemployment ii s irance programs totaled $3,967 million, an increase of $207 million from the same period 1 year earlier. Retirement and survivor benefit payments amounted to $3,787 million, an increase of $256 million over the same period 1 year earlier. Unemployment and sickness benefit payments during the benefit year ending June 30, 1977, totaled $189 million, which was $28.7 million less than in the preceding benefit year. The number of beneficiaries on the retirement-survivor rolls on September 30, 1977, totaled 1,025,000. The vast majority (81 percent) were aged 65 and older. At the end of the fiscal year, 464,000 retired employees were being paid a regular annuity averaging $380, about $26 higher than a year earlier. In addition, 169,000 of these employees were being paid a supplemental annuity averaging $57. Almost 231,000 spouses of retired employees were receiving an average annuity of $178. Of the 337,000 survivors on the rolls as of September 30, 1977, 293,000 were aged widows receiving an average annuity of $267. Some 869,000 individuals who were receiving or were eligible to receive monthly benefits under the Rail- road Retirement Act were covered by hospital insurance under the medicare program at the end of fiscal year 1977. Of these, 849,000 (98 percent) were also enrolled for supplemental medical insurance. Unemployment and sickness benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act were paid to 155,000 railroad employees during the benefit year ending June 30, 1977. However, only about $1.1 million (less than 1 percent) of the benefits went to individuals aged 65 and older. ITEM 22. VETERANS ADMINISTRATION JANUARY 24, 1978. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: In response to your request of December 14, 1977, I am pleased to forward the enclosed report on the Veterans Administration activ- ities relating to developments in the care of older veterans for the year 1977. Our activities in this regard are extensive and increasing. At the present time, veterans comprise 40 percent of all American males over the age of 20 years. Because of the large number of veterans of World War II and the Korean con- 24-084 0 -78 -17 252 flict, by 1990 more than half of the U.S. males over the age of 65 years will be veterans, and by 1995 veterans will exceed 60 percent of the total. Plans andprograms have been developed over a considerable period of time, and are beingemphasized to meet these needs as they become increasingly pressing during theremainder of the century. I hope the enclosed information will be helpful to the committee. Please let us know if we can be of further assistance. Sincerely, MAX CLELAND, Administrator. [Enclosure.] VA ACTIVITIES AFFECTING OLDER VETERANS IN 1977 DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY 1. INTRODUCTION The Veterans' Administration has long been aware of the problems a hich will arise as the result of the aging of large numbers of World War II and Kcrean War veterans. A number of plans and programs have been developed in response to this perceived need. On October 21, 1976, the Veterans Omnibus Health Care Act became law as Public Law 94-581. Section 117(a) of that law directed the chief medical director of the Veterans' Administration to report the short- and long-range plans of the administration in reference to the increasing average age of the eligible veteran population. It was suggested that the report include specific plans for: (1) Adjusting the number of Veterans' Administration hospital, nursing home, intermediate and personal care, and domiciliary beds; (2) Adjusting the program for contracting for such nursing home care (including intermediate and personal care) in community facilities; (3) Expanding alternatives to institutional care, to include provision of hcme health (including homemaker and special nutrition) services; (4) Emphasizing treatment programs particularly suited to meet the health care needs of an aging population; (5) Emphasizing education and training of health care personnel specializing in the treatment of elderly persons and diseases, and infirmities charactcristic of an aging population; (6) Emphasizing biomedical and health services research designed to ameliorate geriatric care problems; and, (7) Meeting the special architectural, transportation, and environmental needs of an aging population. In response to this congressional mandate, the Veterans' Administration during the past year developed a comprehensive report entitled \"The Aging Veteran: Present and Future Needs.\" Submitted to the appropriate Committees on Veterans Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives in January 1978, the report may serve as a basic resource document for planning for aging veterans foi the next two decades. 2. EXTENDED CARE The aging veteran population has brought to attention the fact, that, in addition to impatient and outpatient health services, an intermediate link is necessary in the form of convalescent hospitals, nursing homes, and other types of long-term placement, now known as extended care. The office of the assistant chief medical director for extended care provides the necessary professional expertise and leadership essential for the following long- term care programs: VA domicillary care; State home care (nursing home, domicil- iary, and hospital); VA nursing home care; hospital based home care; community nursing home care; personal care homes; and geriatric research, education and clinical centers. Large numbers of aged veterans requiring long-term care will place ever increasing demands on these programs. Therefore, it is essential that the VA continue to assess these and other approaches to long-term care programs to assure that its health care system is available and responsive to those veterans in need of such care. While plans to meet the short- and long-range needs of aging veterans were being developed for the report referred to above, the office of extended care made significant advances in several program areas during the past year. VA nursing home care.-This program is designed for veterans who are not actually ill or in need of hospital care, but who require skilled nursing care and related medical services. These services are prescribed by, or performed under, the general direction of persons duly licensed to provide such care. Typically, a veteran admitted to VA nursing home care is chronically ill, has a permanent or residual disability, is expected to require a long period of nursing supervision, observation and care, and requires special efforts of a long-term rehabilitative nature. All the services required for the comprehensive care of a veteran in the nursing care unit are available through the resources of the hospital. Nursing home care beds were increased during the course of the year with the opening of new nursing home care units at Manchester, New Hampshire, and Jackson, Miss. Hospital based home care.-This program allows for an early discharge of veterans with chronic illness to their own homes and reduces readmissions to the hospital. The family provides the necessary personal care under coordinated super- vision of a hospital based multidisciplinary treatment team. The team pro.vdes the medical, nursing, social, rehabilitation and dietetic regimens as well as the training of family members and the patient. Thirty VA hospitals are providing hospital based home care services. By providing increased days of care in the home, acute care beds in hospitals are freed up. An educational training experience was provided selected team members in program evaluation and patient care audits through the St. Louis Regional Medical Education Center (RMEC). This training experience was designed to assist HBHC teams to develop a quality assurance program. Ongoing training conferences are being planned for antici- pated program expansion. Community nursing home care.-This program is designed for veterans who are not acutely ill and not in need of hospital care, but who require nursing home care and related health care services. The primary purpose of this program is to aid the veteran and his family in making the transition from a hospital to the community by providing time to marshal resources for the veteran's continuing care. Participating facilities are assessed by VA personnel prior to approval and no less than every 2 years thereafter. Followup visits are provided to the veteran in the nursing home by the hospital social worker, nurse and other members of the treatment team. Under this program, nonservice-connected veterans may be placed in community facilities at VA expense for a period not to exceed 6 months. Veterans requiring nursing home care for a service-connected condition may be placed at VA expense indefinitely. In October 1976, Public Law 94-581 authorized the VA to contract with intermediate care facilities. Subsequent to the enactment of the law, the VA has est blished standards, policies and procedures for the use of such facilities. As of July 31, 1977, 672 ICF's were under contract, with 1,644 veterans in placement at this level of care. It is anticipated that the number of veterans placed in ICF's will grow considerably during the forthcoming year. During the past year, major effort has been placed on refining the process by which the VA assesses a nursing home prior to contract, with emphasis on the quality of life in the home. Concomitant with this effort, the VA has taken steps to work more closely with, and to avoid duplicating the efforts of, other State and Federal agencies in the assessment of nursing homes. Three regional educational conferences for VA nursing home teams from 50 health care facilities were held during the year to develop the assessment process and to further develop relationships with other assessment agencies. Representatives of HEW regional offices and State survey agencies supplemented VACO staff as members of the faculty at these conferences. Personal care homes.-This program provides personal care and supervision in a homelike setting in the community for veterans who have no homes or whose home does not provide the care they need. The veteran pays for his care, usually out of the combination of VA pension, supplemental security income, and/or social security disability payments. All veterans with sufficient funds may utilize this service. Homes vary in size from those accommodating one veteran in a family setting to homes accommodating 20 or more veterans. Homes are periodically inspected by an interdisciplinary team from the nearest VA hospital. Regular followup visits to the homes are made by members of the VA hospital staff. The social worker is the most frequent visitor, working with relationships between sponsor and veteran, veteran and family, and veteran and the community. During fiscal year 1977 increased activity was generated in training hospital teams- nurses, dietitians, and social workers-to more effectively discharge their responsi- bility in selecting patients, selecting homes and sponsors, and providing followup supervision. 254 Additional conferences are scheduled in fiscal year 1978 with emphasis on further expansion of this program for use by patients in general medical and surgical hospitals. To enhance program credibility, cooperation with local and State authorities in setting standards, extending community resources to provide meaningful activities, and inspecting homes on followup visits to insure that quality care is being provided. VA domiciliary care.-The VA domiciliary prcgram is designed to provide neces- sary medical treatment and comprehensive professional care for eligible ambula- tory veterans in a residential type setting. The program is directed toward those veterans who are disabled by age, disease, or injury and are in need of care, but do not require hospitalization or the skilled nursing services of a nursing home. To be entitled to domiciliary care, the veterans' disability must be chronic in nature. The veteran must also be incapacitated from earning a living and have no adequate means of support. During fiscal year 1977, further progress was made toward the construction of 200-bed units to replace beds in facilities which do not meet life safety code requirements and which are not suitable for upgrading because of structural problems and prohibitive cost. The 200-bed units introduce a new concept of a structure that has the feature of convertibility from domiciliary to nursing home care. This will make it possible for future patient-members to obtain nursing home care in the same facility as their health care status requires (skilled nursing care.) The design of this new facility emphasizes a homelike residential environment with desirable privacy and features that will contribute towards increased inter- action and socialization between patient-members. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held for the first of the 200-bed facilities at VA Center Wood, Wisconsin, on October 21, 1977. State home program.-The VA makes grants for the construction of new State home domiciliary and nursing home buildings; the expansion, remodeling or alteration of existing buildings for the provision of domiciliary, nursing home or hospital care in State homes; and the provision of equipment for any such build- ings. Under provisions of the State Veterans' Hcme Assistance Improvement Act of 1977, the VA's annual authorization for construction and modernization of State Veterans' Home facilities was increased from $10 to $15 million for fisc I years 1978 and 1979. The VA participates up to 65 percent in the cost of constru - tion and remodeling of State home facilities. Construction money for new domiciliaries in State homes was provided for t e first time under the new law. Previously, VA grants were limited to remodeling, alteration, or modification projects at State owned domiciliaries. Since 1964, the VA has made grants totaling $54 million to 22 States for nursing home con- struction, expansion, and remodeling, resulting in 4,733 new nursing home beds with improved patient priva-y and better fire protection for patients. Also, VA has made grants totaling $9.6 million to 16 States for 68 projects to remodel existing State domiciliary and hospital care facilities. The State home program has long been recognized as a high quality, cost-efficient alternative to providing extended care in VA facilities. The State Veterans' Home program has grown from the original 11 homes in 11 States in 1888, to 40 hon es and 2 annexes ia 30 States and the District of Columbia. Geriatric research, education, and clinical centers.-During fiscal year 1977 the Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center (GRECC) program continued to promote innovative and comprehensive approaches to the care of elderly veteran patients. These centers include clinicians, researchers, and edu- cators associated in cohesive programs concerned with a variety of medical prob- lems of aging. The specialists in the eight GRECC programs are now providing leadership in the VA hospitals and local communities for originating comprehen- sive health care approaches and in developing new knowledge and applications for quality geriatric care. Some specific contibutions of these centers to the subject of aging are: 1. Operation of geriatric evaluation units. 2. Implementation of intermediate care rehabilitation units and ambulatory geriatric clinics to furnish continuing treatment and health maintenance. 3. Development of geriatric screening systems which can be amplified so that delays in diagnostic procedures are minimized. 4. The management of a cooperative program for testing of prosthetic devices, eating utensils, and other kinds of devices used by the elderly. 5. Implementation of several types of education programs relative to geriatric services, such as: (a) House officer training in geriatric medicine and gero-psychiatry; education of elderly patients and their families in management of chronic diseases. (b) Conducting symposia or workshops on various aspects of gerontology and geriatric problems for health care specialists in the community as well as the VA. (c) Provision of geriatric nutrition training. 6. Support of a number of interdisciplinary research projects in the service of aged, including studies in gero-dentistry, metabolism in aging, cardiovascular disease, memory, psycho-social and psychological medicine problems in the elderly, biochemical and pharmacological studies. GRECC's now exist at Little Rock, Ark.; St. Louis, Mo.; Sepulveda, Calif.; Los Angeles Bedford/ Boston OPC, Mass.; American Lake/Seattle, Wash. The Minneapolis center, which promises a well-integrated program of senile dementia research, was started late in fiscal year 1977. The Veterans Administration continued to be involved during the past year in interagency coordinative efforts in its attempt to ensure comprehensive geriatric care. The growing numbers of older veterans requiring health care, specialized extended care services, supportive living environments, and nutritional supple- ients are indicative, of course, of similar demands being made by a growing elderly population in general. Agencies at the Federal, State, and local levels and within the private sector are working to develop comparable geriatric care pro- grams. To minimize duplication of effort and to promote efficient use of resources, the VA has been actively participating in coordinative efforts on behalf of the elderly citizen. The Veterans Administration is cooperating with the experimental technology incentives program (ETIP) of the National Bureau of Standards to test tech- nologically innovative devices appropriate to an elderly population. The office of extended care has worked closely with the Administration on Aging (AoA) to coordinate Federal programs on behalf of the aged. For instance, the office of extended care and the Department of Veterans Benefits have been involved in the implementation of a working agreement between the VA, 13 other Federal agencies, and the Administration on Aging to improve information and referral services to the older American. The VA took the initiative in match- ing local area agency on aging (AAA) offices with their nearest VA facilities across the Nation. The office of extended care further refined and implemented the information and referral program during the past year with the establishment of an informa- tion and referral liaison representative in each VA hospital. Specific duties and responsibilities were transmitted to the representatives by VA circular which would further the implementation of the action steps agreed to by the VA in the working agreement with the Administration on Aging. Two information and referral workshops were held during the year which provided training for VA- hospital and veterans assistance service representatives in Administration on Aging regions 1, 2, and 3. As an added benefit to the information and referral program, the liaison representatives are providing alternatives to hospitalization for veteran patients by integrating veterans into non-VA community settings such as senior citizens centers, and other related health and social programs. The Veterans Administration and the Administration on Aging are also jointly sponsoring nutritional programs for older veterans. Further significant efforts in the VA to meet the needs of a growing agir g veterans population in a comprehensive manner are described in the following sections. 3. MEDICAL SERVICE During 1977 the Veterans Administration central office medical service and the medical services in Veterans Administration hospitals continued their intense efforts to improve the overall medical care of all veterans. These efforts have been especially focused on the aging veterans since this group represents an increasingly larger proportion of our patient population and presents us with some of our most professionally challenging diagnostic and therapeutic situations. Our programs in medical and coronary intensive care, respiratory care diagnosis and treatment, dialysis, hypertension, infectious diseases, and ambulatory care continued to make significant progress during the year and will continue to be 24-084 0 -78 -18 256 given primary attention and high priority during 1978. In addition, 1977 saw the establishment of the first Veterans Administration centers designed to handle cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and rheumatology-immunology problems. Medical service played a vital role in the planning and selection of the sites for these centers and will continue its efforts to promote the successful development of these unique Veterans Administration health care activities. Their impact on improving the overall quality of medical care of the aging will be of considerable magnitude. Probably the most important medical service activity during this past year was its participation in the Veterans Administration's Study of extended hospital care sections (EHC) which were formerly known as intermediate care sections. This study is under the aegis of the Veterans Administration central office pro- fessional services, but medical service has played a primary role in its implementa- tion. The study is designed to determine the types of patients being treated in the extended hospital care sections of VA hospitals, the quality and appropriateness of care received there, the types of professional programs that should be provided,and the staff, space and equipment resources required to carry out these programs. Since most of the extended hospital care patients are elderly, and since a study of this scope has not been completed within the Veterans Administration previously the potential implications are significant. It is anticipated that the study will be completed and comprehensive recommendations for the development of optimal extended hospital care programs will be forwarded to the chief medical director in early 1978. 4. MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES SERVICE The Mental Health and Behavioral Sciences Service (MH&BSS) further expanded its services to the elderly patients in our health care facilities. Direct psychiatric and psychological consultative, treatment and vocational counseling services are pro- ided to most of our programs which treat the aged veteran. Mental health and behavioral sciences service has prepared a special study report on \"The Impact of Aging on Mental Health Program Requirements 1980- 1990.\" This report will allow for the orderly shifting of resources and expansion of services predicted by our increasing number of patients who manifest mental symptoms associated with advanced years. Specific training conferences will be held this year regarding the appropriate use of psychiatric drugs and the treatment for substance abuse which will stress the particular problems of the elderly veterans. Some of our hospitals have, or are in the process of developing, special psychogeriatrics wards where specific treatment approaches and studies can be developed to enhance an effectiveness regarding these types of patients. These are in addition to the ongoing efforts in the VA geriatric research, education, and clinical centers which have their own mental health involvements. Special efforts have been made by the mental health and behaviorial sciences service to assist in the evaluation of the large numbers of psychiatric patients who currently are being treated in extended care medical wards in order to facilitate their more appropriate placement in regard to their mental health requirements. The internal environment of many of our older psychiatric hospitals, which have a significant number of aging veterans, have been renovated emphasizing the development of a warm, homelike environment which provides an assurance of privacy and the enhancement of human dignity. The provision of pets and encouragement of children to visit are features which are encouraged by mental health staff and add to the quality of life for the elderly veteran. A unique con- tribution has been the development of a quality of life study which developed a rationale and methodology to evaluate aspects of our treatment settings over and above that concerned with the physical care provided. 5. SOCIAL WORK SERVICE Services to the aging veteran and his family continue to receive high priority and social work programming. Social workers assigned to hospitals or operating out of satellite or clinic offices, frequently in areas removed from the urban setting, provide outreach services to veterans and families in their own homes, as well as veterans in nursing homes, personal care homes, and other special placement settings. Greater emphasis is being placed on a need to connect veterans with community resources capable of enhancing their quality of life and sustaining gains achieved during periods of acute and long-term hospital care. Over 4,000 257 veterans were placed directly in community settings without a period of Veterans Administration hospital care which reduces unnecessary hospitalization and results in improved use of professional manpower. During fiscal year 1977 over 80,000 veterans received placement and followup services in Veterans Adminis- tration approved community facilities. Emphasis continues to be placed on the development of responsive community service delivery models which will support the veterans' right to receive comprehensive health care in surroundings that will enhance social functioning. Multidisciplinary workshops were held on personal care home programing for general medical and surgical patients and on a development of community nursing hom assessment models. The latter underscores the need to develop effective working relationship with other agencies both at the State and Federal levels in the interest of improved services to veterans and the prevention of unecessary duplication in the assessment of community nursing homes. Additional multi- disciplinary workshops will be held under the auspices of the office of extended care during fiscal year 1978. A program guide is being developed for the personal care home program and will be issued by the office of extended care during 1978. The working agreement between the Veterans Administration and the Ad- mir istration on Aging calls for the appointment of a Veterans Administration repi esentative from every VA facility to serve as liaison to the approximately 700 Administration on Aging information and referral service offices in all States and territories. The vast majority of persons selected by the hospital directors to assume this function have been social workers who have a long history of contact with community services and resources necessary to assist the older veteran in leaving the hospital and in maintaining optimal physical and mental health while residing in the community. A series of conferences is being conducted in each of the 10 HEW regional offices to orient and train Veterans Administration/Adminis- tration on Aging representatives. Content, in information and referral services programs, on lifestyle patterns of older persons and on psycho-social needs and problems of the elderly is being drawn from a wide range of social workers in public and private agencies as well as from the educational community. Cf great concern to social work has been the patient who cannot return to the community because of severe physical or mental disabilities and social work has been an active participant in the study of the extended hospital care patient which was initiated by professional services during this fiscal year. One especially signif- icant patient group is the terminally ill patient, and consideration is now being given to both inpatient and outpatient programs which address thl needs of this patient group as well as the program of patient/family and staff education in death, dying and bereavement. 6. REHABILITATION MEDICINE With the increase in the Veterans Administration's aging popu'ation, rchabilita- tion medicine service has been especially concerned with providing new programs which will focus on the needs presented by these veterans. A vital step of rehabilita- tioTn is the humanistic approach which projects a sense of caring, a feeling of dig ity and self-worth, and a desire to \"continue\"-not \"give up.\" decause rehabilitation medicine service provides treatment modalities which are activity oriented, many programs are initiated which motivate the aging veteran into a productive and meaningful use of time. In addition to the tradi- tional treatment services provided by psychiatry, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and corrective therapies, new programs have been developed in com- pensated work therapy by establishing special contracts with industry in com- munities to provide work experience for elderly patients that is not only meaningful but also pays wages commensurate with the community. Under the incentive therapy programs, patients are provided jobs within the hospital for nominal remuneration. Sensory integrative dysfunctioning programs (that is, a disruption of informa- tion gathering and processing functions of the central nervous system which is reflected in motor behavior and learning patterns) have been developed to help patients regain use of the sensory mechanisms or to compensate for their loss. Two programs at the Bedford Veterans Administration Hospital which have involved the very elderly are an aqua-therapy program to stimulate muscle activity and a parachute program for socialization, body movement, and muscle stimulation. The use of volunteers has provided the geriatric patient a more meaningful activity of participation in recreation therapy. It is characteristic of the geriatric 258 patient to feel isolated--even in a group; thus, 1-to-1 contacts provide a sense of orientation, belonging, and involvement. Organizations like the Bowlers Victory League (BVL), American Legion, No Greater Love, United Service Organization (USO), in addition to local community clubs have provided activities which involve both the community and Veterans Administration patients. Language and communication are recognized as essential human attributes. They are adversely affected, however, by the communicative disorders which are prevalent among the elderly as a consequence of hearing impairment, stroke, and related conditions. To restore communicative functioning to the maximum extent possible, the Veterans Administration has established audiology and speech pathology services at 88 health care facilities. A new unit was activated at the Phoenix VA Hospital in fiscal year 1977 while another is planned for the Loma Linda VA Hospital in the current fiscal year. Rehabilitation medicine service continues to be involved in programs re ated to the geriatric patient, i.e., intermediate care study, physical fitness programs, rheumatology-immunology centers and cardio-pulmonary centers. In addition, professional staff are encouraged to participate and to attend seminars and work- shops in order to develop new techniques and learning experiences in working with the aged. 7. NURSING SERVICE Nursing service recognizes the increasing need for care in the aged, ill veteran population, and believes that nurses have a significant role to fill in meeting these needs. To improve the quality of care available, nursing service has launched a triad of activities designed toward this end. Working collaboratively with the regional medical education centers (RMEC's), nursing service has sponsored special educational conferences and workshops on geriatric nursing problems and needs of the aged individual. At least two additional geriatric workshops are planned for the first quarter of 1978. Nursing service has worked cooperatively with university schools of nursing to bring increased emphasis on geriatric and gerontologic nursing education. As a direct outcome of this, three universities (Duke, Adelphi, and Utah) now offer graduate degrees in gerontologic nursing. Other graduate programs are giving increasing curricular attention to geriatric nursing. Innovation in geriatric care organization and delivery is underway at selected sites throughout the system. Nurses are serving as primary care providers for aged veterans who have chronic care needs in hospital, extended hospital, and nursing home settings. Increased emphasis is being placed on providing rehabili- tative nursing services to aged, ill veterans via the hospital based home care programs throughout the system. Through this delivery system, nursing service believes it feasible to maintain many aged veterans in the home, support failing faculties, and improve the quality of life for these individuals. The Veterans Administration gerontologic care standards and educational guidelines will be disseminated to the field early in 1978. It is anticipated that every field facility will use these standards and guidelines to improve the quality of nursing care available to the aged veteran patient. Veterans Administration nursing service is working in collaboration with Public Health Service in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in the development and refinement of the patient assessment care evaluation (PACE) for patients in community nursing homes. In addition, the nurse staff member responsible for long-term care nursing programs is involved in close collaboration with the office of extended care in their program areas of domicil- iaries, community nursing homes, VA nursing home care units, and hospital based home care. The need for preventive nursing services for aged veterans is increasing. The Veterans Administration nursing service is eager to begin demonstration projects in preventive and maintenance care when Authorization and resources become available. 8. DIETETIC SERVICE The majority of aged veteran beneficiaries have one or more of the diseases which appear to be related to malnutrition, either by over or under consumption of certain nutrients. These are heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, arteriosclerosis and cirrhosis of the liver. Therefore, nutritional care is an important component of the total treatment program for this gr6up. 259 With greater emphasis on quality of care and quality of life, the total dietary needs for each veteran are being considered. An in-depth nutritional assessment is made and coordinated with the health team in implementing and evaluating nutritional care plans. Other factors which affect nutritional status are also considered, such as poor chewing and swallowing, poor hearing and communica- tion, inability for self-feeding, limited nutritional knowledge, income, cooking facilities and inability to shop for the proper food contribute to the problem. Patient health education is an important part of the aged veteran's treatment. Both normal nutrition and dietary modification, if needed, are emphasized in individual instructions or small group classes. Other subjects included are food preparation, marketing, budgeting, sanitation, and social skills in group living. The dietitian participates with the health team in planning for the veterans return to the community and their followup care. Training is provided the care- giver in meeting the individual's nutritional needs. An assessment is then made of the person's ability to carry out the care for the veteran. The need for research studies to identify the relationship of nutrients with disease is receiving more attention since the publication of \"Dietary Goals for the United States.\" The geriatric research, education, and clinical centers (GRECC's) throughout the country can assist in studying this problem. 9. VOLUNTARY SERVICE The Veterans Administration voluntary service (VAVS) program continued its commitment to provide volunteer activities for and by older Americans during the fiscal year, at the same time laying the groundwork for increased emphasis in fiscal year 1978. Symbolic of this commitment was the inclusion of a major segment on extended care in the agenda planned during 1977 for the October annual meeting of the VAVS national advisory committee. This committee is representative of 45 national veterans, patriotic and service organizations which supply volunteers to the Veterans Administration health care system. Its members disseminate information received at the annual meeting to all concerned officials in their organizations. The chief medical director's concern regarding leisure time needs of long term patients led to the initiation of a 5-month pilot study designated patient services project. The project is scheduled to produce recommendations from the nine test facilities at the end of January 1978. It involves possible restructuring, and relating the voluntary service and recreation sections of rehabilitation medicine service, and involving other appropriate services in order to provide more effec- tively for the human needs of long-term patients during evenings, weekends and holidays. In other developments related to substantial numbers of aging veterans and their families, voluntary service offered its expertise and support to adminis- trators of volunteer programs in State veterans homes, assisted the American Legion in its \"operation post home\" program designed to provide community activity centers for older veterans in American Legion Post homes, and en- couraged and assisted with the formation of the united voluntary services \"haven\" leisure time centers at Veterans Administration hospitals. At the University of Wisconsin, six volunteers from the Madison VA Hospital were appointed to the coupcil of elders, an advisory board for a project dealing with career development in the field of providers of care for the elderly veteran patient. At an increasing number of Veterans Administration hospitals the ex- perience and skills of the older volunteer are being applied effectively to consumer advocate roles assigned by staff responsible for patient relations activities. Assignments of volunteeers to provide personal and recreational services to Veterans Administration patients in community nursing homes continued to multiply. At the end of the year the north Chicago VA Hospital began a study to determine the feasibility of assigning a volunteer to assist the social work service staff in evaluation of community caie homes. The experience, good judgment, and tact of the older volunteers was applied to assignments as hosts and hostesses in the outpatient and admissions areas, as well as in surgical waiting rooms where their role is to inform and reassure the families of patients. Escort service, which provides volunteers to accompany patients between wards, treatment recreation, and chapel areas, remained one of the most useful and popular assignments for the older volunteers. The VA Hospital at Miles City Montana, found in escort service its outstanding volunteer for 1977, Mrs. Mary Cooley, age 88. 260 The continuing contact between voluntary service and the American associa-tion of retired persons resulted, late in the year, in the selection of VAVS as oneof a very limited number of agencies in which AARP will actively promote mem-ber involvement. 10. DENTISTRY The comprehensive dental program for long-term care patients has been atreatment modality in the Veterans Administration since its inception. Withinthis program, many geriatric patients (defined as 65 years of age or over) wereand are being treated. Much knowledge and expertise has been accumulated by individual dentistsand other professionals of various medically related disciplines. The need to sharethis knowledge and expertise becomes more paramount with the potential increaseof geriatric patients from the World War II veteran population which comprises45 percent of our total veteran population. To further the team approach to dental care of the geriatric patient, the VeteransAdministration and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine cosponsored a sym-posium on geriatric patient care in Boston on September 8-9, 1977. Three hundredand fifty dentists, including 90 from the Veterans Administration, participated.Many disciplines participated in the symposium which produced a preliminarygeriatric patient profile. This patient profile could best be described as suggestinga physiologically and/or psychologically compromised individual. This leads tothe belief that the technical aspects of the dental treatment need not be altered,but the capability of the Veterans Administration's system to provide dentalcare to these patients must be assured. Therefore, courses at both the dentaltraining center and regional medical education centers (RMEC's) in 1978 ongeriatric dentistry appear to be needed. The faculty participation will be multi-disciplinary in order to provide the participants with the necessary professionalinformation. To further emphasize geriatric dentistry it has been made the subject of oneof our proposals in the management by objective process. Research and educationwill be the primary objectives to develop fuller understanding of how the physio-logical and psychological compromises of many of the geriatric patients affectthem as human beings, and how we, as a profession, can utilize this informationto provide access for and provisions of dental care to all VA geriatric patients. 11. M7DICAL RESEARCH SERVICE The Veterans Administration has long recognized that it is faced with a rapidlyexpanding veteran population above the age of 60 and improving the care ofthe elderly patient is significantly related to direct and indirect benefits resultingfrom research in or related to the processes of aging and age-related diseases.Research investigations on the process and problems of aging are conductedby VA investigators at VA health care facilities across the Nation. Some ofthese investigators are members of VA geriatric research education, and clinicalcenters established within eight of these facilities. Examples of investigations and/or results of research in aging conducted byVA investigators are as follows: A study of aging changes of the human vascular system conducted at theBaltimore VA Hospital to reevaluate the mechanism of age-related calcification of the human aortic media. Observations have led to the conclusion that matrix vesicles derived from smooth muscle cell residual bodies are the primary site ofcalcification rather than elastic fibers in the medical wall of human aorta. At the Buffalo VA Hospital, ongoing experiments have continued to supportthe hypothesis that intermittent exposures of hyperoxygenation tend to increasecognitive efficiency among elderly subjects whose primary difficulty is cardi-ovascular in origin. Studies are continuing to assess variance in initial responseand in persistence effects among subjects. At the Columbia, S.C., VA Hospital a study of the sociological and physiologicalaspects of aging has attempted to relate the interpersonal functioning of elderlyveterans to possible learning and performance deficits which accompany aging.Data suggests that performance deficits may be related to changes in motiva-tional or arousal processes associated with aging. Accordingly, attempts havebeen made to assess these processes by making psychophysiological measurementspresumably indicative of arousal in younger and older patients during theirperformance on different kinds of behavioral tasks. A number of correlationshave been noted leading to the working hypothesis that differential adaptation to aging is characterized by increased compensatory arousal mechanisms, which are necessary for the elderly person's performance to approach that of his earlier years. At the Kansas City VA Hospital a study is investigating the effect of age on the magnitude of the acoustic reflex. The specific purpose of the study is to deter- mine whether the aging process has an effect on the amplitude and growth func- tion of the acoustic reflex. The study has confirmed previous research which suggested that the aging process affects the stapedius reflex are through reduced amplitude. The 60-70 age group demonstated a significantly lower reflex ampli- tude than the 20-30 and 40-50 age groups. At the Palo Alto VA Hospital a study is continuing on memory deficit on the aged. This is a study of cognitive deficits in the elderly and the neurophysiological correlates of such deficits. Subjects include healthy young adults, healthy old adults and old adults suffering from cognitive impairments. Each subject is given a battery of tests including the Weschler adult intelllgence scale, a physical exam, several pencil and paper memory tests, and event-related potential memory tests (ERP) that involve behavioral measures as well. The memory tests include measure of verbal learning, story memory and memory retrieval. The ERP tests include measures of the orienting response, selective attention and memory retrieval. Preliminary analyses have shown that on memory tests the old performed worse than the young. Further, there was more variability in performance among the old subjects than among the young subjects. Also, for the old immediate recall was less impaired than was retrieval from long-term memory. Data from ERP studies indicate that old people with cognitive deficits do not orient to changes in the environment as well as do the healthy old and the young. The pattern of results from an early component of the ERP indicates that the old and young are equally efficient at attending selectively. At the St. Louis VA Hospital studies of food intake as a function of age, calories and temperature suggest that there are age-related increases in the setpoint about which regulation of calorie intake and body weight occurs. The precision of this regulation, however, is unaffected by aging. Thus, age-related obesity in humans primarily may not be due to errors in day to day caloric intake but to increases in the \"target level\" at which weight is regulated. Such an increase in the setpoint may be due to age-related changes in the hypothalamus. This project is continuing. At the Salt Lake City VA Hospital a study is ongoing on contributions of blood vessel walls to atherosclerosis and aging. Studies of biochemical changes within the vessel wall of the aorta have shown a breakdown of elastin that appears to increase linerarly with age. There appears to be a marked difference in levels of aorta walls from males and females. A study conducted at Temple, Tex. has been designed to compare the effects of two different kinds of group treatment and no treatment on measures of activity and life satisfaction of domiciled geriatric patients. Patients are being randomly assigned to one of three different groups. One is to receive 4 weeks of remotivation therapy followed by 4 weeks of group therapy, a second is to receive 8 weeks of group therapy, and a third is to receive only testing and measurement of behavior. Psychometric measures will look at ward adjustment, psychological well being, life satisfaction, amount of depression and progress in treatment. Behavioral measures will gauge activity and social interaction. At the VA Boston Outpatient Clinic a longitudinal and cross-sectional study of oral health in the healthy male is being conducted. Currently, the 1,200 persons which comprise this cohort, selected from its parent normative aging study, have all been reexamined. Thus, a second cycle report of their interim health history, orofacial status, saliva composition and masticatory performance tests has been obtained. The time span between cycles is three (3) years. The accuracy of the data collected during the first cycle has been verified and encoded into magnetic tape. Information obtained from cycle two is being verified and should be available shortly. Examination of the data obtained from cycle one continues and is expected to result in the publication of numerous manuscripts dealing with various aspects of the investigation. The topics of manuscripts accepted, submitted or in the final stages of prepara- tion include the following: (1) parotid fluid composition in a study of healthy males; (2) relationship of personality traits with parotid saliva flow rate and com- position in healthy men; (3) tobacco smoking and periodontal disease; (4) effect of smoking and age on the keratinization of the palatal mucosa: a cytologic study; 262 (5) oro-facial status of healthy aging males I. Relationship of age and socioeco- nomic status to periodontal disease; (6) oro-facial status of healthy aging males II. Relationship between age, socioeconomic status and caries frequency; (7) the effects of age and prosthetic appliances on the masticatory performance and food selection in adult males. At the VA Boston outpatient clinic data from five studies of decisionmaking, learning and memory processes have been completed as part of the project, \"mental performance and aging.\" Three of these are concerned with the process of mem- orization and the accessibility in memory of unfamiliar verbal information, such as lists of paired associates or relationships among a series of logically connected propositions. The results of the studies are consistent with the generalization that healthy older adults are much less likely to use optional learning strategies for memorizing such information than younger ones. The age difference is reflected both in measures of ease of learning and also in substantial age-related differences in the time required to recall the information once it has been memofized. The results demonstrate clearly that age-differences in the accessibility of newly learned information in memory as indexed by response latency cannot be predicted simply by the ability to accurately recite a list of paired associates or list of related concepts. The results also suggest that slowness in the speed of some cognitive processes can adversely affect the performance of elderly adults in memorization tasks. Results of other studies have established that the time taken to decide if a word had been presented recently (3 seconds-4 minutes) increases with the number of other words presented in the same group. Older subjects are slower than younger ones in making their decision. Confidence in recognition of words that occur fre- quently in the English language is lower than that for infrequently occurring words. The effect is the same across age. The data illustrate that the time required to make a decision in this recognition memory task, not the quality of the process is what varies across age. Together the results of these studies indicate that two fruitful lines of future research will be: (a) to determine ways of minimizing age related differences in memorization of verbal material, and (b) to determine precisely how slowness in cognitive process affects the quality of cognitive functioning in the elderly. 12. EDUCATION The awareness of the increasing age of the veteran population, its implications for the health care system of the VA Department of Medicine and Surgery, and the legisaltive mandate of the Veterans Administration (Veterans Omnibus Health Care Act of 1976, Public Law 94-581) to take an active leadership role in develop- ing training programs in geriatric/gerontology are factors in the emphasis being accorded this effort by the office of academic affairs. In cooperation with the offices of extended care and professional services, the thrust of the effort is generally directed toward health care providers and emanates from various Veterans Admin- istration resource points, i.e., Veterans Administration central office (VACO); regional medical education centers (RMEC's); geriatric research, education, and clinical centers (GRECC's); and individual health care facilities. On a continuing basis, these facilities offer training programs addressing varied concerns in pro- fessional and paraprofessional care of the elderly. Annual national seminars on aging were initiated 2 years ago for Veterans Administration clinicians. Planning is underway to enlarge the scope of these seminars. The Manpower Grants Service Program, Veterans Administration Medical School Assistance and Health Manpower Training Act of 1972, encompasses several grants to academic institutions in support of training in different aspects of geriatrics. These include long-term nursing care of the aging adult, nurse prac- titioners in geriatric settings, and interdisciplinary training for various types of geriatric services. The most promising educational program focusing on the development of geriatric-minded health professionals is the newly established fellowship training opportunity for board eligible or certified physicians from internal medicine, family practice, and psychiatry. It consists of a 2-year postgraduate curriculum for clinical excellence in geriatrics/gerontology for inpatient, ambulatory, and long- term care. Six sites for the geriatric fellowship program have been selected to begin training in July 1978: VA Hospitals at Bedford, Mass.; Lexington, Ky.; Little Rock, Ark.; Palo Alto, Calif.; Philadelphia, Pa.; and Los Angeles (Wadsworth), Calif. 263 Two Fellows are to be appointed at each site each year. They will be trained for 2 years in a multidisciplinary educational program for clinical practice in geriatrics. At this rate, a total of 132 physicians will have completed this special training in geriatrics by 1985. They will be prepared to function as clinicians, teachers, and coordinators (administrators) of geriatric care in inpatient and ambulatory care settings. The Fellows will play an important role in stimulating and catalyzing educational and clinical efforts in geriatrics in Veterans Adminis- tration facilities, and, through joint medical school appointments may also stimu- late undergraduate and graduate medical education in the school(s) with which the Veterans Administration facility is affiliated. 12. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS BENEFITS Compensation and Pension Programs Disability and survivor benefits (pension compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation) administered by the Department of Veterans Benefits provide all or part of the income for 1,627,485 persons age 65 or older. This total includes 784,835 707,817 widows; 106,799 mothers; and 28,034 fathers. veterans, age 78 or older receive a 25-percent added differential in addition to their monthly pension benefit under the current law. Veterans Assistance Service The veterans assistance service has placed Veterans Administration benefits information and assistance at the fingerprints of older Americans through the completion of the Veterans Administration toll-free telephone network during 1977. Veterans and their families in all 60 States are able to speak to a Veterans benefit counselor without incurring long-distance telephone charges. Veterans services divisions continued to expand their service to the elderly according to the needs of the elderly population in each jurisdiction. As a result, liaison is maintained with over 520 area agencies on aging, benefits assistance is provided to residents of public and private nursing homes, and many Veterans Administration benefits seminars are held with community senior citizens groups. Many face-to-face interviews with older Americans have been conducted on VA mobile vans visiting senior citizens centers, particularly in communities remote from VA facilities. During 1977, the Veterans Assistance System began a special project to contact 847 veterans still insured under 5-year level premium term insurance in the U.S. Government Life Insurance Program. This program origi- nated during World War I and continued until 1940. The average age of these policyholders is in the low seventies and their term policy premiums will continue to increase as they get older. Veterans benefits counselors are offering assistance in converting the policies of these individuals. Educational Assistance There are roughly 500 people age 65 or over receiving Veterans Administration educational benefits, of whom nearly 280 are training under chapter 34, the Veterans Readjustment Act of 1966 as amended. Widows of veterans who died of service-connected causes and wives of veterans who are permanently and totally disabled from service-connected disabilities total about 186 of the enrollees in the survivors' and dependents' educational assistance program. No close estimate of the number of recipients of vocational rehabilitation is available. While no education and rehabilitation service program is specifically designed as a service to the aged, participation in the programs continues to include a small number of aged veterans and eligible dependents.

DEAR MR. CHURCH: Thank you for your request of December 21, 1977, to the Administration for Public Services to update information provided regarding title XX program operations. We regret the delay in responding due to the time required for assembling this information. We are reporting the developments in services delivered in fiscal year 1976 to the aged, the highlights of fiscal year 1977 program operations, and those initia- tives for fiscal year 1978 which will have direct impact on elderly individuals who are recipients of title XX services. We trust this information will prove useful. Sincerely yours, ERNEST L. OSBORNE, Acting Commi8ioner. [Enclosure] THE TITLE XX PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICEs PROGRAM FOR FISCAL YEAR 1976 AND PLANNING FOR SERVICES FOR FISCAL YEAR 1977-78 PURPOSE This report will outline the status of the public social service programs admin- istered by 50 States and the District of Columbia from October 1, 1976, through September 30, 1977. Also, an attempt will be made to show the developments in service programs in States for fiscal year 1977 and services projected in some selected States comprehensive annual services plan for fiscal year 1977-78 which give some indications of overall State plans for service provision to adults, including the aged. INTRODUCTION The social services program administered under title XX of the Social Security Act is a $2.5 billion program administered by States. States are reimbursed for 75 percent of their service expenditures for providing or purchasing social serv- ices to eligible groups such as the low-income elderly. The amount of funding available to each State is based on a formula that allows that percentage of the $2.5 billion FFP that is the same percent of the States population to that of all the States. The services available under title XX are directed at goals established by Pub- lic Law 93-647 of the Social Security Act. These goals are: (1) Achieving or maintaining economic self-support to prevent, reduce, and eliminate dependency. (2) Achieving or maintaining self-sufficiency, including reduction or preven- tion of dependency. (3) Preventing or remedying neglect, abuse, or exploitation of children and adults unable to protect their own interests, or preserving rehabilitating or reunitying families. (4) Preventing or reducing inappropriate institutional care by providing for community-based, home-based care or other forms of less intensive care, or (5) Securing referral or admission for institutional care when other forms of care are not appropriate, or providing services to individuals in institutions. 1 See pages 52-199 for reports from other HEW departments. (281) 282 The title XX program is administered at the Federal level by the Administra- tion for Public Services, Office of Human Development Services, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. It is operated in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Also, title XX funding is provided to Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and Guam to carry out public services programs for eligible recipients. Unlike previous social service titles (titles IV-A and VI) there are services suggested, but not actually mandated under the law for the aged. Three services may be made available to SSI recipients by the States in their plan, if they wish to do so. All States provide services to the aged under their comprehensive an- nual service plans. The provision of services to the aged both as to volume and of services scope, as between States, however, varies considerably among States. This is the basis for many complaints that the aged are not being served. As you know eligibility for these services is determined by the State. States are free to determine what services they will provide and to whom they will provide them. There is one major limitation: Of the total State expenditures for social services each year, the State must have expended at least one-half of the Federal entitlement for services furnished to low-income recipients of the SSI, AFDC, and medicaid programs. Although the title XX program is a means test program, some services may be provided without regard to income (information and referral, family planning, and protective services to children and adults). Individuals whose income does not exceed 115 percent of the State's median income may also be furnished services. Those individuals whose income is between 80 percent to 115 percent of the State's median income must be charged a fee for services. THE STATE'S PLANNING PROCESS: THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL SERVICE PLAN When title XX was initially enacted, most States, under the pressure of time, merely adapted their current service programs. Now that the States are begin- ning the third year of operation they are more conscious of the need to syn- chronize their CASP planning with the legislative and budget cycle. This results in a more realistic approach, economically and politically. States still need to improve their efforts to develop realistic and well-docu- mented needs assessments. In addition, States appear to make limited use of needs assessments findings in setting priorities for services. There is little evi- dence to show that States have attained a degree of sophistication in an assess- ment of client needs so as to result in any significant redistribution of services. Any major redistribution of service, where it has occurred, has been due to factors unrelated to the needs assessment process. Many States have made considerable efforts to permit citizen participation in the plannine process. In fisral year 1976, for examnle. 43 States reported that they had held hearings, meetings, or conducted briefings for the citizenry in addition to the mandatory plan publication requirements. States are beginning to consider the importance of regional meetings to review their experiences in planning and budgeting and to consider such issues as the need for a common taxonomy of service definitions, and the imnortance of pre- gram analysis, review, and evaluation as a basis for accountability-program- matic as well as fiscal. The fact that States in fiscal year 1977 were close to, and now in fiscal year 1978 are very near, their ceiling for title XX funding is forcing them to modify their CASP's so that their planning for services reflects considerable change in the volume of services provided from State to State (and particularly in those States actually at ceiling; see chart below) in their CASP plans. Fiscal year Fiscal year 1978 1977 (estimates) Number of States at ceiling.---------------------------------- -------------- 13 29 Number of States 98 to 100 percent of ceiling ------------------------------------- 19 2 Number of States 90 to 98 percent of ceiling --------------------------------------- 14 9 Number of States 80 to 90 percent of ceiling --------------------------------------- 9 7 Number of States below 80 percent of ceiling 9----------------------------- 9 4 Note.-Projection of States 3t ceiling was based on an analysis of State expenditure data for prior years and an analy- sis developed for the January 1978 report to the Senate Appropriation Committee on public assistance costs for 1978. 283 PROGRAM OPERATIONS Under the title XX public social service program, a wide range of services are provided by most States in their annual service plans. This includes services provided to the aged who are SSI recipients and to other aged persons who are otherwise eligible for service. For example, for the quarter ending June 1976 (third quarter), 265,602 aged recipients received one or more services. This figure compares to 182,086 aged recipients of SSI in receipt of one or more services for the quarter ending March 1976 (second quarter) and 109,080 aged recipients in receipt of service for the quarter ending December 1975 (first quarter). Fourth quarter figures have not been published. Furthermore, because of difficulties associated with the Privacy Act, it is not possible to secure an annual, unduplicated count of aged recipients of SSI who received one or more services in fiscal year 1976. It is worth noting that the States with the largest number of SSI aged service recipients in fiscal year 1976 were California, Texas, New York, and Pennsylvania. A projection based on fiscal year 1976 social service data from the Federal social services reporting systems for five common services by recipient and by cost for fiscal year 1977-78 is shown below: Number of recipients Social service costs (estimate) (estimate in thousands) Common service 1977 1978 1977 1978 Homemaker/chore.----------- 128,885 86,956 92,806 It is expected that as States get closer to the present $2.5 billion ceiling, and also due to inflationary pressures, the expenditures will rise but the recipient level may fall. If the ceiling is raised then this situation will not likely occur. The aged are included in the recipients listed above.' There is attached, as an appendix' to this report, the comprehensive annual State plans for six States (California. Minnesota, Utah, Massachusetts, Idaho, and Florida). Services identified in this plan are available to all adults in the State social service plans. Florida pinpoints those services specifically directed toward the aged. The changes in numbers of clients served and in expenditures over the period fiscal year 1977-78 reflect the States' responses to different pres- sures as well as the States' intent to emphasize or deemphasize certain services to certain groups served under the State plan. In the next several years, a com- parison of expenditures for services in the CASP with actual service expenditures reported in the SSRR will give a more precise picture of trends and patterns in service provision between different groups served. OTHER ACTIVITIES HEW Emphasis Upon Improving Standards in Facilities for the Aged The Administration for Public Services issued final regulations on January 2, 1978 (45 CFR 228), regarding Public Law 94-566 (section 505 (d) which requires the States to establish and enforce standards for small residential settings in which the elderly reside and also publish in the title XX State plans annually the procedures for enforcing these standards. The purpose of this amendment was to encourage the improvement of care in small residential settings. The changes have come about as the result of efforts by advocates for the elderly. 1 The basis for all figures Is the document Social Services USA, published quarterly covering State reports, and statistical tables and analyses of services under title XX, and IV-B for 50 States and the District of Columbia Pub. No. SRS 7-03300 and OHDS 70-03300.1 Retained in committee files. 284 Assistance to Indians to Strengthen their Services on Indian Reservations The Administration for Public Services has funded a series of R & D projects that are intended to design and test alternative methods for improving State agency delivery of title XX services to Indians. These projects are operated by Indian tribes or organizations. Two of the projects in North Carolina and Arizona are designed to build the capacity of tribes to deliver a full range of services to Indian recipients of title XX. Benefits also to aged Indians. Review of Homentaler Services in States Homemaker and/or chore services are provided by one of several methods. It is provided directly by the State (the homemakers and chore worker are con- sidered employees of the State) ; provided by a State supervised and county administered approach; or provided through purchase of services contractual arrangements between the State and nonprofit proprietary, public provider, or self-employed individual. STATUS OF HOMEMAKER SERVICES IN STATES FISCAL YEAR 19761 Number of Number of Total States recipients expenditures Chore service ------------------------------------------------ 35 194, 679 $45, 213, 758 Homemaker services ------------------------------------------- 49 152,781 37,087,217 1 Estimated for 3d quarter of fiscal year 1976 (latest information showing recipients and service expenditures). Inter-Agency Agreement-to improve service delivery to the elderly During fiscal year 1977 the Administration for Public Services has cooperated with other Federal agencies which have a special concern with meeting the social service needs of the elderly. Agrccemnts with the Administration on Aging: Interagency agreements have been developed between the Administration for Public Services and the Administration on Aging. In 1976 a study concerning the extent of homemaker and chore services pro- vision by the States, which was conducted in 24 States by the National Councilfor Iomemaker/Home Health Aide Services, Inc., indicates that there is ameasurable difference in the provision of these services by the States. The defini- tion of the service and the components of the service are -different from State toState. (Example, one State defines \"chore services\" as a heavy task orientedservice such as wood chopping. Another State defines \"chore services\" as lighthousekeeping.) Of the 24 States studied, 18 States provide at least some portion of the home-maker and or chore service directly; 9 States are county administered; and 20States purchase some or all of the homemaker or chore service. Agreements center around: (1) Providing the aged adequate access to title XX services; promote effortsat the Federal, State, and local levels 'to develop comprehensive, coordinatedsocial service systems to serve older persons. (2) Improvement of services to elderly American Indians. (3) Working agreement on information and referral services to older people;to increase the responsiveness of Federal agencies to assist State and local agen- cies to improve their I & R services. Activities: designed a series of workshopsto train State staff, and published a Federal guide on information and referralservices. (4) Working agreement on weatherization, winterization. and home repairactions for the elderly; promote cooperation and coordination of program/re-sources 'to assist the elderly to meet problems arising from the energy crisis.Activities: assisted AoA to develop information pamphlets, and revised title XXregulations to permit payment of utilities during emergencies. 285 Agreements oith Other Dcpartnent8 Cooperation to promote working arrangements between public housing agencies and title XX agencies to assure provision of social services to low-income families residing in federally assisted housing. Program review activities in progress to examine effectiveness of national agreement and technical assistance.to localities developing cooperative arrangements. HEW-HUD review team has participated in a number of national and State level meetings/workshops re: housing-social services cooperation in general. Activites: the joint HUD/APS team will review the cooperative efforts in the States of Rhode Island, Michigan, Florida, Wash- ington, Minnesota, and Texas to meet this goal. Development of Management Initiativcs (Fi8cal Year 1978) (a) Service linkage initiative: Joint initiatives OHDS (APS)-SSA (EA) to develop current State of the art study on new and innovative means of linking SSI recipients to title XX local public social services. Object is to improve client access to service. (b) One of the major initiatives to be started in fiscal year 1978 will be to assist two States which will plan and develop satellite diagnostic social services cen- ters for rural areas. This initiative will improve the access to and availability of a variety of social services for those living in rural areas. Individuals and families living in and around rural communities are often not provided adequate numbers and kinds of social services because of unfamiliarity, isolation, dis- tance, and inaccessibility to State or County public welfare agencies. These centers will provide outreach to determine specific social services to meet the needs of residents in these rural communities. Information and referrals services will be made available where necessary, and also the provision of some services where possible. These satellite centers will be modeled after the medical clinics that have been recently developed in rural areas. SUMMARY Over the period of fiscal year 1977, States have gridually improved their ability to plan for services to the aged, either in their own Initiative or in response to citizen pressure to do so. Federal efforts in fiscal year 1978-79 will be directed toward helping States to improve the planning process and to strengthen their service operations. Fed- eral reviews will look to the balance between groups served and the States' efforts to achieve such a balance so that the Congressional intent that the \"needs of all the recipients of service\" will be fulfilled.
