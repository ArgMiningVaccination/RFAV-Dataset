RUDOLF STEINER EDUCATION GROUP BRISBANE INC. Strategic Plan 2017-2026 1 1. Background 1.1. The RSEGB Purpose The purpose of the RSEGB is to provide the opportunity of a Steiner/Waldorf inspired education to children in Brisbane/SEQ. To advance this purpose, the RSEGB supports the Samford Valley Steiner School (SVSS) in providing a p-12 Steiner education curriculum of recognised excellence in a financially sustainable and legally compliant manner. To maximise the number of children able to benefit from a Steiner inspired education, the RSEGB is also focused on building relationships with key stakeholders, both internal and external, and facilitating the provision of training and information on the Steiner philosophy within SEQ. 1.2. Vision and Mission Statements The Board of the RSEGB and the College of Teachers (CoT) of SVSS has developed the following combined vision statement and independent mission statements. Shared Vision: Advancing social and cultural renewal through sound anthroposophical application. CoT Mission: That SVSS be a living and contemporary embodiment of the spiritual, cultural, educational impulse of anthroposophy that contributes towards societal renewal in the world. Board Mission: To provide the welcoming environment and stable framework (encompassing the Board's four pillars) that encourages the maximum number of children to enjoy an education underpinned by the principles of Anthroposophy as given by Rudolf Steiner, whereby, our highest endeavor is to develop free human beings who are able of themselves to impart purpose and meaning to their lives. The following diagram illustrates how the related but slightly different Missions combine to achieve the Shared Vision. Mission of the College of Teachers Shared Vision: Cultural and social renewal Mission of the Board of RSEGB RUDOLF STEINER EDUCATION GROUP BRISBANE INC. Strategic Plan 2017-2026 2 2. Introduction to the Strategic Plan This Strategic Plan accomplishes three important tasks: 1. It clarifies the key objectives that the RSEGB Board and CoT wish to achieve for the SVSS over the next 10 years; 2. It identifies the criteria that will be used to assess performance against each objective (these have been termed the 'End State' criteria in the Board section and as 'Indicators of Achievement' in the CoT section); and 3. It provides a timeframe over which the objectives are expected to be achieved. The RSEGB Board has accountabilities in four strategic areas or pillars, and has grouped the objectives into these: Financial; Performance; Compliance; and Stakeholder Management. The CoT has accountabilities in 3 strategic areas, and has grouped the objectives into these: The Children - A living and contemporary curriculum imbued with an anthroposophical understanding of the human being; The Staff - Professional development, mentoring and succession planning for staff; and The Community and Environment - A healthy united and sustainable community. The Strategic Plan maintains the focus of the RSEG B Board and CoT on agreed activities that will assist in achieving the respective Missions and Shared Vision. RUDOLF STEINER EDUCATION GROUP BRISBANE INC. Strategic Plan 2017-2026 3 3. The Board Pillars 3.1 Financial Financial accountability cannot be legally delegated by the Board and individual members can be prosecuted if they are found to be delinquent in the execution of their duties; ignorance is no defense under the law in this case. Good financial governance by the Board is also essential to the long-term sustainability of SVSS, and so all Board members need to ensure they have sufficient financial literacy to carry out this aspect of their duties.

Strategic Plan 2017-2026 6 3.3 Compliance There are many areas of legal compliance associated with running an educational facility. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring the School is fully compliant in all areas rests with the Board. The Board must ensure the School has the policies and procedures required for compliance in place and they are being implemented effectively. It must therefore demonstrate that it has a mechanism for reviewing policies and compliance regularly and effectively. The requirements for legal compliance do change over time so the Board must be able to demonstrate that it was diligent in keeping all members abreast of changes to compliance requirements.

The progress percentages recorded in this document reflect, at a high level, progress achieved and recorded in the operational improvement plan. 4.1 The Students Our educational philosophy views students as young human beings gradually unfolding and developing on their journey to adulthood. Therefore, we place significant focus on nourishing the social and emotional development of the students as well as on academic rigour and achievement. This is achieved through a carefully designed and implemented curriculum based on the developmental needs of the students at different ages. Our School aims to provide an educational environment that serves the freedom of the human spirit by emphasising the balanced and disciplined development of the child as a whole human being.

Staff acknowledge that to achieve this, ongoing study into the nature of the human being as both a spiritual and physical being is required. Teachers work with the Australian Steiner Curriculum but know that this Framework must be transformed and enlivened by seeking an ever-expanding understanding, through personal and professional development activities, of the self, the children before them, our unique time and place and an understanding of the spiritual basis of the curriculum and our work.
