The last one year has forced us all to take a closer look at it. This is, possibly , one of the more positive outcomes of a pandemic which seems to have\u2014implausible though it may seem\u2014changed the course of humanity forever. We at Outlook Traveller like to count our blessings. This issue we set about rediscovering India. It was a revelation, from the white tigers of Rewa in Madhya Pradesh to an eco-friendly farmstay near Srinagar that is all about hope. Goa is a culinary gift that keeps on giving, and we bring you our pick of the 10 best standalone restaurants of the moment. Besides that there is a compact list of destinations from across the length and breadth of India to give you all the travel inspiration you need for the summer holidays. But perhaps the biggest surprise of this issue is Agra. Who would have thought Agra has a life beyond the Taj Mahal, so much so that we bypassed the monument completely? Not only did we discover hidden and forgotten monuments but also a buzzing city with a street food scene worthy of reverence. Wildlife safaris on the Chambal River are not too far away either. Surprises like these ensure that travel never loses its appeal. Now that the vaccination drive is in full swing, there is more than a glimmer of hope that travel\u2014so essential to our well-being, as we've painfully realised in recent times\u2014will make a full comeback, this time in a sustainable and more responsible avatar. If nothing else, it will certainly make people more confident about travelling. The poet T.S. Eliot called April the cruellest month. For once, we hope he's proved wrong. amit dixit @omitdixitwho would have thought Agra has a life beyond the Taj mahal, so much so that we bypassed the monument completely? croSSed oFF my readInG lISt the World below Zero Fahrenheitsuhas Munshi This book captures a crucial moment in the contemporary history of Kashmir, after Article 370 was abolished.

After a year-long hiatus, the Indian travel industry, which was one of the hardest-hit sectors due to the pandemic, is preparing for a big comeback as it takes the 'Blue Route'. Cordelia Cruises, a Mumbai-based company, will begin its cruise operations in India from May 2021. The company plans to target the west and east coasts of India, catering to domestic destinations like Goa, Diu, and Lakshadweep and international destinations like Colombo, Galle, Trincomalee, Jaffna, and the Maldives. Waterways Leisure Tourism Private Limited has forayed into the Indian cruise industry under the maiden brand, Cordelia Cruises, and is affiliated with the Dream Hotel Group which is a hotel and brand management company with more than 30 years of experience in managing properties around the world. Asserting his belief in the potential of the Indian cruise market, Founder and Chairman of the Dream Hotel Group, Padma Bhushan Sant Singh Chatwal said: \"Success through innovation has been the foundation for all our brands over the last three decades. We have seen the growth and evolution of cruise tourism around the world. With 7 ,500 km of coastline and recent initiatives by the Indian government for coastal development, India is ready for cruising. Incredible India will soon be an incredible cruise destination as well for travellers around the world.\" with facilities and services at par with international standards, Cordelia Cruises is launching 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- & 7-night itinerariesSplashBack with a PHoToGRAPH: SHuTTeRSToCkapril 2021 18Having 2015 for animal cruelty, Mumbai's iconic horse-drawn Victoria carriages are returning to the city's roads.

The app has been designed and developed by the National Informatics Centre and aims to give a boost to tourism in Namsai and its nearby regions. The app will allow tourists to gain credible information directly from the government, which will help them in planning their trip to Namsai district. Home to the Tai Khampti and Singpho tribes, the quaint little hamlet promises to be an enriching experience for travellers looking for off-beat destinations and meaningful experiences.

Over the years of travel across Europe, I have gotten by with whatever I have come across, which being a vegetarian has at times been only bread and cheese. Food was not a priority and I spent the least amount of time searching for the specialities that a place had to offer. Now I wonder though if I was missing something in my travels. When I look back now, I remember those travels more clearly in which I had tasted the local flavours, and eaten well. One that has remained etched in my memory is the trip to Rome. We were newly married and it was our first trip to Italy . We were in Rome for a week, and after spending long days on the streets we would eat at a local restaurant next to our hotel. However, no ordinary restaurant it was, for it was always crowded with locals and we had to wait to be seated. If we placed an order, and the waitress didn't agree with our choice, she showed no restraint. \"I don't like it, \" she told us bluntly on more than one occasion. Taking away our menus, she would order vegetarian fare of her choice. And her recommendations worked every time, so much so that we remember the food as much as the sights. Those were the days before Google Maps, and we had stumbled across this place without reading any reviews. Years later when we went back to Rome, we couldn't locate the restaurant. But we still search for it every time we go to Rome. In contrast, there isn't much that I remember about Doha, which I visited a decade ago. Except for a little memory ... I had gone there to meet a friend. I stayed with him and his wife made sure that I remained well fed with Indian food throughout. On my last evening though, my friend took me to the nearest souk. We sat inside a local restaurant while he ordered the food \u2014 an Arabic flatbread called manousha. It came with a dollop of hummus placed in the centre. I was non-committal, sensing which my friend gently nudged me to try it. The creamy layer of hummus, peppered with sesame seeds and drizzled in olive oil, scooped in soft bread melted in my mouth, exploding into rich earthy flavours. There I was, sitting in that small Arabic caf\u00e9, encountering tastes that I had never experienced before, and the memory of which has remained with me till date. Coming laced with these memories are the smells and the feverishness of that souk, ever fresh and still not sandpapered by the years and the countless other experiences that I have collected since then. The pandemic has restricted us to mostly armchair travelling. Given the time at hand, I have now started recollecting my travels from the past decade. While doing so I realised that the sharpest memories on the road have been when food was integral to the experience. A further thought comes to mind \u2014 by putting labels on ourselves, foodie or non-foodie, we often restrict the experiences that we collect. For what's learning the culture of a city without absorbing the noises from its neighbourhood, without walking its streets, and without tasting the food on offer. Food makes travel memorable, and a trip can become a moveable feast IllUSTRATIoN: NITIN CHAUDHARyNitiN Chaudhary On Food and Travel If we placed an order, and the waitress didn't agree with our choice, she showed no restraint. \"I don't like it,\" she told us bluntly on more than one occasion.

What is not so well known is that, along with its 482-km-long coastline, wildlife sanctuaries, forests, temples and monuments, Odisha is also home to many hill stations. Oozing with natural beauty and enjoying balmy weather, these destinations offer travellers some much- needed relief from the punishing heat of the summer months. Daringbadi Set at a height of 915m from sea level in Odisha's Kandhamal district, Daringbadi is the perfect summer getaway. Popularly referred to as the 'Kashmir IT'S COOL OUT HERE The Hill Stations of Odisha Y es, Odisha has hill stations too, and that makes it a destination for all seasonstravel promotIontravel promotIon clockwise deomali; Mahendragiri, which is associated with the Pandavas; and driving through the lush greenery of odisha mesmerising waterfall named Khasada, this lush green valley presents an ambience of peace and serenity. On the way to Chandragiri from Berhampur falls the small town of Jeerang, where there is a Tibetan settlement. Tourists stop at this town to take in the impressive Jeerang Monastery and to experience a slice of Tibetan culture right here in odisha. The Chandragiri hills also house the Padmasambhava Mahavihara Monastery, which happens to be the largest Buddhist Monastery in South Asia. It was inaugurated by the Dalai Lama in 2010. There is also a nunnery called Namkha Khyung Dzong Monastery. Tourists who visit this place generally stay at accommodations available in Taptapani, which is a scenic hot-water spring 35km away from Jeerang. Deomali To truly experience something refreshing atop Odisha's highest, head off on a road trip to Koraput starting from Bhubaneswar via the enigmatic landscapes of Rayagada, or from Visakhapatnam via the Araku valley. Reaching Deomali at an elevation of 1,672m is a mesmerising experience. Once you're here, you can trek to several beautiful waterfalls such as Gulmi, Duduma and Rani Duduma, or to the cave shrine of Gupteswar which nestles on a green hill 58km from Jeypore and 80km from Koraput. The cavernous interior of the cave shrine enshrines a huge lingam. It is believed that Lord Rama passed through this region on his way to Panchabati in Dandakaranya. The wooded valley all around is a blessing for adventure seekers. For ethnic encounters, visit villages of the Dhuruba and Gadaba tribes. If you happen to be here on a Thursday, visit Onkadelli to interact with the Bondas at their weekly market. They are different from the other tribes, and noted for their colourful ornaments. You can also encounter the Didayi tribe here. If Odisha is India's best kept secret, then these hill stations must surely be Odisha's best kept secret. of Odisha', Daringbadi has beautiful pine jungles, sprawling coffee estates, alluring rain forests rich in fauna, and beautiful valleys. A veritable ecotourism hub, Daringbadi\u2014named after a British officer\u2014provides an eclectic mix of cultural, tribal and nature tourism. It is home to tribes like the Kutia Kondha and Dongri Khond, as well as the Belghar Wildlife Sanctuary. The series of waterfalls punctuating the landscape are a must visit. Some of the most popular are Daringbadi waterfall, Putudi waterfall, Dadubaba waterfall and Ludu waterfall. Nature lovers can book their stay at the Daringbadi Nature Camp and go birdwatching, undertake guided treks and jungle safaris to experience the beauty of the Eastern Ghats and watch the breathtaking landscape unravel itself with the rising sun. Mahendragiri Located in Ganjam district, Mahendragiri is a little-known hill station situated on the second-highest peak of Odisha, and is revered for its mythological, religious and cultural significance. Legend has it that some of the temples here were built by the Pandavas themselves. On top of the hill are the Shiva, Parshuram, Kunti, Bhima, and Yudhishthir temples. The hill does not draw the devout alone. Tourists come to enjoy the view of the mountains and the river flowing nearby. Another famous hill next door is Chandragiri. This one is dotted with numerous Buddhist monasteries.

First referred to as Agra by the Greek polymath Ptolemy , this city was a Mughal capital for close to a century . It was here that Akbar desired to erect palaces of copper and it was here that the marble mausoleums of Itimad- ud-Daulah and Taj Mahal were later raised. It's one of three vertices of the hallowed Golden Triangle. Every year, thousands of foreign tourists pack their bags and set off for a trip to India for Agra alone, bravely ignoring every stereotype that you have sold and bought about travelling in this country . But as we drove through the dusty roads depositing you into its unassuming tier-II environs, none of that crossed my mind. Wherever I threw my somnolent gaze, shop after shop selling more authentic Panchhi petha than the last slapped my field of view with the persistence of the tangawalas of Meena Bazaar. Thankfully , before long, our hosts at Ekaa Villa intervened, telling us that there were just two original Panchhi Petha outlets in the city\u2014the original ones could always be identified by their distinctly green branding and a woman toting a carry bag. going behind its bA cK\u2014liter Ally Initially , choosing to not visit the Taj Mahal was without reason and probably too dramatic and self-important, but I realised Agra had much to see after our first evening experiencing high tea at a tila-top. We drove through a veritable dust bowl of the Taj Reserve Forest and got down just before the access to the said perch. Our hosts, a couple of enterprising gentlemen assiduously carving out a new dawn, a ninth life for Agra in a pandemicked world, along with a staff member, had a table laid out at the edge of what is a rather low precipice. Was this the same Agra whose heat and dust Babur had complained about in his memoirs? Our gaze issued from higher up, where we stood close to a mazaar, and ricocheted off the snacks table onto the silhouette of the mausoleum. Its domes and minars, oblivious of our surreptitious private viewing session, canoodled blithely with the departing sunset. The eavesdroppers were caught without arrest and punished without harm. Anyway , in no time, the damned cameras, lenses and polarisers came out, mine included, and the familiar rush to catch the celebrity's gorgeous back as the sun went down behind, began. The table stood right in everybody's field of view as an interesting detail in the frame but secretly hoping the party would soon land at its shores. That happened when the sun finally sank behind the monument. For me, personally , the return to simple desi snacks\u2014bakery-l let Me coMe cleAn: A t first , I failed to find myself positively charmed by the prospect of visiting the Taj Mahal for the first time. Packed-like-sardines would be an understatement to what our vengeful travel selves had done to the marble mausoleum\u2014 which suffices for India on most calendars and brochures\u2014with the pandemic still at large. That coupled with the last surviving shreds of pioneerism and an elitist aversion for crowd favourites almost made me go, 'Gah\u2014Taj?' But then I woke up one morning and left for Agra on a fogless December morning. And that was it. high spirits for high tea by the t aj Mahalbefore being shifted to Kabul, babur's body was buried in Agra for the six months following his death.

The platter was indulgence at its plainest best, indulgence reminiscent of casual snacking after a knackering game of eight-grade football with no fear at all of getting fat. Petha was inevitably offered, and so was dal moth\u2014I don't need to tell anyone that the couple are to Agra what chaat and chhole bhature are to Dilli. PAnchhis And Patrons We chewed the sweet, fragrant, candied pumpkin cubes with the refinement that we thought only a sarpech- and-attar-wearing Mughal ruler could exercise with the sweets in his mouth. The chalk to this cheese was the tangy , spicy , slightly wet crunch of dal moth that is an incredibly versatile snack consumed all over UP . Different people credit Lucknow, Agra and Farrukhabad with its invention, but when in Agra, you know how the dal moth crumbles. It is had with puris, on top of rice or palmfuls with chai in a steel tumbler. Coming to petha, on the surface, it is the second flagship offering that Agra has for the undiscerning visitor. For the others, there are no frontmen really in this ageless boy band. The rapid proliferation of the Panchhi Petha brand has also meant that connoisseurs have come to place exceptional trust in Gopal Das Pethe Wale that goes back a century . The legacy shop has quite a few variants available and the brand doesn't believe much in aggressive expansionism. As for what's happened to the other petha patron, I think a lot of credit goes to the catchiness of the name itself\u2014Panchhi, which means birdie. Agra is full of Pushpak Mishthaan quarters. Gopal Tajganj, Civil Lines and Fatehabad Road. And Panchhi? They're perched on every branch.

We tried the aloo chaat, ras malai and kadahi doodh on our second night in the city , and we didn't need to bother our friends for dinner. On our final morning in Agra, we would be up early and driving through the cold morning past benign colonial structures and the curious old buildings of the old city , to savour bedhai, another rather special Agra heirloom. The fare at Pushpak Mishthan Bhandar sells like hot cakes and no matter what the actual origin of the eatery's name is, it sure is a great illustration of why the flying chariot of the Ramayana was called so: it'll make you fly; it'll make you come home. As the server hands you a dona, warm with piping hot aloo ki sabzi, you wonder why another marble monument could have been dedicated to this delicious darling. It's after you've polished off the bedhai and washed it down with a kulhad of thick kadahi doodh, that you realise it's probably because monuments are made for the dead. croc-Spotting And ho Ax-b usting Of course, Agra is more than just the Taj Mahal\u2014in fact to keep repeating that fact defeats its undeniable validity . But Agra is more than the stand-ins\u2014Fatehpur Sikri, Agra Fort, Chini-ka-Rauza, Itimad-ud-Daula's Tomb and Sikandra\u2014as well. Excursions and heritage tours to the crafts market of Gokulpura and the heritage buildings of Holipura are stimulating experiences. An hour's drive away is the bustling glass bangle- making town of Firozabad. Itimad-ud- Daulah's Tomb and the nearby Aram Bagh merit a visit not just for their calming environs but also to experience the closest version of the original idea of the tomb-gardens, which the arrival of the British turned into landscaped and manicured lawn-style gardens.

In the same way , enigmatic structures are to be found all over Agra, from Akbar's Church, said to be commissioned by the Mughal emperor at the close of the 16th century , to a huge iron water tank constructed during British rule that never rusted in the old city . The second day , we had to relinquish our haveli walk in Holipura, which has for some time been on the radar of Agra tourism authorities as a rural tourism hub, owing to fears expressed by locals about a couple of Covid cases that had come up in the village. So, we drove due south towards the border with Madhya Pradesh and reached Chambal Wildlife Safari Lodge, a calm, unperturbed oasis of considerable verdure near village Jarar. The director, Kunwar Munendra Pal Singh, an unassuming man with a passion for horses, showed us around the farmstay- style cottages painted in mud green, and then sent his motorboat operator with us for the safari. Singh, from the local zamindar family , expressed his desire to promote his place as a domestic destination wedding venue, but also considered our suggestion that visitors' pillaging and littering ways might not make it a very good idea. The next lap was a short drive to the town of Pinahat, which is the base for the safari. I walked down to the bank entranced by the dance of sunlight on the Chambal's ample belly , feeling already the full breeze that rose from the heart of the river, and hardly expecting to see gharials. The Chambal divides the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh here, and my excitement was pretty much limited to wading through the river astride the hood of the MP border. But as the boat forged ahead, harmonising with the steady current, the spiky ridge of the river reptile's tail materialised from behind a bush. There were more of them to be seen as we went deeper\u2014the little craggy islets one after the other looked scarcely different than their sunbathing inhabitants. Save for a couple or three, the gharials all stayed largely beneath the water, revealing only their cockle- warming snouts, while the crocodiles lay deader than their lonely island homelands and threw themselves heavily and resignedly into the river only when the boat drew closer. of gr And anticlimaxes Stranger things happened later in the day . First, having feasted comprehensively on the delicious north Indian platter at the Ekaa kitchen and feeling the need to take a lengthy stroll and the desire to spend our hard-earned money on some knick-knacks, we set off for the Taj promenade. Having sauntered half of its length, we asked a shopkeeper about the whereabouts of Meena Bazaar. \"Sir, what you get in my shop, you get everywhere in Meena Bazaar, \" he said wisely before proceeding to shatter our na\u00efve illusion of the old-world grandeur of the said market. Giving it our best shot at looking unfazed, we floated further into the quagmire, increasingly emboldened against the soliciting wails of the tangawalas. Curiously , it seemed to be shutter-down time for shops on both sides selling clunky marble living- room decorations and jootiyan embroidered in no specific style. Before long, the massive West Gate of the Taj Mahal appeared, and as we drew closer, we stole a peek at the majestic central dome of Agra's most The Chambal not only teems with crocodiles and gharials but also encompasses a 5,400 sq km protection area for the conservation of endangered red-crowned roof turtles and Ganges river dolphins. while crocs are known for their flat, v-shaped snouts, the gharial is a fish-eating crocodilian with A stylish little nook at the ekaa v illa dining area outlooK tr Aveller 41 agRa eXplore illustrious resident through the arch of the gate. No wonder the walk back to the hotel proved especially difficult. The poverty of novelty at Meena Bazaar affected our minds, accustomed to Dilli Haat and Tripolia Bazaar in the other vertices of the hallowed Golden Triangle, such that we could only realise later what we had come looking for. It was Agra's unrivalled leather goods; footwear emporiums can be found all over the city , be it the 'Leather Street' in Sadar Bazaar or standalone establishments named Berry Shoes and Dawar Shoes where the ambience and distinct school of bohni hustle\u2014and probably the prices, too\u2014are a throwback to the early 2000s if not the late 1990s.

They both now live in the annals of history . Thad them sent to the Delhi Zoo. They were named Raja and Rani! It's indeed amazing that in 1950-70s\u2014 when medical science or infrastructure hadn't made the grade in India\u2014the breeding of these tigers was being successfully carried out, with the feeble veterinary support available. The white tigers kept breeding, although at a slower pace, mainly due to inbreeding, but no damage was done in the process. After a long innings, during which Mohan rendered an immense service to the world by giving his clan to various zoos around the country and the world, he left us forever in 1968. His death was condoled all over the world. Mohan's last son, Virat, who bore his quintessential looks, carried the flag for two decades, till he too left us in 1970. My father was so dismayed by this that he decided to drop the curtain. The white tiger bid adieu from Govindgarh, and the majestic palace fell into ruin bit by bit. the Resurrection After a long struggle to place Govindgarh back on the tourism map, I with my team handed over one lakh signatures to the then President Dr A.P .J.

An initiative at socially and ecologically harmonious living, it is a glimpse of what Kashmiris are capable of, if left to their own destiny . Sagg\u2014\"to nurture like water nurtures the roots of plants\"\u2014is a small resort near Srinagar. Well, resort is a misnomer for its rather down-to-earth character. Conceptualised by the youth civil society group Mool, Sagg is an experiment in providing culturally rooted, environmentally responsible lifestyle examples and experiences to people, especially children and youth. For anyone willing to try something very different from the run-of-the-mill tourist and culinary experience that Kashmir offers in plenty , Sagg is well worth exploring. Having been in touch with its founder, Fayaz Dar and facilitators Shaheena Parveen and Lubna Rafiqi, through the national Vikalp Sangam process, we were fortunate to be invited to spend a couple of nights at Sagg in the summer of 2019. Late June, and just the right temperature though a tad rainy (unusual for this time of the year; climate change?). We were plied with diverse (mostly Kashmiri) cuisine, and plenty of steaming hot cups of kahwa made just as it should be (not the insipid readymade powder variety one gets in the market). Not to mention the ubiquitous nun chai, salty tea, that is proffered to visitors anywhere one goes in Kashmir. Two spacious cottages with thatched roofs, mud walls, beautifully adorned in Kashmiri style, make for a calm, cosy stay . Over meals and beverages, and on a full tour of the campus, Fayaz gave us insights into the motivation behind Sagg and the various activities it hosts. how it Began Sagg started with a thought to integrate needs of self, family , and community by building relationships, and enabling collaborative learning amongst each other. The values underlying all the work that Sagg does are co- existence and collaboration, dignity and trust, freedom and responsibility , equality and justice, inclusiveness and self-sufficiency , sustainability and everyone's well being.

Located at the base of a hill range near Srinagar, Sagg is soaked in the silence of nature, yet so pleasurably alive with sounds of birds and other creatures. There is a strong belief in reviving traditional recipes of Kashmir, as also trying new combinations. The idea stems from promoting an eco-friendly lifestyle that is based on integration of local resources, regenerating local livelihoods, and promoting old and new knowledges. There are a number of products that Sagg makes facilitators Sajad Qadir and Mukhtar Sheikh, also organise collaborative, educational and recreational camps for school children and youth. The aim is to develop critical thinking, reflection, leadership, planning, decision-making and entrepreneurship abilities. They have consolidated their experience in a contextual educational and development methodology; this is being offered in their educational, counselling, consulting and coaching work through mouaj bab sufficiency school and the village academy . Sagg also organises recreational activities like eco-therapy sessions, treks, and rides. and sells, like Kashmiri wuer (a traditional mix of herbs and spices that boosts immunity , especially useful in winters), wild honey , dried apples, lotus stem and other pickles, jams, etc. All of these products are hand-made with love, care and ecological sensitivity . We tasted some of these products and spent hours sipping a wide variety of herbal teas, which were simply delicious! Shaheena Parveen tells us that Sagg has deliberated quite a lot on the pricing of their services and products, realising that most are too costly for the local people. But they try to resolve this by subsidising the vocational training for local students sagg eco v illage products sagg caf\u00e9's very dar and Parveen at the sagg eco village outlooK tr Aveller 59 and also charging 20 per cent less price on products for locals. Using our visit as an occasion, Fayaz had also called a gathering of people associated with Sagg and Mool. It was a diverse crowd in various occupations, all interested in doing something about the ecological devastation and social disruption that the 'developmental' strategy and militarisation of the region had unleashed. There was a lively discussion on the politics of the mindless 'development' being promoted, such as mass tourism, with disastrous consequences for fragile ecosystems and local rural populations. lAP of nature In two short walks in the campus, we listed about 25 species of birds, very likely just a fraction of the diversity that must exist in and around Sagg. The slopes leading away from the campus towards mountainous meadows must in particular be rich in wildlife; Fayaz told us they take treks up for adventure, experiencing nature, and getting some great views of the landscape. While we were there, Sagg inaugurated their Ecoclub 'tamah' of friends and associates for promoting multi-dimensional lifestyles, taking up local issues and running public awareness campaigns on wetland destruction, water scarcity , sand mining and crushers. Sagg is focused on envisioning a future that is ecologically sensitive and regenerative, socially integrative and equitable, economically self-sustaining and self-determined. It is a must visit for all those who wish to learn more about Kashmiri culture and lifestyle, to see how the region's youth is trying to re-imagine lives in a particularly challenging context.

The novel begins with war veteran Jake Barnes trying to live life as a journalist outside of the US while continuously traversing across France and Spain. While the story begins with Jake Barnes and his friend Robert Cohn, it gradually progresses with Lady Brett Ashley coming to the limelight and the male characters\u2014Mike Campbell, Pedro Romero and Cohn among others\u2014trying to catch her attention. Taking readers through a flamboyant lifestyle across clubs and borders in the 1920s, Hemingway's first novel put him on the positive side of the literary map much later. With fairly simple literary usage, the book takes its readers places\u2014from weekends in San Sebastian to the bullfighting rings in the main city and hotel rooms in Madrid. The Sun Also Rises is a tale of unrequited love, escapism as a coping mechanism and disillusioned adults (mis)guiding themselves as they whizz past international borders. In an age when the characters are 'lost' in the very sense of the word, Hemingway builds a narrative that continues to resonate generations later. simon & scHuster $16 On august 5, 2019, Suhas Munshi was on his way back to Srinagar from Gurez, when Article 370--which accorded special status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir- -of the Indian Constitution was abrogated. This book is about that moment, and its aftermath. Through travels and conversations with people across the Valley in the wake of the event, Munshi tries to stitch together a portrait of what it meant for the common Kashmiri. The book opens with a memorable line: \"This is not a goddamn 'Heaven' . \" That's a 'corrosive' clich\u00e9 we've all been guilty of at some point or the other, which, as Munshi says, \"reduced a living place to an amusement park. \" . This is after all a real place, with all the attendant imperfections. Over the course of his travels, Munshi runs into a plethora of eclectic characters and experiences\u2014from attending a Christmas service with the tiny Christian community of Baramulla to meeting the lone Pandit family in a ghost colony in Shopian, watching a football match in Srinagar and embarking on a gruelling walk with the Bakarwal shepherds over the majestic Pir Panjal range from Srinagar to Jammu. There are two encounters in the book that I found particularly impactful. One is with the poet Madhosh Balhami of Pulwama, whose house\u2014including his work and library of over 800 books, some of them quite rare\u2014was reduced to ashes in a gunfight between militants and security forces on 15 March, 2018. The second is a meeting with the playwright, actor and director Bashir Bhawani, who went from rural south Kashmir in the 1980s to study theatre at the National School of Drama in New Delhi\u2014an extraordinary feat for the time. Bhawani has risen to national prominence in recent times after cameos in Haider and Bajrangi Bhaijaan. Then, of course, there is the extraordinary coda of the Bakarwals, sitting snugly by itself at the end like a self- contained novella, even though it had a somewhat inauspicious start. The World Below Zero Fahrenheit is a time capsule, an extraordinary book about an extraordinary moment in the history of the Indian subcontinent. \u2014amiT dixiTThe WoRld BeloW ZeRo FahRenheiT by suHas munsHi penguin/ vintage K499 Through travels and conver-sations with people across the Valley in the wake of the abrogation of article 370, munshi tries to stitch together a portrait of what it meant for the common kashmiriCry, the Beloved Valley outlook traveller 89 Book reviews Back WHile tHis is tHe story of Devika Rani and Himanshu Rai, their relationship and the studio, Bombay Talkies that they struggled to set up, what comes through is a woman's struggle against a patriarchy that judges her on the basis of her beauty and assumed behaviour. Tagore's grandniece locked eyes with the much older producer through a window at midnight in London, as stagey an introduction as any . The relative she was staying with at the time warned Rai off the beautiful young girl, but karma intervened and eventually brought them together. The first part of the book is about Rai's struggles to finance his studio which involved seducing naive German frauleins, one of whom gave him a daughter, and while detailed and well researched the book does have readers wondering when Devika Rani will finally sweep in and take centre stage. Desai does not disappoint\u2014Devika Rani enters and becomes Mrs Himanshu Rai. The first film that they starred in was fittingly called Karma. Launched in London's Hyde Park, Karma dazzled all beholders and became infamous for the longest kiss in Indian cinema, two minutes of screen time in which Devika Rani liplocked with The Longest Kiss: The Life and of Devika Rani by k isHwar Desai westlanD K599an unconscious Rai. Hyped as Tagore's grandniece, she began attracting attention at a time when Indian cinema was in a nascent stage and when most actresses were women from doubtful backgrounds. To do him credit, Himanshu Rai, billed as the Indian Casanova and chased by creditors\u2014mainly female\u2014was solely devoted to setting up his production company . He and Devika advertised for educated actresses and the production crew they assembled was mainly German with a talented Bengali faction at its head. Desai keeps the interest in their personal life going by hinting at a dark secret and intersperses the text with letters from Devika Rani to Svetoslav Roerich whom she was later to marry . Desai's research is based on 4,000 letters and studio documents, which Roerich had advised her to archive, and lockdown helped the author to organise the papers. The fact that a beautiful actress' life is not easy emerges from the book\u2014 driven to elopement by Rai's abusive behaviour, Devika Rani chose to be branded a seductress rather than reveal Rai's psychological issues and weaken the foundations of Bombay Talkies. The kind of strength that enabled her to hold her tongue while being misunderstood on all fronts\u2014Manto shredded her character in his story of the actress Lateeka Rani\u2014would seem strange in these kiss-and-tell tabloid days. The Longest Kiss is as much a story of the setting up of Indian cinema as it is the story of the actress who became a studio head and who could sing and develop film concepts with ease. Ultimately internal politics shredded Bombay Talkies and Devika Rani found love in Svetoslav Roerich and abandoned the tumultuous film world. Her life is the stuff of films, and was the subject of a successful play scripted by Kishwar Desai. The star struck as well as film historians will find much to relish in her story . \u2014anjana BaSu launched in london's hyde Park, Karma dazzled all beholders and became infamous for the longest kiss in indian cinema, two minutes of screen time in which devika Rani liplocked with an unconscious himanshu Rai april 2021 90Time Traveller Back India is full of myriad secrets\u2014in its maze- like streets, historical structures, colourful culinary space, its people and their stories. Its rich history is shaped by numerous rulers, their dynasties and fortified structures, ancient memorabilia and a conscious attempt to preserve it all. While multiple stories float around the rock-cut caves of Ellora, the one that fascinates travellers and historians alike is that the entire structure has been built out of a single basalt rock. And the largest one that has been cut out, today stands in the form of the Kailasa Temple\u2014or colloquially Cave 16\u2014and was aimed at representing its namesake, Mount Kailasa (Kailash), Lord Shiva's abode in the daunting Himalaya. Unlike the honeycomb caves that the structure is believed to be, the temple is a freestanding one, depicting tales from the Ramayana, Mahabharata and the life of Shiva. With two monolithic obelisks and ancient carvings, the Kailasa Temple is an architectural marvel with a royal patronage. While intricately carved figurines and motifs dominate the structure, it is the forgotten ones a few steps away that have a tale of their own to tell and one that is best experienced rather than talked about. Even though the caves sprawl across two kilometres in area, only 34 of them are accessible to the public with the rest sealed with royal secrets. \u2014Simrran Gill ellora 1960 jharkhand a land of natural and cultural wonders amazingwww.outlooktraveller.com April 2021 `150india 's no.1 Travel magazine "}
