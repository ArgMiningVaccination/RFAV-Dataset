On a physical level, the sensation is that of constant energy flow. The emotional experience ranges from sublime peace to fear, crossing the full spectrum of joy and frustration. But mostly, people enter into a deep sleep state. Depending on the individual, visual, auditive, tactile, and olfactory enhancements can be felt. And also, more profound states of meditation that could lead to more astral experiences.
