And there was! I have since become very passionate about holistic nutrition and have made it my goal to help others reach a fulfilling life while bringing an understanding that with proper guidance, healing is possible. In an effort to avoid masking symptoms with medication, I strive to educate, inspire, and guide others to heal their bodies through a holistic approach just like I did! There's nothing quite like seeing clients turn a corner and transform their health in a way that they didn't feel was possible. As long as you believe in yourself and have patience with the process, you can do it too.\" Certified Holistic Nutritionist by American Fitness Professionals & Associates. "}
