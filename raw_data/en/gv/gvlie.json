Fortunately, we have an inbuilt natural defence mechanism - our immune system. Easy lifestyle habits for immunity It's no surprise that simple lifestyle habits such as getting a good night's sleep, a balanced diet full of fruit and vegetables and washing your hands regularly can help support your body's ability to fight off infections, but did you know that plants have powerful properties to help support your body's natural defence mechanism? Here are our favourite natural remedies to help support your immune system. Boost your immune system naturally with these plants Echinacea A renowned immune tonic, echinacea can be particularly helpful for fighting infections of the respiratory tract. It may have a preventative action but also help relieve symptoms and speed recovery. Elderberries Bursting with brightly coloured pigments that act as natural antioxidants, elderberries are a natural source of vitamin C. Sipping on herbal tea is a fantastic way of incorporating these two ingredients into your day-to-day lives. Our [Pukka Herbs Organic Elderberry and Echinacea tea](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/nl/nl/products/elderberry-and-echinacea) is packed with antioxidants to reduce stress and fight infections. Vitamin C Well-known for supporting our immune function, vitamic Cplays an important role in allowing our immune system to communicate and co-ordinate a response. Andrographis Andrographis is traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to promote the production of antibodies and reduce the severity of infection. Pukka Herbs recently worked with the University of Southampton on a clinical trial to prescribe andrographis - to reduce and shorten symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections - to NHS patients in GP surgeries across the UK. Mushrooms There are approximately 400 species of fungi that have been identified with medicinal properties, and many have antiviral, antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory qualities. Mushrooms can be easily added into your diet through daily doses of supplements such as Pukka's Mushroom Gold capsules.
