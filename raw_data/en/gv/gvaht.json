Not only have Black-owned businesses historically had a [harder time accessing loans and capital](https://siepr.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/17-003.pdf), but they've also been disproportionately impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

In response, both individuals and brands have worked tirelessly to help elevate Black-owned businesses and give them the funding, recognition, and shelf space they deserve. For example, in 2020, Brother Vellies founder [Aurora James](https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/a43840231/fashion-designer-aurora-james-book-wildflower-interview/) launched the [Fifteen Percent Pledge](https://www.15percentpledge.org/), a nonprofit that was one of the first to call on large retailers to stock 15 percent of their inventory from Black-owned businesses. Since then, places have all gotten on board. With just one purchase, you can take these efforts a step further\u2014and play a part in helping to create lasting change. Here, we've rounded up a selection of 55 Black-owned businesses online that the team here at Oprah Daily recommends\u2014including in the [beauty](https://www.oprahdaily.com/beauty/skin-makeup/g29549312/best-black-owned-makeup-brands/), food and drink, [fashion](https://www.oprahdaily.com/style/a35191214/black-owned-clothing-brands/), and home decor categories.
