I was immediately blown away by the vast array of over 80 varieties of organic healing plants and food orchards... ...along with a team of incredibly knowledgeable herbalists and gardeners; a closed-loop vermiculture feeding system teas, tinctures, hydrosols, salves, honey, capsules, and more). Everything is done by hand at the Farmacy, including brewing homemade fertilizers from the plants they grow. They seed, propagate, plant, hand-harvest, artisanally-craft, and package all the herbal products they grow right on the farm. The fresh and pure nature of the herbs ensures high quality, potent, consistent, and effective plant medicine straight from the source. Since that visit two years ago, if you've been following me on Instagram and elsewhere, you've seen me using ample amounts of [Kauai Farmacy](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/kauaifarmacy) powders and tinctures in my recipes, along with products such as their salves and hydrosols for joint and skin health. Rooted in the wisdom of Hawaiian La'au lapa'au, Ayurveda, Chinese medicine, and the tribal indigenous, the potent herbal plant medicines harvested from the rich, volcanic soil of Kauai just seem to have a very unique and special energy. After graduating from the University of Michigan, Doug pursued a ten-year career in private equity finance in Connecticut. Before moving his family to Hawaii in 2007, Doug published [The New Game](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/new-game), an economic theory and strategy for sustainable communities. Doug co-founded [Kauai Farmacy](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/kauaifarmacy) in 2010 with his wife Genna, and they currently live there with their three kids. [The Farmacy](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/kauaifarmacy) is a seed-to-cup tropical herbal oasis spanning four acres and consisting of what may be the most diverse collection of plant medicine in the western hemisphere. After spending the last 10 years experiencing the power of fresh plant medicine for both himself and his family on a daily basis, Doug thrives on a high-fat, ketogenic, 100% raw-food diet. Doug believes [Kauai Farmacy's](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/kauaifarmacy) vertically-integrated herbal medicine model is a budding example of what needs to be the future of a more sustainable, preventative-care-focused healthcare industry.
