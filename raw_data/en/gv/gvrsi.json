However, genetic abnormalities together with environmental factors sometimes cause a breach in the tolerance checkpoints causing \"Autoimmunity\"- an inappropriate, unnecessary immune response to self-antigens. Autoimmunity affects young adults, especially women and is characterized by excessive inflammation and autoantibody production causing damage to various organ systems. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the pathobiology of cellular and molecular pathways which regulate inflammation and antibody production- for better and targeted therapeutic interventions. To delineate these mechanisms, we used several experimental mouse models of a prototype autoimmune disorder, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), where autoantibodies develop against self-nucleic acids like DNA/RNA and associated proteins. We found that the activation of toll-like receptors (TLR) -7 and -9 are essential for the formation of autoantibodies in lupus. Moreover, we found that an extracellular endonuclease, DNase1L3, renders TAM-receptor tyrosine kinases on myeloid cells is essential to prevent inflammation during cell death. Overall, the regulation of autoantigen availability and immunogenicity is essential to prevent autoreactive B cell activation and inflammation through TLRs. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| | (PTMs) of tubulin/microtubules can functionalize them for specific cellular processes such as mitosis, chromosome segregation, intracellular transport or cell organization. These PTMs on microtubules can affect their interactions with different MAPs (microtubule associated proteins) and motors; collectively known as the tubulin code hypothesis. Our current understanding of tubulin PTMs is derived from using specific antibodies, which severely limits the temporal information and application in live cell studies. To overcome this, we have deployed a yeast surface display library strategy to obtain binder proteins that recognize the commonly found tubulin PTMs epitopes. Here, I am presenting an alpha-tubulin tyrosination state-specific binder, termed as A1aY1, that binds at the carboxy-terminal tail (CTT) of alpha tubulin. The specificity and the affinity of the prospective binder were determined using structural biochemistry, cell biology methods. A fluorescently tagged binder was then introduced into mammalian cells as a microtubule tyrosination sensor and further validated that the sensor does not interfere with the cellular functions of microtubules. Our sensor can be employed as a nanobody to study microtubule functions in live cells using super-resolution microscopy. The tyrosination sensor, A1aY1, is superior to the known antibodies against tubulin PTMs and previously known ScFv (2G4C) for live cell studies as the tyrosination sensor is specific in detecting only pure tyrosinated microtubules. Later with our tyrosination sensor, we followed vincristine induced depolymerization events of unmodified (tyrosinated) in real time, and found each distinctly perturbs microtubule polymer. Together, our work describes the robustness of the tyrosination sensor and its potential applications to study microtubule and PTM processes in living cells. Thus, this study for the first time allows studying spatial as well as the temporal organization of tyrosinated microtubules, which can be extended to study other tubulin-PTMs. Kesarwani, S., Lama, P., S., Bodakuntla, S., Das, R., and Sirajuddin, M. \"Genetically Encoded Live-Cell Sensor for Tyrosinated Microtubules.\" The Journal of Cell Biology, vol. 219, no. 10 (October 5, 2020).

In their natural niches, bacteria often encounter harsh conditions primarily lacking carbon, phosphate, and nitrogen sources, along with competition from co-existing microorganisms (4,5). It is thought that the bacterial genome is shaped by feast and famine regimes, signifying long periods of starvation interjected with short spikes of nutrient abundance (6,8). The genetic strategies employed for adaptation under these complex conditions could not be well-studied with long-term evolutionary experiments where the bacteria is passaged under exponential growth via serial passaging (9,10). Saturated cultures of E. coli in rich media can self-sustain for prolonged periods without the requirement of externally supplied resources in a phase called the long-term stationary phase (LTSP) (11). We have applied the adaptive laboratory evolution paradigm to starved cultures of Escherichia coli to explore their gene regulation and adaptation in the prolonged stationary phase. Initially, isogenic inoculum is known to diversify in terms of genotype and phenotype when propagated under prolonged starvation (5). Different subpopulations compete with each other for physical space and resources in the spent media. Mutants isolated from LTSP often exhibit transient competitive advantage when competed with their parent strains in nutrient-depleted/spent media. This phenotype is termed as growth advantage in stationary phase or GASP (11). It is a well-studied phenomenon and multiple mutations have been reported to confer GASP to its bearer (12,14). One of the most commonly observed GASP mutations is rpoS819 - a 46-base pair duplication in the rpoS gene, which codes for the stationary phase sigma factor- a crucial transcription factor in E. coli regulating stress-response pathways. This mutation attenuates the function of rpoS and is known to emerge in a wild-type background after 10 days of evolution in LTSP. To identify additional, novel fitness peaks in LTSP we evolved replicates of the GASP-adapted variants of E. coli - ZK819 in rich media under the LTSP paradigm for two months (15). Across this period we observed the emergence of different colony morphologies, amongst which we decided to describe the characteristics of a slow-growing, small-colony forming variant referred henceforth as \"small-colony\" or SC variant (due to its small colony-size compared to its ancestors on a solid nutrient agar plate) (16). This mutant exhibited a slow growth rate, increased tolerance to the beta-lactam class of antibiotics, and transient fitness over the ancestor strain when competed in 10-day old media. Using whole-genome sequencing, we identified a unique mutation in SC that causes the slow growth phenotype observed in SC. This was a point mutation in rpoC coding for the '-subunit of the RNA polymerase rpoCA494V. The competitive fitness conferred by rpoCA494V, however, seemed to depend on the rpoS status in the background. Manually curated rpoCA494V-bearing strains were able to exhibit competitive fitness over rpoCWT only when co-occurring with rpoS819. We investigated the global gene expression patterns in rpoCA494V containing strains in different backgrounds via whole-transcriptome sequencing and observed that stress response-related genes are up-regulated in backgrounds where rpoCA494V was present along with rpoS819. The SC strain natively harbors rpoS+92 allele, a novel mutation of rpoS resulting in the increase of its expression to wild-type levels. We further probed the mechanistic basis of rpoCA494V mutation to understand its effect on the genotype and adaptive fitness. We found that the mutated RNA polymerase exhibited altered transcription kinetics compared to the wild-type polymerase. We hypothesize that the slow-down of transcription can directly cause a reduction in growth and indirectly mount a growth advantage when complemented by reduced rpoS expression. To check the repeatability of the emergence of SC variants under prolonged starvation, we re-iterated the evolution experiment in LTSP keeping the same conditions and ancestor as the initial evolution experiment, but with a higher number of replicates. Across 11 evolving lines from this experiment, we observed the emergence of SC variants in four lines after three weeks of starvation. The whole-genome sequence of these SC mutant colonies revealed unique mutations in various regulatory genes but not in the rpo operon. Using next-generation sequencing and molecular biology we show that LTSP presents a unique evolution paradigm where regulatory mutations fine-tuning the trade-off between rapid growth and self-preservation are continuously selected, which results in the repeated emergence of slow-growing variants, albeit through different genetic routes.
