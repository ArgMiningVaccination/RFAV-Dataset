It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person, and does not operate to bind FDA or the public). Import Alert # 66-41 Published Date: 09/06/2023 Type: DWPE Import Alert Name: Detention Without Physical Examination of Unapproved New Drugs Promoted In The U.S. Reason for Alert: The revision of this Import Alert (IA) dated 12/30/2022 updates the guidance section. Changes to the import alert are bracketed by asterisks (***) Unapproved new drugs present public health and safety risks because they have not been reviewed by FDA for safety or effectiveness. Without FDA review, there is no way to know if these drugs are safe and effective for their intended use, whether they are manufactured in a way that ensures consistent drug quality, or whether their labels are complete and accurate. Unapproved new drugs have resulted in patient harm, and the agency works to protect patients from the risks posed by these drugs. In part, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) defines \"drug\" as (B) articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and (C) articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals; and (D) articles intended for use as a component of any article specified in clause (B) or (C). Under section 201 (p) of the FD&C Act, a drug is a new drug if it \"is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof\" (i.e., not GRAS/E). Further, under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, a drug that is so recognized is still a new drug if it has not been used to a material extent or for a material time under such conditions. In general, \"new drugs\" may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), unless they are nonprescription drugs governed by and lawfully marketed under section 505G of the FD&C Act. Guidance: Divisions may detain without physical examination (DWPE), shipments of the unapproved new drugs listed in the Red List of this Import Alert. . ***Personal Importation Shipments: ***Commercial or promotional shipments, and products subject to DWPE are generally not amenable to the use of enforcement discretion as indicated in RPM Chapter 9-2,: \"Coverage of Personal Importations\", available at https://www.fda.gov/media/71776/download. *** Release of Articles Subject to Detention without Physical Examination Under this Import Alert: *** In order to secure release of an individual shipment subject to detention without physical examination under this import alert, the owner, consignee and/or another responsible party ***for the affected goods should*** provide evidence that the shipment does not contain unapproved new drug products. Removal from Detention Without Physical Examination (REMOVE FROM RED LIST): ***In order to remove a firm's product from the Red List, information should be provided to the Agency to adequately demonstrate that the firm has resolved the condition that gave rise to the appearance of the violation. The purpose of this is so that the Agency will have*** confidence that future entries will be in compliance with the FD&C Act. This may require five consecutive non-violative commercial shipments to confirm the effectiveness of any corrective actions. For guidance on removal from detention without physical examination, refer to FDA's Regulatory Procedures Manual, Chapter 9-8, \"Detention Without Physical Examination (DWPE),\". If a firm and/or a representative thereof would like to petition for removal from detention without physical examination under this Import Alert, all relevant information supporting the request should be forwarded to the following address: Food and Drug Administration Division of Import Operations 12420 Parklawn Drive, ELEM-3109 Rockville, MD 20857 Or, be sent via email to: Importalerts2@fda.hhs.gov. Questions or issues involving import operations should be addressed to ORA/DIO at (301) 796-0356 or FDAImportsInquiry@fda.hhs.gov. Questions or issues involving compliance of imported drug products should be addressed to the CDER Imports Compliance Branch at CDERImports@fda.hhs.gov. Product Description: Unapproved new drugs Charge: The article is subject to refusal of admission pursuant to section 801(a)(3) in that it appears to be a new drug within the meaning of Section 201(p) without an approved New Drug Application (NDA).

Date Published: 03/21/2020 Desc: PT 141 Peptide Notes: The product appears to be an unapproved new drug, drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1) because it is an article (other than food) intended to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease in man and/or to affect the structure or function of the body. Examples of claims observed on the firm's social media website that establish the intended use of \"PT-141\" include, but may not be limited to, the following: On the CanLab Research Facebook social media account, on June 24, 2019, the firm posted a chromatogram report under the heading \"PT-141: 98.24%.\" In the comments to the post, various commenters discuss how they use the product. A commenter named Joel Grotrian asked \"May i (sic) ask what this means and what this peptide does?\" and a commenter named Michael Shofield replied \"[I]t will give you a hard-on for an entire day.\" Jean-Francois Tremblay, who is identified as the President of CanLab Research in the entry documents, replied to the conversation that \"Often, 1 mg will do.\" When a commenter asked \"Jean-Francois Tremblay is subQ the only way to administer or is there another option for my wife?,\" Jean-Francois Tremblay replied \"intranasal works, but at much higher dose\" and posts a link to a journal article about the use of PT-141 for erectile dysfunction. \"PT-141\" is also a new drug under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p) because this product is not generally recognized as safe and effective under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling. Under section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, a new drug may not be legally marketed in the United States without an FDA-approved application. FDA approves a new drug based on scientific data submitted by a drug sponsor to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective. There is no FDA-approved application in effect for \"PT-141.\" CANUSA Health Group Date Published : 09/13/2019 865 Brawley Road West , Whitby, ON CANADA 60 V - - 99 Suppressor N.E.C.

Specifically, this product is intended for the treatment of one more diseases, including rashes caused by scabies.; Therefore, this product appears to be a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p) because this product is not generally recognized as safe and effective under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in the labeling. According to section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), a drug is misbranded if, among other things, it fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use. \"Adequate directions for use\" are directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined by section 503(b)(1)(A), of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A), can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. \"Tetmosol Medicated Soap\" is intended for the treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Thus, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use this product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, the labeling for \"Tetmosol Medicated Soap\" fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act.
