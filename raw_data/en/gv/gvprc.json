Methods: Qualitative analysis of all N, N-DMT experiences posted to the r/DMT Reddit community over a 10-year period from 2009-2018. Results: A total of 3778 experiences from 3305 posts were included in this study. A median dose of N, N- DMT of 40.0 mg [interquartile range (IQR), 27.5 to 50.0] and a median experience duration of 10 minutes (IQR, 5.0 to 15.0) were identi\u0000ed. The most common somatic (n=1231, 32.5%) and vivid colours (n=953, 25.2%). Entity encounters occurred in 45.5% (n=1719) of the experiences and involved predominantly a Entity interactions were predominantly positive (n=600, 34.9% of encounters) involving benevolent, comforting, protecting, or outwardly caring interactions. A companion-type, pedagogical, or guide-type interaction was identi\u0000ed 32.4% of encounters (n=557). Common typology, architectural, and structural features of the \"DMT world\" were descriptions of alternate or higher (n=390, 10.3%). Features of mystical and ego-dissolution experiences were common and additional rewarding aspects were reported, including familiarity and acceptance/removal of the fear of death. Challenging and di\u0000cult responses were less frequent but also documented. Statements of profundity were identi\u0000ed in 232 experiences (6.1%), including pronouncing the experience or an aspect of the experience as the most \"beautiful\" or feeling the most \"beautiful\" of their life (n=47, 1.2%). Conclusion: This study identi\u0000ed common phenomenological themes and content of naturalistic inhaled N, N-DMT experiences. Major thematic domains included (1) physical and somatic experiences; (2) content of visualizations and imagery; (3) entity encounters including entity phenotype, descriptors, attributes, disposition, and characteristics of the interaction; (4) typology, architectural features, structural characteristics, and scenery of the \"DMT world\"; (5) emotional responses (including positive, rewarding, di\u0000cult, and challenging); and (6) statements of profundity. Introduction N, N-Dimethyltryptamine (N, N-DMT) is a naturally occurring classic psychedelic with psychoactive properties that are mediated primarily via the serotonergic pathway and serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor agonism 1. Plant-based DMT has been used for centuries for ritual healing ceremonies and spiritual practices 2-5. Early reports of DMT-use derive from indigenous communities in the Amazon-basin andPage 3/48involve the oral consumption of Ayahuasca 3,4,6-8, which is a Quechua term translated to \"vine of the souls\" or \"vine of the dead\" 9. N, N-Dimethyltryptamine is typically orally inactive due to a deamination process facilitated by visceral monoamine oxidase enzymes 8. The technology of the Ayahuasca brew orally activates the plant DMT alkaloids by combining them with plants a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) nasal, and per-rectum reduce \u0000rst pass effect resulting in an increase in bioavailability, a more rapid onset, and shorter duration of effect compared to oral administration 10. Using data from the Global Drug Survey (an anonymous online global survey; n=22289), Winstock et al. observed that overall lifetime use of DMT was relatively low (8.9%) and the predominant reported route of administration amongst individuals who used DMT was inhaled (92.2%)11. Early but growing efforts are attempting to characterize the phenomenological experience following exogenous DMT administration 2,5,16-30. Common and 2; increased noesis (ascertaining direct or knowledge) 31,32; alterations in consciousness and the sense-of-self 2,17,21; vivid imagery and perceptual changes 16,24; emotional effects 16; death and rebirth;2 the divine, spirituality, and religiosity 2,21; and encounters with autonomous entities and beings 5,27. The early understanding of the DMT experience was largely supported by editorial, non-peer-reviewed, or popular science publications and reports 2,24,25,33-35. However, recent efforts have been undertaken to substantiate these works with more rigorous systematic methodologies 2,16,17,19,21,27,36, with few studies speci\u0000cally examining inhaled-DMT 21,27,37. In one of the earliest peer-reviewed studies on the subjective effects of DMT, Strassman et al. conducted a unblinded followed by a double-blind randomized controlled trial of intravenous DMT-fumarate in twelve volunteers 16. A signi\u0000cant dose-response effect of DMT was observed in all six domains of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS) including: somaesthesia, affect, perception, cognition, volition, and intensity 16,33,38. To note, the HRS was developed through interviews with individuals experienced with inhaled DMT 16. Benny Shanon explored the subjective and perceptual effects of 245 Ayahuasca experiences, including 67 of his own experiences 2. Shanon identi\u0000ed common patterns and attempted to \"draw a map\" of the Ayahuasca experience incorporating themes including, but not limited to, general effects; open-eye visuals; structural typology; the contents and themes of visions; non-visual perceptions; and consciousness 2. Cott and Rock conducted a survey-based method in 19 DMT users and documented 9 themes that captured the essential aspects of the DMT-induced state following \"ingestion\", including hallucinations; entering other distortions; ineffability; intensity; spirituality and learning truths; distortions in sense of time, space, and self; and familiarity 19.Page 4/48In a retrospective survey-based study, Gri\u0000ths et al. examined the single most memorable \"God encounter experience\" in individuals who used N, N-DMT (n = 606) and Ayahuasca (n = 435) 21. A total of 73% and 65% of the N, N-DMT and Ayahuasca experiences, respectively, ful\u0000lled criteria of a complete mystical experience and a large proportion of both cohorts rated the experience as among the most personally meaningful and spiritually signi\u0000cant lifetime experiences 21. Davis et al. systematically studied the account of the single most memorable entity encounter after inhaled N, N-DMT use in 2561 individuals 27. Almost all of the individuals in this study reported an emotional response to the encounter to which profound and enduring ontological changes in worldview were attributed 27. Timmermann et al. conducted a \u0000xed-order, placebo controlled, single blind intravenous DMT administration study in 13 participants and established that DMT induced consistent visual, somatic, emotional, and 'higher-level' metacognitive effects; 14 and noted similarities between DMT experiences and Near Death Experiences (NDE) 17. More recently, Michael et al. performed a thematic analysis from semi-structure interviews of 36 inhaled naturalistic DMT experiences (dose 40-75 mg) 30. The most prominent theme from this study involved an encounter with \"sentient entities that were experienced as beyond\", occurring in 94% of the experiences 30. The shared qualities amongst DMT and certain non-drug induced states 17,18,21,27, in concurrence with the growing evidence of an endogenous mammalian source of DMT 39,40, has led to the increasingly accepted hypothesis that endogenous DMT may be responsible for non-drug induced alternate states of consciousness 17,21,27. However, it is not clear that endogenous DMT release occurs in su\u0000cient concentrations or with su\u0000cient selectivity to produce pharmacological effects 41,42. There currently exists a paucity of knowledge describing how psychedelics are used in naturalistic settings in Western societies 43. A greater understanding of the patterns of use of inhaled N, N-DMT in naturalistic settings and the broader user population will aid in the explication of the expanding research \u0000ndings 43. Inhaled N, N-DMT sometimes occasions profound \"ontological shock\" experiences prompting a reconsideration of the very nature of reality, and such experiences are associated with enduring positive changes in attitudes, moods and behavior 5,27. Given the unusual and consequential nature of these experiences, the current study sought to provide new information about the phenomenology and content of inhaled N, N-DMT experiences by systematically analyzing thousands of N, N-DMT experience reports from online postings over a 10-year period. A greater understanding of the inhaled N, N-DMT experience is critical to further our understanding of this substance's properties. Such learnings could inform current and future research and therapeutic applications in the management of central nervous system and mental health conditions, and, potentially, catalyze interest in and insights into broader ontological questions pertaining consciousness and the human psyche 21,27,41,44. Materials And Methods Data Source and CollectionPage 5/48All posts to the \"DMT\" community page (\"r/DMT\") on Reddit from database inception in 2009 through to 2018 inclusive (10 years), were screened for inclusion in this study. Reddit is an online social network, news aggregator, and host of forums for communities with common interests to share, discuss, and comment on a topic 45,46. Data from Reddit has been aggregated previously to inform peer-reviewed research 46-48. The r/DMT community is a public forum for the discussion and sharing of information pertaining to DMT and is a rich community-based open-access resource, which includes individuals describing experiences with DMT use. Archived posts to the r/DMT community were accessed via Pushshift: a big-data storage project, comprehensive search engine, and real-time analytics tracker for the website Reddit 49. At the time of this study, Pushshift met the standards for the terms of use of the Reddit application programming interface (API). The title of all posts to the r/DMT community within the study period were manually screened and included for full post review if the post had the potential to include a self-reported N, N-DMT experience (see \u0000gure 1). All relevant posts that were identi\u0000ed after the initial title-screen underwent full independent manual review to assess candidacy for \u0000nal study inclusion. Posts were included within the \u0000nal study cohort if the post included a \u0000rsthand description of any aspect of an inhaled N, N-DMT experience. Posts were excluded based on the following criteria: (1) the route of administration was not inhaled (i.e., oral, intravenous, intramuscular, rectal, or intra-nasal); (2) the excluded); (3) the post solely referenced or linked to an external website, video, audio \u0000le, or image; (4) the post failed to describe any experience or subjective response to N, N-DMT; (5) the post was non- English; or (6) the post was a duplicate or deleted. To note, no posts were excluded for being non-English. Non-English posts were identi\u0000ed but all contained enough information to be excluded based on alternate criteria (i.e., only included a link, image, and/or video). Therefore, zero experiences were excluded for being non-English. All plant-based accompaniments (i.e., Changa, enhanced leaf, and joints or spliffs) were included in this study. Plant-based accompaniments are largely used to improve to vaporization yield and reduce burning the crystalline N, N-DMT, although it is recognized that Changa also includes MAOI-containing plants. Multiple unique N, N-DMT experiences reported within a single post coded as independent and separate experiences. [INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE] Figure 1. PRISMA \u0000ow diagram for screening and selection of r/DMT posts. ROA, route of administration Content Analysis, Statistics, and Research Ethics All included posts and experiences underwent independent full manual review. The following data were systematically collected for all posts: month and year of posting, Reddit author username, title, and word count. The following data were systematically collected for all experiences: age at time of experience,Page 6/48author gender, previous inhaled N, N-DMT use, previous psychedelic use, data pertaining to the setting of the experience, plant source used for DMT extraction, the device used for administration, the reported N, N-DMT dose and number of inhalations, the duration of experience, and concomitant psychoactive substance use. A grounded theory inductive qualitative analytic coding approach was used for all included experiences using NVivo 12 (12.6.0) 50. Independent meaningful units (MU) were coded and organized into categorical themes 50,51. Opportunity for code review, MU development, and thematic development were afforded to four authors (DWL, RCH, CT, and RG) after the completion of the coding of 50, 300, and 1000 experiences. The following thematic categories were developed: (1) physical and somatic experiences; (2) content of visualizations and imagery; (3) entity encounters including entity phenotype, descriptors, attributes, disposition, and characteristics of the interaction; (4) typology, architectural features, structural characteristics, and scenery of the \"DMT world\"; (5) emotional responses (including positive, rewarding, di\u0000cult, and challenging); and (6) statements of profundity. To note, both the prevalence of MU's and thematic categories were reported as a percentage of the overall study sample to improve the transparency of the reporting of the prevalence of the MU's overall, not just as a proportion of the imposed themes. Additionally, four validated scales for documenting cardinal aspects of the psychedelic experience were completed, including the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) 52,53, Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) 54, God Encounter Questionnaire (GEQ)21, and Ego-Dissolution Inventory (EDI)55,56. The MEQ, CEQ, and EDI were completed for all experiences while the GEQ was completed for all reported entity encounters 27. The presence of identi\u0000ed questionnaire items within the experiences was coded and the percentage of experiences endorsing a questionnaire item was reported. To note, the included questionnaires are validated for self-report and not for third-party assessment. However, due to the relative novelty of this \u0000eld of study and the paucity of validate scales, we felt the application of these questionnaires in this study was still appropriate to facilitate and structure the analysis of the respective features occasioned by DMT. Statements of profundity were coded and de\u0000ned as endorsements pronouncing the experience or an aspect of the experience as \"the most [X] experience of my life\" or \"...the most [X] I have felt in my life...\"; where [X] was coded as the descriptor. For statements that include multiple descriptors, the order in which the descriptor appeared within a statement was also coded. Institutional REB approval for human research protocols (protocol number 39101) was obtained for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of the data and content included within this study. Data Availability All requests for raw and analyzed data and materials are promptly reviewed by D.W.L (chief investigator and principal investigator). All data are anonymized and NVIVO source data with meaningful coded unitsPage 7/48are provided with this paper (see supplemental tables 1 through 5). Results A total of 30652 r/DMT reddit posts were identi\u0000ed and screened over the 10-year period from 2009-2018, of which 3305 posts containing 3778 unique inhaled N, N-DMT experiences were included in this study (see \u0000gure 1). Two-thousand nine-hundred and thirty-four posts (88.8%) included a report of a single experience, 297 posts (9.0%) included two experiences, and 74 posts (2.2%) included 3 or more experiences. The included 3305 posts were created by 2277 Reddit authors, with a median age at the time of the N, N- DMT experience of 23.0 years [interquartile range (IQR), 20.0 to 29.8; reported in 118 experiences (3.1%)], and a median word count of 311 (IQR, 160.0 to 568.0; see table 1). The gender of the author was identi\u0000ed in 237 experiences (6.3%), including 189 males (5.0%) and 48 females (1.3%). The location in which the experience occurred was reported in 1138 experiences (30.1%), of which the location was most frequently inside (n=969, 25.6%) within a bedroom or living room (n=492, 13.0%); while 169 experiences (4.5%) were reported as occurring outside. Music was reportedly used in 408 experiences (10.8%) and the presence or absence of a sitter was identi\u0000ed in 948 experiences (25.1%); of which 157 experiences (4.1%) were completed alone. [INSERT TABLE 1 HERE] A median reported N, N-DMT dose of 40.0 mg (IQR, 27.5 to 50.0) with a median of 3.0 inhalations (IQR, 2.0 to 3.0) per experience were reported in 1347 (35.7%) and 1087 (28.8%) of the experiences, respectively. The plant source of the N, N-DMT was identi\u0000ed in 129 experiences (3.4%), including 95 (2.5%) experiences involving N, N-DMT extracted from and 34 A pipe or glass-pipe (n=598, 15.9%) was the most frequent reported device used to administer the N, N-DMT. Identi\u0000ed plant-based material accompaniments included the \"sandwich method\" (containing the DMT between other plants to avoid losing intake due to vaporization produced by directly burning the substance; median experience duration, estimated from 538 experiences (14.2%), was 10 minutes (IQR, 5.0 to 15.0). No previous inhaled N, N-DMT experience (i.e., \u0000rst time-use during the index experience) and one previous inhaled DMT experience were identi\u0000ed in 1008 experiences (26.6%) and 324 experiences (8.6%), respectively (see table 1). Seventy-six experiences (2.0%) involved the Reddit authors reporting no previous psychedelic use prior to the index experience. Previous experience with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was most frequently note, a separate analysis of the data was conducted excluding experiences with reported concomitant psychoactivePage 8/48substance use. No differences in the distribution of codes or themes were identi\u0000ed in experiences with concomitant psychoactive substance use excluded (see tables 1 through 9). Physical and Somatic Experiences Somaesthesias (i.e., bodily sensations or kinesthetic hallucinations) were identi\u0000ed in 1415 experiences (37.5%) including a body vibration, buzz, or tingling (n=1026, 27.2%); body \"high\" (n=180, 4.8%; see table 2).

Reddit authors most frequently pronounced the experience or an aspect of the experience as the most \"beautiful\" or feeling the most \"beautiful\" of their life (n=47, single descriptor were identi\u0000ed in 156 experiences. [INSERT FIGURE 3 HERE] Figure 3. Heat map of the frequency of statements of profundity (\"...most [X] experience of my life...\" or \"... the most [X] I have felt in my life...\", where [X] is a descriptor theme or themes). The total column represents the frequency a theme was coded. For statements that include multiple descriptors, the order in which the themes appear within a statement is indicated: \u0000rst order column (i.e., the descriptor appears \u0000rst within the statement or alone), second order row (i.e., the descriptor appears second within the statement), and third or fourth order column. The frequency in which \u0000rst order and second order descriptors appear jointly is highlighted at the intersection of those themes. Dual descriptors within a statement of profundity were identi\u0000ed in 43 experiences, of which the most common descriptors reported concurrently were \"beautiful\" and \"intense or scared\" and \"amazing\" (n=6w). Discussion This study conducted a qualitative analysis of naturalistic inhaled N, N-DMT experiences and documented consistent phenomenological thematic patterns, particularly within the domains of (1) physical and somatic experiences; (2) content of visualizations and imagery; (3) entity encounters including entity phenotype, descriptors, attributes, disposition, and characteristics of the interaction; (4) typology, architectural features, structural characteristics, and scenery of the \"DMT world\"; (5) emotional responses (including positive, rewarding, di\u0000cult, and challenging); and (6) statements of profundity. The results of this study contribute to the limited descriptive information about inhaled N, N-DMT use and the entailing experience 11,30,43. This study identi\u0000ed a reported median dose of inhaled N, N-DMT of 40 mg and duration of experience of 10 minutes. This is consistent with a previous study conducted in a natural setting which documented an average inhaled N, N-DMT dosage of 40 mg, which induced changes in subjective and neural markers that returned to baseline after approximately 7 minutes 37. Additionally, the naturalistic study conducted by Michael et al. reported a similar mean dose of inhaled DMT of 54.5 mg 30. Somatic and physical responses to N, N-DMT administration were commonly observed in this study, most frequently the perception of somaesthesias, or kinesthetic hallucinations, and an auditory ringing sound; both of which have been previously ascribed to the DMT experience 16,19,20,26. Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. documented auditory hallucinations rings\") inPage 16/482 out of 12 subjects (16.7%) who completed a high dose intravenous DMT session, which is a comparable incidence rate identi\u0000ed within this study (15.4%)26. Strassman et al. documented a high- pitched \"whining/whirring\", \"chattering,\" \"crinkling\" sound in approximately half of the subjects at the onset of intravenous DMT administration 16. The features of the N, N-DMT-induced visualizations identi\u0000ed in this study most frequently involved the description of fractals, geometric shapes, and patterns (including descriptions of kaleidoscopes, a chrysanthemum, sacred geometry, and mandalas) and vivid, brilliant, and novel colours. Previous observations of DMT-occasioned visualizations include similar descriptions 16,19,23,26. Strassman et al. reported that following intravenous administration of DMT \"many subjects described kaleidoscopic geometric patterns that were not obviously representational\" 16, while Cott and Rock concluded that \"colours, patterns, and lights were one of two common visual hallucinations\" 19. Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. observed that visual hallucinations consisting of \"complex geometric patterns\" occurred in all volunteers after receiving a high dose of intravenous DMT, although these phenomena were recorded in only a subset of volunteers following a low dose 26. Additionally, Meyer relies on \"vivid, brilliantly colored, geometric visual hallucinations\" as a qualifying criterium when de\u0000ning a particular \"level\" of DMT experience 23. Various theories have been proposed to explain the predictable DMT occasioned visual experiences from a neurophysiologic perspective. Entoptic phenomena, de\u0000ned as visual effects whose source is within the eye or visual system, can include grids or lattice patterns, parallel lines, dots or \u0000akes, zigzags or undulating lines, nested curves, and spirals 57,58. Entoptic phenomena featured prominently in some prehistoric art 58 and were shown to be increased after repeated Ayahuasca ingestion in naturalistic settings57. The prevalent geometric-type visualizations identi\u0000ed in this study are consistent with descriptions of entoptic phenomena. Based on phenomenological studies 59, Bressloff and colleagues developed a mathematic model suggesting that the geometrical visual hallucinations are determined by the patterns of connection between the retina the striate cortex and the neuronal network within the striate cortex 60. Furthermore, results from recent electroencephalography (EEG) studies and a broader understanding of the hierarchical nature of the visual system support the empirically informed hypothesis that (1) DMT reverses the inherently top-down hierarchy of visual system and (2) DMT-visions are interpretations of propagating activity up the visual hierarchy in a bottom-up manner 14,61. Dimethyltryptamine reproducibly (1) decreases involved in visual-sensory processing, resulting in cortical excitation in these regions 14,36,61-63, and (2) increases bottom-up forward travelling waves from occipital to frontal regions 36,61; both of which correlate with the intensity of the DMT-induced visualizations 36,61. One of the most salient and discussed features of the DMT experience is encounters with seemingly autonomous entities, consistent with previous DMT studies 2,27,30. In the current study, the most frequently reported encounters involved a Feminine archetype; followed by aliens, celestial beings; andPage 17/48extra-terrestrials; deities, divine beings, and demi-gods; entities (including reptilian and insectoid beings); beings (including machine elves); and the jester archetype. Shanon 2, Davis et al. 27, and Michael et al.30 identi\u0000ed analogous entity phenotypes in their studies examining Ayahuasca and inhaled N, N-DMT, respectively. In the present study, communication with entities was common (75%) and comparable to rates of communication documented by Davis et al. (84%) 27. Positive, benevolent, comforting, caring, and welcoming entity attributes and interactions were most frequently described consistent with previous reports 27. This study provides further recognition of a \"companion-type, pedagogical, or guide-type interaction\" and \"medical-type\" interaction 27. Timmermann et al. predicts that the dissolution of top-down cortical control over medial temporal lobe activity may explain the content of the DMT experience, including entity encounters 17,61,64-67. The psychedelic disruption of top-down dynamics 17,61,64-67 and examining psychedelic entity experiences from the perspective of evolutionary psychology and neurophenomenology has led to the theory that psychedelics may partially liberate innate modules facilitating the experience of entity encounters 5,68. Entity encounters cannot be dismissed as irrelevant hallucinations without substance or meaning, nor accepted as transcendent realities 5. Winkelman has identi\u0000ed patterns in DMT entity experiences that re\u0000ect innate operators and modules fundamental to mental processes including, but not limited to, social role inferences, agency attribution, intentionality, causality, and animacy detection 5. These patterns suggest that DMT is, in part, exposing innate human tendencies but further evidence is required to substantiate any ontological claims for these experiences 5,69. Pervasive and consistent themes were reported during N, N-DMT experiences included within this study and those in other studies of the DMT-state 2. These themes may be explained by the cultural experience and background of the authors or priming of the authors prior to the experience. Another theory to account for the pervasive themes revealed by the DMT-state is that the DMT-state is in part a probe into a collective unconscious. The collective unconscious, a term introduced by Carl Jung, consists of a repository of knowledge and imagery shared by all human beings due to a common ancestral experience 68. It is populated with archetypes, symbols, and instincts, which greatly in\u0000uence individual unconsciousness, states of mind, and behaviours 68. Jung, however, did not provide a clear ontological account for the archetypes and the collective unconscious 70,71. With advancements in neurophysiology and quantum physics, a theoretical approach called \"biogenic structuralism\" has been developed to ground Jung's archetypal psychology within a neurophysiologic and quantum framework 70,71. Particular attention has been placed on the relationship between the archetypes and \"neurognosis\", or the understanding of how the brain develops knowledge 70. It has been suggested that neurognosis and Jung's archetypes are related, both, to the structural organization of the brain during development and the pattern of total quantum neural network activity. Future approaches to study the DMT experience should attempt to understanding the ontological origin of prevalent themes from a neurophysiologic basis. basis 14,61,64,65,67.Page 18/48Similarities between near death experiences (NDE) and the psychedelic experience have been described, including transcendence of physical form, themes of death and dying, OBEs, tunnels, descriptions of bright lights, familiarity, sense of belonging, religiosity, experience with a void or unearthly realm, and interaction with presences or entities 2,16,17,19,21. These themes featured prominently within this study congruent with other studies describing the phenomenology and content of the DMT experience 2,16,17,21,27,33. Timmermann et al. directly investigated the relatable features of the DMT experience to NDE in a within-subject placebo-controlled study of 13 healthy volunteers 17. Signi\u0000cant correlations were observed between features of NDE following DMT administration compared to placebo. Moreover, a separate analysis was performed on volunteers who underwent an 'actual' NDE and demonstrated comparable NDE scores between an 'actual' NDE and the DMT state 17. The discovery of an endogenous mammalian source of DMT 39,40 and the similarities between the DMT state and non-drug-induced states, like NDE 17,21, support the hypothesis that DMT is responsible for inducing certain non-ordinary states of consciousness. However, to date, it has yet to be established that endogenous DMT concentrations and selectivity are commensurate with levels required to induce effects seen during the exogenous DMT state 41,42. Poor recall of a DMT experience is widely reported in anecdotal sources and N, N-DMT has been described to have \"a self-erasing mechanism\" 72; however, there are limited data documenting the frequency of this occurrence. The results of this study support these reports by documenting the prevalence of reported partial experience-amnesia, full experience-amnesia, and \"black outs.\" The amnestic mechanism of an N, N-DMT is unknown, however, may be similar to sleep dream amnesia and hypoactivation of the prefrontal cortex 73. Alternatively, the inherent highly unusual and overwhelming nature of the DMT experience and frequent resultant ontological shock may hinder the ability of the cortex to reconstruct the experience contributing to the reported amnestic properties of N, N-DMT. Although many features of the DMT experience identi\u0000ed in this study can be labelled as positive, the presence of negative or challenging responses to DMT inhalation were also documented and important to recognize. Approximately 30% of the DMT experiences reported a minimum of one item from the CEQ; predominantly items from the \"fear\" subsection, followed by \"grief\" and \"emotional and/or physical suffering\" subsections. Moreover, approximately 7% of authors reported features of ego-dissolution. Ego- dissolution, de\u0000ned as a compromised sense of self, can induce meaningful (i.e., a sense of unity or \"oceanic boundlessness\") but also negative outcomes (i.e., \"dread of ego dissolution\"), with potentially psychological destabilizing effects resulting from depersonalization and derealization.55,74,75 Overall, the negative and challenging responses to DMT ingestion should not be overlooked or underestimated. Further studies should attempt to identify individualized variables associated with a deleterious response to DMT-use. For example, this study did not capture information on the previous mental health diagnoses of the authors, which is a critical confounder to examine in future prospective studies. The methods within the con\u0000nes of this study attempted to limit the variability of the DMT product ingested within the included experiences. Only experiences reporting N, N-DMT, as de\u0000ned above, werePage 19/48included and experiences from other forms of DMT, including synthetic DMT and 5-MeO-DMT, were excluded. Moreover, a secondary analysis was conducted excluding experiences with reported concomitant psychoactive substance use. However, self-extraction of N, N-DMT from plant sources, such as Mimosa hostilis root bark and Acacia confusa root bark, is one of the predominant methods for obtaining N, N-DMT for naturalistic inhaled use.76 It should be noted that the different plant sources, in addition to variable methods of extraction, can lead to variability in the concentration of the N, N-DMT and pro\u0000le of other plant alkaloids in the consumed product, which may modulate the effects of the DMT.76,77 There are several limitations to this study. First, the naturalistic nature of not only the experience but the reporting in this study limited the ability to systematically collect data for all experience reports. This methodology allowed for the induction of novel themes and codes; however, this limits the ability to provide true incidence rates for the included variables and instead relies on rates of reported variables as a proxy for incidence. The limiting of the study population to Reddit users makes it likely nonrepresentative of DMT-users at large and may have introduced a selection bias not controlled for in the results. Moreover, previous reports on the Reddit platform may in\u0000uence the experiences and reporting of fellow Reddit users. This is evident through the recurrent invocation of speci\u0000c terminology and labels for otherwise novel phenomena (i.e., \"machine elves\"). Reddit users are also potentially more likely to post experiences that were interesting, meaningful, consequential, and/or positive which would bias the results of this study towards the inclusion of experiences that were more notable and/or favourable. Furthermore, this bias may be especially relevant for N, N-DMT due to the reported cases of amnesic episodes identi\u0000ed in this study and elsewhere 27. Adequate characterization of psychological experiences associated with N, N-DMT would require controlling for dosage and other elements that are known to in\u0000uence the experience, including the set, setting, and concurrent uses of other substances. Next, the scope of the study was limited to experiences that occurred while under the in\u0000uence of N, N- DMT and did not capture information pertaining to enduring effects (i.e., continuing or long-lasting). Enduring effects are valuable and can be positive or negative and should be systematically collected in future inhaled N, N-DMT studies 27. Although this study provides insight into the naturalistic inhaled DMT- use, detailed examination in a controlled settings is required to substantiate the themes and patterns identi\u0000ed here. Overall, this study contributes to the limited understanding the patterns of naturalistic inhaled N, N-DMT use and the descriptive phenomenological features of the N, N-DMT experience at-large.

The total column represents the frequency a theme was coded. For statements that include multiple descriptors, the order in which the themes appear within a statement is indicated: \u0000rst order column (i.e., the descriptor appears \u0000rst within the statement or alone), second order row (i.e., the descriptor appears second within the statement), and third or fourth order column. The frequency in which \u0000rst order and second order descriptors appear jointly is highlighted at the intersection of those themes.
