Scientific Family - Fabaceae (pea) Botany Kudzu is a fast-growing vine native to the subtropical regions of China and Japan, as well as some Pacific islands.( [Kudzu extract 1994](#8010311), [Penso 1980](#Penso.1980)) The plant consists of leaves (containing 3 broad oval leaflets), purple flowers, and curling tendril spikes.( [Chevalier 1996](#Chevalier.1996), [USDA 2022](#USDA.2022)) Kudzu has been used to control soil erosion due to its rapid vine growth and extensive root system. Since its introduction to the United States, kudzu has become well established and proliferates in moist southern regions, where it is now considered an invasive plant.( [Gulizia 2019](#Gulizia.2019)) History Kudzu was introduced to the United States in the late 1800s to control soil erosion.( [Lukas 2005](#15897719)) Although it is widely recognized as a ground cover and fodder crop in the Western world, kudzu also has a history of medicinal use in Asian cultures. Beginning in the sixth century BC, Chinese herbalists used the plant to prevent intoxication, reduce muscular pain, and treat measles.( [Chevalier 1996](#Chevalier.1996), [Xu 2005](#16361209)) Chemistry Numerous reports have identified chemical constituents in various plant parts isoflavone content compared with other isoflavone-containing herbs, with the dry root containing as plant.( [Arao 1997a](#9118450)) Analysis of performed.( [Rong 1998](#9646928)) in kudzu leaf has also been identification studies of kudzu have been performed.( [Kartmazova 1980](#7409122)) Uses and Pharmacology Alcohol use disorder The isoflavones daidzin, daidzein, and puerarin may help to suppress ethanol intake. Although the mechanism of action is not certain, inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase is thought to be a major factor in animal studies of the effects of kudzu on alcohol dependence have been reviewed, with plant constituents (daidzin, daidzein, puerarin) [Xu 2005](#16361209)) Clinical data Clinical trials evaluating the effects of kudzu on alcohol consumption provide conflicting results.( [Ulbricht 2015](#24848872)) In a study of 38 military veterans, 1.2 g of kudzu root extract administered twice daily for 1 month had no effect on alcohol consumption patterns or cravings.( [Shebek 2000](#10706235)) Another small study (N=14) conducted over a period of several weeks demonstrated a reduction in the number of beers and total volume consumed by heavy drinkers.( [Herbal treatment 2005](#16229064), [Lukas 2005](#15897719)) The amount of isoflavone present in the extracts used in these 2 trials likely differed, which may account for the inconsistent results.( [Lukas 2005](#15897719)) Several clinical studies available in the literature and conducted by the same pool of researchers demonstrate favorable effects of kudzu on moderate to heavy and in vitro data Animal and in vitro studies have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects of kudzu leaf and root extracts, as well as its active constituents puerarin and robinin. In a colitis mouse model, oral administration of puerarin reversed colonic shortening and spleen weight in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.01 for each) and significantly improved disease severity (P<0.05 at 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg doses; P<0.01 at a 50 mg/kg dose). Improvements were noted in antioxidant processes (ie, cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2], prostaglandin E2) via inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B and activation of necrosis factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathways, as well as via reductions in the activity and levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (ie, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha], [Jeon 2020](#31981944)) In mouse peritoneal macrophages, kudzu leaf extract was a more potent inhibitor of inflammatory proteins predominantly in kudzu leaves and not the roots, was found to inhibit interferon-gamma and iNOS production but not TNF-alpha, COX-2, or IL-6.( [Eom 2018](#29786649)) Antiviral activity Animal and in vitro data Puerarin administered to mice infected with influenza virus strain H1N1 significantly reduced lung inflammatory pathology and pulmonary enterovirus titer compared with untreated controls (P<0.01 each). Inflammatory lesions in the GI tract (ie, ileum, colon) were reduced, as were inflammatory cytokines (ie, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-7) in the Anti-HIV activity of kudzu vitro.( [Mediouni 2018](#30236131)) Ataxia In vitro data Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 common subtype among the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, results in cellular polyglutamine aggregates, which contribute to cellular dysfunction and death. In an SCA3 in vitro model, the constituents puerarin and daidzein derived from P. lobata suppressed this aggregation and the proapoptotic marker BCL-2-associated X protein, as well as restored ubiquitin-proteasome system function and enhanced cellular proteasome activity.( [Phang 2021](#33509239)) Cancer In vitro data A kudzu ethanolic extract has been evaluated for antiproliferative activity against breast, ovarian, and cervical cancer cell lines, with some components demonstrating cytotoxic activity.( [Jeon 2005](#15886524)) Cardiovascular effects Animal and in vitro data Kudzu has been examined for its effects on vascular smooth muscle tissue.( [Wang 1994](#8010117)) The main constituent, puerarin, has been found to inhibit endothelium-dependent contractions in mouse carotid arteries in a dose-dependent manner.( [Chen 2020](#32555127)) Kudzu has also been studied A patients with unstable angina pectoris who received puerarin injection as an adjunct to conventional therapy. Most of the 41 included studies (N=2,953) were conducted among Chinese populations, with small sample sizes. The meta-analysis reported improvements in angina pectoris incidence, electrocardiogram findings, nitroglycerin consumption, and plasma endothelin levels.( [Gao 2015](#26628941)) A small 12-week study (N=15) reported decreased blood pressure and enhanced plasma fibrinolytic activity with consumption of 1.5 g of P. tuberosa (each capsule contained 0.75 g of powder) twice a day for 12 weeks.( [Verma 2012](#24171260)) Cervical spondylosis Clinical data In a 15-day observational study enrolling 200 patients with cervical spondylosis, oral administration of a nanoparticle P. lobata targeted preparation (3 g added to 250 mL physiological saline once daily) for 15 days was associated with a significantly better cure rate (41%) and total effective rate (97%), as well as a lower incidence of adverse events (3%) compared with controls (12%, 78%, and 12%, respectively) (P<0.001 for efficacy; P<0.05 for adverse events). Effects were attributed partially to a beneficial shift in the composition and distribution of gut microbiota (P<0.05).( [Qin 2022](#35126618)) CNS effects Animal data In an Alzheimer rat model, puerarin alleviated beta-amyloid-induced cognitive dysfunction by maintaining neuroplasticity.( [Liu 2021](#33433542)) Puerarin has also demonstrated antidepressant effects in mice subjected to mild unpredictable stress; effects appeared to be due to improved gut microbiota diversity and composition.( [Song 2021](#34049088)) Diabetes Animal and in vitro data Isoflavones in P. lobata have demonstrated alpha-glucosidase-inhibitory effects in vitro. Other constituents (eg, puerarin) have resulted in increased glucose utilization in rat models.( [Hsu 2003](#12828463), [Wang 2017](#28343876)) In a study of mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, improvements in memory and cognitive function, as well as changes in acetylcholinesterase activity, were observed.( [Liu 2015](#26060502)) Estrogenic activity In vitro data The high isoflavone content of kudzu has prompted investigation of the potential estrogenic activity of kudzu extracts. In vitro experiments suggest that daidzein exhibits more potent estrogenic activity than daidzin or puerarin.( [Park 2006](#17142977)) In studies comparing estrogenic effects of legume extracts containing phytoestrogens, kudzu was more potent than red clover, soybean, mung, and alfalfa sprouts.( [Bou\u00e9 2003](#12670155)) In another study, P. was less effective than Pueraria mirifica or Mucana collettii, with no proliferation and a mild antiproliferation effect on the growth of MCF-7 cells observed.( [Cherdshewasart 2004](#15234761)) Clinical data In one trial of 25 menopausal females, a decrease in the number of hot flushes per day occurred when a multiple-ingredient preparation containing kudzu extract was used.( [Lukaczer 2005](#16189949)) However, in a larger trial (N=127), a P. lobata extract given daily for 3 months did not demonstrate positive effects on symptoms of menopause.( [Woo 2003](#12851519)) In another study in postmenopausal females with pelvic floor dysfunction (N=60), P. lobata root administration (one 0.33 g tablet [including 0.425 mg of isoflavones] per day) for 60 days prior to hysterectomy resulted in increased collagen and elastin content and less blood loss during surgery compared to controls.( [Yan 2016](#Yan.2016)) Hepatoprotective effects In vitro data In experimental studies in mouse and human cells investigating the hepatoprotective effects of puerarin and saponins, 1998](#9690342), [Hayashino 2005](#16269923)) Obesity In vitro data In an in vitro experiment, biochanin A demonstrated potential hypolipidemic activity via activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.( [Shen 2006](#16549448)) Clinical data The effects of kudzu flower (as Pueraria thomsonii extract) on obesity have been evaluated in a 12-week clinical trial (N=81). Reductions in body mass index and visceral (but not subcutaneous) fat were demonstrated.( [Kamiya 2012](#22878195)) Osteogenic activity In vitro data In an in vitro study of a Radix puerariae (kudzu root) extract, an increase in the synthesis of alkaline phosphatase in human osteoblast cells was observed.( Animal data Puerarin protected against gentamicin-induced ototoxicity in mice, as demonstrated by significant improvements in the auditory brainstem response thresholds as well as surviving outer and inner cochlear hair cells compared with untreated controls (P<0.01 for each). In vitro experiments indicated the effects were related to improved antioxidant activity, protective effects on the mitochondrial membrane, and reduction in apoptosis.( [Niu 2021](#34651662)) Dosing In one pharmacokinetic profile study, the isoflavone puerarin was rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak levels in 2 hours.( [Penetar 2006](#16884345)) Isoflavone content varies widely among commercial kudzu preparations, with most containing less than 1%.( [Lukas 2005](#15897719)) Cervical spondylosis In a 15-day observational study of patients with cervical spondylosis, oral administration of a nanoparticle P. lobata targeted preparation (3 g added to 250 mL physiological saline once daily) for 15 days was evaluated for effects on clinical symptoms.( [Qin 2022](#35126618)) Estrogenic activity In a small study in postmenopausal females with pelvic floor dysfunction, P. lobata root (one 0.33 g tablet [including 0.425 mg isoflavones] per day) was administered for 60 days prior to hysterectomy to evaluate effects on collagen and elastin content.( [Yan 2016](#Yan.2016)) Pregnancy / Lactation Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Interactions None well documented. Several in vitro and animal studies indicate glucose-lowering effects; therefore, additive effects are possible agents.( [Hsu affect CYP-450 isoenzymes; study results demonstrate contradictory effects (ie, a complex pattern of CYP modulation was observed, including both induction and inactivation).( [Guerra 2000](#11133012)) Adverse Reactions Kudzu has historically been used for medicinal purposes, with few reported adverse reactions.( [Keung 1993a](#8116840)) There are a few case reports of hypersensitivity reactions (ie, maculopapular drug eruption, kudzu-containing Kakkonto decoction.( [Akita 2003](#14531887)) Toxicology Although data regarding use in traditional Chinese medicine indicate a lack of toxicity, the safety profile of kudzu and its extracts has not been determined by systematic pharmacologic screens.( [Qicheng 1980](#7464185)) Acute toxicity of 4 Pueraria species has been studied comparatively.( [Zhou 1995](#8679082)) Index Terms - Pueraria thomsonii - Radix puerariae References Disclaimer This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
