Betty Shine 1929 - 2002 I am convinced that recognizing the importance of mind energy could change people's attitudes to negativity and positivity the world over. I have seen so clearly the effects of thought on people's physical energy and health: how positive thinking stimulates it, causing the energy to expand outwards, while negativity draws that same energy downwards, eventually causing congestion throughout the body. Betty Shine 1929 - 2002 If you have an expansive mind - a mind that extends out to other minds and other dimensions - someone will be listening, and they will always respond. Betty Shine 1929 - 2002 In a healthy positive person the energy pulsating around the head is quite amazing. It surrounds the head as far as just below the ear, and is separate from the aura around the body. It can extend outwards ad infinitum, unlimited by space. The ability to see this has brought new meaning to the concepts of 'open' and 'closed' mindedness. In an open-minded person the expansion of the energy can be tremendous, whereas closed-minded people literally draw their minds in so that not only are they unreceptive to new ideas but they have also cut themselves off from the ability to attune to other people and even to nature. Betty Shine 1929 - 2002 Many conditions which have baffled medical science are caused by negative energy pressing on a vital spot which undermines the efficient working of a major organ. Betty Shine 1929 - 2002 Many more people would benefit if healing were used in conjunction with medical treatment. Betty Shine 1929 - 2002 My healing gifts have been developed by invisible teachers. Betty Shine 1929 - 2002 The replacement of negative thought with positive thought, brings about a spiritual and physical change that can heal.
