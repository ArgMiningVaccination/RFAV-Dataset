Hence having such properties is called 'Piccha basti'. |Sr.No.||Indications||Reference| |1.||In the colic pain a basti complication Sharangdhara formulations of piccha basti 1.

It is indicated in diarrhea without [ama](/index.php?title=Ama)(nirama atisara). Hence in cases of chronic diarrhea and where there is no relation of ama, piccha basti can Piccha basti may be given in any of the schedules of [basti](/index.php?title=Basti)therapy or as per the state of [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha)(avastha) combined with suitable [anuvasana](/index.php?title=Anuvasana)basti. Mode of action of piccha basti [[5]](#cite_note-ref5-5)Hence treatment of inflammation and correcting the excessive abnormal peristalsis is the treatment principle in certain chronic diarrhoea mostly associated with irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's [disease](/index.php?title=Vyadhi)& ulcerative colitis. Contents in piccha basti have anti-inflammatory and antidiarrheal properties. Moreover, [basti](/index.php?title=Basti)treatment itself can set in the reverse peristaltic waves, which can slow down the high amplitude propagated contractions in the colon. [Basti](/index.php?title=Basti)has direct access to the colon and rectum, thus drugs used in [basti](/index.php?title=Basti)can directly reach the site of inflammation or ulcers without any alteration due to gastric contents. The small intestine is the excretory organ for the [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta)& colon for [vata](/index.php?title=Vata_dosha)in natural course. But [diseases](/index.php?title=Vyadhi)associated with the intestine can hamper the [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta)and [vata](/index.php?title=Vata_dosha)excretion. [Pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta)is excreted through small intestine by [basti](/index.php?title=Basti). This brings [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha)from shakha and [marma](/index.php?title=Marma)to [koshtha](/index.php?title=Koshtha). Thus inflammation to these organs makes the patient ineligible for [panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma)therapy. [Koshtha](/index.php?title=Koshtha)has to be capable of excreting [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha). Thus, it is inevitable to treat and heal the gut ( [koshtha](/index.php?title=Koshtha)) on priority either by drug or by [basti](/index.php?title=Basti)treatment.
