Within procurement and sourcing, Neles assess the possibilities to source recycled materials and to increase the usage of renewable energy and bio-based or potentially fully recyclable materials . Partnering with new sustainable companies within the circular ecosystem helps Neles find new opportunities to increase reuse or recycling, and in this way turn the company's waste or by -products into usable resources or energy for other businesses. Neles also strives to increase its energy efficiency of its offices and plants. Neles works to prevent environmental hazards by auditing its own operations, followed by corrective actions. Neles HSEQ management system is certified with the ISO 14001 environmen tal management system certificate for its manufacturing and is also audited regularly by a third party. Additionally, Neles' European plants have been granted ISO 50001 energy management system certificates. Supply chain Neles' responsible way of operating reaches out to the suppliers in the form of Supplier Code of Conduct ensuring quality and sustainability in the supply chain. Neles Supplier Code of Conduct sets the standards for what we expect of Neles suppliers. Neles' long -term target has been to have 90% of the company's suppliers in terms of spend, having signed Neles' Supplier Code of Conduct, or published their own corresponding code, by 2022. Neles also track the environment and climate change related agendas of its suppliers. Neles strives to par tner with suppliers with similar values. This is measured for example by tracking how many suppliers have set emission targets. Suppliers are audited regularly, and Neles' long -term target is to conduct supplier assessments and audits for 95% of its direc t suppliers in high -risk areas by 2025. During the reporting period 1 -3/2022, Neles conducted a total of 4 sustainability assessments including social and environmental aspects. Based on the results of each assessment, follow -up plans were prepared, and co rrecting actions made. The sustainability assessment of suppliers is improved and developed continuously as a critical part of Neles risk management, and sustainability agenda. EU taxonomy - eligibility In adopting the EU taxonomy, Neles has assessed sales, capital expenditure and operating expenditures against climate change sustainable activities regulation. EU taxonomy eligible sustainable activities during the reporting period assessment are those, which significantly contribute to climate change mitigation or climate change adoption, do not harm any of the other environmental objectives and comply with minimum social safeguards set by OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human rights. EU t axonomy eligible sales consist mainly of sales to manufacturing of low carbon technologies related to recycled pulp, paper, and bio product industries and to manufacturing of renewable energy technologies. Operating expenditure consists mainly of R& D to im prove energy efficiency through valve tightness and minimized need f or compressed air. Capital expenditure consists mainly of upgrades in energy management systems. Neles discloses the share of EU taxonomy eligible sustainable activities of sales, operatin g and capital expenditures in the table at the end of this section. Personnel, social matters, human rights The performance and engagement of Neles employees are key contributors to value creation. Engagement is supported and achieved by the safety and wellbeing of employees and responsible employment. Health issues, discrimination and harassment are the most si gnificant human and labor rights -related risks. Sick leave absences may have a negative cost impact and compromise customer deliveries. Low employee engagement may lead to a loss of talent and competence. Neles' Code of Conduct sets the main principles f or tackling the above -mentioned risks. The Code of Conduct outlines Neles' approach to human rights: All employees are entitled to be treated with respect, and there is zero tolerance of discrimination, harassment, or illegal threats. Any form of compulsor y forced, or child labor is unacceptable. Neles respects applicable national laws regarding working hours and employee compensation. All Neles employees are Board of Directors' Report Neles Corporation - Final Accounts 2022 14 required to complete Code of Conduct training once every two years. Human rights -related topics, in cluding safety and labor rights, are regularly reviewed in Neles' own operations and the operations of its suppliers. Risks related to the engagement, safety and wellbeing of Neles' and its suppliers' employees are also mitigated by providing managers wit h tools in daily management activities and through continuous leadership development. The Neles early support model is an example of the focus on wellbeing and safety in Finland. It helps ensure that employees receive appropriate support when needed. Valuing diversity and providing equal opportunities is important. To advance work -related human rights principles, Neles has an Equal Opportunity and Diversity Policy. The underlying principle is Neles' commitment to ensuring equal opportunities for all emplo yees, regardless of gender, age, race, religion, caste, or religious beliefs, ethnic or national origins, marital/civil partnership status, union membership, political affiliation, sexuality, or disability. Employees are selected based on merit and experie nce. Continuous development and learning in everyone's daily work is emphasized in Neles' learning approach, which is supported by our global people processes and tools. Additionally, Neles aims for fair remuneration systems that take into consideration the individual, team, business area and the Group's performance, as well as the varying global market practices. Excelling in leadership makes all the difference from an employee engagement perspective. Employee engagement is measured annually in the Neles ' global employee survey, People Pulse. The results of the survey in 2021 showed that Neles employees in a global comparison were very engaged and the results in general were above the benchmark levels. Except for some cultural and geographic differences, Neles employees in general are very highly committed, had a strong feeling of being able to contribute and a good level of competences in performing in their work. Neles' main health and safety risks occur both in its own operations and at customer sites . The most common risks in the company's own operations are related to lifting, working at heights, machinery, hot work, and road travel. Risks are mitigated with the help of work instructions, training, risk observations, audits, and the corrective action s these generate. Neles uses lost -time incident frequency (LTIF) as the key indicator for safety both at its own premises and for the subcontractors working at Neles' and customers' sites. Another important safety focus area is to ensure that products are safe to use and maintain; thus, the safety of services is considered in the early phase of product and service development. Neles has a safety system in place to continuously improve its processes and culture for safety development. Key elements of the Nel es safety system are: Common guidelines for a Health, Safety & Environmental policy and Neles minimum safety standards An eLearning for Neles' minimum safety standards and exclusive safety trainings for employees working in production Individual safety target (number of Risk Observations and Safety Conversations) for all employees A safety audit process with follow -up plans for corrective actions The Neles HSEQ management system has been granted the ISO 45001 occupational health and sa fety management system certificate for its manufacturing and is also audited regularly by a third party. Employee safety, risk observations, safety discussions and safety training hours are continuously measured and monitored. The lost time incident frequ ency (LTIF) is the main indicator. Annually, an external partner conducts site visits as part of sustainability reporting assurance. Previous assurance was conducted i n 2021 and three sites were visited in Finland, Germany, and India. Anti-corruption and b ribery The Code of Conduct is the highest standard that outlines what good corporate citizenship means at Neles. The Code of Conduct includes topics such as compliance with the laws and rules of society, fair employment practices, anti -corruption, and fai r competition. It was approved by the Board in 2020 and is available in eight languages. All employees are required to complete Code of Conduct training, either as classroom training or e -learning course every two years. The training is also part of the on boarding of all new employees. Neles' Corporate Anti -Corruption Policy demonstrates the company's commitment to prevent corruption in all its operations' business activities. The purpose of the policy and related training is to guide employees in recognizing situations which pose a heig htened risk of corruption and taking appropriate measures to ensure compliance with the law. In addition to the policy, local rules for gifts, entertainment, and hospitality support employees in making the right decisions or escalating potential issues to the management. The rules are monitored through general management controls, as well as the company's Internal Audit function. Third -party sales channel partners (distributors, resellers, and agents) are an important part of Neles' sales strategy. Neles has a systematic process for evaluating, onboarding, and managing its channel partners to ensure they are committed to ethical bu siness activities. Due diligence is conducted of channel partners to assess potential corruption risks.

Final Accounts 2022 29 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Basic information Neles Corporation (the \"Parent Company\") with its subsidiaries (\" Neles \" or the \"Group\") is a global flow control solutions and services provider to the oil and gas refining, pulp, paper and bioproducts industries, chemicals and other process industries. The Group is presented as one repor ting segment. Neles Corporation merged to Valmet Corporation on 1 April 2022 and Neles' shares were delisted on Nasdaq Helsinki stock exchange on 31 March 2022 . Valmet Corporation is domiciled in Finland and the address of the Group Head Office is Keilasatama 5 , 02150 Espoo , Finland. Due to merger t hese fina l accounts have been prepared for the period from January 1 to March 31, 202 2 in accordance with Finnish Limited Li ability Companies Act chapter 16, section 17 . Comparison period information has been presented for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2021 and hence figures are not comparative between financial years. These consolidated financial statements were au thorized for issue by Neles Corporation's Board of Directors on May 30, 2022, after which, in accordance with Finnish Companies Act, the financial statements are either approved, amended or rejected at the next Annual General Meeting. Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRIC Interpretations as adopted by the European Union. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for financial assets and liabilities classified as at fair value. The fi nancial statements are presented in euros, which is the Parent Company's functional currency and Neles' presentation currency. The figures presented have been rounded; consequently, the sum of individual figures might differ from the presented total figure. Neles' more detailed accounting policies are disclosed in the relevant note to the consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates an d judgments by Management The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with the IFRS, requires management to make estimates and assumptions and to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. These affect the reported amounts of balance sheet items, the presentation of contingent assets and liabilities, and the income and expenses for the financial year. Actual results may differ from the estimates made. The assets and liabilities involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where the assumptions and estimates are significant to Neles' consolidated financial statements, are the following: Note 1.1 Sales 1 Note 1.5 Share -based payments Note 1.7 Income taxes Note 2.2 Trade receivables 1 Note 2.3 Other receivables Note 2.4 Inventory 1 Note 2.6 Provisions Note 2.7 Post-employment obligations Note 2.8 Deferred tax assets and liabilities Note 3.1 Goodwill and other intangible assets 1 Note 3.2 Tangible assets Note 3.4 Right -of-use assets Note 4.1 Financial risk management 1 Covid -19 implication disclosed Implications of Covid -19 The Covid -19 pandemic situation has been followed closely by management, prioritizing the health and safety of Neles' employees and partners. The global logistics situation continued to be challenging during the first quarter. The availability of transportation and its costs continued to be issues, impacting for example Neles' net working capital development and margins. In addition, challenges and risks r elated to the availability of electronics components continued. At the end of March 2022, Covid -19 situation in China deteriorated causing Neles' main factory in China, situated in Jiaxing, to be closed for 2 days. The other Neles factory situated in Shang hai has been closed since the end of March. At the end of first quarter, all Neles' factories, except Shanghai's technology center, were operational. Impact of sanctions on Russian business in 2022 Due to war in Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions affecti ng deliveries, logistics and financial transactions Neles suspended its sales to Russia in late February 2022 for an indefinite period of time. Deliveries for items in the backlog were also suspended in late February 2022. Subsequently, Neles has been wind ing down deliveries of the order backlog to Russia in a controlled manner according to the imposed sanctions, taking into account availability of logistics and financing as well as stakeholders. Orders received prior to suspension of sales operations amoun ted to EUR 4 million and sales in Russia amounted to EUR 1 million . At the end of March 2022 , Neles has the following risk exposure from Russia: order backlog worth approximately EUR 20 million, outstanding trade receivables approximately EUR 2 million and advances received approximately EUR 2 million. In this Final Accounts, EUR 12.3 million was written down from the order backlog and EUR 1,9 million from the trade receivables. Financial Statements Neles Corporation - Final Accounts 2022 30 Reporting segment Neles Group as one operating segment is based on its operat ional business model. The Board of Directors is Neles' chief operating decision -maker (CODM) and responsible for allocating resources and assessing the performance of the operating segment and business lines, deciding on strategy, selecting key employees, as well as deciding on major development projects, business acquisitions, investments, organizational structure and financing. The accounting principles applied to the operative reporting are the same as those used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Neles' performance is measured with operating profit (EBIT). In addition, Neles uses several other alternative performance measures to reflect the underlying business performance and to improve comparability between financial periods . Adjusting items comprise of costs related to the partial demerger and setting up Neles business area as an independent company, capacity adjustment costs, outcome of material intellectual property rights disputes, gains and losses on business disposals, a nd other infrequent events. Alternative performance measures, however, should not be considered as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with the IFRS.

The principle is that sales are recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which Neles expects to receive in exchange for tra nsferring goods or services to a customer. Sales are recognized when the control of goods or services is transferred to a customer. The control is transferred either at a point in time or over time. Neles providing standardized valves equipment and wear or spare parts to customers, sales are recognized at a point in time, when control for the goods is transferred, typically at the delivery of the goods or after commissioning. Sales to the distributors are recognized at the delivery when the distributor is not acting as an agent. If the distributor is acting as an agent, sales are recognized only when the goods are delivered to ultimate customer . Neles providing services, the performance obli gation is satisfied by rendering the services , Sales from services are recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, and customer has been invoiced . For short -term service contracts with hourly fee based on valid price list , sales are recognized to the extent Neles has the right to invoice the customer, and for service contracts with fixed hourly fee agreed in the contract, sales are recognized based on invoicing. Customer contracts may include promises such as volume - based rebates, late delivery penalties or right to return delivered parts. The impact of these promises on the final consideration will be estimated when revenue is recognized and systematically during the contract period. Sales will be recognized to the extent that Neles is entitled to the consideration. Also, creditworthiness of the client and collectability of the consideration is assessed through the contract period. Extended warranties are treated as a separate performance obligation and appropriate transaction price is allocated to them and recognized in sales when occurred. Neles may require advance payments from customers . Applying IFRS 15, advances received do not include a financing component, because the payment schedule of them follows closely the timing of perform ance obligations to be satisfied. Estimates and assessments by Management Sales recognized at a point in time may require judgement on facts and circumstances when the control is considered to have p assed to the client, affecting on timing of sales to be recognized. Transfer of the control is assessed mainly based on terms of delivery in the contract and local legislation. Customer contracts including clauses on rebates, late delivery penalties, right to return promises or extended warranties requires management judgement on the probability of such clauses to influence contracts sales. Judgements are based on earlier experie nce, combined with current market outlook, when it is available. Covid -19 pandemic impact Sales in 2022 were at good level and s ales in 2021 grew compared to 2020. Covid -19 pandemic only had an impact on distribution of sales in the reporting periods . During the first half 2021 , Sales were negatively impacted by temporary closures of certain Neles facilities, but these delays in deliveries were caught up in the second half of the year . There were no other major extraordinary impacts on revenue recognition in 2022 and 2021 because of the Covid -19 pandemic situation. Management has in place internal control measures for customer contract clauses on rebates, late delivery penalties or rig ht to return promises. Risks on collectability of client considerations is managed through credit limit management and enhanced collection measures.

In long-term valves delivery and service contracts invoicing sis based on the client contracts. Short - term service contracts are invoiced when service is rendered. Trade receivables are based on the invoicing to customers and are generally on terms of 30 -90 days. Information about provision for expected credit losses on trade receivables is presented in note 2.2. The performance obligation partial satisfied, and not yet invoiced is recognized in work in progress and finished products in inventory. Adva nces received is the amount paid in advance to Neles by customers. Typically, Neles receives advance payments in the long-term valves ' delivery and service contracts . Advances received are annually recognized as sales mainly during the following year. Major customers In 202 2 and 2021, Neles did not have a single customer whose sales would have exceeded 10 percent of the consolidated sales.

The equity -settled share awards are valued based on the market price of Neles share as of the grant date and recognized as an em ployee benefit expense over the vesting period with corresponding entry in other reserves of the equity. The historical development of Neles share and the expected dividends have been taken into account when calculating the fair value. The entire share inc entive, including the cash -for-taxes portion are recognized in equity. Also, the value of the cash portion is based on the grant date value. As a market condition, total shareholder return of the Performance Share Plans will be considered when determining the fair value at grant and it will not be changed during the plan. The fair value of the cost estimate of the Performance Share Plans will only be changed when service condition and non -market conditions are concerned. The cash -settled share -based incentive plans are valued based on performance criteria. Liability incurred is measured at the fair value at grant date and it is accrued as personnel expenses and other liabilities during the service period. Until cash reward is settled, liab ility is remeasured at the fair value at the end of each reporting period with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the period. At each balance sheet date, Neles revises its estimates on the amount of sha re-based payments that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision to previous estimate is accrued as an employee benefit expense with corresponding entry to equity or to other liabilities. Estimates and assessments by Manag ement At each balance sheet date, the management revises its estimates for the number of shares that are expected to vest as well as for amounts of cash settlements . As part of this evaluation, Neles takes into account the changes in the forecasted performance of the Group, the expected turnover of the personnel benefiting from the incentive plan and other pertinent information impacting the number of shares to be vested or amounts of cash to be settle d. Share -based payments Modification on 1.7.2021 to share -based payment plans: In relation to Neles' merger with Valmet, the Board of Directors decided to adjust the structure of Neles' long -term incentive schemes. All outstanding long -term incentive schemes will be paid as a cash reward, and their plan and vesting periods have been shortened to reflect the merger schedule. The performance measurement of relative T SR (total shareholder return) was discontinued in the announcement of the merger plan on July 2, 2021 because it was considered that Neles share would not trade as an independent share after the merger announcement. The performance measurement of earnings per share ( EPS) was discontinued on December 31, 2021 . As a result, Neles has recognized an accelerated cost of EUR 2.7 million for the year 2021 as incremental fair value granted. In 2022 share based payments plans have not been changed. Performance measu rements were discontinued in first quarter of 2022 except for service condition. The payments of the cash rewards are scheduled for 2022 and 2023. Share -based payments until July 2021 In January 2021 , the DSUP 2021 -2023 was granted as a first individual plan within the DSUP structure to Neles' senior management. The reward will be earned through individual -, business -, or company level performance criteria in 2021. The reward earned in 2021 will be conve rted to synthetic share units for an approximately two -year share price performance period. The reward is paid thereafter in cash in the spring of 2024, based on Neles' share value at the time of payment. In February 2021 , the PSP 2021 -2023 was granted t o the members of the Neles Executive Management Team. The potential reward is based on the performance targets relative to the total shareholder return of Neles share and earnings per share (EPS) from 2021 to 2023. Potential reward earned will be paid afte r the performance period in 2024 in net shares and as a cash payment for taxes arising from the reward to the employee. In June 2021 , the DSUP 2018 rewards were paid in cash to 16 employees and payment amounted to EUR 1.4 million.

The other comprehensive income statement (OCI) includes taxes on items presented in OCI. Deferred taxes are determined for temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their financial statement carrying amounts, measured using substantially enacted tax rates . Estimates and assessments by Management Neles is subject to income tax in its operating countries. Neles' management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the annual tax calculations for which the ultimate tax consequence is uncertain. Annually, Neles has tax audits ongoing in several subsidiaries and recognizes tax liabilities on for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimate of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the outcome of these issues is different from the estimated amounts, the difference will impact the income tax in the period in which such determination is m ade.

Non -allocated assets include mainly goodwill and other assets arising from business acquisitions that have not been pushed down to the subsidiaries' books. 2.2 Trade receivables Accounting policy Trade receivables are invoiced receivables from customers related to Neles' ordinary business transactions. General payment terms are typically from 30 days to 90 days and they are non -interest bearing receivables. Trade receivables are initially recognize d at recoverable value and subsequently valued at amortized cost. If exceptionally over 360 days payment term has been offered to a client, the invoiced amount is discounted to its fair value. Neles may enter an agreement to sell trade receivables. Trade r eceivable will be derecognized when payment has been received and there is certainty that credit risk and other risks and rewards have been transferred to a third party. Neles applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, wh ich uses a lifetime expected loss allowance to be assessed and recognized regularly. Based on the analysis of previous year's credit losses by aging category and nature, as well as macroeconomic outlook in the near future, Neles recognize s a credit loss allowance from 0.2% to 5% on undue or less than 180 days overdue trade receivables. For more than 180 days overdue trade receivables , the impairment is assessed individually, but without any credit guarantee, collateral or similar assurance on the recoverability, a minimum credit loss provision of 25% (over 180 days overdue ) and 100% (over 360 days overdue ) will be recognized. Trade receivab les are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Probability of bankruptcy, other financial reorganization or similar situation indicating insolvency of the client trigger final write off. Estimates and assessments by Management Estimate on expected credit losses and credit loss provision to be recognized are based on management's best judgement. The judgement is based on earlier experience on past years credit los ses and current economic outlooks and client segment and location information. Trade receivables are collected actively, and possible impairment analyzed regularly by businesses and Neles legal units, and necessary actions to secure the receivables are mad e by the management. When credit loss provision of a trade receivable is assessed individually, collateral, credit guarantees, financial position of client and earlier payment behavior are considered . In 2022, management has used judgment in decision to wr ite-off all Russia related trade receivables due to sanctions imposed to Russian business. Covid -19 pandemic impact There were no increases in realized credit losses in 202 2 or major delays in payments because of the Covid -19 pandemic situation. No material changes to the payment terms have been negotiated. Management implements internal control measures by monitoring public information on clients ' creditworthiness and the aging of trade receivables. The method to recognize credit loss allowances in the expected credit loss model was kept unchanged.

The impairment is expensed under selling, general and administrative expenses. Estimates and assessments by Management Neles' policy is to calculate an impairment loss based on the best estimate of the amounts that are potentially uncollectable at the balance sheet date. Neles' management actively monitors the amount of receivables past due globally and initiates action as necessary. 31.3.2022 31.12.202 1 EUR million Non-current Current Total Non-current Current Total Prepaid expenses and accrued income - 19.0 19.0 - 18.5 18.5 VAT, payroll tax and social charge receivables - 11.6 11.6 - 10.9 10.9 Pension assets 9.7 - 9.7 12.5 - 12.5 Other receivables 1.3 8.0 9.2 1.2 8.4 9.7 Derivatives - 3.6 3.6 - 1.2 1.2 Non-interest bearing receivables total 10.9 42.2 53.1 13.7 38.9 52.7 Other current non-interest bearing receivables included EUR 4.8 million in March 2022 (EUR 3.8 million in 20 21) Brazilian tax credits arising from delivery of goods and transfer of services (ICMS) recognized by a local subsidiary . Financial Statements Neles Corporation - Final Accounts 2022 41 2.4 Inventory Accounting policy Inventories are valued at the lower of historical cost calculated or net realizable value. Costs are measured on a weighted average cost basis and include purchase costs as well as transportation and processing costs. The costs of finished goods include direct materials, wages and salaries plus employer social contributions, su bcontracting and other direct costs, as well as a portion of production and project administration overheads. Net realizable value is the estimated amount that can be realized from the sale of the asset in the normal course of business less costs to sell. Inventories are shown net of a provision for obsolete and slow-moving inventories. Neles' policy is to maintain a provision for slow -moving and obsolete inventory based on the best estimate of such amounts at the balance sheet date. An obsolescence provisi on is charged to income statement in the period in which the obsolescence is determined. Estimates are based on a systematic, on -going review and evaluation of inventory balance. Trade -in equipment received is recorded as inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Estimates and assessments by Management Inventory valuation requires management to make estimate s and judgements particularly relating to obsolescence and expected selling prices . Covid -19 pandemic impact The Covid -19 pandemic situation and the resulting logistics challenges and component shortages caused some challenges in 2022 and 2021 for inventory management through delays in deliveries and need to ensure availability with more safety stocks. Neles has managed to keep its supply chains and manufacturing operations ongoing, expect for certain temporary difficulties. Neles has global supply chains and manufacturing footprint, therefore it does not have major risk associated with concentration of production. Management has increased internal controls on the inventory management with the aim of optimizing the level of net working capital in a timely manner. The methods to recognize obsolescence provision and s crapping were kept unchanged . The cost of inventories recognized as expense amounted EUR 107.8 million in Q1 2022 ( EUR 403.6 million in 202 1).

The maturities of the current non -interest bearing liabilities rarely exceed six months. The maturities of trade payables are largely determined by trade practices and individual agreements between Neles and its s upplier. Accrued personnel costs, including holiday pay, are accrued and settled in accordance with local laws and regulations. 31.3.2022 31.12.2021 EUR million Non-current Current Total Non-current - 59.5 59.5 - 62.8 62.8 Other payables Accrued interests - 0.2 0.2 - 0.5 0.5 Accrued personnel costs - 26.5 26.5 - 24.0 24.0 Accrued project costs - 0.2 0.2 - 0.3 0.3 VAT, payroll tax and social charge payables - 36.5 36.5 - 6.1 6.1 Other payables 0.3 15.7 16.0 0.3 18.0 18.2 Other payables 0.3 79.0 79.3 0.3 48.8 49.1 2.6 Provisions Accounting policy Provisions are recognized when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that financial benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation . Provisions, for which settlement is expected to occur more than one year after the initial recognition, are discounted to their present value and adjusted in subsequent closings for the time effect. Warranty and guarantee provisions Neles issues various types of contractual product warranties under which it generally guarantees the performance levels agreed in the sales contract, the performance of products delivered during an agreed warranty period and services rendered for a certain period or term. The provision for estimated warranty costs is based on historical realized warranty costs for de liveries of standard products and services in the past. The typical warranty period is 12 months from accepted delivery. The adequacy of provisions is assessed periodically on a case by case basis. Restructuring and capacity adjustment costs A provision fo r restructuring and capacity adjustment costs is recognized only after management has approved, committed to and started to implement a formal plan. Employee termination benefits are recognized after the representatives of employees or individual employees have been informed of the intended measures in detail and the related compensation packages can be reliably measured. The costs included in a provision for capacity adjustment are those costs that are either incremental or incurred as a direct result of the plan or are as the result of a continuing contractual obligation with no continuing economic benefit to Neles or a penalty incurred to cancel the contractual obligation . Restructuring and capacity adjustment expenses are recognized in either cost of go ods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the restructuring expenses. Restructuring costs can also include other costs incurred as a result of the plan, which are recorded under other operating income and expenses, net, such as asset write -downs. Environmental remediation costs Neles recognizes provisions associated with environmental remediation obligations when there is a present obligation as a result of past events, an outflow of resources is considered probabl e and the obligation can be estimated reliably. Such provisions are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed virtually certain. Estimates and assessments by Management Provisions booked require management to estimate the future costs needed to settle the obligations and to estimate the possible outcomes of claims or lawsuits. The outcome depends on future development and events, so the final costs needed and timing to se ttle the obligation may differ from the initial provision estimated.

In certain countries, the plans are defined benefit plans providing retirement, disability, death, and other post-employment benefits, termin ation and retirement lump sums. The retirement benefits are usually based on the number of service years and the salary levels of the final service years. Neles has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. The pension plans are generall y funded through payments to insurance companies or to trustee -administered funds. Other arrangements are unfunded with benefits being paid directly by Neles as they fall due. All arrangements are subject to local tax and legal restrictions in their respec tive jurisdictions. In the case of defined benefit plans, the net liability recognized from the plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation as of the balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets. Independent actuaries calculate the defined benefit obligation by applying the projected unit credit method under IAS 19R. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using the interest rates of high -quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and having maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. The cost of providing retirement and other post -retirement benefits to personnel is charged to profit and loss concurrently with the service rendered by personnel. Net interest is recorded through financial income and expenses in the income statement. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized through OCI in shareholders' equity in the period in which they arise. Past service costs, gains and losses on curtailments or settlements are recognized immediately in the income statement. The contributions to defined contribut ion plans and multi - employer and insured plans are recognized in the income statement concurrently with the payment obligations. Estimates and assessments by Management The present value of the pension obligations is based on annual actuarial calculations, which use several assumptions such as the discount rate and expected return on assets, salary and pension increases and other actuarial factors. As a result, the liabil ity recorded on Neles' balance sheet and cash contributions to funded arrangements are sensitive to changes. Where the actuarial experience differs from those assumptions gains and losses result, which are recognized in OCI. Sensitivity analyses on the pre sent value of the defined benefit obligation have been presented in the tables. Assets of Neles' funded arrangements are managed by external fund managers. The allocation of assets is reviewed regularly by those responsible for managing Neles' arrangement s based on local legislation, professional advice and consultation with Neles , based on acceptable risk tolerances. Covid -19 pandemic impact The Covid -19 pandemic impacts all assumptions used, of which interest rate factor has the main influence on the present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated. Neles' pension and other post -employment plans Neles' most financially significant arrangements are the US pension plan and the German pen sion plans which amount for 98% of Neles' pension obligations and almost 100 % of Neles' pension assets. The US funded pension plan is closed to new entrants and to future accrual of benefits. Annual funding valuations are carried out in accordance with loc al principles to determine if cash funding contributions are required. As the plan has been in funding surplus over recent years, no contributions have recently been required. Neles' obligations in the US also include a more modest unfunded pension plan an d a deferred compensation arrangement. Deferred compensation arrangement will be paid to beneficiaries as a consequence of implementation of Neles merger to Valmet. Neles' defined benefit plans in other territories include modest pension plans, as well as lump sum benefits payable on leaving service and retirement.

Typical temporary differences arise from provisions, depreciation and amortization expense, inventory and trade receivable valuation , defined benefit plans and tax loss carry forwards. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet in full, a nd the deferred tax assets are only recognized if it is probable there will be taxable income in the future against which deferred tax can be used. Deferred tax assets are set off against deferred tax liabilities if they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority. Deferred tax assets are assessed for realizability at the end of each reporting period. If it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow deferred tax asset utilization, carrying amount of deferred tax asset is reduced. Estimates and assessments by Management In determining the deferred tax assets and liabilities, Neles is required to make certain assumptions and estimates on , in particular , future operating performance and the taxable income of subsidiaries, recoverability of tax loss carryforwards and potential changes of tax laws in jurisdictions where Neles operates. A deferred tax liability based on foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings has been provided only where Neles management has elected to distribute such earnings in the coming years and the distribution is subject to taxation. Because the tax consequenc es are difficult to predict, the deferred tax asset and liabilities may need to be adjusted in coming financial years, which will have an impact in the period in which such determination is made.

Financial Statements Neles Corporation - Final Accounts 2022 49 Intangible and tangible assets 3.1 Goodwill and other intangible assets Accounting policy Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of net identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the fair values of previously owned interests and non -controlling interests. Neles Group is one ope rating segment consisting of three cash generating units (CGU), Equipment (VEQ), Service (VSE) and Valve Controls (VCO). In Neles operational model, goodwill is contributing the future cash flows integrated to all of the CGUs' and is therefore allocated to group of these CGUs' forming Neles Group. The carrying value of goodwill is tested at least annually with the Neles Group value in use. Previously recognized impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, such as brand values, are not amortized. Currently testing of such assets are included the annual impairment testing. Previous losses on impairment are only reversed to the extent that the new carrying amount of the assets does not exceed the carryi ng amount the asset would have had if the asset had not been impaired. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets with a definite useful life, mainly trademarks, patents, licenses, IT software or acquired customer relationships and order backlog are measured at costs less accumulated amortizations and impairment losses. Amortization of intangible assets Amortization of intangible assets with a definite useful life is calculated on a straight -line basis over the useful life of the assets as follows: Patents and licenses 5-10 years Computer software 3-5 years Technology 3-20 years Customer relationships 3-20 years Other intangible assets < 1-20 years The probable useful lives of assets are reviewed annually. If material deviations from previous estimates arise, the useful lives are reassessed. The carrying value of intangible assets subject to amortization is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. A previously recognized impairment loss may be reversed if there is a significant improvement of the circumstances having initially caused the impairment, but not to a higher value than the carrying amount, which would have been recorded had t here been no impairment in prior years. Research and development expenses comprise salaries, administration costs, depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets and they are mainly recognized as incurred. When material development costs meet certain capitalization criteria under IAS 38, they are capitalized and amortized during the expected useful life of the underlying technology.

The testing of goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life is performed at Neles Group level. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the recoverable value, an impairment is recognized in the income statement. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Neles Group allocates the goodwill to be tested to the Neles Group, formed by the group of three cash generating un its (CGUs), Equipment, Service and Valve Controls. The recoverable amounts are based on value in use calculations, where the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value. The cash flows are derived from the current year's last quarter estimate, the following year's budget and the approved strategy for the next three years, beyond which cash flows are calculated using the terminal value method. The terminal growth rate used is based on management's judgment regarding the average long-term growth. Estimated cash flows include only normal maintenance investments and exclude any potential investments that enhance Neles' performance and acquisitions. Financial Statements Neles Corporation - Final Accounts 2022 51 Estimates and assessments by Management Value in use calculations is inherently judgmental and highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require management to make assumptions about future supply and demand related to its individual business units , future sales prices, profit margins and achievable efficiency savings over time. The value of benefits and savings expected from the efficiency improvement programs are inherently subjective. Neles management estimates sales growth rate and EBITDA develo pment for the testing period as well as the discount factor used. The present value of the cash generating units is discounted using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) calculated by Neles. WACC calculations include judgments on regarding, among ot her things, relevant beta factors, peer companies and capital structure to use. Neles performs impairment testing annually, or whenever there is an indication of impairment. Typical triggering events are material and permanent deterioration in the global economy or political environment, observed significant under - performance relative to projected future performance and significant changes in Neles' strategic orientations. Expected useful lives and remaining amortization periods for other intangible assets are reviewed annually by management. Acquisitions, disposals and restructuring actions typically generate a need for the reassessment of the recoverable amounts and remaining useful lives of the assets. When the other intangible assets are measured at fai r value less costs of disposal, the selling price, incremental costs and selling costs need to be estimated by management. Upon initial acquisition Neles uses readily available market values to determine the fair values of acquired net assets to be allocat ed. However, when this is not possible, the valuation is based on past performance of such an asset and expected future cash generating capacity, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions of the future performance and use of these assets. Any change in Neles' future business priorities may affect the recoverable amounts. Covid -19 pandemic impact During the Covid -19 pandemic uncertainties and risks related to global economy have remained high and predicting future long-term cash flows has c ontinued to be difficult. At the end of March 2022, impairment test is based on strategy figures that were revised during 2021 and plan 2022 created in the second half of 2021, taking into account the uncertainties related to the Covid -19 pandemic and othe r changes in market environment. Impairment test in 2022 As at March 31, 2022, goodwill totaled EUR 85.9 million. Impairment testing has been conducted for annual financial statements in 2021 and that detailed calculation for carrying value has been used in impairment testing for final accounts as at March 31,2022. Neles Group tested assets and liabilities have not significantly changed after financial statements 2021 testing. Change in tested net assets is -1.0% between final accounts March 31, 2022 and annual financial statements 2021. According to impairment tes ting prepared for the financial statements 2021 , the recoverable amount significantly exceeded the carrying value of goodwill and other tested assets . Management has analyzed events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent recoverable amount calculation in connection with the annual financial statements 2021. Most significant changes are update of estimate for year 2022 and change in market interest rates. Management has updated the 2022 economic estimate during the first quarter of 2022. In this estimate management has taken into account impact of Russian sanctions to forecasted cash flows, the Covid -19 pandemic and other changes in market environment. In addition, change in market interest rates has been updated during the first quarter of 2022 which has impact on the discount factor used in value in use calculations. Based on the analysis, the recoverable amount still significantly exceeded the carrying value of goodwill and other tested assets and no indication of impairment was found in 2022. The impact of the CGUs value in use of the events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed in the value in use calcula tions 31.3. 2022 Change in economic estimate for 2022 -0.4% Market interest rate change -3.3% Financial Statements Neles Corporation - Final Accounts 2022 52 Annual impairment test in 2021 As at December 31, 2021, goodwill totaled EUR 85.6 million. Given that the recoverable amount significantly exceeded the carrying value of goodwill and other tested assets, no indication of impairment was found in 2021. The value in use calculations were derived from estimates, budgets and strategy figures reviewed by Neles' management and approved by the Board of Directors. The key assumptions used in assessing the recoverable amount are the profitability and growth rate for the estimate period, long -term average growth in the terminal period and discount rate. The key values used were the following: 31.12.2021 Sales growth in four years estimate period 9.0% EBITDA % range in four years estimate period 16.2% -19.5% Growth rate in the terminal period 1.7% WACC after tax 9.7% WACC before tax 12.2% Values assigned to key assumptions reflect past experience and the management's expectations on the future sales and production volumes, which are based on the current structure and production capacity. In the 2021 testing, the i ncreased risk in forecasting future cash flows caused by the Covid -19 pandemic situation has been assessed. Additionally, data on growth, demand and price development provided by various research institutions have been utilized. The growth rate of 1.7% for the terminal period is based on the long -term expectations on the growth in the Neles' market environments considering the current low interest rate environment and overall financial market situation. WACC before tax is used as a discount factor in the calculations. It takes into account the expected return on both debt and equity and has been derived from the WACC on comparable peer industry betas, capital structure and tax rates. WACC is evaluated annually for testing and business specific risk is incorp orated through individual beta factors from the market data of peer companies. WACC used in 2021 is reflecting the Covid -19 pandemic impact on the market prices and takes into account the risk s in estimating future cash flows . Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity to impairment was tested in the following scenarios: Scenario 1: increasing WACC by 2.0 percentage points Scenario 2: reducing the terminal growth rate from 1.7% to 1.2% and increasing WA CC by 2.0 percentage points The impact to the value in use of the CGUs in the sensitivity analysis 31.12. 2021 WACC increase by 2 p.p. -21% Terminal growth to 1.2% and WACC increase by 2 p.p. -23% The sensitivity analysis also includes several cash projections on break -even levels of EBITDA %, WACC and sales growth based on reasonable change in the future performance. However, the impact on the present value obtained is limited as long as there is n o permanent weakening expected for the business, which would affect the terminal value. Based on these sensitivity analyses, the management believes that no reasonably possible change of the key assumptions used would cause the carrying value exceed its re coverable amount. In 2021, the sensitivity analysis did not indicate risks of impairment. Financial Statements Neles Corporation - Final Accounts 2022 53 3.2 Tangible assets Accounting policy Tangible assets are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciat ion and impairment loss, if any. The tangible assets of acquired subsidiaries are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. Depreciation is calculated on a straight -line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets as follows: Buildings and structures 15-40 years Machinery and equipment 3-20 years Land and water areas not depreciated Expected useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date and if they differ significantly from previous estimates, the remaining depreciation periods are adjusted accordingl y. Subsequent improvement costs related to an asset are included in the carrying value of such asset or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when the future economic benefits associated with the costs are pro bable and the related costs can be separated from normal maintenance costs . Neles reviews tangible assets to be held and used by the company for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not b e recoverable. Gains and losses on the disposal of tangible asset and possible impairments are recognized in operating income and expenses. Previously recognized impairment loss may be reversed if there is a significant improvement to the circumstances hav ing initially caused the impairment, however not to a higher value than the carrying amount, which would have been recorded had there been no impairment in prior years. Government grants Government grants relating to additions t o tangible assets are deducted from the acquisition cost of the asset and they reduce the depreciation charge of the related asset. Other government grants are deferred and recognized as profit concurrently with the costs they compensat e Estimates and assessments by Management Acquisitions, disposals and restructuring actions typically generate a need for the reassessment of the recoverable values and remaining useful lives of the asse ts. When tangible assets are valued at fair value less costs of disposal, selling price, incremental costs and selling costs need to be estimated by management.

Neles recognizes lease liabilities to make lease payments and right -of-use assets representing the right to use the und erlying assets. Right -of-use assets Neles recognizes right -of-use assets at the date the underlying asset is available for use. Right -of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasu rement of lease liabilities. The cost comprises of the lease liability, initial direct costs and lease payments made at or before the commencement of the lease less any lease incentives received. Lease contracts may include extension and termination optio ns. Such options have been considered when determining the lease term. A period covered by Neles' option to extend the lease is included in the lease term if such option is likely to be exercised. Further, a period covered by Neles' option to terminate the lease is included in the lease term if such option is estimated not to be exercised. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight -line-basis over the shorter of estimated useful life and the lease term , as follows: Buildings 3-10 years Vehicles and other equipment 3-5 years Short -term leases and leases of low -value assets Neles applies recognition exemption to leases that have a lease term less than 12 months ( short -term-leases ) and leases that are considered to low value contracts ( low- value -assets ). Lease payments for leases of low value assets and short -term leases are expensed in the income statement on a straight -line-basis over the lease term. Lease liab ilities Lease liabilities are included in interest bearing liabilities, see note 4.5. Borrowings and lease liabilities . Estimates and assessments by Management The most significant management judgment relates to lease agreements that include extension or early termination options for Neles . For these contracts, management needs to assess the probability of exercising such option, which may significantly affect th e estimated length of lease term and consequently the amounts of right -of-use asset and lease liability as well as the related depreciation and interest expense. Management judgment is also applied in defining the incremental borrowing rate used to calcula te the present value of the future lease payments.

Financial Statements Neles Corporation - Final Accounts 2022 57 Capital structure and financial instruments 4.1 Financial risk managemen t As a global company, Neles is exposed to a variety of business and financial risks. Financial risks are managed centrally by the Group Treasury under annually reviewed written policies approved by the Board of Directors. Treasury operations are monitored by the CFO. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co - operati on with the operating units. Group Treasury functions as counterparty to the operating units, manages external funding centrally and is responsible for the management of financial assets and appropriate hedging measures. The objective of financial risk man agement is to minimize potential adverse effects on Neles' financial performance . Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis figures presented in connection with different financial risks are based on the risk exposures on the balance sheet date. The sensitivity is calculated by assuming a change in one of the risk factors of a financial instrument, such as interest or currency. It is not likely that the future volatility of a risk factor will develop in accordance with the test assumptions and that only one factor would be impacted. When calculating the sensitivity, Neles has chosen to use market conventio ns in assuming a one percentage point (100 basis points) variation in interest rates, 10 percent change in foreign exchange rates and in commodity prices because this provides better comparability from one period to another and information on the volatilit y to users of financial statements. Neles is aware that such assumptions may not be realistic when compared to past volatility and they are not intended to reflect the future. Neles has chosen not to use past volatility as this could mislead the users of f inancial statements to assume the analysis reflects management's view on future volatility of the financial instruments. Liquidity and refinancing risk and capital structure management Liquidity or refinancing risk arises when a company is not able to arr ange funding at terms and conditions corresponding to its creditworthiness. Sufficient cash, short -term investments and committed and uncommitted credit facilities are maintained to protect short -term liquidity. Diversification of funding among different m arkets and adequate number of financial institutions is used to safeguard the availability of liquidity at all times. Group Treasury monitors bank account structures, cash balances and forecasts of the operating units and manages the utilization of the con solidated cash resources. As of March 31, 2022 cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 1 30 million (EUR 132 million in 2021), and there were no deposits or securities with maturity over three months in March 2022 (EUR 0 million in 2021). As of March 31 , 2022 Neles had a fully drawn term loan of EUR 150 (EUR 150 million in 2021) million with final maturity in 2028. Additionally, Neles had a committed syndicated revolving credit facility of EUR 200 million (EUR 200 million in 2021) This syndicated revolving credit facility was fully undrawn and had final maturity in 2024 and had one one -year extension option. In 2021 Neles signed a EUR 301 million Bridge -to-bond facility, the purpose of which was to finance the extraordinary distribution of funds prior to the completion of the merger. On March 31 , 2022 EUR 215 million had been drawn under this facility. The facility te rm was 12 months with maturity in March 2023 and it had two 6 -month extension options. In March 2022 Neles signed a EUR 88.8 mill ion short -term loan agreement with Valmet the purpose of which was to maintain Valmet's share of extra distribution of funds as debt in Neles's balance sheet. Additionally, as of March 31, 2022 the uncommitted Finnish Commercial Paper program totaling EUR 200 million was available for funding. At the end of March 2022, all interest bearing loans are disclosed as current loans, because of the merger effective on April 1, 2022. Neles' refinancing risk is managed by balancing the proportion of short -term and long -term debt as well as the average remaining maturity of long -term debt. The table below analyzes the repayments and interests on Neles' liabilities by the remaining maturities from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

Capital structure is monitored by the Board of Directors and managed operationally by the Group Treasury. Capital structure management in Neles comprises both equity and interest -bearing debt . On March 31, 2022, Parent company's equity totaled EUR 119 million (EUR 462 million in 2021 ) and interest -bearing liabilities totaled EUR 473 million (EUR 168 million in 2021). The changes in the capital structure in March 2022 are part of the planned transactions related to the merger of Neles with Valmet group as of 1 April 2022. The covenants included in the previous loan agreements have been agreed with the banks as part of the merger arrangement. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises when changes in market interest rates and interest margins influence finance costs, returns on financi al investments and valuation of interest -bearing balance sheet items. Interest rate risks are managed by balancing the ratio between fixed and floating interest rates and administrating duration of debt and investment portfolios. The interest rate risk is managed and controlled by the Group Treasury and measured using sensitivity analysis and maturity of long -term debt. As of March 31, 2022 the balance sheet items exposed to interest rate risk were interest bearing assets of EUR 132 million (EUR 134 million in 2021) and interest bearing debt of EUR 473 million (EUR 168 million in 2021). Of the total interest bearing debt 95 percent (89 percent in 2021) was denominated in EUR. The basis for the interest rate sensitivity analysis is an aggregate group l evel interest exposure, composed of interest bearing assets and interest bearing debt. For all interest bearing current debt and assets to be fixed during next 12 months a one percentage point move upwards or downwards in interest rates with all other vari ables held constant would have an effect on Neles' net interest expenses, net of taxes, of EUR +/ - 2.5 million (EUR +/ - 2.0 million in 2021). Foreign exchange risk Neles operates globally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk in several currencies, alth ough the geographical diversity of operations decreases the significance of any individual currency. About 7 5 percent of Neles' sales originate from outside the euro zone; the main currencies being euro, US dollar, SG dollar, Brazilian real and Chinese ren minbi. Transaction exposure Foreign exchange transaction exposure arises when an operating unit has commercial or financial transactions and payments in other than its own functional currency, and when related cash inflow and outflow amounts are not equal or concurrent. In accordance with the Neles Treasury Policy, operating units are required to hedge in full the foreign currency exposures on balance sheet and other firm commitments. Future cash flows denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the unit are hedged with internal foreign exchange contracts with the Group Treasury for periods, which do not usually exceed two years. Operating units also do some hedging directly with banks in countries, where regulation does not allow corporate internal cross -border contracts. Group Treasury monitors the net position of each currency and decides to what extent a currency position is to be closed. Neles Treasury Policy defines upper limits on the open currency exposures managed b y the Group Treasury; limits have been calculated on the basis of their potential profit impact. To manage the foreign currency exposure Group Treasury may use forward exchange contracts and foreign exchange options. Neles does not apply hedge accounting for foreign exchange derivatives. Financial Statements Neles Corporation - Final Accounts 2022 59 Total amount of foreign currency exposures at the end of period EUR million 31.3.2022 31.12.2021 Operational items affecting to operating profit 29.2 25.1 Financial items 25.3 43.0 Hedges -34.8 -58.3 Total exposure 19.7 9.8 This aggregate group level currency exposure is the basis for the sensitivity analysis of foreign exchange risk. This exposure, net of respective hedges, is composed of all assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, projected cash flows for unrecognized firm commitments, both short - and long -term sales and purchase contracts and anticipated operational cash flows to the extent their realization has been deemed highly probable and therefore hedged. This analysis excludes net foreign currency investments in subsidiaries . Assuming euro to appreciate or depreciate ten percent against all other currencies, the impact on cash flows, net of taxes, derived from the yea r-end net exposure as defined above, would be EUR +/ - 0.03 million (EUR +/ - 0.3 million in 2021). Transaction exposure is spread in about 2 7 currencies and as of December 31, 2021, the biggest open exposures were in USD, 2 4 percent, and BRL, 13 percent. A sensitivity analysis of financial instruments as required by IFRS 7, excludes following items: projected cash flows for unrecognized firm commitments, advance payments, both short - and long -term purchase contracts and anticipated operational c ash flows. The next table presents the effects, net of taxes, of a +/ - 10 percent change in EUR foreign exchange rates: 1-3/2022 1-12/2021 EUR million USD BRL Others Total USD CNY Others Total Effects in Income statement +/- 0.6 +/- 0.4 -/+ 0.2 -/+1.3 +/- 0.3 +/- 0.4 -/+ 0.2 -/+ 0.5 Effect in income statement is the fair value change for all financial instruments exposed to foreign exchange risk. Translation or equity exposure Foreign exchange translation exposure arises when the equity of a subsidiary is denominated in currency other than the functional currency of the Parent Company. The major translation exposures are in US Dollar and Chinese Yuan , which altogether comprise approximately 78 percent of the total equity exposure. Neles is currently not hedging any equity exposure. Commodity risk Neles is exposed to variations in prices of raw materials and of supplies. Neles units identify their c ommodity price hedging needs and hedges are executed through the Group Treasury using approved counterparties and instruments. Hedging is done on a rolling basis with a declining hedging level over time. To reduce its exposure to the volatility caused by the surcharge for certain metal alloys (Alloy Adjustment Factor) comprised in the price of stainless steel charged by its suppliers, Neles has entered into average -price swap agreements for nickel. The Alloy Adjustment Factor is based on monthly average pr ices of its components of which nickel is the most significant. As of March 31, 2022, Neles had outstanding nickel swaps amounting to 288 tons (312 tons in 2021). The sensitivity analysis of the commodity prices based on financial instruments under IFRS 7 comprises the net aggregate amount of commodities bought through forward contracts and swaps but excludes the anticipated future consumption of raw materials. A 10 percent change upwards or downwards in commodity prices would have effects, net of taxes, of EUR +/ - 0.6 million to income statement in March 31, 2022 (EUR +/ - 0.4 million to income statement in 2021). Hedge accounting is not applied to nickel agreements, and the change in the fair value is recorded through profit and loss. Other commodity risks are not managed using financial derivative instruments. Credit and counterparty risk Credit or counterparty risk is defined as the possibility of a customer or a financial counterparty not fulfilling its commitments towards Neles. The operating units of Neles are primarily responsible for credit risks pertaining to sales and procurement activities. The units assess the credit quality of their customers, b y taking into account their financial position, past experience and other relevant factors. When appropriate, advance payments, letters of credit and third - party guarantees, or credit insurance are used to mitigate credit risks. Group Treasury provides cen tralized services related to customer financing and seeks to ensure that the principles of the Treasury Policy are adhered to with respect to terms of payment and required collateral. Neles has no significant concentrations of credit risks. The maximum cr edit risk equals the carrying value of trade and loan receivables. The credit quality is evaluated both on the basis of aging of the trade receivables and also on the basis of customer specific analysis. The aging structure of trade receivables is presente d in note 2.2. Counterparty risk arises also from financial transactions agreed upon with banks, financial institutions and corporates. Financial Statements Neles Corporation - Final Accounts 2022 60 The risk is managed by careful selection of banks and other counterparties, by counterparty specific limits determined in the Treasury Policy, and netting agreements such as ISDA (Master agreement of International Swaps and Derivatives Association). The compliance with counterparty limits is regularly monitored. Credit risk exposure relates to carrying value of financial assets valued at amortized cost, such as trade receivables, interest bearing receivables, other receivables, deposits and security investments and cash and cash equivalents, and customer contract assets. Impairment on cash at hand, bank accounts, deposi ts and interest -bearing investments is assessed regularly, but seen minor, because of their high investment grade and short duration. Group Treasury makes a financial analysis of corporate counterparties regularly. In addition, the investments are constant ly monitored by Group Treasury and Neles does not expect any future credit losses from these investments. For trade receivables and customer contract assets Neles applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses a lif etime expected loss allowance to be assessed and recognized regularly, see note 2.2. Fair value estimatio n For those financial assets and liabilities which have been recognized at fair value in the balance sheet, the following measurement hierarchy and valuation methods have been applied: Level 1 Quoted unadjusted prices at the balance sheet date in active markets. The market prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, market information service system, pr icing service or regulatory agency. The quoted market price used for financial assets is the current bid price. Level 1 financial instruments include fund investments classified as fair value through profit and loss. Level 2 The fair value of financial instruments in Level 2 is determined using valuation techniques. These techniques utilize observable market data readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, market information service system, pricing servic e or regulatory agency. Level 2 financial instruments include: Over -the-counter derivatives classified as financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit and loss or qualified for hedge accounting Debt securities classified as financial instrumen ts at fair value through profit and loss Fixed rate debt under fair value hedge accounting Level 3 A financial instrument is categorized into Level 3 if the calculation of the fair value cannot be based on observable market data. Neles had no such instruments in 1-3/2022 or in 2021.

Reclassification of the categories will be made only, if the busi ness model for managing those assets changes. Financial assets and liabilities are classified as non -current items, when the remaining maturity exceeds 12 months and as current items, when the remaining maturity is 12 months or less. Financial assets and liabilities are classified as follows: A) At amortized cost Financial assets Financial assets valued at amortized cost are investments in debt instruments or receivables, which are held end of maturity and for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows are solely payments of principal and/or interest. These are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effec tive interest method. Interest income is recognized as financial income in income statement. Financial assets at amortized cost include depo sit, commercial papers, interest bearing loans and receivables, trade receivables and non -interest bearing receivables. Impairment is assessed regularly and when the carrying value exceed the recoverable value of discounted cash flows, appropriate impairme nt is recognized in income statement. For trade receivables, Neles applies the simplified method in IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables. See more in note 2.2. Financial liabilities Issued bonds and withdrawn loan facilities from financial institutions as well as trade and other liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Trade and other receivables are non -interest bearing short -term unpaid debts. The difference, between the debt amount net transaction cost recognized of bonds and loans from financial institutions and the redemption amount, is recognized in income statement as interest cost over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized in the income statement as other finance expense over the period of the facility, or, if the withdrawn of the loan is probable, as part of transaction cost. B) At fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) Financial assets Financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income are debt instruments or receivables, which are held for collection of contractual cash flows or held for selling the assets, and where contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and/or interest. Interest income is recognized in income statement using the effective interest method. Cha nge in fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). At the derecognition, the cumulative previously booked gains and losses in OCI are released from equity to income statement. Neles includes in this measurement category derivatives under hedge accounting, trade receivables for sale and security investments with maturity less than three months. Impairment is assessed regularly and when the carrying value exceed s the recoverable value of discounted cash flows, appropriate impairment is recog nized in income statement . This financial asset measurement category has been applied only for discontinued operations. C) At fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) Financial assets Financial assets valued at fair value through profit and loss are equity investments, investments in funds and derivatives not under hedge accounting. Change in fair value and gain or loss at the derecognition will be recognized in income statement. The change in the fair value includes the valuation of the impairment risk as well. Fair value of listed equity shares or investments in funds is the quoted market price on the balance sheet date. Unlisted shares are valued at cost less impairment, if any. Financial liabilities Fixed rate debts covered by fair value hedges accounting and derivatives not under hedge accounting are included in this measurement category. Change in fair value and gains or losses at derecognition will be recognized in income statement .

These commercial papers deposit and debt investments have maturity less than twelve months, and they are measured at amortized cost. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and bank accounts, deposits and interest bearing investments, which are easily convertible to known amount of cash within the period of three months or less as well as bond fund invest ments, with the same risk profile. Cash on hand, bank accounts, deposits and interest bearing investments are measured at amortized cost . The bond fund investments are measured at fair value through profit and loss accounts . Impairment on cash on hand, bank accounts, deposits and interest bearing investments is assessed regularly, but seen minor, because of their high investment grade and short duration.

Own shares held by the Parent Company valued at the historical acquisition price are deducted from equity. Should such shares be subsequently sold or reissued, the consi deration received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs and related income tax, is recorded in equity. Translation differences The translation differences arising from subsidiary net investments and non -current subsidiary loans without agreed settlement dates are recognized through the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) to cumulative translation adjustments under equity. When Neles hedges the net investment of its foreign subsidiaries with foreign currency loans and with financial derivatives, t he translation difference is adjusted by the currency effect of the hedging instruments which has been recorded, net of taxes, through OCI in equity. When a foreign entity is disposed of, the respective accumulated translation difference, including the eff ect from qualifying hedging instruments, is reversed through OCI and recognized in the consolidated statements of income as part of the gain or loss on the sale. If the equity of a subsidiary denominated in a foreign currency is reduced by a return of capital, the translation difference relating to the reduction is reversed through OCI and recognized in the consolidated statements of income . Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors are recognized annually after the shareholders ' approval in th e Annual General Meeting.

The legal reserve consists of restricted equity, which has been transferred from distributable funds unde r the Articles of Association, local company act or by a decision of the shareholders. The other reserves consist of the distributable fund and the invested non -restricted equity fund held by the Parent Company.

The difference, between the debt amount recognized and the redemption amount, is recognized in income statement as interest expense over the period of the borrowings . A portion of long -term debt is classified as short -term debt, when the settlement of the liability is due within 12 months from the balance sheet date. Borrowings are derecognized only if the contractual obligation is discharged, cancell ed, or expired . Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized in income statement as other finance expense over the period of the facility, or, if the withdrawal of the loan is probable, as part of transaction cost. Transaction costs arising from modification to debt instruments are included in the carrying value of the debt and amortized using the effective interest method over the remaining period of the modified liability provided that the new conditions obtained through the modification do not substantially differ from those of the original debt. Modification gain or loss will be recognized in income statement at the time of non -substantial modification . Lease liabilities Neles recognizes lease liabilities to mak e lease payments for the right-of-use assets rented to use in Neles operations. On the commence date of the lease, Neles recognize lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease. Lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable payments that depend on an index or a rate and amounts expected payments under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of purchase options when exercise is estimated to be reasonably certain and penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the exercise of a termination option. In calculating the present value of lease payments, Neles uses the incremental borrowing rate at the commence date, because the implicit interest rate in the lease contracts cannot be readily determined. Subsequently, lease liabilities are increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. The carrying val ue of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification of the contract, a change in the lease term or a change in the assessment of usage of an option.

Derivatives are designated at inception as derivatives at fair value through profit and loss that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria. Derivatives are classified as non -current ass ets or liabilities when the remaining maturities exceed 12 months and as current assets or liabilities when the remaining maturities are less than 12 months. Derivatives at fair value through profit and loss These instruments, which have been contracted to mitigate risks arising from operating and financing activities, comprise foreign exchange forward contracts, currency and interest rate options, interest rate swaps and swap agreements for nickel. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps are recog nized in interest expenses. Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts are mainly recognized in other operating income and expenses. However, when the foreign exchange forwards have been contracted to mitigate the exchange rate risks a rising from foreign currency denominated cash and from financial instruments used for cash management, the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recognized in financial income and expenses. Changes in the Financial Statements Neles Corporation - Final Accounts 2022 68 fair value of other derivative instruments s uch as commodity instruments are recognized in other operating income and expenses. Fair value estimation of derivative instruments The fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves. The fair value of the commodity forwards and swaps are based on quoted market prices at th e balance sheet date. The fair value of options is determined using Black -Scholes valuation model.

Financial Statements Neles Corporation - Final Accounts 2022 69 Consolidation 5.1 Principles of consolidation Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Parent Company and each of those companies over which Neles exercises control. Control is achieved when Neles is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from the investee and can affect those returns through its power over the investee. The companies acquired during the financial period have been consolidated from the date Neles acquired control. Subsidiaries sold or distributed to the owners have been included up to their dat e of disposal . All intercompany transactions, balances and gains or losses on transactions between subsidiaries are eliminated as part of the consolidation process. Non -controlling interests are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity, separate from equity attributable to shareholders. Non - controlling interests are separately disclosed in the consolidated statement of income. Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The purchase consideration of an acqui sition is measured at fair value over the assets given up, shares issued, or liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition. For each acquisition, the non -controlling interest in the acquiree, if any, can be recognized either at fair value or a t the non -controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets. The excess acquisition price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill (see also intangible assets). If the purchase consideration is less than th e fair value of the Group's share of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognized directly through profit and loss account . When Neles ceases to have control, any retained interest in equity is re -measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addi tion, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity is accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities . Non-controlling interest Transactions with non-controlling interests are regarded as transactions with equity owners. In the case of purchases from non -controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share of the carrying value of net assets acquired in the sub sidiary is recorded in shareholders' equity. Gains or losses on disposal to non - controlling interests are also recorded directly in shareholders' equity. Non-current assets or disposal group held -for-sale Neles classifies a non -current asset or disposal g roup as held for sale if it's carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. These assets are valued at the lower of it carrying value and fair value less costs to sell, and assets subject to de preciation or amortization are no longer amortized. Assets related to non-current assets, or a disposal group classified a held -for- sale are disclosed separately from other assets, but financial statements for prior periods are not reclassified. Foreign cu rrency translation Neles' F inancial Statements are presented in euros, which is the parent company's functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. At the end of the reporting period, unsettled foreign currency transaction balances are valued at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Trade related foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in other operating income and expenses, unless the foreign currency denominated transactions are subject to hedge accounting, in which case the related exchange gains and losses are recorded in the same line item as the hedged transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses associated with financing ar e entered as a net amount under financial income and expenses. The statement of income of a subsidiar y with a functional currency different from the presentation currency is translated into euros at the average of the month end exchange rate for the financial year, and the balance sheet is translated at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. This exchange rate difference is recorded through other comprehensive income (OCI) within cumulative translation adjustments under equity. Net investment hedge The translation differences arising from subsidiary net investments and long -term subsidiary loans without agreed settlement dates are recognized through OCI within cumulative translation adjustments under equi ty. Neles may hedge its net foreign investments in certain currencies to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations. The hedging instruments are mainly foreign currency loans and foreign currency forward contracts. Both realized and unrealized excha nge gains and losses measured on these instruments are recorded, net of taxes, through OCI in a separate component of equity against the translation differences arising from consolidation to the extent these hedges are effective. The interest portion of de rivatives qualifying as hedges of net investment is recognized under financial income and expenses. When a foreign entity is disposed of, the respective accumulated translation difference, including the effect from qualifying h edging instruments, is reversed through OCI and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as part of the gain or loss on the sale. If the equity of a foreign currency denominated subsidiary is reduced by reimbursement of invested funds, the transl ation difference relating to the reduction is reversed through OCI and recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Net investment hedges have not been executed in 2022 or 2021. .
