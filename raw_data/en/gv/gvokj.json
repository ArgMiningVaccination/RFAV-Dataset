If so, as the name of a recently invented musical instrument, it would not be capitalized. (I removed the dead-end wikipedia link that was placed there.)

[\u2014Stephen](/wiki/User:Stephen_G._Brown) 23:58, 1 November 2006 (UTC) - Everything related to [w:Jason Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Grant)looks highly suspicious to me (self-promotion IMO). Google yields really poor results when searching for \"marching pipe organ\" or \"jay-bay organ\" and the vast majority is a copy of the WP article.

Any Americans recognize this spelling, or should it be marked as 'Cheifly British' (or something)? -- As to it being a typo: it is the name used for the food as I described it. I've no idea of its etymology. - I'm looking at the takeaway menu of my local tandoori, and there it is. I have seen other spellings though.

There does not seem to be any perfect solution. I believe that the number and quality of hits from Google would suggest that the entry should stay, but, as others have pointed out, there are several other ways to spell the name of this dish and some of those will also define a different dish, particularly if it is from an alternative cuisine. If you care to look at the entry for 'papadom' you will see a most egregious example of the extent of the problem. At the moment, if anyone comes here looking for a definition, they have a 1 in 36 chance of finding it. Even I have to go to the index of Indian food to get there as I can't remember which spelling I used for the headword. This is a particularly extreme example but it does indicate the nature of the problem. I did suggest the inclusion of a tool for situations like this but it was met with only negative response. I still believe that Wiktionary should provide such a tool as it it would be very helpful, especially to non-English speaker, given the rather baroque nature of the language's spelling and is one way of using the fact that Wictionary is an 'on-line' technology to differentiate it from the traditional paper approach. [Moglex](/wiki/User:Moglex) 09:46, 5 November 2006 (UTC) - Erm, what do you mean? Enter \"puppadom\" in the search box, press [Go] and you will be prompted to either create the page of go (further down the page) to our entry for [papadom](/wiki/papadom).

The use, looking at web references, is evidently expanding to include other drugs, but that might be just a regional thing. Going back to the original cartoon - and thus the reference - \"Scooby's\" middle name of \"Doobie\" was a reference to his favourite drug of choice!

The senses are (summarised): \"obsolete: preserved ginger; a kind of cake flavoured with ginger; something showy unsubstantial; of tansy; slang: money\".

The [cookie](/wiki/cookie)material, on the other hand, is dense and flat, having a thickness measured in millimeters. Additionally, while both use [ginger](/wiki/ginger)as an ingredient for flavoring, they have different flavors. The word refers both to the construction material for the cookies (a gumdrop castle made of gingerbread and icing) where it is uncountable, and also to the cake and servings of the cake (Pass me a piece of gingerbread. or We baked a gingerbread for the potluck luncheon.)

The first sense may well be valid. - One way to check whether it is a typo is to see if it's consistent. If there's only one or two examples of \"frictive\" in a book that otherwise uses \"fricative\", it's a typo. If \"frictive\" occurs consistently throughout the book, it's probably intentional and merits conclusion. Runes and Germanic Linguistics has \"fricative\" on pages 9, 88, and 305, but \"frictive\" occurs only once on page 101. Conversely, Development and Evolution: Complexity and Change in Biology has \"frictive\" on pages 107, 136, and 268, while \"fricative\" doesn't occur at all. - At least some cases of frictive might be hypercorrections: Classical Latin [frico](/wiki/frico)\"to rub\" had an irregular past participle [frictus](/wiki/frictus), which regularly would have been [fricatus](/wiki/fricatus). -- [Ptcamn](/w/index.php?title=User:Ptcamn&action=edit&redlink=1)23:45, 10 November 2006 (UTC) - It was either Hippietrail or RichardB? who used to argue that there's no such thing as a misspelling. Indeed we haven't defined it for ourselves, for our purposes. From the [definition](/wiki/misspell), how do we judge when the spelling is incorrect? What Ptcamn says above is the closest anyone has come to a clear objective judgement. I personally don't think an inconsistent spelling should count towards an RFV citation. That still leaves the issue of consistent misspellings though. Counting those, RFV might still result in the inclusion of the word. The key point is that it wouldn't say how it should be labeled. Does it make sense to refuse an inconsistent spelling as a typographical error, and at the same time label a perfectly cited definition as a misspelling? [DAVilla](/wiki/User:DAVilla)07:08, 13 November 2006 (UTC) - It was either Hippietrail or RichardB? who used to argue that there's no such thing as a misspelling. Indeed we haven't defined it for ourselves, for our purposes. From the How do we support the conclusion that using books.google.com as a resource is inappropriate here? - \"frictive\" is clearly a misspelling (since no other dictionary has it, and since as Ptcamn points out, the usage in those books isn't consistent). - We don't list misspellings as \"words\", except perhaps in the case of extremely widespread misspellings. - Three print citations is proof that a word may be included, not a mandate that a random string of characters must be included. - There's no hard-and-fast rule for how common a misspelling must be before we'll include it, but it's probably more than \"three print citations\".

Without being an expert in horticulture, my reading tends to indicate that Morning Glory can refer to any of these genera. As such, the definition should stand. [DrX] 09:12, 27 November 2006 (UTC) - Though one variety of Convolvulus hederaceus in the first edition (1753) of Linnaeus's Species Plantarum was assumed to correspond to Ipomoea nil, in the second edition (1763), the academic name of Convolvulus nil L. to Ipomoea nil was first recorded, as was that of Convolvulus purpureus L. to Ipomoea purpurea. Linnaeus mentioned Ipomoea was North America. As the Convolvulus of Linnaeus was recognized to have considerably heterogeneous species by later taxonomic studies, the genus Calystegia was newly proposed and some species included in Convolvulus were moved to Ipomoea or to the new Calystegia. Roth moved Convolvulus nil L. and Convolvulus purpureus L. into genus Ipomoea in 1797. Thus the name of the morning glory became Ipomoea nil (L.) Roth.

The Australian newspapers I've looked up don't allow boolean searches, and on Google books results can be narrowed down with extra search terms but then the quotations can't pulled without some effort, which due to the common use of Nang as a name makes the search futile. - The original RFV applied to the entire page.

The principle authority for deletions, and multiple deletions in particular, is that which originates from an objective standard decided by the community, to the extent empowered. That standard includes speedy reversals of clear garbage, with reactive rather than prescriptive review, and this process to bring verification requests before that community and, perhaps more importantly, to the attention of the contributor(s) so they might know that decisions are not arbitrary. The perception of fairness can do more to win over a contributor than any hostility. - This process requires that the page exist with notice for a month, and while deleting potentially legitimate terms may not have had consequences in the past, and with such short resources may continue to go unchallenged for some time, that does not equate to community support. Granted, I do believe that an overwhelming majority of sysop decisions are made not only in good faith but correctly. I do not mean to be rebellious in my views. My objections are made purely on a matter of principal. If this term had only been allowed to go through the process then it would probably be no less dead by now than it currently is. In fact, it would be more dead: it wouldn't be turning in its grave. And frankly sneevil graves don't make good test beds because they rather stink. But that's not the point. - Subjective determinations of fitness are necessary and yes, most likely even correct in this case. However, we should strive for objective determinations when our reasoning is brought into doubt. And furthermore we should be reaching out to new contributors, or at least communicating with them more directly, which is something a blacklist of entries doesn't accomplish very well. Now I'd think it unlikely that this term would be resubmitted only because it appears to be so isolated. But if it were, then I would wonder if there were something we'd missed, and I would want the procedures to reflect that self-doubt.

OED2 is not infallible, but it should take some very solid evidence to show that it's wrong. - The difficulty is that you can never prove that there are insufficient cites available to meet our CFI, only that they have not yet been found and entered, so the burden of proof of adequate and appropriate actual usage must remain with a word's defenders. The presence of a word in a reputable small dictionary is persuasive that it is (or has been) used by at least a few people in the sense shown. The presence of a word in the full OED merely implies that at least one person has used or an earlier dictionary has defined the word with that spelling and meaning. Many of these words will therefore not meet our normal CFI. - So I agree with Connel that presence in the full OED should not imply that a word has met our CFI (and indeed, it is no longer mentioned on our CFI page). However, the cites in OED do give useful clues, eg likely dates, when searching for our own cites. Also, the relative number of cites gives a clue re whether an archaic word is likely to meet our CFI (for words still in use we can usually find more cites easily, but finding on-line-accessible cites for a word or meaning not used since 1900 is difficult, and I usually only manage 1 or 2 for every 3 in OED2).

Meanwhile, - Reread your cites in context, and you will find that none of them support any of the meanings you give. In the \"Drifting About\" cite, narf has the meaning and a half, with the preceeding numeral assumed. The link to the cite from \"The Globe\" is actually a b.g.c. hit list which does not even contain the work you claim. Without any further context, the quote appears to use narf-narf as a misspelling of 'arf an' 'arf meaning half half. In \"Little Warrior\", Amateur Gentleman\" and \"BBC\" cites, a narf is a misspelled an 'arf, meaning a half. - In the \"World Encyclopedia of Beer\" cite, which is in any case mention rather than use, and so does not help meet CFI, narfer narfer narf is a misspelled an 'arf of 'arf an 'arf, ie a half pint of half and half. Incidentally, I am somewhat dubious of the book's claim that this is an \"East London\" usage (assuming they are referring to London, England). Most pubs in East London serve bitter and lager, but not mild. Also, most cockneys drink pints, not halves. If it were used, it would be as a joke. - So I repeat, none of the \"cites\" support any of the claimed definitions, even as misspellings. - If you want to add a definition of a narf as what I call a misspelling of an 'arf, meaning a half, then you do have three cites supporting it. However, at present, misspellings do not meet CFI unless they are very common, so that is unlikely to be accepted either.

But there are still no cites (and I believe no usage, certainly not in London) of narf meaning A half each of two beers, such as porter and ale or mild and bitter. Frequently used with pint. Possible contraction of arf-and-arf.

This pseudo-word does not appear in any English [dictionary](/wiki/dictionary). Why? Because it simply doesn't exist. Just look at the [synonyms](/wiki/synonyms): Polophobia. This word seems to concat [Poland](/wiki/Poland) and [phobia](/wiki/phobia), but accordingly would mean [fear](/wiki/fear) for Poles and not \" [hatred](/wiki/hatred) towards\".

I could not first believe my own eyes. Well... Except for Americanism - an ideological construct coined in the USA (hence anti-Americanism), in all other instances the ending -ism indicates a condition, a disease or ideology. Hence we have imperialism, communism, tribalism, sexism, dwarfism, cretinism, etc. For the word anti-Polonism to exist (no English dictionary is aware of its existence), there must then be an ideology, condition or disease that can be termed polonism. Reading some Wikipedia pages and communicating with nationals of a certain country convinced me that the grave disease that can be classified as polonism indeed exists. Luckily it is not contagious and the circle of sufferers is limited to members of one specific group. Perhaps the disease is passed genetically but the exact manner in which it is transferred is yet unknown to the science (in fact even the word is unknown). If you let the logic of word formation run freely, then anti-Polonism must be a body of science should be tasked with treatment and hopefully with eventual eradication of polonism. - Rfvfailed, deleted. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)01:33, 4 January 2007 (UTC) Seems to be very recent; most references are to Mark Shuttleworth, who apparently uses this as his IRC handle.

Or does that need to backed up numerically somehow? -- - It's hard to say. I don't think we have firm policy on when to use tags like those, nor can we. I wouldn't argue too strongly against labeling it \"rare\", although I would ask that we make sure we understand exactly what the label would be intended to accomplish. \u2014 - So after some digging, it stays. OK. Should it be marked as \"rare\" or \"uncommon\" or do you think the current listing is accurate? -- - And three more. (It wasn't so hard, after all. And the usage is not as archaic as I thought.) \u2014 - rfvpassed, note added, rfv tag removed. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)06:52, 19 December 2006 (UTC) - rfv re-asserted. Entry has been POV edited in direct conflict with all of the above discusson. Since I need a wikibreak, I would like to simply rollback the latest edit and get another \"Request for de-sysopping\" but that would probably result in leaving the Wiktionary entry broken. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)00:18, 31 December 2006 (UTC) - I'm amazed that no other sysop has taken action on this. He has had numerous warnings regarding his habit of ignoring discussions, and has previously exerted his incorrect POV in this content dispute. His refusal to participate is no reason for his incorrect POV to have any mention on this entry. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)18:12, 3 January 2007 (UTC) - I'm amazed that no other sysop has taken action on this.

Restored correct version. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)10:15, 2 February 2007 (UTC) Not in other on-line dictionaries, not too many b.g.c. hits - the preponderance of them seem to be specific to psychiatry? Is the definition given wrong, (even after my edit) or too narrow? Or is it not a word? -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie) 04:34, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - It does seem to have some specialized use. I have changed the definition from that of a verb to that of a noun. [SemperBlotto](/wiki/User:SemperBlotto)08:28, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - Citations please. I have moved the discussion to March. [Andrew massyn](/wiki/User:Andrew_massyn)12:41, 11 March 2007 (UTC) Any takers? Needs formatting. [SemperBlotto](/wiki/User:SemperBlotto) 10:39, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - I often spell/misspell it this way. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)18:26, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - Ugh. I'd forgotten what a mess -- er, kludge -- this situation is. \"Kluge\" is not just an alternative spelling of \"kludge\"; it's the correct, original spelling of kludge! (And though it is indeed based on a German word, as [User:130.119.248.12](/w/index.php?title=User:130.119.248.12&action=edit&redlink=1)speculates in the skeletal entry at [kluge](/wiki/kluge), it's a word for \"clever\", not \"dumb\"!) See the Jargon File's careful explanation at [http://catb.org/jargon//html/K/kluge.html](http://catb.org/jargon//html/K/kluge.html); there is also some discussion at [w:Kludge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kludge). - Ugh. I'd forgotten what a mess -- er, kludge -- this situation is. \"Kluge\" is not just an alternative spelling of \"kludge\"; it's the correct, original spelling of kludge!

[bd2412](/wiki/User:BD2412) [T](/wiki/User_talk:BD2412) 16:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - But is it English or French? [SemperBlotto](/wiki/User:SemperBlotto)16:43, 30 November 2006 (UTC) Any takers? Google hits seem to be of the form \"not a no one\" - the opposite of the definition. [SemperBlotto](/wiki/User:SemperBlotto) 17:00, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - If it were marked with what dialect it is intended for, I might be inclined to include it (or at least search for some cites) as a set phrase in that dialect. But it isn't. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)18:24, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - Perhaps the creator of the entry made a mistake for [not a one](/wiki/not_a_one). -- [Ptcamn](/w/index.php?title=User:Ptcamn&action=edit&redlink=1)19:25, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - Sorry, I misheard, apparently, a Futurama scene with Truman (\"a single consipracy nutter no one will believe\") and misinterpreted a couple of those Google results, including [this](http://www.sheckymagazine.com/atom.xml)ambiguous one. Wasn't trying to invent anything here, just thought it wasn't too common and had been left out. [DAVilla](/wiki/User:DAVilla)21:12, 30 November 2006 (UTC) Move to [WT:LOP](/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:LOP&action=edit&redlink=1)? -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie) 19:00, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - Zero Google hits - not even a protologism yet - deleted. [SemperBlotto](/wiki/User:SemperBlotto)20:00, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - I'll forward that irate e-mail to you. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)22:08, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - Received. We'll just have to wait for those print citations. Unless [WT:CFI](/wiki/Wiktionary:CFI)doesn't apply in this instance? [SemperBlotto](/wiki/User:SemperBlotto)09:33, 1 December 2006 (UTC) - Received. We'll just have to wait for those print citations. Unless - I'll forward that irate e-mail to you. -- Wrong capitalization, too. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie) 19:40, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - Zero supporting hits from Google Books and Google Groups searches (it is, however, apparently used in the lyrics of a song by Eminem, where it's meaning is unclear, possibly a misspelling for [blow](/wiki/blow).) Blow away bloah, please. -- [Jeffqyzt](/wiki/User:Jeffqyzt)21:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC) - deleted -- [EncycloPetey](/wiki/User:EncycloPetey)01:49, 3 February 2007 (UTC) - deleted -- English? Initial glance at b.g.c. suggests otherwise. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie) 22:44, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - Crossover word, in increasing usage, esp. in the American Southwest where there's a strong Spanish influence. It's used with some frequency (though I can't remember whether in italics or not) in the novella The Peace War, by [Vernor Vinge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge). My (WASP) parents use \"Jefe\" as a nickname for their (WASP) son-in-law Jeff. (But I can't provide cites for any of this just now.) \u2014 [scs](/wiki/User:Scs)23:11, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - Yes, borrowed.

Any way to strip out the proper noun and italicized entries from that search query? The first one looks like it may be a borrowing, but a cursory glance at the others turns up nothing. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)16:31, 4 December 2006 (UTC) - Yeah, I'm sorry that only a fraction of them are worth anything. Narrowing it down well takes many more terms and doesn't give that much better of results. Write Google about the capitals (and punctuation too is a pain or impossible). I guess I've just gotten kinda good at screening them with my eyes. But what do you mean by \"the others\"? There are 3480 hits! Your cursory glance must have been on the first page only, and no, there may not be exactly what you want there, certainly not three. With a minor tweak in the search [[28]](http://books.google.com/books?q=jefe+many+OR+much+OR+lots+-politico+-con+-sin+-por&as_brr=0)there's just one that's adequate, if you would want to settle for adequate given such a large quantity of hits. Still, what's seen immediately isn't that far from what you're asking, and there are a couple of completely legitimate citations in only the first few pages. (Yes, I've looked. Actually adding them to the page takes some time.) I'm used to making a lot out of nothing, and seeing these results I think, \"Gold!\" ... so much so that it really seems like a waste of time finishing the process. I mean, look at how big this page is. Maybe you haven't run across [jefe](/wiki/jefe), but having heard it as a borrowed word in English, I'm not really worried about the future of this entry.

One could say that all activities on en.wiktionary.org are a \"waste of time\", but yes, there is value to finishing the process, particularly because it is hard now. As b.g.c. adds more texts, finding non-italicized entries will only become harder. -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie)18:18, 5 December 2006 (UTC) - I would not call this \"clearly widespread use\" by any stretch of the imagination.

[DAVilla](/wiki/User:DAVilla)18:59, 5 December 2006 (UTC) - A good three hours later, I see the other dictionaries already have these definitions. Why didn't we look there first? Well, I hope you enjoy the cites. None italicized or quoted, and even divided by meaning now, with the second a quite a bit harder to reference. Maybe that distinction makes it worthwhile. RFV passed for Christ's sake. [DAVilla](/wiki/User:DAVilla)22:19, 5 December 2006 (UTC) - Okay, okay... you're right it's not obvious, so no sense not doing it. Also wrong capitalization, also lists only UD as a \"reference.\" -- [Connel MacKenzie](/wiki/User:Connel_MacKenzie) 23:05, 30 November 2006 (UTC) - Removed the unreference.
