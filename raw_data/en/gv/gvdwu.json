Whether you want to cut through the clutter of life or get some guidance on getting your book published, she's a wealth of information. At minimum you will be inspired to take action! I highly recommend her and Bali is a great place to create new opportunities on life's journey. It was really hard for me to write a concise review because there is SO much to say about Taksu, which many can say is \"everythingland\". So I'll try to keep it short, sweet, and brutally honest. Happiness Talk and Theta Healing with Erika: Theta healing is one of the most powerful, efficient and targeted forms of therapy I know. It released in minutes what has taken me years in psychotherapy. In a nutshell it's like belief system transplant. We identified belief systems that get in my way, released them, then replaced them with positive ones. It's really that easy! Totally painless, didn't force me to relive my traumas (thank God!) and I immediately felt lighter, happier, and much more liberated. I've noticed major shifts in my relationships, my decision-making and my self-worth after just one session. Erika's Tuesday night talk, Happiness, is a great sampler to Theta Healing and gives you a chance to release some belief systems (bonus: it's free!). Definitely worth checking out! Youthing Classes and Somalogy with Tyr: Tyr transformed the way I connect with my body. Having suffered from constant chest, shoulder and leg pain, my first default is to always get a massage, but Tyr helped me realize that the solution comes from the way we carry ourselves in our daily lives. Youthing is based on the concept that our age is determined by our posture. At 24, I wasn't sure I needed this class, but boy, was I wrong! In his Youthing Class and Somalogy sessions, Tyr gives you practical exercises to help you live in your best alignment every day. The way he teaches makes your body remember. Once you experience correct alignment, you simply never want to go back. Nutritional Counseling with Dr. Liana: Dr. Liana has a background in Western Medicine (MD), Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurvedic Medicine, Yoga Therapy... Everything under the sun. So her evaluations come from a very holistic and sophisticated point of view. She makes you realize how everything in your body really IS all connected-- for example, problems with your spleen is connected to grief-- things I never even thought about, and now it's making me look at my emotional state in a whole new way because I'm realizing how unresolved issues can REALLY harm my body. She also helps you identify your body composition and advises you on what types of foods can help you reach more balance in your life. She has a very honest and straightforward approach, and you can tell all her advice is coming from a very well-researched and experienced place. Bars with Lela: To be honest I still don't completely understand what happens during a Bars session but basically, Lela shifts some molecules in your head. There's a little bit of touch involved but the rest is energetic. Your job as a client is just to just lie there and be open. I didn't feel much at first but towards the end my pineal gland was PULSING. Something definitely shifted. After the session Lela gave me her brochure with a list of questions to help us explore the many \"beautiful, expansive possibilities of life.\" Questions include \"how can it get any better than this?\" and \"what else is possible?\" As I started to ask myself those questions that night, my imagination went wild. I felt free from the mental box I used to live in. Whether or not those fantasies came true, I felt like I was living in a much freer space. I felt excited like a child again, and I could sincerely believe that anything really IS possible. Reinvent your Life Workshop and Life Coaching with Barbara: The exact opposite from Bars, Barbara gives you concrete and directed tools to get from point A to point B. Her fun and powerful workshop helps you gain perspective on what you want and how to make it happen. Barbara is a high energy and very practical person. She combines the teachings of Louise Hay, Tony Robbins, and other spiritual or self-development gurus to equip you with tools that can transform your habits and your life. She truly gets you excited for change, freedom, and a new life path! Sound Healing: This is easily one of my favorite things to do in Ubud. The Bali Sound Healers Collective brings together talented musicians from around the world, creating unique and unforgettable sound journeys at Taksu every Thursday and Sunday evening. My experiences have ranged from deep relaxation to intense visual journeys and unexplainable full-body bliss. Every session is a surprise. Definitely a must-try in Ubud! Spa Treatments In Asia, massages could be very hit-or-miss, but not at Taksu! You can tell the masseurs are meticulously trained and my experiences have all been very relaxing and enjoyable. So far I've tried Pulse Point Balancing, Ayurvedic Massage, Ozone Therapy, Ozone Facial, Lymphatic Massage, Mani/ Pedi, and my favorite... the Esalen Massage. The treatments aren't the cheapest, but for the five-star hotel quality it is definitely a steal! Overall I find Taksu to be a great place to relax and heal, whether it is through a massage or a kind of \"out there\" energetic therapy. If you're new to the healing world, it's definitely a good place to start because the healers have lots of integrity and experience (which you need to pay extra attention to in a place like Ubud.) The the ambiance isn't as trendy or cool as Yoga Barn or Alchemy Holistic, but that's kind of what I like about it. It's just a quiet space that isn't crowded or scene-y. It's a chill little sanctuary where you can really take time to unwind and embody the spirit of vacation. I have had many many facials around the world and more recently in Bali. Taksu is a spa haven with the loveliest Baines therapists. It was an authentic Bainese style treatment with the freshest natural ingredients. All explained in detail to me with the steps explained prior to application. Great care and attention is given to check for skin type and allergies. Excellent English. I just drifted into heaven for the hour. A wonderful surprise was the soothing arm and hand massage. Not like others in Ubud where they leave you in the bed while the mask is activating. They are with you all the way thru. I am particular about what I look at. Even the ceiling is pretty. Soothing music, beautiful tropical garden surroundsound and a refreshing Jamu or ginger tea after your treatment. All this for what price? Just $25 a fraction of treatments in Australia or NZ. Ask for Rika she is a delightful therapist and for group bookings check in with Barbara. Thank you for your kind feedback. A lot of our guests are pleasantly surprised by the great value we offer, especially considering our luxury surroundings and the fact that all our spa professionals are internationally trained and accredited. We work constantly to improve and streamline our services and we're thrilled that we've exceeded your expectations. Next time you're in Ubud, it would be our pleasure to welcome you again. I contacted Taksu through their FB page & they responded straight away. My husband suffers with chronic pain & some days really struggles to move & do things. He is on 'traditional' treatments methods at home in Australia, so we thought he could try something different; what better place to try than in Ubud. The staff recommended that my husband speak with Tyr Throne as he is an expert with neck & back chronic pain patients. I was more than happy as the reviews about Tyr's work on TA were nothing short of amazing; I was hoping that my husband could experience the same thing. We met with Tyr over 2 hours & what an education that was! Tyr is all about posture & how we carry ourselves when we sit; stand; walk etc & he taught us that much of the pain we experience in our necks & back is simply bad habits we've picked up over the years. Tyr taught my husband how he can improve the level of his pain through a few simple posture changes which would if regularly practiced become second nature. Tyr didn't sugar coat it for my husband & didn't give him any delusion he was going to completely heal him; he told him how he could improve his pain if the effort was put in. Tyr was an absolute gentleman & a master of his craft; we will be keeping in touch with him to keep him posted on my husbands progress. Highly recommend visiting Taksu; it will make you think differently about pain & how it can be improved with only a few simple techniques. An exotic location was only the first pleasure I experienced at Taksu. My massage was totally amazing, perhaps challenging for some. I felt a million dollars afterward. My therapist Dek Ani was very skilled and I would highly recommend her. It was our pleasure to welcome you to our jungle paradise Nat. Dek Ani will be thrilled to receive your kind feedback and we look forward to welcoming you again, the next time you visit Ubud. I went to Ubud for a detox retreat that included several different activities and sessions, such as yoga, meditation, massages, sauna etc. I decided to visit a healer while in Ubud to see if I could get some clarity I hadn't had previously. I searched the web for different types of healers and their specialties and recommendations. Erika had received some very positive reviews, so I looked into Theta Healing practices and decided to make a few appointments with her. I am very happy, I did that! While I did not know exactly what to expect, except some insights into my current situation, I was not disappointed. Erika used a simple technique to bypass my brain by asking verbal questions but receiving the answers from my physical reaction. She meditated briefly at times to focus on some possible answers, and I was impressed at how well she could provide useful insight and suggestions to how I could move forward. Even after the first session, I left Taksu feeling lighter and calmer. I will recommend more than one session. As with all personal development, the first meeting will help with the immediate symptoms you feel, but the second and third time I met with Erika, we dealt with root causes more than symptoms, and I left the third session feeling I had gone through a bigger development process in a couple of days than I had gone through the past two years (also, Erika has a very good offer if you choose to see her, for example three times). I will say that these good results is also partly contributed to my ten-day detox retreat, my readiness and openness to Erika's methods, and my interest in becoming more aware of how my mind affects my state of being. If you are in a similar state, I have no doubt Erika can help you move forward in your journey! I look forward to seeing her the next time I go "}
