This systematic review was conducted as part of the Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project (P/B-24 Project) by USDA's Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR). The purpose of the P/B -24 Project was to conduct a series of systematic reviews on diet and health for women who are pregnant and for infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months of age. This project was a joint initiati ve led by USDA and HHS, and USDA's NESR carried out all of the systematic reviews. A Federal Expert Group (FEG), a broadly representative group of Federal researchers and program leaders , also provided input throughout the P/B -24 Project. More information about the P/B -24 Project has been publishedii and is available on the NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/project -specific - overview -pb-24-0. NESR, formerly the Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL), specializes in conducting food - and nutrition -related systematic reviews using a rigorous , protocol -driven methodology . To conduct each P/B -24 systematic review, NESR's staff worked with a Technical Expert Collaborative (TEC) , which is a group of 7 -8 leading subject matter experts . NESR's systematic review methodology involves developing and prioritizing systematic review questions, searching for and selecting studies, extracting and assess ing the risk of bias of data from each included study, synthesizing the evidence, developing a conclusion statement, grading the evidence underlying the conclusion statement, and recommending future research. A detailed description of the methodology used in conducting systematic reviews for the P/B -24 Project has been publishediii and is available on the NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/pb -24-project -methodology -0. In addition, starting on page 27, this document includes details about the methodology as i t was applied to the systematic review described herein. An analytic framework that illustrates the overall scope of the question, including the population, the interventions and/or exposures, comparators, and outcomes of interest, is found on page 27.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMA RY What is the question? What is the relationship between the types and amounts of complementary foods and beverages consumed and developmental milestones ? What is the answer to the question? There is insuff icent evidence to draw a conclusion about the relationships betwee n types and amounts of c omplementary foods and beverages consumed and developmental milestones . Why was this question asked? This important public question was identified as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services P regnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project How was this question answered? A team of staff from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review conducted a systematic review in collaboration with a group of experts called a Technical Expert Collaborative. What is the population of interest? Generally healthy infants and toddlers who were fed complementary foods and beverages from ages 0 -24 months and had developmental milestone outcomes examined through 18 years of age. What evidence was found? This review includes eight studies published since 1980 The studies varied in terms of the types and/or amounts of c omplementary foods and beverages examined, which included dietary patterns consumed during the complementary feeding period, meat and/or f ortified -cereal intake, and foods with differing levels of DHA or phytate Different types of developmental milestone outcomes were measured between 4 months and 8.5 years of age, including: o communication development such as sentence repetition o cognitive d evelopment such as mental development index scores o motor development such as psychomotor development index scores o neurological development such as cortical processing 9 There are limitations in the evidence as follows: an inadequate number of studies that were comparable in terms of design, and variation in the types of complementary foods and beverages examined, how and when developmental milestones outcomes were assessed, and reported results How up -to-date is this review? This review includes literatur e from 01/1980 to 07/2016 10 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background Systematic reviews were conducted as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project. The goal of this systematic review was to examine the following question: What is the relationship between types and amounts of complementary foods and beverages (CFB) consumed and developmental milestones ? Complementary feeding is the process that starts when human milk or infant formula is complemented by other foods and beverages, beginning during infancy and typically continuing to 24 months of age. CFB were defined as foods and/or beverages other than human milk or infant formula (liquids, semisolids, and solids) provided to an infant or young child to provide nutrients and energy. Conclusion Statement There was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion about the relationships betwee n types and amounts of CFB consumed and developmental milestones . Grade: Grade Not Assignable Methods This systematic review was conducted by a team of staff from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review in collaboration with a Technical Expert Collaborative. Literature search was conducted using 4 databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and CINAHL) to identify articles that evaluated the intervention or exposure of timing of CFB introduction and the outcomes of developmental milestones. A manual search was conduc ted to identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic databases searched. Articles were screened by two analysts independently for inclusion based on pre -determined criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted for each included study, and both were checked for accuracy. The body of evidence was qualitatively synthesized to inform development of a conclusion statement(s), and the strength of evidence was graded using pre -established criteria evaluating the body o f evidence on risk of bias, adequacy, consistency, impact, and generalizability. Summary of the Evidence This review includes eight studies published since 1980 that examined the relationship between consuming different types and/or amounts of CFB and developmental milestones during childhood through 18 years of age, including three randomized controlled trials and five prospective cohort studies. The studies varied in terms of the types and/or amounts of CFB examined, which included dietary patterns cons umed during the complementary feeding period, meat and/or fortified -cereal intake, and foods with differing levels of DHA or phytate 11 Different types of developmental milestone outcomes were measured between 4 months and 8.5 years of age, including: o Communi cation (e.g., sentence repetition) o Cognitive (e.g., mental development index) o Motor (e.g., psychomotor development index) o Neurological (e.g., cortical processing) Three articles from two observational studies identified positive associations between dieta ry patterns emphasizing vegetables and meats during the complementary feeding period, and intelligence quotient (IQ) between ages 4 - 8.5y. However, a conclusion could not be drawn due to low generalizability and heterogeneity in exposures, observed effects, and potential confounding Because there was substantial variation in how studies were designed, it is difficult to compare and contrast the reported results. No conclusion regarding the relationship between types and/or amounts of CFB and developmental mi lestones could be drawn due to an inadequate number of studies that were comparable in terms of design, the types of CFB examined, how and when developmental milestones outcomes were assessed, and reported results. 12 FULL REVIEW Systematic review question What is the relationship between the types and amounts of complementary foods and beverages consumed and developmental milestones ?

No conclusion r egarding the relationship between types and/or amounts of CFB and developmental milestones could be drawn due to an inadequate number of studies that were comparable in terms of design, the types of CFB examined, how and when developmental milestones outco mes were assessed, and reported results 13 Description of the evidence This systematic review includes eight studies that examined the association between types or amounts of CFB and developmental milestones, including three RCTs (1-3) and five prospective cohort studies (4-8). According to the Human Development Index (9), all of the included studies were conducted in countries that were identifie d as \"very high\" (U.K. , U.S., Sweden, and Netherland s). Most of the studies included participants who were full term (gestational age >37 wk) and excluded participants with illnesses or conditions that could impact complementary feeding or development. All of the prospective cohort studies included subjects who had a normal birth weight (>2.5kg). Two studies specified that their samples were majority white (4, 8) , and the remaining studies did not specify the racial/ethnic make -up of subjects. The studies in this review examined the following interventions/exposures: dietary patterns (4-6, 8) meat compared to cereal (2); amount of meat consumed (7); phytate -reduced milk - cereal -drink and porridge (3); and DHA -enriched compared to control baby -food (1). A variety of validated, developmental indices/scales wer e used to examine outcomes ranging in age from birth to 11.5y, including the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), The Denver Developmental Screening Test, and the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (NEPSY). Developmental milestone outcomes that were reported by these studies fit within one or more of the following domains (10): communication (4, 5) , cognitive (2, 3, 5 -8), motor (2-5, 7), or other neurological (1), or behavioral ( 15) development . No studies were identified that reported the associatio n between types or amounts of CFB introduced and social/emotional development outcomes, executive function, or incidence and prevalence of anxiety or depression. Table 1 describes the studies and reported results from included studies that examined dietary patterns and developmental milestone outcomes. Table 2 describes the studies and reported results from included studies that examined specific types or amounts of CFB and developmental milestone outcomes. Evidence s ynthesis Dietary patterns and developmental milestones Dietary patterns and communication development Dagnelie and van Staveren (4) reported that infants who consumed a 'Macrobiotic' dietary pattern from ~4 -18 mo of age had significantly slower language development, though age of assessment was not report ed. Gale et al. (5) reported no significant associations between dietar y pattern scores at either 6 or 12 mo of age and language development at 4 y in adjusted models, though analyses did not adjust for education or race/ethnicity of participants. Gale et al. (5) adjusted for several baseline characteristics but Dagnelie and van Staveren (4) did not account for differences between groups in birth weight and BF duration. Notably in that study (4), there were also several concurrent factors, such as relatively high rates of wasting and rickets in the 'Macrobiotic' r elative to 'Omnivorous' groups and may have impacted development. The magnitude of differences in that study was notable and macrobiotic diets tend to be deficient in several nutrients that could affect development. However, prenatal differences and human milk nutrient content cannot be ruled out as factors. Therefore, differences in outcome assessment, lack of adjustment for confounding factors, limited generalizability, and inconsistency in findings limit the ability to 14 draw a conclusion about the relatio nship between dietary patterns during the complementary feeding period and communication development. Dietary patterns and motor development Dagnelie and van Staveren (4) found slower gross -motor development in infants with a 'Macrobiotic' compared to 'Omniv orous' diet pattern (see Table 1 ), but no differe nces in terms of fine -motor development. Gale et al. (5) reported no significant associations between dietary pa ttern scores at either 6 or 12 mo and visuomotor precision at 4 y. These studies were difficult to summarize because of the variation in dietary patterns and types of motor development outcomes examined. Dietary patterns and cognitive development Three prospective cohort studies examined the relationship between dietary patterns and cognitive milestones (5, 6, 8) . Table 2 describes information regarding CFB included in each dietary pattern and study results in more detail. All thr ee studies reported that dietary patterns emphasizing vegetables and meat at 6 mo of age were associated with better verbal IQ scores in childhood at ~4 -8.5 y, compared to other dietary patterns (Table 2). Gale et al. (5) reported that scores on the U.K. 'Infant guidelines' pa ttern scores at age 6 mo (i.e., higher scores reflect higher adherence to complementary feeding guidelines in the U.K.) were positively associated with full -scale and verbal IQ scores at 4 y, and at age 12 mo were positively associated with full -scale IQ s cores at 4 y. No significant associations were reported between 'Adult Foods' pattern scores at age 6 or 12 mo and IQ at 4 y. In terms of cognitive outcomes aside from IQ, Gale et al. (5) reported no significant associations between either dietary pattern and visual form constancy or visual attention at 4 y. Golley et al. (6) reported that scores on the complementary feeding utility index (CFUI) at age 6 mo (i.e., higher scores reflect healthier patterns based on complementary feeding recommendations in the U.K.) were positively associated with f ull-scale, verbal, and performance IQ scores at age 8.5 y. Smithers et al. (8) reported significant positive associations between the following dietary pattern scores a nd IQ scores at 8 y (see Table 1 for full results): 'Homemade traditional' (e.g., potatoes/vegetables, meat) at age 6 mo and full -scale, verbal, and performance IQ; 'Contemporary foods' (e.g., legumes, fruits, and/or vegetables, nuts, egg) at age 15 and 24 mo and full -scale and verbal IQ; 'Ready -to-eat foods' (e.g., biscuits, bread/toast, breakfast cereal, yogurt, milk pudding, cola) at age 24 mo and full -scale and verbal IQ. Significant negative associations were identified between the following dietary pattern scores and IQ scores at 8y (see Table 1 for full results): 'Discretionary foods' (e.g., biscuits, crisps, sweets, chocolate, cola) at ages 6 mo and full -scale, verbal, and performance IQ, 'Discretionary foods' at 15 mo and full - scale and verbal IQ, and 'Discretionary Foods' at 24 m o and full -scale IQ. 'Ready -made' (e.g., commercial manufactured foods including rice/baby cereal, meat from a tin/jar, vegetables, fruit puddings, milk puddings, and fish) at 6 mo and full-scale and verbal IQ. 'Ready -made' (e.g., commercial manufactured foods) at 15 mo and full -scale, verbal, and performance IQ. Smithers et al. (8) acknowledged that all observed, significant differences were less than 15 one IQ point and results were primarily driven by th e verbal IQ subscale. Although all three studies analyzed scores on dietary patterns that were related to higher intake of vegetables and meat/meat products at 6 mo, dietary patterns were analyzed heterogeneously across studies and may be less generalizable to U.S. patterns. For example, Golley et al. (6) analyzed CFUI scores, which were reflectiv e of better adherence to broad complementary feeding recommendations in Australia, New Zealand, North America, and the U.K. from 2003 -2010. Gale et al. (5) analyzed scores on the Infant Guidelines pattern, which was reflective of better adherence to the infant feeding manual from the U.K. Department of Health in 2006. However , the patterns analyzed in Smithers et al. (8) have previously shown both similarity and discordance with U.S. patterns, see (11). Some of the patterns identified in Smithers et al. (8) included food s such as gravy/soy sauce, were only observed at 15 or 24 mo, or were not well described. In addition, the dietary patterns from Smithers et al. (8) did not clearly align with the three dietary patterns that were used to obtain CFUI scores in Golley et al. (6), despite data being from the same cohort. Among the three studies, dietary patterns characterized by foods and/or food groups divergent from complementary feeding recommendations, such as bread, biscuits, and fizzy drinks/cola, had either negative or null associations with IQ in early -mid childhood. All three cohort studies controlled for the majority, if not all, potential key confounders. However, the interval be tween assessment of dietary patterns during the complementary feeding period and outcome assessment of IQ varied across studies, with dietary patterns as early as 6 mo of age and outcome assessments from 4 -8.5 y of age. It is plausible that uncontrolled fa ctors during this interval may confound the relationship between dietary patterns consumed during the complementary feeding period and developmental milestones. 16 Table 1.

Developmental milestone outcomes were categorized i n accordance with the analytic framework, and for these studies included the following domains: cognitive, motor, and communication development. No studies examined social/emotional development or incidence of anxiety/depression in relation to complementary feeding (also see Figure 1). 2. The independent variables/exposures included in this systematic review were types and amounts of CFB, which included studi es that examined dietary patterns during the complementary feeding period described in this table. Abbreviations: BF, breast -fed; CFB, complementary acid; analysis; NSA, non -significant association; NSGD, rolled trial; WISC, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 21 Specific types and amounts of CFB consumed and developmental milestones Meat with or without cereal and cognitive and/or motor development Two studies (2, 7) reported no significant association between meat consumption, starting at either 4 or 5 mo of age, and BSID scores for cognitive and motor development (i.e., MDI or PDI scores on the BSID) (Table 2 ). Krebs et al. (2) additionally reported no difference between the meat relative to cereal groups in terms of behavior development al index (BDI) scores at 7 or 12 mo. Estimated iron content of meat intake was not reported in Morgan (7). The meat (beef) in Krebs et al. (2) contained 15\u00b5g of iron per gram relative to iron -fortified, dry cereal, which contained 740\u00b5g of iron per gram. Although the cereal group had higher intake of iron, both groups in Krebs (2) had similar iron status and similar energy intakes from CFB. Morgan et al. (7) found significant positive associations, such that greater meat intake from age 4 -12 mo or 4 -16 mo was related to hig her PDI scores at 22 mo . However, whether groups in that study were similar in baseline characteristics could not be det ermined and analyses were not adjusted for potential key confounding factors. Phytate -reduced CFB and cognitive and motor development Lind et al. (3) reported no significant differences between groups receiving reduced - phytate compared to regular -phytate CFB with regard to MDI or PDI scores a t ages 7, 13, or 18 mo (Table 2) . DHA -enriched CFB and neurological development Infants who received DHA -enriched baby food compared to control CFB from ages 6 -12 mo had significantly better visual acuity at 9 and 12 mo of age, suggesting improved visual cortex development that corresponds to ~1.5 lines on an eye chart (1) (Table 2). Notably, the infants fed DHA -enriched baby food vs. control baby food had an 83% increase in DHA blood -levels, which was associated with a 2 -fold greater intake of DHA from both CFB and human milk combined. 22 Table 2.

Developmental milestone outcomes were categorized i n accordance with the analytic framework, and for these studies included the following domains: cognitive, motor, and/or other development (neurological or behavioral). No studies examined social/emotional development or incidence of anxiety/depression in relation to complementary feeding (also see Figure 1). 2. The independent variables/exposures of interest were types and amounts of CFB at the age noted. Abbreviations: BDI, behavioral development index; BF, breast -fed; Infant VEP, visual -evoked potential 24 Discussion There was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion about the relationship be tween types and/or amounts of CFB consumed and de velopmental milestones . A grade could not be assigned due to an inadequate number of studies that were comparable in terms of design, the types of CFB that were examined, how and when developmental milestone s outcomes were assessed , and the results that were reported. In addition, no conclusion could be drawn due to low generalizability , heterogeneity in exposures, observed effects, and potential confounding . Limitations Eight articles published since 1980 were included from three RCTs and five prospective cohort studies that examined the relationship between consuming different types and/or amounts of CFB and developmental milestones during childhood through 18 y of age. The studies varied in terms of the t ypes and/or amounts of CFB examined, which included dietary patterns during the complementary feeding period, meat and/or fortified -cereal intake, and foods with differing levels of DHA or phytate. Different types of outcomes were measured between 4 mo and 8.5 y of age, which involved communication (e.g., sentence repetition, reading skills), cognitive (e.g., IQ, MDI), motor (e.g., age of walking, PDI), and neurological (e.g., cortical processing) development. Two of the three RCTs noted they were slightly underpowered (1, 3) . The direction of findings varied across the ev idence. The directness with which studies examined the link between different types of CFB and developmental milestones also varied across the evidence. Three articles (5, 6, 8) from two observational studies identified positive as sociations between dietary patterns emphasizing vegetables and meats during the complementary feeding period, and IQ between ages 4 -8.5 y. However, t he observational nature of the studies, potential confounding, low generalizability of dietary patterns to the U.S. population, and the relatively small magnitude of the observed effects in two of the studies restrict the ability to draw a conclusion regarding the relationship between dietary patterns during the complementary feeding period and cognitive develo pment. Three studies (two RCTs; one observational) examined the relationship between types of CFB that may influence micronutrient absorption and developmental indices but varied in how exposures were analyzed, what types of CFB were examined , and the directness with which the studies examined the relationship between different CFB consumed and developmental milestones. Due to inconsistency in study design and results, the relationship between types and/or amounts of CFB that may influence micronut rient absorption and developmental indices remains unclear. One high-quality study examined DHA -enriched baby food in relation to neurological development, showing positive effects of DHA -enriched baby food on visual acuity (i.e., cortical processing ) (1). With only one study, however, it is not possible to draw a conclusion regardin g the relationship between DHA -enriched CFB and neurological development 25 Research recommendations In order to better assess the relationship between the types and/or amounts of CFB introduced and developmental milestones, additional research may be warranted. Should research in this area be conducted, the following recommendations should be considered: Conduct RCTs examining how dietary patterns that are more generalizable to the U.S. population and comparable across studies are related to cognitive development Examine DHA -enriched CFB in relation to neurological development and other developmental mile stones Determine whether assessment tests have predictability for longer term neurodevelopmental outcomes; it remains unclear whether achievement of developmental milestones predicts enduring effects on developmental outcomes later in childhood. Account fo r the following factors that could impact the relationship between types and/or amounts of CFB introduced and developmental milestones: the amount of human milk or formula consumed, birth weight of the infant, weight status of the infant at the time CFB a nd outcome assessment, age of children when assessed, and the developmental readiness of the infant.
