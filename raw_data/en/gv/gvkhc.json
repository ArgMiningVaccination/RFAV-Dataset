F arragher D octor of Philosophy Rehabilitation Sciences Institute University of Toronto 2018 B ackground: Fatigue is a common and disabling symptom experienced by people with end- stage renal disease on chronic dialysis therapy (CDT). Energy conservation education (ECE) is an approach to fatigue management that provides people with energy -saving strategies, to reduce their fatigue and improve their life participation. ECE has yet to be trialed in the CDT population. Objective: To explore the potential for energy conservation education to improve fatigue and life participation outcomes in people on CD T. Method s: A three -step process was undertaken: 1. A scoping review was conducted to investigate what is known about energy conservation education in people with chronic diseases who experience fatigue. 2. The W ord H ealth Organization framework was used to develop an ECE program, tailored specifically to meet the needs of people on CDT. Feedback on the program was collected via key informant interviews and usability testing, to inform program revisions. 3. P reliminary efficacy testing was conducted using a mixed -methods sequential ii explanatory design, including a single- case, tri -phasic, time -series study with four replications , and qualitative post-intervention interviews. Results: The majority of evidence on ECE in people with chronic diseases focused on a specific, group-based ECE program in people with MS. There was a dearth of evidence to demonstrate positive effects of ECE on life participation outcomes across chronic disease populations, and a lack of programs that would be feasibl e for people on CDT. A personalized, web -supported ECE program (The \"PEP\" Program) was therefore created to meet the CDT population's key needs. Key informant interviews suggested the program was perceived positively, and usability testing found people on CDT could complete the program independently. Efficacy testing revealed consistently positive changes in fatigue and life participation associated with the program in three of five participants, while all participants reported experiencing benefits during the qualitative interviews. Conclusion: The PEP program has the potential to improve fatigue- related outcomes in people on CDT . Further robust testing of the program is warranted. iii iv Acknowledgments Someone once said that it takes a village to finish a PhD , and my journey through out the past five years has confirm ed the absolute truth of that sentiment .

Lee et al. , 2002; Loubeau, Loubeau, & Jantzen, 2001; United States System, 2017) , high morbidity and mortality (Lozano et al. , 2012; United States Renal Data System, 2015; Wolfe et al. , 199 9), and low quality of life (Fukuhara et al. , 2003; Merkus et al. Morton, Hayen, Howard, & Webster, 2012) . The most common form of treatment for ESRD is chronic dialysis therapy (CDT), which requires the recipient to undergo regular, frequent dialysis sessions, either in hospital or at their home. People with ESRD on CDT often experience a number of disease -related complications, including frailty (Johansen, Chertow, Jin, & Kutner, cognitive al. , 2006; O'Lone et al. , 2016) , and psychosocial s uch as depression and anxiety (Hedayati, Bosworth, Kuchibhatla, Kimmel, & Sz czech, 2006) , all of which negatively impact their quality of life. One of the more negative facets of living with ESRD on CDT, according to p eople with the disease , is fatigue. An estimated seven in 10 people on CDT experience fatigue (Murtagh, Addi ngton -Hall, & Higginson, 2007) , and it has frequently been ranked among the top concerns of people on CDT (Manns et al. , 2014; Weisbord et al. , 2007) . Unfortunately, a poorly -understood, multifactorial of 2008) , and treatment options are limited. Fatigue management is a high -priority for people with ESRD on CDT: a recent Canadian study found that p eople on CDT ranked fatigue as being in their top -three priorities for ESRD research (Manns et al. , 2014) , and a nother recent international study found that people on CDT identified the n egative impact of fatigue on their life participation as being their most concerning consequence (Ju et al. , 2018) . Collectively, these findings highlight the need to develop novel approaches that can support peo ple on CDT with day -to-day fatigue management . Energy conservation education (ECE) is an approach to fatigue management found in the general literature. ECE aims to provide p eople with strategies (eg. organizing the environment, changing body positioning, prioritizing) t hat will reduce their energy expenditure during everyday activities, thereby minimiz ing their fatigue and improv ing their life participation (Mathiowetz, Matuska, & Murphy, 2001) . ECE is often used by rehabilitation professionals working with chroni c disease populations who experience fatigue, such as multiple sclerosis, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseas e, but has yet to be investigated as a fatigue management 3 approach for the CDT population . Furthermore, the literature on ECE in peopl e with other chronic diseases has not been comprehensively explored. The overarching objective of th e multi -staged work reported in this manuscript -style thesis , was to explore the potential for ECE to improve fatigue -related outcomes for people on CDT. The work began with a review of background information on chronic kidney disease, fatigue, and energy conservation education , presented in Chapter 2. Next, a scoping review was conducted to investigate what is known about energy conservation education in c hronic disease populations who experience fatigue. This work, presented in Chapter 3 ( Manuscript 1), was undertaken to identify the populations in which ECE has been studied, the characteristics of energy conservation education programs that have been test ed, and findings that have been reported about their impact on fatigue and life participation outcomes. The scoping review guidelines of Arksey and O'Malley (2005) , which outline a five -stage process involving systematic literature searching, data extraction and synthesis , were followed . A comprehensive search of seven relevant online databases and hand -searching of relevant journals w as undertaken by the first author to identify literature on ECE, and study eligibility was assessed according to pre - established criteria by the first author, with validation from a second reviewer. Data from the eligible studies were extracted into a Micr osoft Excel spreadsheet, and were collated using descriptive and narrative syntheses. Informed by the results of the scoping review, the development of a new ECE program for people on CDT was then undertaken . For t his work, presented in Chapter 4 ( Manuscript 2), the World Health Organization 's (2014) six-step framework on health education planning was used to guide program development. The process began with a literature -based Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) needs assessment, informed by the findings from scoping review (Chapter 3), to assess the need to develop a new energy conservation education program for the CDT populat ion. T he results of the SWOT analysis suggested a new program was needed, and informed the goals and objectives for the new program. Evidence - informed design strategies were researched and applied to develop the draft program. Next, the draft version was p resented to four key informants , chosen to bring a broad range of expertise to the evaluation. Semi -structured qualitative interviews were conducted , to gather their impressions of the program , and their suggestions for improvement. Usability testing was also conducted with five p eople on CDT, purposively selected to represent typical dialysis user 4 characteristics, to assess if they could use the program as intended and identify further design revisions to be made. This process indicated the program had pot ential , and identified a number of changes to be made, resulting in the test version of the program. The final stage of the work presented in this thesis , was the preliminary exploration of the potential for the new ECE program (\"The PEP Program\") to effect change in fatigue and life participation in people on CDT. This work, reported in Chapter 5 (Manuscript 3) , involved preliminary efficacy testing of the program with five people on CDT . A mixed -methods, sequential explanatory design (Tashakkori, Teddlie, & Teddlie, 2003) was used , which included a single -case, time -series experiment with four replications , and follow -up qualitative interviews with study participants. The five participants were p urposively selected to represent various facets of the CDT population on key characteristics (age, gender and dialysis modality). The primary outcomes examined were fatigue, life participation, and self -efficacy. The study participants initially underwent a three - to four-week baseline observation period, during which fatigue and life participation outcomes were assessed weekly. Participants then began the six- to eight -week \"PEP\" program, throughout which the weekly assessments of fatigue and life particip ation outcomes were continued. The single -case data were analyzed using both visual analysis and the Tau -U statistic, to identify patterns of change in the study outcomes associated with the intervention. Thematic coding was used to analyze the qualitative interview data. Finally, an overview of the findings from this multi -staged work is provided in Chapter 6 , with an outline of the methodological strengths and weaknesses of the work, and a discuss ion of implications and directions for future research. 5 Chapter 2: Background Literature Review 6 Chapter 2 : Background Literature Review 2.1 The global burden of chronic kidney disease Kidneys perform a number of key functions in the body that are critical for human health and survival. These functions include controlling fluid and electrolyte balance; removing toxins and metabolic end -products; and contributing to the function of several hormones such as erythropoietin, renin and angioten sin, and the Vitamin D axis. Disease affecting the kidneys is often progressive, and can be present undetected for several years. The term chronic kidney disease (CKD) describes a chronic progressive , multi -staged disorder, which is associated in the later stages with a decline in renal function characterized by a reduced glomerular filtration rate (<60 ml/min/1.73m2), and often protein or albumin in the urine (Levey et al. , 2005) . CKD has become a growing global health concern in recent years (Atkins, 2005; Jha et al. , 2013) , becaus e of an accelerating incidence rate driven largely by factors such as the aging population , and increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes (Jha et al. , 2013) . Estimates suggest that approximately 13% of the global population now meet the criteria for CKD (Hill et al. , 2016) . CKD is also a n increasingly prevalent cause of mortality, moving from 27th to 18th on the list of causes of total number of worldwide deaths between 1990 and 2010 (Lozano et al. , 2012) . Stage 5 CKD, which is typically referred to as end -stage renal disease (ESRD), is the most severe category of CKD. ESRD is defined as an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate of <15 ml/min/1.73m2 (Levey et 2005) , and is an imminently life -threatening condition that is typically associated with the use of renal re placement therapy (RRT) as a life -sustaining measure. There are two primary forms of RRT: kidney transplantation, and chronic dialysis therapy (CDT). According to an estimate from 2010, 2\u00b76 million people receive RRT worldwide, with the number needing RRT estimated to be almost double (Liyanage et al. , 2015) . Kidney transplantation is considere d the optimal form of RRT, as it offers better survival (Wolfe et al. , 1999) , lower morbidity, and superior quality of life outcomes (Purnell et al. , 2013; Wyld et al. , 2012) compared to CDT. However, as the demand for donor kidneys outweighs the supply in most parts of the world, including Canada, more than half of Canadians who have ESRD rely on routine , chronic dialysis therapy as their primary ESRD treatment (Canadian Institute of Health Information, 2017) . 7 2.2 Chronic dialysis therapy CDT performs some of the most critical functions of the kidneys, such as removing metabolic waste products from the bloodstream, balancing fluid and electrolyte levels, and controlling blood pressure. Estimates suggest that 284 per million people worldwide are currently treated with CDT (Thomas et al. , 2015) . There are two different modalities of dialysis therapy : hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis (HD) removes uremic waste products and fluid from the bloodstream through a process of diffusion and osmosis, where the blood is filtered through a semi -permeable membrane located in an external hemodialysis machine. People on chronic hemodialysis typically undergo dialysis in a setting with the assistance of specially trained n urses and technicians (ie. \"In -center hemodialysis, or IC HD), on average three times per week for 4 -5 hours per session. P eople on ICHD typically follow a consistent weekly hemodialysis schedule: dialyzing either on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, or, Tu esdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and typically either during a morning, afternoon, evening, or overnight \"shift\". More than 75% of people on CDT in Canada undergo IC HD (Canadian Institute of Health Information, 2017) . Hemodialysis can also be performed at home, however, by the patient or a personal caregiver, within a self -care model of dialysis referred to as \"home hemodialysis\". People on home hemodialysis typically first undergo an extensive training period to learn how to administer hemodialysis to themselves, and are then provided with recommendations as to the frequency and duration for their home dialysis. Home hemodialysis is undertak en by approximately 5% of people on CDT in Canada (Canadian Institute of Health Information, 2017) . In peritoneal dialysis (PD), uremic wa ste products and excess fluids are removed from the body, using the natural filter -like properties of the abdominal lining. This lining, termed the peritoneal membrane, already exists in the p erson 's abdomen and acts a semipermeable filtering mechanism. Wi thin this model of dialysis, a special sterile solution called dialysate, is regularly instilled into the peritoneal cavity, via a permanent, surgically -placed catheter. Fluids are exchanged on average 3 -5 times daily, using a 30 -minute process that is oft en performed by the person on CDT themselves. Between exchanges, waste products and excess fluids pass from the bloodstream through the peritoneal membrane into the dialysate, via a process of diffusion and osmosis. Unlike hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis is typically performed in the home setting. 8 Exchanges can either be done manually by the person on CDT (termed \"continuous automated peritoneal dialysis\", or CAPD), or using a machine to perform the exchanges, often at night (termed \"continuous cycler per itoneal dialysis\", or CCPD). Peritoneal dialysis is the modality of choice for 15% of people on CDT in Canada (Canadian Institute of Health I nformation, 2017) . 2.3 Quality of life and life participation on chronic dialysis therapy Dialysis therapy has greatly prolonged the life expectancy of people diagnosed with ESRD, and provided hope to many individuals affected by the disease. However, despi te experiencing a prolonged survival, people maintained on CDT long-term often experience poor physical and psychosocial outcomes (Jassal & Watson, 2010; Kliger & Finkelstein, 2009) , and have difficulty with engag ing in valued day -to-day activities (ie., life participation) . Health -related quality of life (HRQoL) , defined as \"a multi -dimensional concept that includes domains related to physical, mental, emotional, and social functioning\" (Office of Disease Prevention & Health Promotion, n.d.), is typically low among people on CDT (Fukuhara et al. 2012) . For example, d ata from the international Dialysis Outcomes and Pra ctice Patterns Study (DOPPS) indicated that HRQoL among 7 378 people on CDT was significantly lower than that of population -based norms , across the continents of Europe, Japan, and the USA (Fukuhara et al. , 2003) . A central facet of quality -of-life is the ability to engage in valued , day-to-day activities (ie., life participation) . People on CDT often fall into the category of \"high needs, high cost\" people , which has been defined by Hayes and colleagues (2016) as people who have three or more chronic diseases and a functional limitation in their ability to care for themselves or perform routine daily tasks. Multiple qualitative studies have identified the negative effect of CDT on daily activities, such as home responsibilities and social engagement, as being a key theme of the experience of people on CDT (Clarkson & Robinson, 2010; Harwood, Wilson, Locking -Cusolito, White, & Spittal, 2005; Y. White & Grenyer, 1999) . Quantitative studies have similarly found that people on CDT experience high rates of disabi lity in self -care and work activities (Cook & Jassal, 2008; Jassal 1991) . For example, Jassal and col leagues (2016) found that only 36% of 7226 p eople on hemodialysis were able to perfor m 13 self -care tasks without any assistance . Several studies have also reported a loss of employment among working -age people on CDT after dialysis initiation 9 (Curtin, Oberley, Sacksteder, & Friedman, 1996; Kutner, 2010 ; van Manen et al. , 2001) and continued low rates of employment among people on CDT (Helanter\u00e4, Haapio, Manen et al. , 2001) . People on CDT experience multiple disease -related physical and psychosocial sequelae, which may contribute to their poor quality of life and life participation . One study estimate s that 70% of people on hemodialysis meet Fried an d colleagues' (2001) established criteria for frailty (at least three of weakness, impaired mobility, weight loss, inactivity, and fatigue ) (Johansen, Chertow, Jin, & Kutner, 2007) . Seven in 10 people on CDT have also been found to exhibit moderate to severe cognitive impairment , according to a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery (Murray et al. , 2006) , while a recent systematic review found that people on hemodialysis experience impai red orientation, attention, and executive function , compared to the general population (O'Lone et al. , 2016) . People on CDT also experience a heavy burden of symptoms: for example, a systematic review of symptom prevalence studies found that 45% of people on CDT experience chronic pain, 33% have nausea , and 28% have depression (Murtagh et al. , 2007) . Yet a nother major challenge of living on CDT is managing its intensive , day-to-day health management tasks. The responsibilities of a person on CDT typically include attending (or performing) frequent, routine dialysis sessions; monitoring and recording blood pressure daily; managing multiple medicatio ns; and adhering to strict diet and fluid intake guidelines. Illness intrusiveness, which is the degree to which an illness and its associated treatments interfere with normal life activities, has also been found to be associated with poorer psychosocial o utcomes in the CDT population (Devins et al. , 1983, 1990, 1993) Among the many challenges faced by people on CDT, the symptom of fatigue is consistentl y ranked as one of the ir top concerns. Fatigue is the most common symptom experienced by peopl e on CDT (Murtagh et al. , 2007; Weisbord et al. , 2007) , and is often identified as being a top stressor of living with ESRD (Baldree, Murphy, & Powers, 1982; Juergensen et 1996; 2001; Weisbord et al. , 2007) . Fatigue is associated with a variety of negative outcomes in people on CDT; for example, it is an independent predicto r of poor physical and mental quality of life (Davison & Jhangri, 2010; Wang et al. , 2014) , and is correlated with increased morbidity and mortality (Bossola et al. , 2011; Jhamb et al. , 2011) . People on CD T have identif ied the negative impact o f fatigue on their life participation as being among its most important consequence s (Ju et al. , 2018) . This was recently highlighted in a study 10 by Ju and colleagues (2018), for which an international consensus workshop was held with 15 people on CDT /caregivers and 42 health professionals from nine countries , to discuss the development of a core outcome measure fo r ESRD fatigue. All of the people on CDT who participa ted in th e workshop agree d that fatigue played a vital role in their ability to participate in activities and tasks (Ju et al. , 2018) . This finding is consistent with what has been reported in other qualitative studies on fatigue, where people on CDT have described the limiting effect of fatigue on their self -care, productivity, and leisure activities example, Heiwe and colleagues (2003) previously reported that people on hemodialysis perceived fatigue as being the most limiting factor with respect to thei r overall physical and functional capacity. One p erson on CDT was quoted as saying \"... it's a kind of tiredness that you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy ... when you can't read, you're too tired to watch the telly, you're too tired to do anything, because your brain is so tired like all of you ... it feels like you're kind of hollow inside ... like it's only a kind of shell that's functioning\" (Heiwe et al. , 2003, p. 173) . In Ju and colleagues' (2018) study, both p eople on CDT and health professionals agreed that \"the ability to participate in life activities was the fundamental goal of treatment, because it symbolized some indicator of being able to live a life without being confined by the disease. Other dimensions of fatigue, such as post-dialysis fatigue and muscle weakness, were considered mediators that contribu ted to the end goal of life participation\" (Ju et al. , 2018, p. 108) . Collectively, these studies highlight the need to better understand fatigue , and explore ways to optimize its day -to-day management , in the CDT population. 2.4 Defining fatigue The definition of fatigue, according to the Merriam -Webster dictionary, is an \"extreme tiredness resulting from mental or physical exertion or illness\" (Merriam -Webster, n.d. -a). This definition identifies the hallmark quality of fatigue , which is a subjective feeling of tiredness. It also specifies that fatigue is commonly experienced by people after periods of extensive exertion . However, f atigue in the healthcare literature typically refer s to an abnormal degree of fatigue , experienced by people with illness . To differentiate disease -related fatigue from usual fatigue, some refer to it as chronic, or pathological fatigue. Jason and colleagues (2010) explain that 11 pathological fatigue \"is experienced in many people with chronic illness, and with a greater intensity and longer duration \" and that it typically causes \"severe impairments to an individual's functional activity and quality of life \" (Jason et al. , 2010, p. 327) . Pathological fatigue is typically also said to have an unpleasant or unwanted quality. For example, Ream and Richardson (1996) describe fatigue as a \"subje ctive, unpleasant symptom which incorporates total body feeling ranging from tiredness to exhaustion\" (Ream & R ichardson, 1996, p. 520) . Fatigue shares its core quality of tiredness with several other symptoms, such as sleepiness, lethargy, and malaise. However, there are conceptual distinctions between them. Whereas the hallmark quality of fatigue is tiredness, sleepiness involves both a feeling of tiredness and difficulty staying awake. Shen, Barbara and Shapiro (2006) explain that sleepiness is specifically caused by an alteration or imbalance in sleep/wake mechanisms. Le thargy , meanwhile, is defined as \"the quality or state of being lazy, sluggish, or indifferent\" (Merriam -Webster, n.d. -b), and unlike fatigue, is characterized by a lack of enthusiasm or motivation in addition to tiredness. Malaise is defined by Merriam Webster as \"an indefinite feeling of debility or lack of health often indicative of or accompanying the onset of an illness\" ( (Merriam -Webster, n.d. -c), and refers to a more general feeling of u nwellness that may include, but not be limited to, tiredness. The majority of the healthcare literature on fatigue refers primarily to the physical, bodily tiredness described above. However, other types of fatigue have also been described that reflect a specific location, quality, timing, or other characteristic. For example, mental fatigue refers to \"a transient decrease in maximal cognitive performance resulting from prolonged periods of cognitive activity, that can manifest as somnolence, lethargy, or directed attention fatigue\" (Van Cutsem et al. , 2017, p. 1569) . Emotional fatigue has been described as a feeling of being emotionally overextended and exhausted by one's work (Wright & Cropanzano, 1998) , and is akin to the concept of burnout . Exertional fatigue describes an \"increased sense of effort in relation to a task\" (Macdonald, Fearn, Jibani, & Marcora, 2012) , and often relates to the phenomenon of muscle fatigue, which is \" an exercise -induced reduction in the ability of muscle to produce force or power whether or not the task can be sustained\" (Enoka & Duchateau, 2008, p. 12) . A common distinction is that between central versus peripheral fatigue, the former being mediated by central nervous system mechanisms, and the latter resulting from decreased response in the neuromuscular system after central activation (Chaudhuri & Behan, 2004) . There 12 has also been discussion in the nephrology literature of \"post -dialysis\" fatigue, a type of fatigue that describes the tiredness and general malaise people on hemodialysis often experience following a hemodialysis treatment session (Sklar, Riesenberg, Silber, Ahmed, & Ali, 1996) . 2.5 Fatigue in people with ESRD on CDT Fatigue is a widespread experience in the CDT population. A systematic review by Murtagh and colleagues (2007) found that the reported prevalence of fatigue in people on CDT ranged from 42-89%, wi th the mean weighted prevalence being 70%. The Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) , which studied a large, international sample of people on hemodialysis , reported that mean scores on the SF -36 vitality scale in people on hemodialysis ran ged between 40 and 50 across age groups (Mapes et al. , 2004) . These scores were lower than the mean scores reported across age groups from population -based normative data in Canada , which were above 60 (Hopman et al. , 2000) . In addition to physical fatigue, people on CDT also appear t o experience the various types of fatigue discussed above . For example, Karakan and colleagues (2011) found that the majority of p eople on CDT reported experiencing moderate to severe levels of cognitive and emotional fatigue on a multidimensional fatigue scale, while in a qualitative study , Lee and colleagues (2007) similarly found that people on C DT described experiencing physical, cognitive and emotional aspects of fatigue in their day -to-day lives . Although exertional fatigue has not been directly studied people on CDT, Johansen and colleagues (2005) report that people on CDT experience threefold greater muscle fatigue (defined as a fall in their maximal voluntary contraction) than controls during exercise, indicating that they fatigue more easily on exertion. This aligns with a large body of qualitative literature, in which it has been described that people on CDT experience fatigue when attempting to engage in their day-to-day activities (Al-Arabi, 2006; . Post -dialysis fatigue, meanwhile, is estimated to be experienced by half of people on ICHD (Sklar et al. , 1996) . With respect to its natural history, high er rates of fatigue are seen in people wi th mid-stage CKD compared to normative samples , Pagels et al. , 2012; Perlman et al. , 2005) , which suggest s that fatigue may originate in earlier stages of CKD . For example, P erlman (2005) found that people with CKD Stages 3 and 4 had lower vitality scores on the SF -36 than healthy - matched peers . Similarly, Pagels and colleagues (2012) found that people with Stage 2 -3 CKD 13 had a higher prevalence of fatigue than healthy controls. Fatigue also appears to worsen with the progression of CKD ; Mujais and colleagues (2009) found that vitality levels across the stages of CKD were highest in people with Stage 3 CKD, and lowest in people with ESRD . The progression of fatigue in people with ESRD after they initiate CDT is unclear, due to a general dearth of longitudinal studies. Ossareh and colleagues (2003) reported that the prevalence of fatigue increased from 55% to 67% in people on PD over the year following dialysis initiation, possibly indicating a worsening of fatigue after dialysis initiation. However, a prospective study by Bossola and colleagues (2017) reported that fatigue typically remained stable over the period of one year, in a sample of p eople already established on hemodialysis. Most of the literature on fatigue in people on CDT is based on studies of the ICHD population. In people on ICHD , fatigue also appears to fluctuate diurnally: a study by Abdel -Kader and colleagues (2014) that us ed ecological momentary assessment of fatigue throughout p eople 's day-to-day lives, found that people on ICHD experienced greater fatigue on dialysis days compared to non -dialysis days, which was similarly reported by Delgado and colleagues (2012) . Fatigue has also been found to worsen later in the day in the hemodialysis population (Abdel - Kader et al. , 2014) . Relatively less is known about fatigue in the PD and HHD populations. Available literature suggests fati gue is also common in p eople on PD. For example, Merkus and colleagues (1997) reported equal fatigue levels among p eople on HD and PD, with both groups experiencin g greater fatigue compared to a normative sample. Ossareh and colleagues (Ossareh et al. , 2003) similarly reported that fatigue is common in people on PD, with 67% of people on PD having been found to complain of fatigue at their last clinical visit based on a clinical chart review. There is a dearth of literature on fatigue in the home hemodialysis populatio n. One study by Watanabe and colleagues (2014) found that vitality scores were higher among people on HHD compared to people on ICHD in Japan, suggesting they may be less prone to fatigue than other CDT groups. However, this has yet to be confirmed in other studies. The literature is fairly consistent that fatigue is greater among people on CDT who are older (Artom, Moss -Morris, Caskey, & Chilcot, 2014) . There is conflicting evidence regarding the relationship between gender and fatigue; some, but not all, studies have found fatigue to be more common amo ng women on CDT (Artom et al. , 2014) . With respect to geography, the DOPPS study found that fatigue was reported more commonly in European and Americ an dialysis centres, compared to Japanese centres (Mapes et al. , 2004) . Some literature has also suggested 14 that Caucasians with ESRD are more likely to experience fatigue compared to other races (Artom et al. , 2014) . Social and situational factors including education, and marital a nd employment status have also been associated with fatigu e in people on CDT . For example, Karadag and colleagues (2013) found that more education was associated with higher fatigue levels, while multiple studies have reported associations between unemployment and greater fatigue (Jhamb et al. , 2011; Karadag et al. , 2013; Liu, 2006) . Married people on CDT have also been found to generally re port more fatigue compared to single p eople (Akin, , although whether this may be a function of older age is unclear . 2.6 Proposed mechanisms of fatigue in people on CDT Pathological fatigue is generally discussed as being a complex, multifactorial symptom . Such symptoms, according to the middle -range theory of unpleasant symptoms, can be influenced by physiologic, psychological, and /or situational factors (Lenz, Pugh, Milligan, Gift, & Suppe, 1997) . Physiologic symptom factors are defined as \"normally functioning bodily systems; the existence of any pathology, including the occ urrence of trauma; and the individual's level of energy (reflecting baseline nutritional balance and hydration level)\" (Lenz et al. , 1997, p. 15) . Johansen (2005) specifies that the physiologic mechanisms which may contribute to pathological fatigue in general include central activation failure, impaired neuromuscular propagation, impairment of contractile function, and altered muscle metabolism. A number of physiologic factors may contribute to fatigue in people on CDT. U remia is a clinical syndrome that develops in parallel with the deterioration of renal function, and is associated with fluid, electrolyte and hormone imbalances and m etabolic abnormalities (Medscape, n.d.) . Uremic syndrome is often said to be characterized by symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and malaise, and may lead to protein and energy malnutrition, nausea, and loss of appetite, which ca n contribute to fatigue (Artom et al. , 2014) . However, markers of uremic syndrome, such as albumin, creatinine, Kt/V, urea reduction ratio, phosphate , and calcium, have been inconsistently correlated with fatigue in the renal literature (Artom et al. , 2014) . Anemia is a deficiency in red blood cel ls or blood hemoglobin levels that is a typical complication of ESRD (Locatelli et al. , 2004) , and is characterized by 15 fatigue symptoms. Inflammation has also been recently identified as a potential biological mechanism of fatigue in people on CDT . Increased levels of interleukin -1b (IL -1b) and IL -6, which are biomarkers of inflammation, have been documented in several chronic disease populations in whom fatigue is common (Rohleder, Aringer, & Boentert, 2012) . In people on CDT , IL-6 levels have been found to significantly associated with fatigue after controlling for confounding factors (Bossola, Di Stasio, Giungi, Rosa, & Tazza, 2015) Physical c omor bidity is another potential contributing physiologic factor to the fatigue experienced by people on CDT. Chronic kidney disease rarely occurs in isolation, as an estimated 86% of people with advanced CKD have at least one comorbidity (Gullion, Keith, Nichols, & Smith, 2006) , the most common being hypertension, cardiac disease and diabetes . Several studies have found significant associations between fatigue and the number of comorbidities in people on CDT (Bossola et al. , 2011) . Psychological symptom factors include \"the individual's mental state or mood, affective reaction to illness, and degree of uncertainty and knowledge about the symptoms and their possible meaning\" (Lenz et al. , 1997, p. 15) . Concomitant psychological disorders that are linked to fatigue are common in the CDT population . For example, approximately 2 5% of people on long - term dialysis are estimated to have clinical depression (Palmer et al. , 2013) , and t he correlation between depression and fatigue has been well -established in both the renal and non -renal literature (Farragher and colleagues, 2017). People on CDT also experience high rates of sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea ; insomnia ; restless legs syndrome ; and impaired sleep initiation, maintenance, and adequacy ; which are associated with fatigue or overlapping symptoms (eg. sleepiness) in people on CDT (Artom et al. , 2014) . Sedentary behaviour may also contribute to fatigue in people on CDT . People on CDT have been found to be less physically active than a control group of sedentary adults without kidney disease (Johansen, 2007), and sedentary behaviour has been linked to fatigue in ESRD people (Brunier & Graydon, 1993; Gordon, Doyle, & Johansen, 2011) , although the directionality of this relationship is unclear. Situational symptom factors refer to \"aspects of the social and physical environment that may affect the individual's experience and reporting of symptoms\" (Lenz et al. , 1997, p. 15) . Undergoing routine dialysis therapy is a prominent situational factor which may contribute to fatigue in people on CDT . Just over half of people on in -center hemodialysis report experiencing post-dialysis fatigue (Sklar et al. , 1996) ; 41% of people on CDT say i t takes two to six hours to 16 recover from a dialysis session, while 27% say it takes more than six hours (Rayner et al. , 2014) . The mechan isms underlying postdialysis fatigue are still poorly -understood, although excessive ultrafiltration, rapid osmolar flux (Gorden et al. , 2011), and repeated episodes of myocardial ischaemia during hemodialysis (Dubin et al. , 2013) have been pro posed as potential mechanisms. People on CDT may also experience excessive exertional fatigue (ie. the fatigue experienced in relation to a task), due to the extensive number of health management tasks they must routinely complete in addition to their usual day -to-day activities. For example, people on CDT must regularly attend dialysis sessions and hospital appointments; monitor their blood pressure and fluid intake; and specially prepare meals, using techniques targeted at limiting potassium or phosphate intake such as double boiling potatoes, or extra rinsing meats. 2.7 Clinical approaches to fatigue management in people on CDT Evidence -based interventions to mitigate fatigue in p eople on CDT are currently limited. Erythropoietin stimulating agen ts (ESAs) are one well-studied approach, that target the deficiency in erythropoietin that causes anemia in people on CDT . A systematic review by Johansen and colleagues (2012) found that ESAs were associated with a mean 35% reduction in fatigue among people with baseline hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL, when a correction to >10 g/dL was achieved. The DOP PS study also found that anemia is inconsistently managed across treatment settings internationally (Pisoni et al. , 2004) , which suggests that improved knowledge translation and training on the use of ESA therapy may positively affec t fatigue in people on CDT in some parts of the world . However, the primary limitation of ESAs is that they do not address the multiple other purported mechanisms of fatigue in people on CDT beyond anemia . Exercise training is another well -studied approach in the CDT population, which aims to improv e physical fitness levels by engaging people in structured and/ or routine physical exercise. A review by Johansen (2007) found extensive literature to support that aerobic exercise training increases the exercise capacity of p eople on CDT . Astroth and colleagues (2013) , meanwhile, identified a number of studies, of v arying levels of evidence , that reported positive effects of exercise training on subjective fatigue in people on CDT . However, there are various documented limitations to exercise training as a fatigue inter vention for people on CDT , such as lack of motivation, fear of adverse consequences, and insufficient staff expertise (Delgado & Johansen, 2012; Painter, Clark, & Olausson, 2014) . 17 These barriers have hindered the use of exercise training in the CDT clinical context. The improved exercise capacity after exercise training in people on CDT has also not been found to match age-adjuste d normative levels (Johansen, 2007) , suggesting that people on CDT would still experience higher levels of fatigue than normal even after undergoing exercise training. A number of other approaches have also been proposed for managing fatigue in the CDT population . Interventions targeting improved sleep quality, such as cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) and individualized behavioural approaches, have been reported to have positive effects on fatigue (Chen et al. , 2008, 2011) in people on CDT who have sleep disorders . Acupressure is another approach, grounded in Eastern medicine, that has been explored in two studies of people on CDT and reported to have some positive effects on fatigu e (Cho & Tsay, 2004; Tsay, 2004) , although their potential mechanism of action is unclear. Interventions for depression , such as antidepressant medicatio ns and cognitive -behavioural therapy, have also been discussed as being potentially important for fatigue management in the ESRD population (Farragher, Polatajko, & Jassal, 2017) . Antidepressant medications are often ineffective at directly ameliorating depression -related, according to literature from non -renal populations (Fava et al. , 2014; Menza, Marin, & Opper, 2003) ; however, they may help to counteract secondary fatigue related to inactivity that can occur with l ow mood and anhedonia. Cognitive -behavioural therapy has also been studied as a fatigue management approach in other chronic disease populations , and shown to have positive effects on fatigue perceptions and quality of life (Sandler et al. , 2017; van den Akker et al. , 2017) , and thus may warrant exploration in people on CDT as a secondary coping mechanism for fati gue. 2.8 Energy conservation education Energy conservation education (ECE) is a n approach to fatigue management that has been used in several other chronic disease populations, including multiple sclerosis, cancer, and chronic fatigue syndrome . Packer and coll eagues (2005) describe the goal of ECE as being to promote \"optim um use of available energy to fit the unique needs of each individual\" (Packer, Brink, & Sauriol, 1995, p. 2) . The under lying theory of ECE is that exertional fatigue , and its limiting effects on life participation, can be minimized in people with pathological fatigue by decreas ing the amount of energy they expend during their day-to-day activities . Engaging in d ay-to-day activities can lead to exertional fatigue because activities are comprised of a set of movements 18 and/or cognitive processes , which each use energy. Energy is r equired to achieve the muscular contract ions that enable purposeful body movements, such as standing, lifting, reaching, or walking . Factors such as the force required, the number and types of muscles recruited, and the speed at which an activity is performed, can affect the amount of energy expended during movement . It is also widely accepted that the brain u tilizes glucose during neural activity (Bell, Willson, Wilman, Dave, & Silverstone, 2006) , suggesting that energy is also expended during cognitive processin g. People with chronic illnesses, who often have reduced energy capacities, are therefore more likely to fatigue while attempting to engage in their valued, day -to-day activities. The energy conservation approach is based on the notion that identifying and reducing the energy -draining steps of an activity , can reduce the exertional fatigue experienced during day -to- day activities and thereby improv e life participation . The energy required to engage in a given activity can be identified by considering the movements and cognitive processes it involves , and the finding ways to reduce them. For example, if the amount of energy expended to read a book equals t hat required for the arm, forearm and hand muscles to hold the book and turn the pages, and the br ain to process the content , energy could be saved by instead placing the book on a table. Packer and colleagues Table 2.1: Energy conservation strategies from Packer and colleagues' \"Managing Fatigue\" Program 1. Change body position for activities 2. Plan the day to balance rest and work 3. Modify frequency or outcome standards 4. Include rest periods in the day for at least 1 hour 5. Adjust priorities 6. Simplify activities 7. Communicate needs for assistance 8. Rest during longer activities 9. Change location of equipment/supplie s 10. Delegate part or all of an activity 11. Eliminate part or all of an activity 12. Identify and change incorrect work heights 13. Change the time of day of an activity 14. Use adapted equipment 19 (1995) have outlined fourteen fundamental energy conservation strategies, included in the ir ECE program, that can be used to reduce the energy expended during an activity (Table 2.1). Examples of strategies include simplifying an a ctivity ; prioritizing ; using energy -efficient body postures ; or asking for assistance. ECE appears as though it could be a good fit for the CDT population . Laboratory studies have supported the notion that using energy conservation strategies can reduce both physiological energy expenditure , and perceived exertion , during day -to-day tasks . For example, Velloso and colleagues (2006) demonstrated that energy conservation strateg y use was associated with reduced energy expenditure and shortness of breath during four prespecified self-care tasks (grooming, putting on shoes, retrieving food on high shelves, and retrieving food on low shelves) , in people with moderate to severe COPD. Ip and c olleagues (2006) , similarly, found that the use of energy conservation strategies was associated with a reduction in physiological energy expenditure for younger study participants, and reduced perceived exertion for older study participants, when they completed three self -care tasks (grocery organization, handwashing laundry, and hanging laundry). People on CDT seem to be particularly good candidates for ECE, as they have a marked mi smatch between their reduced energy capacities (Johansen, 1999; Johansen , 2005; Kopple, Storer, & Casburi, 2005) , and the many health management activities they must routinely perform in addition to their usual day -to-day tasks. However, ECE has never been empirically investigated in the CDT population. Furthermore, the literature on energy conservation education and its effects on pertinent fatigue -related outcomes , such as life participation , in other chronic disease populations has never been systematically synthesized , apart from a systematic review that focused only on the Multiple Sclerosis population . The review reported small positive effects of ECE on fatigue , and insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about life participation (Blikman, 2013). Exploring what is known about ECE in people with o ther chronic diseases would help to inform future directions for ECE research in the CDT population. The next chapter of the thesis therefore outlines a scoping review, that was undertaken to investigate more broadly what is known about ECE in people with chronic diseases. 20 Chapter 3: Energy Conservation Education for Adults with Chronic Diseases: A Scoping Review Janine J. Polatajk o Target Journal for Submission: Archives of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation 21 Chapter 3 : Energy Conservation Education for Adults with Chronic Diseases: A Scoping Review 3.1 Abstract Background: Fatigue is a highly common symptom of illness, and is often persistent and disabling among individuals living with chronic diseases. Energy conservation education (ECE) aims to teach people to use energy -conserving strategies, such as planning ahead, bala ncing activity with rest, using assistive tools, and simplifying activities, to manage day-to-day fatigue. No review to date has explored the full body of evidence that exists on ECE in adults with chronic diseases. Objective: To describe what is known ab out energy conservation education for adults with chronic diseases. Methods: We used s coping review methodology , as outlined by Arksey and O'Malley (2005) , to guide this review. We searched s even electronic databases , and reference lists of seminal articles, for relevant articles . The first author then assessed the identified articles for eligibility , with validation from a second reviewer for a subset of articles . We extracted d ata about study populations, program design, and study outcomes from eligible articles , and summarized them descriptively. Finally, w e grouped f indings on EC E according to the chronic disease population studied, and described them narratively. Results & Conclusions: Forty -one articles were included in this review. They collectively reveal that ECE has been studied in seven different chronic disease populations, including multiple sclerosis, cancer, and chron ic fatigue syndrome. Nineteen distinct ECE programs have been studied, which were predominantly face -to-face and included more than seven hours of intervention time. Multiple articles reported positive outcomes associated with a specific face -to- face, grou p-based ECE program in MS people . Beyond this program with people with MS, the evidence on ECE was more limited and equivocal. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of ECE in chronic disease populations who experience fatigue beyond MS, usin g robust study methodologies and evidence -informed program design. The effect of ECE on occupational engagement should also be further studied. 22 3.2 Introduction Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of illness; an estimated 25% of people who visit a prima ry healthcare provider present with fatigue (Kroenke, Wood, Mangelsdorff, Meier, & Powell, 1988) . Fatigue is defined as \"an uncommon, abnormal or e xtreme whole bodily tiredness, disproportionate or unrelated to activity or exertion\", and is particularly prevalent in populations with chronic or long -term illnesses. For example, 59 -100% of people with cancer (Weis, 2011) , & 2014) 75% of sclerosis (MS) (Braley & Chervin, 2010) , 70% of people with advanced kidney disease (Murtagh et al. , 2007) , and 69 -88% of people with heart failure (Fini & de Almeida Lop es Monteiro da Cruz, 2009) are estimated to experience abnormal levels of fatigue. Across populations, fatigue is a nonspecific and poorly -understood symptom that can have a complex array of contributing factors , and effective medical treatments are oft en limited. Fatigue is reported to be a highly concerning and problematic symptom for people with chronic diseases (Curt et al. , 2000; Fisk, Pontefract, Ritvo, Archibald, & Murray, 1994; Manns et al. , 2014) , that interferes with their ability to engage in everyday activities of importance (ie ,, their occupation al engagement ) (Jones et al. , 2016; Ju Mollaoglu, Fertelli, 2011) and diminishes their quality of life (Amato et al. , 2001; J. S. Anderson & Ferrans, 1997; Curt, 2000) . As the prevalence of chronic illness continues to increase globally, investigating approaches that can support people in living with fatigue more s uccessfully should be a high -priority for rehabilitation. Energy conservation education (ECE) is an approach that teaches people to use energy -saving strategies during day-to-day occupations , to minimize their fatigue and improve their occupational engage ment (Mathiowetz et al. , 2001) . Examples of energy -saving strategies include prioritizing, simplifying, pacing, using energy -efficient body postures , and using energy - saving tools (Matuska, Mathiowetz, & Finlayson, 2007) . ECE has been in the literature for over 50 years (eg. (Whitehouse, 1963) , and i ts mechanism of action ( reducing fatigue by decreas ing day-to-day energy expenditure) is widel y applicable, which suggests it has the potential to benefit many chronic disease populations. Laboratory studies hav e also confirmed th e efficacy of energy conservation strateg y use for reduc ing energy expenditure and perceived exertion (Ip et al., 2006; Velloso & Jardim, 2006) . However, the literature on energy conservation education as a rehabilitative intervention for adults with chronic diseases has not yet been well -summarized, 23 apart from one systematic review published in 2013 that focused exclusively on quantitative evidence from the multiple sclerosis population (Blikman et al. , 2013) . It remains unknown whether ECE has been formally studied in other chronic disease populations, w hat the characteristics of ECE programs are, and what findings have been reported about their impact on fatigue, occupation al engagement , and quality of life. This information would help to inform the clinical practice of rehabilitation professional s worki ng with chronic disease populations, and guide future research in the area. The overall purpose of this scoping review was therefore to identify and describe the literature on ECE in adults with chronic diseases. 3.3 Methods We used scoping review methodology , as described by Arksey and O'Malley (2005) , to conduct this review. Scoping review methodology is used to summarize the extent, range and nature of research activity in a research area, for the purpose of collating knowledge and/or identifying evidence gaps (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005; Colquhoun et al. , 2014; Rumrill, Fitzgerald, & Merchant, 2010) . Scoping reviews are a useful approach to knowledge synthesis in disciplines or research areas where there are insufficient randomized controlled trials to undertake a systematic review. Arksey and O'Malley (2005) 's five, iterative scoping review stages were implemented , and are used to structure this paper. 3.3.1 Stage 1 : Identify the research question(s) The overarching research question of this r eview was: What is known about ECE in adults with chronic diseases? Specific questions of interest were: 1. In which chronic disease populations has ECE been studied? 2. What are the characteristics of the ECE programs that have been described in the literature? 3. What findings have been reported regarding the impact of ECE on fatigue, occupations, and quality of life? 4. What other findings have been reported on ECE; eg . regarding its feasibility and acceptability , or mediators or moderators of its effects ? 24 3.3.2 Stage 2: Identify relevant studies The primary author constructed the search strategy in collaboration with an experienced information specialist. Background literature was reviewed to develop the following list of search terms related to ECE: energy conservation, fatigue management, adaptive pacing, work simplification, and energy envelope . The subject heading, title, abstract, and keyword fields were searched in seven electronic literature databases (Medline, Embase, Pubmed, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and PsycInfo). Details of the search strategy used for Medline are provided in Appendix A, as an example of the approach used. The primary author also reviewed re ference lists of seminal articles , to identify missed literature from the electronic search. 3.3.3 Stage 3: Select studies The information specialist i mported the results from the electronic search into Endnote reference management software, and removed duplicate articles . Filters were then applied to eliminate extraneous articles that were captured due to conceptual overlap (ie. environmental energy conservation). Two screeners reviewed a sample (10%) of the results according to the study inclusion/exclusion criteria , and discussed their findings, to validate the s creening process. The primary author then screened the remaining abstracts and, if necessary, full -text articles , to determine their eligibility . We used t he following inclusion/exclusion criteria to select articles : 3.3.3.1 Inclusion criteria Any full -text, peer -reviewed primary article which reported on ECE, in which: Participants were aged >18 years and had a chronic disease (defined as a disease lasting >3 months, in accordance with the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics) and The main focus of the program was education regarding energy conservation, planning, and/or prioritization during everyday activities, and The article was available in English 3.3.3.2 Exclusion criteria The article did not provide findings on energy conservation education, or ECE was c ombined with another fatigue management approach (eg. CBT, exercise), or Participants were <18 years of age or had no chronic disease, or 25 The article was not peer -reviewed, or The result was an abstract, conference proceeding, or review article 3.3.4 Stage 4: Chart the data We used a Microsoft Excel data sheet to document and organize the study data from the eligible articles. Data extracted were: Publication characteristics (ie., title, authors, year, journal) Study characteristics (ie., location, re search question, research design, sample size, outcome measures) Sample characteristics (ie. clinical condition, mean age, gender, additional unique characteristics of the sample) ECE program characteristics (ie. length, mode, format) Primary f indings reported in the studies (c onsistent with scoping review methodology, no critical appraisal was undertaken ) 3.3.5 Stage 5: Collate, summarize and report results We described c haracteristics of the included articles narratively, and synthesized them using frequencies or percentages whe re relevant. We similarly described ECE program characteristics narratively , and synthesized them using frequencies and percentages. We listed t he clinical populations in which ECE had been studied, and reported the number of articles addressing each population. We then used a narrative approach to summarize the findings on ECE for each clinical population. As the literature was particularly extensive on the MS population, findings in this population were further grouped according to the specific ECE program investigated. 3.4 Results The search strategy generated 6, 243 possible items. After we removed duplicate and screened articles for eligibility (Figure 3.1), we identified 41 primary articles that were eligible fo r the review (Table 3.1). 26 3.4.1 Description of the literature Seventeen (41%) articles were published within the last five years (2013 -2017). The majority of articles described studies conducted in the USA (67%) ; however, studies were also conducted in Figure 3.1: PRISMA Flow Diagram of Study Selection the UK (8 studies), Australia (3 studies), Austria (1 study), Iran (1 study), the Netherlands (1 study), and Sweden (1 study). The most common study designs were RCTs (9 studies) , pilot 27 Table 3.1: Characteristics of ECE articles included in review Disease Group Study Year First Author Study Design Sample Size Additional Sample Characteristics Mean Age % Female Energy Conservation Program Used (see Table 3 .2) Acquired Brain Injury 2015 Boehm Case study 1 Post -stroke 71 0 Finlayson et al. 2017 Raina Pilot study 41 Mild to severe traumatic brain injury, >6 months post -injury NR 45 Raina et al.

Other study designs included subgroup analyses (4 studies), qualitative studies (3 studies), long -term follow -up studies (4 studies), follow -up surveys (3 studies), mixed -methods studies ( 1 study), study re -analyses (1 study), and case studies (1 study). Twenty -six studies reported on the efficacy or effectiveness of ECE (Table 3. 3). The most common dependent variables explored were fatigue (20 studies), fatigue impact (13 studies) and qual ity of life or its subdomains (12 studies) . Other dependent variables that were investigated were occupation al engagement (10 studies), energy conservation strategy use (7 studies), self -efficacy (7 studies), and fatigue -related knowledge (4 studies). 3.4.2 Clinical populations studied Just over half of the included studies (22 of 41) focused exclusively or primarily on the multiple sclerosis (MS) population. The remainder focused on six different populations: chronic fatigue syndrome (7 studies), cancer (4 stud ies), cardiac disease (3 studies), rheumatoid arthritis (2 studies), acquired brain injury (2 studies), and post -polio syndrome (1 study). 3.4.3 Characteristics of the ECE programs The literature on ECE described n ineteen different ECE programs ( see Table 3 .2 for their characteristics ). Seven programs were versions of Packer and colleagues ' (1995) \"Managing Fatigue: A Six -Week Course in Energy Conservation\" program The \"Managing Fatigue\" program is a protocolized, face -to-face, group -based ECE, with a total of ~9 hours of ECE provided. Its adaptations included a teleconference -based version, a web-supported version, and two individually -delivered versions. The \"Managing Fatigue\" program and/or its adaptations were used for all 22 of the MS studies on ECE , but only one ECE study outside of the MS population. The remaining 12 ECE programs , used in the 1 8 other studies of ECE in different clinical populations, were all distinct . Six programs used a face -to-face modality, while the other s ix used different delivery modes , such as telephone, computer, audio CDs, a self -guided workbook, or mixed -modalities. Eight of the programs were delivered individually , and four were group - based . Total reported program lengths ranged from one to twelve ho urs, with the median being 7.5 hou rs and the majority (82%) being more than five hours. 31 Table 3 .2: Design characteristics of ECE programs described in the literature Program Described By Supporting theory Delivery Model Format Sessions Total approx. length \"Managing Fatigue \" or adaptations Packer et al.

Mathiowetz and colleagues (2001) conducted a pilot RCT including 54 community -dwelling volunteers with MS , and reported that the \"Managing Fatigue\" participants experienced significantly greater improvements in fatigue, fatigue impact, and so me quality of life domains compared to an active control . The ECE participants also used more energy -conserving strategies, and reported greater self -efficacy (Mathiowetz et al. , 2001) . Mathiowetz and colleagues (2005) conducted a randomi zed controlled trial (RCT) with 169 volunteers with MS , and found that, consistent with the pilot RCT, the \"Managing Fatigue\" participants were less fatigued, and experienced greater gains in fatigue impact , some domains of quality of life, self -efficacy, and use of energy -conserving strategies, compared to a wait -list control . Improvements were still seen six weeks (Mathiowetz et al. , 2005) and one -year post - intervention (Mathiowetz, Matuska, Finlayson, Luo, & Chen, 2007) . Mathiowetz and Busch (2006) administered post -study program evaluations and reported that the \"Managing Fatigue\" program was well -regarded among participants, receiving a mean overall value rating of six out of seven . Core concepts such as budgeting /banking energy, and the social aspect of the group intervention , were t he most highly -rated aspects of the program . Lower -rated aspects included aspects of the intervention format (eg. completing homework assignments), and specific course topics (eg. activity stations and ergonomics) (Mathiowetz & Busch, 2006) . Matuska and colleagues (2007) reported that a ll 14 of the ECE strategies taught in the program were adopted by at least half of the participants after the course. Participants perceived the strategies of t aking rest breaks, delegating tasks, and modifying priorities to be the most useful ECE strategies (Matuska et al. , 2007) . Finlayson and colleagues (2007) reported there was no interaction between participants' baseline cognitive status and their change in vitality scores after the program, although poorer cognitive functioning was associated with poorer post -intervention quiz performance and less reported energy conservation strategy use. Lamb and colleagues (2005) , meanwhile, reported that p articipants who missed 1 treatment , recei ving self- study modules i nstead , experienced comparable positive outcomes to those who attended all sessions . 33 3.4.4.1.2 Teleconference -based adaptatio n Seven studies investigated an adaptation of the \"Managing Fatigue\" program, delivered by teleconferencing, in people with MS. Finlayson a nd colleagues (2005) conducted a n uncontrolled pilot study, involving 29 volunteers with MS, and reported that participants experienced significant improvements in fatigue impact, fatigue severity, and some domains of quality of life . Finlayson and colleagues (2011) conducted a n RCT , including 190 volunteers with MS , and similarly found that the teleconference -based program was associated with significantly greater improvements in fatigue impact, compared to a wait -list control. These gains were reportedly maintained at 6 months post -intervention. However, they reported no differences between groups in self -efficacy, fatigue severity, or quality of life , at immediate or long-term follow -up (Finlayson et al. , 2011) . In a follow -up study, Asano and colleagues (2015) reported that participants achieved approximately half of the activity -related goals they had set at the beginning of the program, with short -term goals being more frequently achieved than mid- term or long -term goals . However, outcome information was only available for 60% of the goals originally set by study participants . Holberg and Finlayson (2007) conducted a qualitative follow -up study , and reported that factors such as disease progression, level of disability, predictability of fatigue, concurrent symptoms, cognitive status, and physical and social environment affected particip ants' use of the program information. However, they reported that participants felt the program had changed their perspective on fatigue , and enabled them to feel more in control of their lives (Holberg & Finlayson, 2007) . Finlayson, Preissner and Cho (2012) conducted secondary analyses of the data, and reported that o lder age was associated with less improvement in self -efficacy and fatigue impact, and lower functional status was associated with less improvement in mental health. The y also reported that the type and nature of comorbidities affect ed outcomes. For example, people with diabetes experience d more gradual improvements during and after the program compared to non -diabetics, and people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were less likely to maintain initial benefits gained from the program (Finlayson, Preissner, & Cho, 2013) . Dunleavy, Preissner and Finlayson (2013) conducted a retrospective study of clinical chart notes , and reported that the occupational therapists pro viding the teleconference - based ECEP perceived it to be generally feasible and beneficial, although they identified several aspects of the phone -based delivery (eg. managing time, adhering to the treatment protocol, managing the group process) as challengi ng. 34 3.4.4.1.3 Internet -based adaptation Three studies examined an internet -based adaptation of the \"Managing Fatigue\" program in the MS population. Ghahari, Packer and Passmore (2009) conducted a pilot trial involving 5 people with MS , and reported that the web-supported program was associated with improvements in fatigue impact, performance of activities of daily living, and quality of life compared to baseline. Ghahari, Packer and Passmore (2010) conducted a three -arm RCT (n=95) involving people who had a progressive neurological condition, and reported the web-supported ECEP had no significant effects on fatigue impact, performance of activities of daily living, or quality of life, compared to an information -only control and a no -intervention contro l. Ghahari and Packer (2012) conducted a secondary analysis , comparing the RCT data to a non -equivalent group who received the original face-to-face \"Managing Fatigue\" protocol, and reported that the face -to- face program was associated with the greatest improvements in the primary outcome of fatigue impact. 3.4.4.1.4 One-to-one adaptations Two studies examined 1:1 adaptations program among MS people . Blikman and colleagues (2017) conducted an RCT involving 76 individuals with MS , and reported that the 1:1 \"Managing Fa tigue\" program had no significant effect on fatigue or participation outcomes, compared to an information -only control. Van Heest, Mogush and Mathiowetz (2017) conducted a quasi -experimental study (n=49) involving predominantly people with MS (78%), and reported that their 1:1 program adaptation was associated with improvements in the majority of the study outcomes (including fatigue and self -efficacy). 3.4.4.1.5 Other adaptations Three studies examined other adaptations of the \"Managing Fatigue \" course in people with MS. Vanage, Gilbertson and Mathiowetz (2003) conducted an RCT examin ing a version of the \"Managing Fatigue\" program for people with progressive MS , who had a lower baseline functional status , and reported t he program was associated with significant improvements in fatigue impact compared to control . They also reported that the gains made were maintained at eight weeks post -interv ention (Vanage et al. , 2003) . Garc\u00eda Jal\u00f3n and colleagues (2013) examined an ECE program informed by several other ECE program s, including the \"Managing Fatigue\" program, an d reported no differences in self -efficacy, fatigue severity, or depressive 35 Table 3.3: Reported outcomes associated with ECE Population Abbreviated Study Citation Control Reported Outcomes Fatigue Fatigue Impact Activit y Quality of life Self-efficacy Fatigue knowledge EC strategy use Total Physical Cognitive Psychosocial Energy expend ed Occ. engagement Mental health Physical fxn* Role -physical Bodily pain General health Social fxn Role -emotional Multiple sclerosis Mathiowetz, 2001 Support group Vanage, 2003 Support group Mathiowetz, 2005 Wait -list Finlayson, 2005 None Sauter, 2008 None Ghahari, 2009 None Ghahari, 2010 Standard care Finlayson, 2011 Wait Jalon, -only Cancer Barsevick, 2002 care Barsevick, 2004 Support group Yuen, 2006 None Sadeghi, 201 6 Standard care Cardiac disease Norberg, 2017 None Kim, 2016 None Rheumatoi d Arthritis Furst, 1987 Existing ECEP Barry, 1994 None Post -polio Young, 1991 None Acquired brain Injury Boehm, 2015 None Raina, 2016 Health education CFS McDermott, 2004 None White, 2011 Standard care Friedburg, 2015 Standard care Chronic condition Van Heest, 2017 None Legend: favours ECE; no difference between ECE & control; not assesse d36 symptoms in the ECE group compared to control, with the exception of the cognitive subscale of the Fatigue Impact Scale. Sauter and colleagues (2008) conducted an uncontrolled study of 32 people to examine a German -language adaptation of the program, and reported it was associated with improvement in fatigue impact, but not fatigue, at 3 months and 9 months post -intervention. 3.4.4.2 Chronic fatigue syndrome Seven studies explored ECE in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). White and colleagues (2011) conducted an RCT involving 641 people with CFS to compare ECE to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), graded exercise therapy (GET), and a standard care control. They found a n extensive, individually -delivered ECE had no effect on the primary outcomes (fatigue or physical performance) or secondary outcom es (mental health, participation) compared to the standard care control, and was less effective than CBT and GET (P. White et al. , 2011) . Dougall and colleagues (2014) conducted a follow -up study and found that people allocated to ECE or standard care were more li kely to experience a post -intervention decline in physical functioning , compared to the CBT and GET participants, while White and colleagues (2013) found that ECE participants were less likely to recover from CFS. There was no difference in rates of serious adverse events reported among the treatment groups (Dougall et al. , 2014) . Wilshire and colleagues (2017) conducted a re-analysis of the RCT data to explore the study results according to the original RCT protocol, and found that when the original protocol was used, the recovery rate from CFS was in fact no better for the CBT or GE T treatment groups compared to ECE or usual care (Wilshire et al. , 2017) . Sharpe and colleagues (2015) conducted a long-term follow up study at 2.5 years post -intervention , and found no difference in fatigue and physical functioning between the four treatment groups, although participants in the ECE and standard -care groups more frequently participated in alternative treatments (CBT or GET) after the original study ended . McDermott and colleagues (2004) undertook a uncontrolled, retrospective study to examine return -to-work activitie s in 98 people with CFS who participate d in a clinical , group -based ECE program . They reported 56% of program participants had undergone work training or acquired new full -time, part -time or volunteer work at 18 months post -intervention, while 19% continue d with their previous employment (McDermott et al. , 2004) . Sixty -six percent of participants were reported to have an increase in their feelings of vitality, compared to baseline. Friedberg and 37 colleagues (2016) conducted an RCT stud ying ECE among a sample of 137 CFS people who had a high level of disability at baseline , and reported that two versions of a n ECE self -management program (a \"high tech\" and \"low -tech\" version) were associated with significant reductions in fatigue severity and depression scores compared to usual care. However, self -care independence, activity levels, and anxiety did not change s ignificantly in the ECE groups compared to control (Friedberg et al. , 2016) . The positive effects on fatigue and depression were also not reported to be maintained at long -term follow -up. 3.4.4.3 Cancer Four studies examined ECE programs in people with cancer. Barsevick and colleagues (2002) undertook a pilot study of a brief, telephone -based ECEP with 80 cancer people initiating chemotherapy or radiat ion therapy, and reported that the program was feasible, acceptable, and associated with reductions in fatigue compared to a non -equivalent control. Barsevick and colleagues (2004) conducted a n RCT , comparing the same ECE to a support group control with a sample of 396 cancer people initiating chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and reported that the ECE group adopted more energy conservation str ategies post -intervention and experienced significantly less fatigue compared to control ; however, the effect sizes were reported to be very small . No improvement was reported in the people ' participation in activities of daily living (Barsevick et al. , 2004) . Yuen, Mitcham and Morgan (2006) conducted a pilot study comparing a different ECE program to a standard -care control with 12 cancer survivors in the post -treatment stage of their illness, and reported that only the sensory dimension of fatigue demonstrated positive outcomes, while general, physical and cognitive fatigue were unaffected (Yuen et al. , 2006) . Meanwhile, Sadeghi, Gozali and Tabrizi (2016) undertook an RCT (n=135) comparing a group -based ECE program to a usual -care control in women with breast cancer , and reported that multiple types of fatigue i mproved significantly in the ECE group compared to control, as did several indicators of healthy living (eg. physical activity, nutrition, stress management). 3.4.4.4 Cardiac disease Kim and colleagues (2016) tested a telephone -based ECE program for cardiac arrest survivors, that used a n individualized, problem -solving approach to ECE training. They involved e ighteen participants in a quasi -experimental trial of the program, and found it to be feasible and associated with improvements in fatigue impact, fatigue and participation (Kim et al. , 2016) . 38 Planning ahead, pacing oneself, and delegating activitie s were reported to be the most commonly -used energy conservation strategies by participants, and household tasks, leisure activities and grocery shopping were the most common occupations targeted during the program (Kim et al. , 2017) . Norber g and colleagues (2017) conducted a mixed -methods study (n=5) of a different , individualized ECE program for people with ch ronic heart failure , and reported that participants adopted energy conservation strategies after participating in the ECEP, but fatigue and depression -related outcomes were mixed. The occupational therapists who administered the ECEP were reported to appre ciate its thoroughness, but questioned the feasibility of using the extensive program in routine clinical practice (Norberg et al. , 2017) . 3.4.4.5 Acquired brain injury Raina and colleagues (2016) undertook a pilot RCT of an internet -based ECE program with 41 people living with a traumatic brain injury , and reported that the ECE program, which used a problem -solving approach, was feasible and associated with small to moderate -sized improvements in fatigue impact and fatigue. Meanwhile, Boehm, Muehlberg and Stube (2015) studied an individually -delivered, teleconference -based adaptation of the \"Managing Fatigue\" program in a case study of a 70 -year-old person living post-stroke , and reported that it was associated with a decrease in physical, cogni tive and social fatigue impact. However, minimal change was reported to occur in the participant 's performance of, and satisfaction with, three self-identified occupational goals (Boehm et al. , 2015) . 3.4.4.6 Rheumatoid arthriti s Barry and colleagues (1994) conducted an uncontrolled, pre -post study, and reported that people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were able to identify energy conservation strategies more successfully after participating in one hour of individually -delivered ECE. Furst and colleagues (1987) undertook a pilot study involving 28 people with RA to compare a formally -developed , group-based ECE program to usual occupational therapy care, and reported that the ECE program was associated with greater increases in physical activity levels, and balance between rest and activity, at 3 months post -intervention . However, no differences were reported in other study outcomes such as pain, fatigue, psychosocial adjustment to illness, knowledge, or independence in activities of daily living (Furst et al. , 1987) . 39 3.4.4.7 Post-polio syndrome Young and colleagues (1991) conducted a retrospective study investigat ing a clinical , group - based ECE program in a sample of 35 p eople with post -polio syndrome, and reported that participants ' knowledge about their disease, use of energy -conserving behavi ours, and fatigue ratings improved after the program . 3.5 Discussion Our study is the first to comprehensively identify and describe the literature on ECE in adults with chronic diseases. We found ECE has been studied in seven chronic disease populations : MS, cancer, CFS, cardiac disease, acquired brain injury, RA, and post -polio syndrome . Multiple approaches to ECE have been examined, but the literature was most extensive on a six -session , face-to-face, group -based program entitled \"Managing Fatigue: A S ix-Week Course in Energy Conservation\" (Packer et al. , 1995) , studied almost exclusively in the MS population. The program was said to be feasible with this population, and both quantitative and qualitative studies reported it had various positive effects on participants, such as reducing the impact of fatigue on their physical, cognitive and psychosocial functioning and improving their self - efficacy (Finlayson et al. , 2011; Mathiowetz et al. , 2005) . Participants also reported that the y valued the social aspect of the program (Mathiowetz & Busch, 2006) , and that they energy conservation strategies they learned were novel and effective (Mathiowetz & Busch, 2006; Matuska et al. , 2007) . The consistency of the se positive findings indicate the \"Managing Fatigue\" program is a beneficial treatment option for people with MS who experience fatigue , and may warrant investigation in other chronic disease populations for whom its program format would be feasible. A potential limitation of the \"Managing Fatigue\" program is its face-to-face, group -based design, which may be inaccessi ble or inconvenien t for peopl e with barriers to attending a health facility . Several adapt ations of \"Managing Fatigue\" were created to be more accessible, such as a teleconference -based adaptation, a web-supported adaptation, and individualized adaptations, but were reported ly associated with more mixed results . Beyond the \"Managing Fatigue\" program, a number of remotely -delivered and individualized ECE programs were studied in other populations that were said to be associated with positive outcomes ; however, the literature was still preliminary. Further robust research into accessible and/or individualized ECE programs is 40 therefore needed. In the general literature, e-health education programs have been found to be effective (Buntin, Burke, Hoaglin, & Blumenthal, 2011; Krebs, Yardley, Powell, & Michie, 2012) . Design components that have been identified as important includ e social interaction or social references, tailoring, contact with the intervention , and self -management features (Morrison et al. , 2012 ). Individually -delivered interventions , meanwhile, can offer tailoring towards individual needs, preferences, and goals, which is associated with better health education outcomes (Lustria et al. , 2013) , and which may therefore be beneficial for ECE program design. Despite the positive reported effects of t he \"Managing Fatigue\" program on fatigue outcomes , there were also a limited number of studies that investigat ed its effects on occupational engagement . ECE is an approach to fatigue management that uniquely focuses on occupational engagement, which is a n important consequence of fatigue for people with chronic diseases (Curt et al. , 2000; Fisk, Pontefract, et al. , 1994; Ju et al. , 2018) . The reported findings that were available did not su pport a strong effec t on occupational engagement ; for example, Asano and colleagues (2015) reported t hat people 's life goals were infrequently achieved after the \"Managing Fatigue\" program. They subsequently proposed, in their discussion of findings, that adding a goal management component to the \"Managing Fatigue\" program might facilitate the attainment of participants' life participation goals (Asano, Berg, Johnson, Turpin, & Finlayson, 2015) . A functional goal-focused approach to rehabilitation has generally been associated with positive o ccupational engagement outcomes in multiple populations, such as traumatic brain injury (Dawson et al. , 2009) , developmental coordination disorder (Smits -Engelsman et al. 2013) and stroke (Polatajko, McEwen, Ryan, & Baum, 2012) . It offer s several advantages over traditional education approa ches, including a client -centered consideration of individual participant needs and situations (Polatajko et al. , 2001) , which allows for targeted intervention tailoring . There were more recent ECE programs identified in this review that did include a goal - focused component; however, they require further study to ascertain their effects on occupational engagement. In general, ECE studies should routinely include personalized measure s of occupational engagement or performance , such as the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (Law et al. , 1990) , Activity Card Sort (Gustafsson et al. , 2014) , or Performance Quality Rating Scale (Martini, Rios, Po latajko, Wolf, & McEwen, 2015) , to measure its effect on participation in occupations that are meaningful to the participant . 41 Beyond the \"Managing Fatigue\" program in the MS population, the reported findings on ECE in other chronic disease populations were either conflicting, or preliminary . It is unclear whether the conflicting findings were attributable to study variations in ECE program, sample , and/or design. For example, i n people with cancer, two controlled studies reported that ECE had little to no effect on outcomes such as fatigue and physical function (Barsevick et al. , 2004; Yuen et al. , 2006) , yet another RCT reported ECE had a positive effect o n fatigue (Sadeghi et al. , 2016) . The length of the ECE programs used varied greatly between the studies, as did the timing of the introduction of the intervention , both which could have affected study outcomes . In people with CFS, a large RCT showed no effect of an extensive, individually -delivered ECE program compared to standard care, on fatigue, physical performance, participation and mental health (P. White et al. , 2011) . This finding could be related to the longstanding ambiguity of the underlying nature of CFS , which has been discussed as being a psychological disorder that therefore may not respond to ECE. However, the scientific rigor of the PACE trial has also been questioned since its publication (Wilsh ire et al. , 2017) , as mid -study protocol changes were subsequently reported to have inflated the effects of two active control arms (CBT and graded exercise). Other preliminary studies have , by contrast, reported that ECE has positive effects on people with CFS (Friedberg et al. , 2016; McDermott et al. , 2004) . Further research on ECE in both the c ancer and CFS populations, using well -designed ECE programs and robust study methodologies, is therefore needed . The reported findings on ECE in other chronic disease populations (eg. rheumatoid arthritis, post-polio syndrome, cardiac disease, acquired bra in injury) were predominantly positive, but preliminary. Further robust research on ECE in these populations is therefore warranted . We also found no studies of ECE in chronic disease populations such as kidney disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , who also experience a high burden of fatigue (Mollaoglu et al. , 2011; Murtagh et al. , 2007) . Given the benefits of ECE that have been demonstrated in the MS population, research should be undertaken to explore the potential for ECE to improve fatigue - related outcomes in these populations. The strengths of this review include the comprehensive literature search that was conducted by trained professionals; the broad examination of the evidence on ECEs across clinical populations; and the systematic approach used to identify and describe the evidence. Its limitations include the exclusion of non -English studies, which may limit the generalizability of 42 the findings ; and, limitations inherent to a scoping review, such as a lack of consideration of evidence quality, which may mean that quality -based evidence gaps were not identified. 3.6 Conclusion Multiple studies support the \"Managing Fatigue\" ECE program as an effective approach in the MS population. Preliminary evidence on ECE is also promising in acquired brain injury, post - polio, and cardiac disease, justifying the need for further robust trials in these populations. Evidence on ECE is currently conflicting in cancer and CFS, and thus further well-designed resear ch is a lso warranted for clarification . Investigation into ECE in other chronic disease populations with a high burden of fatigue, such as COPD and kidney disease, is needed. Future ECE trials should aim to use evidence -informed programs, and measure occupational engagement . Flexible and convenient program delivery formats, such as self -guided, individualized, or telehealth programs, should also be further investigated. 43 Chapter 4: Developing PEP\": A Personalized, Web-supported Energy Conservation Education Program for Adults on Chronic Dialysis Therapy Janine F. Farragher, Sarbjit V. Jassal, Sara McEwen, Helene J. Polatajko Target Journal for Submission: American Journal of Occupational Therapy 44 Chapter 4: Developing \"PEP\": A Personalized, Web- supported Energy Conservation Education Program for Adults on Chronic Dialysis Therapy 4.1 Abstract Background: Fatigue is one of the most common and disabling symptoms experienced by people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on chronic dialysis therapy (CDT) . Energy conservation education (ECE) is an approach to fatigue management that has demonstrated some positive effects in other chronic disease populations, but has yet to be explored for its potential for the CDT population. Objective s: To explore whether an ECE program exists to meet the needs of adults on CDT ; to develop a new ECE program tailored for the CDT population , if needed ; and to carry out preliminary evaluation of the program. Methods: We followe d the World Health Organization's framework for health education planning to guide the intervention development process. We addressed Stage 1, engaging and understanding the population , through an examination of recent CDT studies that included a patient engagement component. We accomplished Stage 2, assessing the needs and assets of the priority population , using a literature -informed Strengths, Weaknesses , Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis. We then identified the highest -priority results of the SWOT, and transformed them into program goals and objectives , meeting Stage 3 , developing program goals and objectives . We accomplished Stage 4, planning an intervention , in three substa ges: a . Initial program development; b . Key informant feedback; and c . Usability testing. We completed Stage 4a by consulting relevant literature to select theory and evidence -based educational approaches, and then engaged expert key informants in semi -structured interviews about the new program during Stage 4b . We accomplished Stage 4c using performance - and questionnaire -based usability testing with people on CDT. Results and Conclusions: We identified need s that could be addressed by ECE in the CDT population through the SWOT analysis . As there was no existing ECE program that met these needs , we developed a new program . The three goals we identified from the SWOT for the new program were that it would 1. improve life participation; 2. be feasible fo r people on CDT ; and 3. use theory and evidence from the ECE and health education literature . The resulting new ECE program combines an established personalized, goal -based, problem solving approach (CO -OP) with traditional didactic ECE methods that a re delivered via three brief, novel web modules. The feedback provided by k ey informant s on the program was 45 positive, while a number of program modifications were recommended, of which 26 were implemented. Usability testing revealed the majority of the program was usable by people on CDT with various characteristics, while minimal support was required for people with little to no computer literacy. Further research should investigate the effects of the program on fatigue - related outcomes in people on CDT . 46 4.2 Introduction Fatigue is among the most common and limiting experiences of people with end -stage renal disease (ESRD) treated with chronic dialysis therapy (CDT) (Ju et al. , 2018; Manns et al. , 2007) . Fatigue has be en defined as an \"unusual, abnormal or excessive whole -body tiredness, disproportionate to or unrelated to activity or exertion\". It has been estimated that approximately 70% of people on chronic dialysis experience fatigue (Murtagh et al. , 2007) . Fatigue is a complex, nonspecific symptom that , in end -stage renal disease (ESRD) , is associated with a multitude of factors, such as anemia, inflammation, depression and sleep disorders (Artom et al. , 2014; Bossola et al. , 2008) . Evidence -based treatment options for fatigue in people with ESRD are currently limited (Artom et al. , 2014) . Erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) are the most well -established approach to fatigue management for people on CDT , and have been found to reduce fatigue by 35% in people on CDT with severe forms of anemia (Johansen et al. , 2012a) . However, ESAs do not address the multiple other factors that contribute to fatigue in ESRD beyond anemia. Exercise training is another widely -researched approach in people with ESRD , that has been associated with an increased e nergy capacity and a reduction in subjective fatigue in people on CDT (Astroth et al. , 2013; Johansen, 2007) . However, there are a number of longstanding barriers to the use of exercise training with people on CDT , such as insufficient dialysis staff expertise , and low motivation or energy among people on CDT (Delgado & Johansen, 2012; Kontos et al. , 2007; Painter et al. , 2014) , that have proven challenging to overcome in the ESRD community to date. Fatigue is associated with a range of negative outcomes in the CDT population (Davison & Jhangri, 2010; Jhamb et al. , 2011; Wang et al. , 2014) , with the most prominent, according to people on CDT themselves, being its negative impact on the ir ability to participate in daily activities (Ju et al. , 2018) . In a recent Canadian research -priority setting exercise, people on dialysis identified fatigue as being among their top -three research priorities (Manns et al. , 2014) , underscoring the need to investigate novel approaches to minimize fatigue and its impact on life participation for this populat ion. Energy conservation education (ECE) is an approach to fatigue management which has been reported to have positive effects on fatigue outcomes in other chronic disease populations, 47 including multiple sclerosis, cardiac disease, and acquired brain inju overall goal of ECE approach is to promote \"opti mum use of available energy to fit the unique needs of each individual\" (Packer et al. , 1995 , p. 2) . People are taught to use a range of energy conservation strategies during everyday activities, to reduce fatigue and improve life participation . Examples of energy conservation strategies include combining steps of an activity, using assistive tools, avoiding inefficient body postures, and reorganizing activity stat ions. Energy conservation education is theoretically a good fit for the CDT population, given that multiple studies have shown the exercise capacity of people on CDT is reduced , and t hey fatigue more easily during activity (K. L. Johansen, 2007; Kirsten L. Johansen et al. , 2005) . In addition, p eople on CDT also have extra health -related activities they must routinely complete in addition to their usual day-to-day tasks , such as going t o dialysis; monitoring blood pressure, fluid intake and diet; and attending frequent hospital appointments ; which may exacerbate their fatigue. However, despite its potential to improve fatigue -related outcomes in people on CDT, ECE has never been formally investigated in the CDT population (Farragher et al. , unpublished ). Our primary objective was therefore to investigate the potential of an energy conservation approach in the CDT population. 4.3 Methods We used the six-stage WHO framework for health education planning (World Health Organization, 2014) to inform our intervention exploration and development process (Figure 4.1). Stages 1 -4 are reported here; stages 5 -6 are reported in a separate publication (Farraghe r, Polatajko, McEwen & Jassal , unpublished). We addressed Stage 1, engaging and understanding the population , through an examination of recent studies that included a patient engagement component, and that explored their experiences and/or needs related to CDT and fatigue. We undertook Stage 2, assessing the needs and assets of the population , by conducting a SWOT analysis to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities a nd threats to ECE among people on CDT . The primary sources we consulted to inform the SWOT analysis were: a recent scoping review of energy conservation education literature in other chronic disease populations (Farragher et al. , unpublished) ; published ne phrology literature; and the nephrologist on our development team, who has 15 years of experience working in a large, academic hospital setting. 48 We addressed Stage 3, developing program goals and objectives , by having the primary research team (two academ ic OTs, one nephrologist and one academic PT) discuss the findings from the Figure 4.1: Intervention development process SWOT analysis, to identify the highest priority needs and reformulate them into goal and objective statements. We undertook Stage 4, planning an intervention , in three substages: 4a. Initial program development, 4b. Key informant feedback, and 4c. Usability testing . We accomplished Stage 4a, initial program development , using an iterative, multi -staged process. Guided by the program go als and objectives, w e reviewed relevant background literature to inform theory or evidence -based strategies that could be incorporated into the new energy conservation program. We then designed the program, with multiple revision and moderations made duri ng the process, until the research team reached consensus that the program would meet its goals and objectives. We accomplished Stage 4b, key informant feedback, by conducting semi -structured interviews with two CKD people , one CDT clinician, and one health education specialist , to gather their perspectives on the strengths and limitations of the program modules and recommendations for modifications . We chose t he informants purposively to provide a range of expertise regarding the program content and d esign, and for desired characteristics such as insightfulness, discernment, 49 and enthusiasm to participate. We showed e ach key informant each of the three program computer modules over three separate sessions, and then interviewed them using a semi - structur ed guide (Appendix B). The first author audio -recorded and transcribed a ll interviews, and then read the transcriptions to get a general sense of the content. The first author then coded the content into one of two broad categories: program strength, or pr ogram weakness/recommendation for change . The first author then created more s pecific codes , that described the type of strength and/or weaknes s. Next , the research team met to review the information and decide on actions. Recommended modifications were im plemented unless they were conflicting between informants, or deemed to be unnecessary or infeasible by the research team. We undertook Stage 4c, usability testing, with intended users to assess the usability of the program, and identify usability barriers to address with further design modifications . We recruited p articipants from the dialysis units at an academic hospital in Toronto. We identified prospective participants using purpos ive sampling, to represent varying levels of functional abilities and computer literacy of the CDT population. Participants were required to be over 18 years of age, and to have adequate visual function and English comprehension to complete study activitie s. We conducted b oth a performance -based assessment , in which the user was observed engaging with the program technology, and a user satisfaction questionnaire. We provided e ach participant with the program workbook, g ave them a brief orientation to the pr ogram and workbook, and then asked them to access and complete each of the program's computer modules independently. The first author observed p articipants while they complet ed each module task , documented their progress through the modules, noted the need for cues or assistance, and documented any observed or reported barriers to completion. Analysis of these observations consisted of tabulating the percentage of module tasks that pa rticipant s were able to complete independently. Barriers to independent co mpletion were also listed. Once the modules were completed, t he first author administered the System Usability Scale (SUS) (Jordan, Thomas, McClelland, & Weerdmeester, 1996) . The SUS asked p articipants to rate their satisfaction and the ease of use of the technology on ten, four-point Likert -scale questions . The SUS is a widely - used measure of system usability in healthcare, with strong reliability and validity across various popu lations and interventions (Bangor, Kortum, & Miller, 2008) . We summed s cores on the SUS 50 and then multiplied by 2.5, to generate a total usability score out of 100, with higher scores representing better usability. We also calculated t he median score on the SUS. We completed Stage 5, implementing the intervention, and Stage 6, evaluating the importance of the intervention , with a small group of participants . These data are reported in a separate publication (Farragher, in preparation). 4.4 Results 4.4.1 Stage 1: Engaging and understanding the priority population We found people on CDT were recently engaged in two studies that explored their top uncertainties and priorities for research into CDT. The first was a study conducted in Canada , where Manns and colleagues (2014) undertook a two -staged consensus -building process. In the first stage, they distributed a survey to a sample of people on CDT from across Canada, to identify the research uncertainties of people on CDT. They then held a consensus workshop with a steering committee, involving 11 people , to select the top ten uncertainties. T hey found that fatigue and its management were among the top three research priorities of people on CDT (Manns et al., 2014) . The second study was an international consensus -building workshop conducted by Ju and colleagues (2018) to discuss the development and implementation of a core outcome measure for fatigue in the C DT population. Fifteen people on CDT /caregivers and 42 healthcare professionals participated in the discussion. One of their core findings, was that the impact of fatigue on the life participation of people on CDT was the most salient aspect of fatigue to address (Ju et al. , 2018) . These two studies provided justification to further explor e ECE for the CDT population, as it is an approach that targets the impact on fatigue on life participation. 4.4.2 Stage 2: Assessing the needs and assets of the priority population The SWOT analysis , presented in Figure 4.2, revealed a number of strengths and opportunities (eg. evidence of positive effects of ECE on fatigue in other chronic disease populations ; increased focus on qual ity of life and symptom management in nephrology) . However, there were also a number of weaknesses and threats identified (eg. lack of evidence for improving life 51 participation; limited time among people on CDT to participate in an ECE program). Collectively, the results suggested that an ECE program could be beneficial for people on CDT , but that it would need to be designed to meet the specific needs of the CDT population. Figure 4.2: SWOT analysis of energy conservation educ ation for people on CDT Strengths -Has been associated with positive fatigue -related outcomes in other chronic disease populations, such as Multiple Sclerosis -Well -positioned to target life participation outcomes -Theoretical basis suggests it can be useful regardless of the underlying fatigue aetiology provided it has a physical origin, which is true for people on CDT -Common ECE strategies from existing programs have been found to be useful and effectiveWeaknesses -Limited evidence that existing programs improve life participation -Most ECE programs are time -consuming, involving on average 7 hours of patient education -Most evidence -based ECE programs are delivered in-person, which is inaccessible to people with barriers to attending a health facility -Existing programs not designed to meet specific user characteristics (eg. visual impairment, cognitive impairment) Opportunities -Increased focus on addressing patient -reported outcomes such as fatigue in the nephrology community -People on CDT identify fatigue management as a top research priority, suggesting interest in a new fatigue management approach -People on CDT report some maladaptive fatigue management strategies that could be amenable to change via energy conservation education -People on dialysis have benefitted from self - management interventions in previous studies -Found to be beneficial for people with characteristics common to the dialysis population (eg. older age, cognitive impairment, comorbidity)Threats -People on CDT spend extensive time on health - related activities & may be unabke to commit extra time for ECE -Many existing programs use formats (eg. group - based, face -to-face) that may be inconvenient for people on CDT -Therapist -facilitated design of existing programs may be unfeasible, given the limited rehabilitation staffing on dialysis units -Energy expenditure issues which may be important to people on dialysis, such as the extensive energy spent on dialysis -related care, are not addressedSWOT Analysis Energy conservation for people on chronic dialysis52 4.4.3 Stage 3: Developing program goals and objectives The highest -priority needs we identified from the SWOT analysis were for an ECE program that would be feasible for people on CDT , and would positively affect their life participation. These needs inform ed the following program development goals and objectives : 1. The new ECE program will incorporate a theory or evidence -based a pproach to facilitat ing life participation 2. The new ECE program will be feasible in the dialysis clinical context, as follows: a. The program will require less time to complete than existing evidence -based energy conservation education programs (ideally less than five hours) b. The program will require less time tha n existing programs for clinicians to administer (ideally less than three hours per pa rticipan t) c. The program will be amenable to completion at flexible and convenient times and locations for people (eg., from home; during dialysis sessions) d. The program will be usable by people with common ESRD characteristics (ie. older age, visual impairments, cognitive impairments) 3. The ECE program design will build on the evidence and theories from the existing ECE and health education literature 4.4.3.1 4a: Initial program development 4.4.3.1.1 Program Goal 1: Improving the life participation of people on CDT We first undertook to identify an intervention approach , that would facilitate people's use of energy conservation strategies to address their life particip ation goals. We identified t he Cognitive Orientation to Occupational Performance (CO -OP) as a promising option . CO-OP can be described as a personalized, goal -based, problem solving (PG -BPS) approach . One of its primary goals is to facilitate client -center ed, functional skill acquisition (Polatajko et al. , 2001) . The CO -OP approach is grounded in dynamic systems theories , such as the Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement (CMOP -E) (Townsend & Polatajko, 2007) , which posit that the performance of functional skills, or tasks, depends on an idiosyncratic interaction between the person's skills and abilities, the environment they are in, and the task they are performing (Townsend & Polatajko, 2007 ). A client -centered, top-down approach, focus ing 53 directly on three client -chosen functional goals, therefore f orms the basis of CO -OP. For each chosen goal, the therapist and participant collaboratively undertake a process of dynamic performance analys is (DPA) in the therapeutic setting, during which the participant is observed attempting to perform his/her target goal skill or task. O ut of the DPA, the therapist and participant identify where the participant's performance is break ing down , and generate personalized strategies, or plans, to address the performance breakdown(s) . The participant then enacts these strategies and check s to see if they work , in an iterative fashion, until an optimal performance solution is found. Features are also embedded in CO-OP to help the participant generalize the progress they make in therapy to other contexts (ie. real -world settings) and transfer their progress to other goals (Houldin, McEwen, Howell, & Polatajko, 2018; Polatajko et al., 2001) . For example, the therapist and client apply a global problem -solving strategy (goal - plan-do-check) consistently during CO-OP to frame the problem -solving process , which the participant can then apply independently to problem -solve around other potential p erformance problem s. The therapist also uses a guided discovery approach throughout CO -OP, to further encourage the participant's independence in discovering performance breakdowns and solutions (Missiuna, 2001) . CO-OP has never been specifically tested for addressing fatigue -related performance breakdowns . However, it has strong evidence of effectiveness at improving life participation for a variety of other functions (eg. motor -based, organizational) in other clinical populations , such as stroke (Polatajko et al. , 2012) , developmental coordination disorder (Smits -Engelsman et al. , 2013) , and traumatic (Dawson et al. , 2009; Ng, Polatajko, Marziali, Hunt, & Dawson, 2013) . CO-OP's general focus on strategy -based skill acquisition (Polatajko et al. , 2001) aligns well with the strategy -focused approach of ECE . CO-OP builds on existing ECE programs by using a personalized approach to energy conservation strategy selection , which we reasoned may generate energy conservation strategies tha t are more relevant to the individual's own life participation goals . The components used to promote generalization and transfer in CO - OP (eg. guided discovery, metacognitive strategy use) may also increase the likelihood of people on CDT achieving positive real -world outcomes (ie. better life participation) after ECE , providing them with the self -efficacy to independently problem -solve around fatigue problems that arise in their lives . Houldin and colleagues (n.d.) have found that increased self -efficacy is a mediator of successful generalization and transfer after CO -OP. 54 4.4.3.1.2 Program Goal 2: Maximizing program feasibility for the CDT population Although a CO-OP approach had potential to improve life p articipation outcomes after ECE, its typical twelve -session model did not match the feasibility objectives for the CDT population. Further, CO -OP has no specific educational component, while all ECE programs do. We therefore decided to precede the CO -OP co mponent of the intervention with a brief, didactic - style education section about energy conservation, informed by the content from existing energy conservation programs. Gaining declarative (ie. knowledge -based) information about a skill to be learned is proposed by many to be the first stage in skill acquisition (J. R. Anderson, 1982; Fitts & Posner, 1967) , is consistent with CO -OP's pre -requisite of having a general understanding of the skill to be performed, and is also consistent with the 'supplementing task knowledge' strategy often used in CO -OP to accelerate skill acquisition (Polatajko et al. , 2001) . We reasoned that providing this evidence -informed information a priori would enable clients to apply energy conservation principles and develop appropriate plans more easily during CO -OP, thus accelerating their learning p rocess. We decided to deliver the didactic component of the program via a series of online modules, that people could access and complete independently at their own convenience. Web and mobile -based approaches have been effectively used for various behavio ur change objectives (Wantland, Portillo, Holzemer, Slaughter, & McGhee, 2004) , and have been found to be feasible and acceptable in in the CKD population (Diamantidis et al. , 2015; Ong et al. , 2016) . A partially self -administered, web-supported model would also reduce the time n eeded for clinicians to administer the program. We used a number of design strategies to enhance the usability of the computer modules for people with common dialysis user characteristics , such as visual impairments and cognitive impairments . All graphics and text we used were large in size , and we used bright colours and strong contrast, to increase module visibility . We also used simple analogies throughout the modules to promote comprehension of the content for individuals with cognitive impairments, and employed extensive repetition of key concepts to accommodate learning or memory impairments. The instructions for accessing the computer modules provided in the program workbook were also simple and detailed , to accommodate people with little to no computer literacy. 55 We made further m odifications to CO -OP to align it with the ECE program feasibility objectives . First, although CO -OP is typically a dministered in -person by a therapist, we had to be flexible with its administration s o it could be completed in -person during dialysis, over the web, or via telephone, according to pa rticipant preference. Web -administer ed CO-OP has been used previously by Ng and colleagues (2013) , and found to be feasible and associated with improvements in participants' goals . The revised mode of delivery for CO -OP, combined with the complex nature of people 's fatigue -related goals (eg. having enough energy to go grocery shopping), also meant that participants could not be directly observed attempting to perform their target functional activity for the DPA process. As DPA is a crucial component of CO -OP for problem -solving and generating strategies, we decided to instead elicit detailed descriptions of people 's typical performance of their functional goal using visualization and question probing. Question probing and verbal descriptions of task performance were used for DPA successfully by Ng and colleagues (2013) in their web -administered CO -OP study. The complex goals and mode of delivery also meant it was typically not possible for the client to immediately try strategies generated from the DPA, as is typica lly done in CO -OP. Since trying the strategy is a key part of the leaning process for CO-OP, we instead asked participants to \"Do\" their plans in between CO -OP sessions, and then reviewed the success of the plans during a \"Check\" at their next session to d etermine whether further DPA and planning were needed. 4.4.3.1.3 Program Goal 3: Using evidence and theories from existing ECE and health education literature We created t he PEP Program m odule content using energy conservation literature and health education literat ure, while also incorporating information from nephrology and movement science literature . We inclu ded general information on kidney disease -related fatigue, such as its prevalence and potential causes, and outlined aspects of everyday activities that can affect energy expenditure, such as movement, speed, and body positioning. We included content to promote participants' readiness to change their behaviours; for example, we briefly addressed the pros and cons of continuing with current energy expenditure p atterns to ready participants for change, consistent with the principle of decisional balance from the T ranstheoretical Model (Prochaska, DiClemente, & Norcross, 1993) . We then presented core energy conservation strategies from Packer and colleagues' (1995) evidence -based \"Managing Fatigue: A Six Week Course in Energy Conservation\" progra m, with an emphasis on those that had specifically been found to be 56 effective. For example, we used the analogy of \"budgeting\" energy from the \"Managing Fatigue\" program extensi vely to explain much of the content, as this comparison was identified as particularly helpful and beneficial by the \"Managing Fatigue\" program participants (Mathiowetz & Busch, 2006) . We also included the fourteen energy conservation strategies from the \"Managing Fatigue\" , as they were all reported to be useful and beneficial by people from the MS literature (Matuska et al. , 2007) . However, for brevity we consolidated and condensed the strategies into seven key energy -saving strategies (eliminate, simplify, tools, organize, assistance, reposition, and slow down). A brief description of each strategy was provided along with one or two illustrative exampl es, and a mnemonic (E -STOARS) was presented to promote their retention. The web module design was inspired by the style of whiteboard animation, which is \"the process by which an author physically draws and records an illustrated story using a whiteboard - or whiteboard like surface - and marker pens\" (Whiteboard Animation Studio, n.d.) , frequently aided with narration by script. We achieved a whiteboard animation effect using Microsoft Powerpoint, by animating simple pictures and diagrams against a plain white background and adding a narrative overlay to create a video -like experience. The design of the web modules was also informed by Morrison and colleague s' (2012) four components of effective e -health interventions : contact with the intervention, tailoring, self-management, and social supports . Contact with the intervention was achieved by engaging users with a number of reflective and practice activities , embedded throughout the modules . We accomplished t ailoring and self - management features with a novel, personalized prioritization exercise, ter med \"the Energy Inventory\", that set the stage for the goal -based CO -OP portion of the intervention. Further information about the Energy Inventory is provided in Appendix C. Although there were no direct social interactions included in the modules, they f eatured an animated protagonist who was a person on CDT , and was intended to be relatable for the target population. We also created a participant workbook to accompany t he modules , which included key program information, activity worksheets, and detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to access the online educational modules. 57 4.4.3.1.4 The PEP (Personal Energy Planning) Program The PEP program (Table 4.1) is a two -part energy conservation education program, that is uniquely tailored for the CDT population. Part 1 of the program involves two educational web modules which last approximately 20 minutes each. The modules introduce participants to the basic concepts and principles needed to practice energy conservation, including information about fatigue, energy expen diture, and energy -saving strategies. The modules are designed to be user-friendly, and are available for people to complete independently over the Internet. The PEP module slides and audio transcript s for Module 1 are provided in Appendix D, to demonstrat e the approach . Part 2 of the program uses a modified version of the Cognitive Orientation to Occupational Performance (CO -OP) approach (Missiuna et al. , 2001) , to facilitate participants' application of the energy conservation strategies to achieve their own life participation goals. Participants complete a third computer module which briefly explains the fundamentals of CO -OP, and then work directly with a trained clinician over four to s ix sessions to create and test personal energy plans for three personal life participation goals. Participants are also provided with a supplementary work book to guide and track their progress in the PEP program.

Their characteristics are described in Table 4.2. The informants' impressions of the modules were overall positive; all identified several strengths and also a few weaknesses and recommendations for change, which are summarized below, as are the modifications made based on the feedback. A full account of part icipants' feedback about the program is provided in Appendix E. Table 4.2: Key Informant Characteristics Informant 1 Informant 2 Clinician Informant Health Education Technology Specialist Male 52 years old Stage 3 CKD Employed full -time High comfort with computers Female 56 years old On ICHD for 2.5 years Retired Living in supported care residence Moderate comfort with computers Female PD nurse coordinator Large, academic dialysis center >10 years experience Female Prior experience designing technology -based health education programs 4.4.3.2.1 Program strengths All four informants considered the modules to accomplish many of their intended objectives. The informants all described the program's core approach of budgeting energy as a way of managing fatigue to be novel, relevant, and relatable. The informants with CKD expressed that the modules raised their awareness about their own energy spending, and the need to prioritize and consid er their everyday activities in more detail . The informants all saw the energy -saving strategies outlined in the modules as being valuable. The y identified the personalized approach used in the program to be another strength, and both informants with CKD could identify personal energy goals they would work on in Part 2 of the program. The informants expressed that the program design was engaging and effective. All informants felt that th e length and pace of the modules was suitable, as was the ir visual desi gn. All informants also described t he examples and activities 59 incorporated into the modules, as being relevant and relatable. Overall, the informants judged the PEP program to be important, and saw it as filling a gap in care provided to this population. T he informants with CKD indicated that they would recommend the program to other people with CKD on dialysis. 4.4.3.2.2 Weaknesses and recommendations The key informants identified several minor critiques and recommendations about the program content during the inter views. The two informants with CKD and the health education specialist felt it would be helpful to clarify ways to increase one's energy beyond pacing with rest breaks. The informant with Stage 3 CKD also expressed he was not yet at the stage where he was ready to cut down on his energy expenditure if it meant changing activities he valued, and wished the Table 4.3: Program Modifications Implemented based on Key Informant Interviews 1.

Two of the key informants felt that there was conflicting information ab out whether low -energy activities and/or mental activities drain versus refresh energy, while two informants suggested providing information on how to communicate with family about needing greater assistance from them. The informants also expressed that th ey found some of the module content was overexplained at times; however, there was general ambivalence about this issue, because they also appreciated its clarify and simplicity. Finally, the nurse informant wondered whether people would be able to complet e the computer modules independently due to their burden of health -related impairments, and also wondered about the clinical feasibility of Part 2 of the program, which requires a healthcare provider to work 1:1 with the participant for four to six half -hour sessions. 4.4.3.2.3 Program modifications Based on the key informant feedback, a total of 60 possible program modifications were identified, and 25 were implemented (Table 4.3). 4.4.3.3 4c. Usability testing We recruited five people on CDT to participate in usability t esting of the program modules (Table 4.4). One participant was subsequently found to be unable to use the computer provided for the testing due to physical limitations, and therefore did not complete the performance -based assessment or the System Usability Scale. Table 4 .4: Participant characteristics from PEP usability testing P1 P2 M F F M Modality HD HD PD HD HD Computer use Occasional Occasional Occasional Never Daily 61 Table 4.5 outlines a listing of the usability issues encountered by the participants . Among these , the most common barriers encountered were related to computer literacy (e.g. uncertainty about how to access the PEP computer modules online, and challenges completin g the drag -and-drop sorting task from the Energy Inventory activity ). All participants were consistently able to perform tasks such as navigating and completing the reflective exercises in the workbook, and interacting with the onscreen buttons to restart the modules after activity breaks. We carefully considered a ll usability barriers, and where possible, addressed the identified issues with program design changes (Table 4.5). As can be seen, a few barriers could not be overcome with design modifications. Table 4.5: PEP program usability barriers and corresponding program modifications Usability Barrier(s) # of participants Resulting Program Modifications Unable to use computer mouse (motor control deficits) 1 Stipulation : Ability to manipulate computer (mouse, keyboard) required for independent program use Unsure how to locate web browser and enter web address to access modules 2 Change: Web links to modules provided directly on desktop and/or provided via email Difficulty clicking and dragging for EI activity 2 Change: Additional click -and-drag instructions added to module Difficulty reading text for Energy Inventory 1 None (unable to change) Did not know how to double -click mouse 1 Stipulation: Some initial support may be required for people unfamiliar with basic computer operations The median score on the SUS was 93.75 (range 82.5 - 95) (Figure 4.3). Two participants \"strongly agreed\" that they would recommend the PEP program to other people on dialysis in response to an additional follow -up question, while the other two participants \"agreed\". 62 Figure 4.3: System Usability Scale scores for the PEP program* *Note: Participant 1 did not complete scale 4.5 Discussion The Personal Energy Planning program is a novel, personalized, web -supported energy conservation education program for adults on chronic dialysis therapy with fatigue . The development of the program was guided by a health education planning framework (World Health Organization, 2014) , and driven by the findings of a population -specific needs assessmen t. The needs assessment suggested an ECE program was needed for people on CDT that would improve their life participation; be feasible in the dialysis clinical context; and build on theory and evidence from the existing ECE and health education literature . The resulting program combines an established personalized, goal -focused intervention (CO -OP) (Missiuna et al., 2001) , with a series of educational modules about energy conservation that are informed by evidence -based ECE and health education principles, and are accessible to people via the internet . Preliminary feedback from key patient, clinician and health education informants wa s positive with respect to program content and design, while usability testing suggested the program modules were usable by people on CDT with a variety of levels of computer literacy. We addressed s everal recommended or observed issues , identified during the key informant interviews and usability test ing, with design revisions. 0102030405060708090100 Norm referenced medianP2 P3 P4 P563 The preliminary f indings from the key informant interviews and usability testing are promising , regarding the potential of the PEP program to fill an important gap in the care provided to people with ESRD. At present, there are a dearth of evidence -based approaches to help people with ESRD with day -to-day fatigue management , despite i t being a prominent concern within this population (Ju et al. , 2018; Manns et al. , 2014) . Erythropoeitin (EPO) and exercise training are currently the two primary approaches to managing fatigue for people on CDT, but each have limitations; EPO only addresses one contributing factor of fatigue in p eople on CDT, while exercise training requires substantial participant and clinician time and energy. The PEP program is a novel approach to fatigue management for people on CDT, which may offer advantages over these approaches: it theoretically can be use d irrespective of the person's underlying fatigue aetiology, and has been designed to minimize the demands on people's time and energy. The ECE approach has also been found to be effective in other chronic disease populations , such as multiple sclerosis (Finlayson et al. , 2011; Mathiowetz et al. , 2005) , which further supports its potential in the CDT population. The positive program feedback provided by key informants suggests that efficacy testing , to assess the PEP program's impact on fatigue -related outcomes in people on CDT , is now warranted. The PEP program incorporated both novel and well -established ECE comp onents into its design , and t he key informant interviews highlighted a number of possible program strength s. In general, informants expressed that the energy conservation approach was a novel and seemingly helpful way to manage fatigue, which supports the justification for further exploring ECE in the CDT population. The informants all expressed that the modules were engaging and interesting, which may relate to the inclusion of specific design features (eg. tailoring, self -management) that have been associ ated with more effective e -health programs (Morrison, 2012) . Both informants with CKD said that th ey appreciated the program's acknowledgement of their physical fatigue , feedback that could reflect the lack of attention often paid to symptoms in CDT clinic al practice (Weisbord et al. , 2007) , or, an assumption that fatigue in people on CDT is primarily related to psychological disorders. The informants with CKD also provided positive feedback about the program's personalized approach , which supports the rationale behind incorporating the personalized , goal -based , problem -solving CO-OP approach in to the program. The CO-OP approach aligns with other frameworks (eg. problem -solving training) that have been used in other recent energy conservation programs , for which preliminary findings have been positiv e 64 with respect to peopl e's life participation outcomes (Kim et al. , 2017; Raina et al. , 2016) . Life participation has recently been identif ied by people on CDT as being t heir highest -priority fatigue -related outcome (Ju et al. , 2018) . As such, e xploring the eff icacy of the PEP program for improving the life participation of people on CDT will be a top priority for the next phase of program research . The positive usability da ta collected on the PEP program web modules also support its potential to be a convenient tool for both people on CDT and clinicians, as people can complete portions of the program w ithout clinician assistance , and at times and locations of their choosing . This data build on other literature , which has shown e-health technology may be a feasible and advantageous way to administer care to people with CKD (Weisbord et al. , 2007) . For example, Ong and colleagues (2016) recently reported strong feasibility data for the use of a tailored, health management sma rtphone application among people with pre-dialysis CKD, even among people with no prior experience using a smartphone. We used a user -centered approach to designing the modules, proactively identifying and addressing potential usability barriers (eg. visua l and cognitive impairments) that could arise in the CDT population with design solutions such as large text, use of colour contrast, and simple explanations of key concepts . Our results suggest that common impairments in the CDT population , which may be v iewed as preclusive for the use of technology -based tools , can be overcome with sound design . Additional adaptations may be required f or people with certain impairments, however, such as motor -based impairment s that prevent physical manipulation of the tec hnology. Despite the positive preliminary findings about the PEP program, our key informant s highlighted a number of potential program limitations that should be monitored in future studies. Although we designed the PEP program to minimize the time require d for administration, our clinician informant suggested there may still be a lack of clinical resources o n dialysis units to implement the program successfully. Patient -reported outcomes have become an increasing priority in nephrology ; however, there are still often limited clinical resources allocated to staff, such as rehabilitation therapists, who may be able to improve quality of life outcomes such as life participation (Farragher, 2017) . If the PEP program is found to be efficacious in futu re robust studies, a reconsideration of clinical resource allocation, combined with targeted knowledge translation strategies, w ould likely be required to achieve successful clinical implementation of the program. Another observation was that , despite the benefits of a program that was simple and 65 easy-to-use, the key informants wondered if the modules moved too slowly to optimally engage and interest participants . This feedback could be related to the highly -selected sample of dialysis stakeholders we invol ved for the key informant interviews. These people were purposively chosen to provide insights, reflections and feedback about the program ; however, they also may not have had the level of cognitive impairment typically seen within the CKD and dialysis populations . Alternatively, th is feedback may reflect that people on CDT are already familiar with some of the program content and energy conservation strategies discussed . People with MS, who completed a different ECE program, were similarly found to familia r with some of the energy conservation strategies covered in the program prior to completing it (Matuska et al. , 2007) . However, they nevertheless reported it to be beneficial, stating that they used a wider variety of strategies , and us ed them more often, after participating in the program. It is possible that people on CDT who complete the entire PEP program in the next phase of research may realize the value of the EC strategy ideas provided in Part 1, as they work to identify and develop new, personalized EC strategies for themselves in Part 2 of the program. Future studies on the PEP program should nevertheless monitor patient engagement with the modules, to assess the need to revise the program content and/or delivery. In conclusion, the PE P program is a novel interactive, web -supported, energy conservation education program that has been designed to be feasible in the dialysis clinical context, and effective at improving life participation outcomes. Future research should address program development stages 5 and 6, by assessing the efficacy of the program at improving the target outcomes of life participation and fatigue in the CDT population. 66 Chapter 5: Exploring the Efficacy of the PEP Program for Improving Life Participation and Reducing Fatigue in Adults on Chronic Dialysis Therapy Janine F. Farragher, Helene J. Polatajko, Target Journal for Submission: Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation 67 Chapter 5: Exploring the Efficacy of the PEP Program for Reducing Fatigue and Improving Life Participation in Adults on Chronic Dialysis Therapy 5.1 Abstract Background: Fatigue is a common and difficult -to-treat symptom of renal disease , that interferes with people 's abilit ies to participate in meaningful daily activities (ie., life participation) . The PEP program is a personalized, web-supported energy conservation education (ECE) program recently developed to reduce fatigue and improve life participation in adults o n chronic dialysis therapy (CDT) , but its ef ficacy has yet to be explored . Primary Objective: To explore if the PEP program is associated with improvements in life participation and fatigue - related outcomes in adults on CDT with fatigue. Methods : We used a mixed -methods, sequential explanatory study design, including a single -case, time -series experiment with four replications, and follow -up qualitative interviews. We recruited s tudy participants who were on CDT, and who were purposively selected to represent typical dialysis user characteristics. We administered measures of life participation (created for this study) and fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) repeatedly at weekly intervals , before and afte r study participants began the PEP program. These time series measures were cross -validated with other validated measures of life participation (COPM) and fatigue ( Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, SF -36 vitality scale) , as well as post- intervention interview s examining people 's exper iences and perceptions of the program. We analyzed the data using visual analysis and the Tau -U for the time series data , examined pre-to- post changes for the quasi -experimental data, and used thematic analysis for the qualitative interviews. Results and C onclusions: We recruited f ive people on CDT (3 I HD, 1 PD, 1 HHD) to participate in the study . Three participants demonstrated a positive response to the program across multiple measures of fatigue and life participation , with effect sizes rang ing from small to moderate. T he remaining two participants demonstrated an inconsistent response, or no response , to the program . All participants expressed that the program had benefitted them in the qualitative follow -up interview, with the most common ly identified benefit being that it made their lives or day-to-day activities easier. The format of the program was also said to be feasible and convenient by the participants. These findings suggest the PEP program has potential to improve 68 important fatigue -related outcomes on CDT . Further clinical trials to examine program efficacy are therefore warranted. 5.2 Introduction Reported by an estimated 70% of people on chronic dialysis therapy (CDT) (Murtagh et al. , 2007) , fatigue is one of the most common and concerning symptoms experienced by the CDT population (Ju et al. , 2018; Manns et al. , 2014; Weisbord 2007) . Define d as an \"unusual, abnormal or excessive whole -body tiredness, disproportionate to or unrelated to activity or exertion\" (Piper, 1 993, p. 285) , fatigue affects all aspects of life participation for people on CDT . Due to its complex, multifactorial nature, evidence -based targeted treatment approaches for fatigue are limited (Artom et al. , 2014) . Recently, Farragher and colleagues ( Chapter 4 ) proposed the adoption of an energy conservation education approach to address this problem. Energy conservation education (ECE) has been reported to be efficacious in a number of clinical populations who experience fatigue, including multiple sclerosis (Finlayson et al. , 2011; Mathiowetz et et al. , 1987) and cardiac disease (Kim al. , 2017; Norberg et al. , 2017) . This approach teaches individuals to use strategies, such as simplifying activities, using energy -efficient postures, and prioritizing, that will reduce energy expenditure during everyday activities and thereby minimize fatigue. We reasoned that e nergy conservation may be a particularly go od fit for individuals on CDT, given that they are prone to exertional fatigue (Johansen, 1999; Macdonald et al. , 2012) and have extensive treatment -related activities they must routinely spend en ergy on, such as attending dialysis sessions, managing medications, and monitoring weight and blood pressure. However, after an examination of existing ECE approaches (Chapter 3 ), we concluded that a new approach to ECE, specifically designed to meet the u nique needs of the CDT population, was necessary (Chapter 4 ). We therefore developed a new web-supported , personalized ECE program (the PEP Program ) for people on CDT , with input from key stakeholders, that is designed to be feasible and to improve fatigue and life participation outcomes. The program draws on established energy conservation strategies from other evidence -based energy conservation programs, and incorpor ates a personalized, goal-based -problem solving component to enable personalized solutio ns to s olve the individual's specific life participation challenges. The program is brief , remotely accessible, and partially self -administered, to maximize delivery convenience and minimize clinician load. 69 Preliminary assessments of the program's web-supp orted modules by four key informants (two people with CKD, one dialysis nurse and one health education designer) were positive, as were the findings from usability testing with people on CDT (Chapter 4 ) Accordingly, in this study we set out to evaluate the potential of the PEP to affect change in fatigue and life participation among individuals on CDT. 5.3 Research Questions 1. Is participating in the PEP program associated with changes in life participation and fatigue -related outcomes (including fatigue , fatigue impact, and fatigue management self-efficacy ) in people on CDT? 2. Is participating in the PEP program associated with increase d fatigue -related knowledge and/or energy budgeting strategy use in people on CDT? 3. What are people on CDT's perceptions and experiences of the PEP program and its impact on their lives, and what program modifications do they recommend ? 5.4 Methods 5.4.1 Design We used a mixed -methods, sequential explanatory study design (Ivankova and colleagues, 2006). This design include s a quantitative study phase, followed by a qualitative phase to help explain and elaborate on the quantitative findings . The quantitative design we used was a single -case study design , supported by a quasi -experimental, pre -post design , to allow for cross -validation of study results across multiple measures. The single -case methodology we employed was a tri- phasic, time -series design , with four replications. The three study phase s constituted a three- or four-week baseline observation period (Phase A); Part 1 of the PEP program (Phase B1); and Part 2 of the PEP program (Phase B2). The first author conducted o bservational a ssessments weekly (\u00b13 days) with each participant throughout the three phases . For the quasi -experimental , pre-post design , the first author administered standardized assessments at the start of the baseline period , and after the last intervention session. The qualitative component of the study comprised a semi -structured interview , conducted by the first author after all other assessments had been completed . 70 5.4.2 Participants We recruited p articipants from a large, academic, hospital -based dialysis center in Toronto, Canada. The clinical care teams identified i ndividuals on CDT who had chronic fatigue, and who were likely to be willing to participate in the study procedures. Study posters were also used to recruit participants. We applied p urposive sampling during the study recruitment, to maximize the representat ion of the target popula tion on key variables of age, gender, and dialysis modality. Prospective participants were approached about the study by the first author to assess their interest in the study. Interested individuals underwent further assessment of their study eligiblity for the following criteria: 5.4.2.1 Inclusion criteria 1. Aged 18 years 2. On chronic dialysis therapy for 3 months at time of recruitment 3. Self-identifies as having problems with fatigue 4. Otherwise a ble and wil ling to provide informed consent 5.4.2.2 Exclusion criteria 1. Significant visual impairment (unable to read the text in the intervention video and workbook) 2. Scores >3 on PHQ -2 depression screening tool* 3. Plans to change RRT modality within 3 months of recruitment 4. Inadequate written and verbal English comprehension (Gr ade six or higher) The first author underwent a comprehensive informed consent process with e ligible individuals. Baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory information about the participants were then collected through participant interview, and/or re ference to the clinical chart. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board . 5.4.3 Intervention: The \"PEP\" (Personal Energy Planning) Program The PEP program has previously been described in detail ( Chapter 4 ). In brief, the \"PEP\" (Personal Energy Plann ing) program is designed to provide clients on dialysis with personalized training in energy conservation strategy use. The program consists of two parts, and is delivered over six to eight weekly sessions lasting 20 -40 minutes each. Part 1 of the program involves two 71 online educational modules, that introduce participants to the fundamental concepts and strategies needed to practice energy conservation. Part 2 includes four to six individualized sessions with a therapist or clinician, to help participants develop their own personalized energy conservation plans that address their life participation goals. Participants can complete the program from their preferred location: at the hospital during dialysis, from home, or from another remote -based location. For this study, the first author assisted participants who opted to complete the PEP program during hemo dialysis , to watch the Part 1 computer modules in the dialysis unit on a provided laptop. These participants also completed the individualized sessions of Part 2 in -person , with the first author , during their dialysis sessions . Participants who chose to complete the program remotely (ie. from home) were first oriented to the program and its workbook during a single in- person session with the first author . They then completed the modules independently from home , using the workbook instructions as a guide. They completed the individualized sessions of Part 2 via phone with the first author. 5.4.4 Measurement The measures used for the study are provided in Appendix F. 5.4.4.1 Life participation For the single -case study component, we assessed life participation weekly throughout the study using three questions created for the stu dy. We created t he three questions to address a gap in available assessments that were brief, and that captured the impact of fatigue on people 's participation in personally relevant activities. The three questions asked participants to rate, on a scale of 1 -10, how well they managed their fatigue during the p ast week; how often they had the energy to do the things they needed to do during the past week; and how often they had the energy to do the things they wanted to do during the past week. A score of one indicated poor fatigue management or insufficient ene rgy, while a score of 10 indicated optimal fatigue management or always having sufficient energy. We averaged s cores from the three items , to create a summary score out of 10. To cross -validat e the findings from the se novel measure s, we also assessed participant -perceived performance of three specific life participation goals before and after Part 2 of the program, using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) (Law et al. , 1990) . The COPM asks individuals t o rate, on a 10 -point Likert scale, their current 72 perceived performance on a self -chosen goal and their satisfaction with that performance. A score of 1 indicates poor performance or satisfaction, while 10 indicates optimal performance or satisfaction. The COPM has been found to be a valid, reliable, clinically useful and responsive outcome measure in multiple disease populations (Carswell, 20 04). 5.4.4.2 Life participation satisfaction For the single -case study component, we assessed life participation satisfaction using one question created for this study, which was patterned after the COPM's (Law et al. , 1990) assessment of satisfaction on specific life participation goals. The question asked participants to rate, on a scale of one to 10, how satisfied they were with their fatigue management. A score of one indicated low satisfaction, while a score of 10 indicated optimal satisfaction . For the quasi - experimental component, we assessed participants' satisfaction with their performance on three specific occupational goals before and after Part 2 of the intervention, using the satisfaction rating of the COPM (Law et al. , 1990) . Having rated performance on a self -chosen goal (see above), the participants were asked to rate, on a 10 -point Likert scale, their current perceived satisfaction with their performance. 5.4.4.3 Fatigue For the single -case study component, we assessed fatigue weekly using the fatigue severity scale (FSS) (Krupp, LaRocca, Muir -Nash, & Steinberg, 1989) . The FSS is a nine-item sc ale that asks individuals to rate, on a Likert scale from one to seven , the severity of their fatigue and its impact on their life during the past week. Individual item scores are averaged to create a summary score out of 7. The FSS is a valid, reliable an d responsive measure (Flachenecker et al. , 2002; Learmonth et al. , 2013) that has previously been used in the CDT population (Farragher et al. , 2017) . For the quasi -experimental component, we cross -validated the FSS with two additional fatigue measure s, the SF -36 Vitality Scale (Ware & Sherbourne, 1992) and the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (Ritvo et al., 1997) , administered before and after each phase of the study. The SF - 36 Vitality scale includes four questions that ask indiv iduals to rate, on a six-point scale, their energy levels during the past four weeks. The SF -36 vitality scale is a well-validated measure (McHorney, Ware, & Raczek, 1993; Ware, 2000) , that is commonly used to assess fatigue in the renal population . The MFIS is a 2 1-item scale that asks individuals to rate, on a Likert scale fro m zero to five , the impact of fatigue on various facets of their functioning during the past four 73 weeks. The F atigue Impact Scale has frequently been used as an outcome measure , in energy conservation education studies involving other chronic disease popu lations (Farragher et al. , unpublished). 5.4.4.4 Fatigue ma nagement self -efficacy For the single -case component, we assessed self-efficacy for managing fatigue using one question created for this study, patterned after Bandura's (2006) method for measuring self - efficacy for a particular skill or task . The item asked the participant to rate his/her present confidence in his/her ability to manage fatigue, on a scale of one to 10. A score of one indicated no confidence in one's ability to manage fatigue, while 10 indicated full confidence. 5.4.4.5 Energy budgeting strategy use We assessed e nergy budgeting strategy use using an 11 -item questionnaire created for this study. The questionnaire asked participants to rate, on a five-point scale, how often they used each of 11 energy budgeting strategies within the past week. A score o f one indicated that the strategy was never used, while a score of five indicated that the strategy was used regularly. We averaged the scores for each item to create a total summary score of energy budgeting strategy use. 5.4.4.6 Energy conservation knowledge We assessed energy conservation k nowledge using two knowledge assessments created for the study, which participants were asked to complete before and after Part 1 of the PEP program. The assessments constituted 10 multiple choice questions, that measured part icipants learning of the key concepts from each of the two computer modules of Part 1 of the PEP program. 5.4.4.7 Post-intervention interview The first author conducted a semi -structured interview, lasting 20 -30 minutes, with each participant one to two weeks after their final intervention session after all other measures had been administered. The interview was conducted in the hemodialysis unit for P1 and P2, and over the phone for P3, P4, and P5. Participants were asked about their subjective percepti ons of the PEP program and its impact on their lives, inconsistencies from the quantitative data, and recommended program changes (see Appendix G for interview guide). 74 5.4.5 Data analysis We analyzed t he single -case, time-series data using a combination of visual analysis, and the Tau-U statistic. Visual analysis is considered the cornerstone of studies that employ a single case, time -series design . The guidelines provided by Lane and Gast (2014) inform ed the visual analysis approach: 1. Graphing: Data for each variable were graphed on an interrupted time -series scatterplot, and labelled according to study phase (A, B1, or B2) 2. Within -phase analysis: Data within each of the three study phases were analyzed to determine the following: a. Level, which is the mean value of the data points within a phase b. Trend direction, which is the direction (rapidly deteriorating, deteriorating, no - change, improving, or rapidly improving) of the data points across the phase 3. Between -phase analysis: Data from the baseline and intervention phases were compared, to identify changes in trend direction and/or l evel that occurred between phases. We supported t he visual analysis with statistical analysis, in keeping with recommendations from several single -case study design guidelin es (Brossart, Vannest, Davis, & Patience, 2014; Single - case intervention research , 2014) . We chose t he Tau -U statistic for the statistical analysis because of its relatively high degree of power to detect an effect with a small number of datapoints, and its capability to correct for trends in the baseline phase (Parker, Vannest, Davis, & Sauber, 2011) . The Tau -U is also robust against autocorrelation (ie., serial correlation between observations as a function of the time lag between them ), thus eliminating the need to test for autocorrelation in the se data. We calculated t he Tau-U statistic (Parker et al. , 2011) to compare the Phase A (baselin e) data to the Phase B2 (goal management training) data. A Tau -U value between 0 and .65 indicates a small effect size, while .65 -.92 is a moderate effect size, and >.92 is a large effect size. Due to the preliminary, exploratory nature of this study, p -values were not calculated. We did not perform statistical analyses f or the quasi -experimental data , given the small number of data points. Rather, we reported the pre-post data as absolute values , and calculated changes between phases by subtracting the participants' baseline score from their post -intervention score . 75 We interpreted the scores according to minimal clinically important differences reported from previous literature, whe re available. For the qualitative interview data, t he first author audio -recorded and transcribed the q ualitative interview data, and then read the transcripts to get a general sense of the content. The first author then coded t he transcriptions in cycles, as recommended by Saldana (2018) . In the first coding cycle, descriptive codes were created for meaningful units of data that were close to the original data. The second coding cycle involved extrapolating from the first -cycle codes to form broader descriptive categories, an d in the third coding cycle, further abstraction was conducted to create key themes. 5.5 Results Five people on CDT were recruited to participate in the study. Four people on CDT were invited by the clinical staff, based on the presence of longstanding fatigue and a perceived openness to completing the study activities. The remaining participant (P3) volunteered to participate, after having seen a study advertisement poster. Participant characteristics are outlined in Table 5.1. To preserve anonymity, some data (eg. age) are not reported as absolute values. All five participants completed the 3 computer modules of the program, and then underwent four to seven individualized goal training sessions with the study therapist, which lasted a medi an of 24 minutes (range, 7 - 48). The me dian total time spent working with the therapist per participant was two hours, 11 minutes (range 1 hour, 32 minutes to 3 hours, 25 minutes) . Three people (P1, P2 and P3) completed the PEP program at the hospital duri ng their regular hemodialysis sessions, while P4 and P5 completed the program remotely from home. 76 Table 5.1: Participant characteristics from PEP efficacy study P1 Gender M F M M M Dialysis duration (yrs) 2 8 1 5 4 Dialysis modality ICHD ICHD ICHD Home HD CAPD Independent in basic ADLs Y Y Y Y Y Lives alone N Y N N N Computer use Never Never Daily Daily Daily 5.5.1 Quantitative results Single -case, t ime series scatterplots for P1 are provided in Figure 5.1, and the t ime series results for the remaining participants are described in Table 5.2 (See Appendix H for remaining participants' scatterplots). Pre - and post -intervention data for the COPM are provided in Table 5.3, while Table 5.4 presents pre - and post -intervention data for the FIS, SF -36 Vitality Scale, knowledge questionnaires, and energy budgeting strategy use. 5.5.1.1 Life participation Three participants (P1, P3 and P4) demonstrated improvement s in life participation associated with the intervention. The effect sizes were small for P1 and P3, and moderate for P4, according to the Tau -U analysis of the time -series data (Table 5.2). P1 and P4 also experienced clinically significant performance improvem ents for all three of their life participation goals on the COPM (Table 5.3), while P3 improved on two out of three goals. Two participants (P2 and P5) demonstrated no improvement in life participation, on either the time -series data or the COPM performanc e ratings. 77 Figure 5.1: Interrupted time -series scatterplots for P1 78 5.5.1.2 Life participation satisfaction Three participants ( P1, P3 and P4 ) displayed improvement in life participation satisfaction associated with the intervention. P3's effect size w as small and P1 and P4's effect sizes were moderate, according to the Tau -U. These three also demonstrated clinically significant changes in self -rated satisfaction; P1 and P4 for all three of their life participation goals on the COPM, and P3 for two out of three goals. Two participants (P2 and P5) demonstrated no improvement in life participation satisfaction, on either the time -series analysis or the COPM satisfaction rat ing. 5.5.1.3 Fatigue Four participants (P1, P2, P3 and P4) demonstrated improvement in fatigue on the FSS associated with the intervention, according to the time -series analysis . P1 and P3's effect sizes were small, while P2 and P4's effect sizes were moderate according to the Tau -U. All except P1 also demonstrated clinically significant improvements on the SF -36 vitality scale and the FIS, from pre - to post -intervention (Table 5.4). P5 demonstrated no positive changes in fatigue on any outcomes. 5.5.1.4 Fatigue manage ment self-efficacy Three participants (P1, P3 and P4) demonstrated improvement in self-efficacy associated with the intervention, according to the time -series analysis . P1 and P3's effect sizes were small , and P4's effect size was moderate (n=1), according to the Tau -U. P2 and P5 demonstrated no positive change in self -efficacy . 5.5.1.5 Energy budgeting knowledge & strategy Use: The median score on both knowledge questionnaires at pre -intervention was eight out of 10; post-intervention improvement was only observe d for P3. Three participants (P3, P4, & P5) demonstrated moderate -sized increases in their energy budgeting strategy use, according to the Tau-U, between the baseline phase and the second intervention phase. P1 demonstrated small - sized improvements. 79 Table 5.2: Visual analysis and Tau -U results for single -case, time -series data Phase A (Baseline) Phase B1 (PEP Part 1) Phase B2 (PEP Part 2) Tau-U (A vs B2) Effect size Life participation P1 Trend .45 Small Level 5.11 6 6.33 P2 Trend -.78 Deteriorating Level 5.89 4.66 4.75 P3 Trend .64 Small Level 4.50 5.50 6.23 P4 Trend .71 Moderate Level 4.22 4.65 6.33 P5 Trend -.41 Deteriorating Level 6.66 7.33 5.75 Life participation satisfaction P1 Trend .75 Moderate Level 2.67 4.50 6.20 P2 Trend -.48 Deteriorating Level 5.67 5.00 5.00 P3 Trend .48 Small Level 3.50 4.00 5.43 P4 Trend .80 Moderate Level 2.67 5.00 6.50 P5 Trend -.15 Deteriorating Level 5.67 8.00 6.25 Fatigue P1 Trend -.28 Small Level 5.18 5.00 4.84 P2 Trend -.73 Moderate None Level 5.63 5.84 5.81 Self-efficacy P1 Trend .42 Small Level 5.33 5.00 6.00 P2 Trend -.62 Deteriorating Level 5.33 5.00 4.50 P3 Trend .55 Small Level 4.00 4.50 6.14 P4 Trend .70 Moderate Level 3.67 6.00 6.75 P5 Trend -.14 Deteriorating Level 3.67 6.50 3.75 * = rapid deterioration; = deterioration; = no -change; = improvement; = rapid improvement 80 5.5.2 Qualitative findings 5.5.2.1 Program benefits The participants were unanimous in express ing that the program had helped them to manage their fatigue more effectively. A common sentiment was that the program had, in some way, made life e asier. P3 stated that the program made him feel \"more energized\", whi le P2, P3 and P5 shared that the program had enabled them to cope with their daily tasks more easily. For example, P3 stated: \"I've been using it daily, to help with my daily activities at home and outside, and at dialysis, too.\" Table 5.3: Changes on Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) after PEP PT GOAL PERFORMANCE (/10) SATISFACTION (/10) IMPOR - TANCE (/10) Pre Post Change Pre Post Change 1 a.

For example, P1 stated: \"Before we started this, I didn't realize I had these problems. But you opened my eyes to it all.\" P2 similarly described how the program had helped her to attend more closely to her methods of completing activities: \"It helped me to be more sharp, more al ert, thinking, \"oh - I should do it this way \". So you always - you go back to it. And you apply what you've learned\" The participants all expressed that the program had helped them to generate new ideas and strategies for completing their day -to-day tasks. P4 expressed that he was already familiar with 82 most of the strategies covered in the program, but that the program had reminded him about the strategies, and motivated him to use them . All participants described instances where they had used the energy bu dgeting strategies to address the goals they set in therapy in their everyday lives. They also provided examples of when they had applied the strategies to work on goals that were not directly addressed in therapy. For example, P4 described how energy cons ervation principles such as simplifying and pacing had enabled him to visit the local zoo to take photographs, and P1 shared that he transferred the strategy of being more organized before getting dressed, to also make shopping and other excursions easier: \"If I'm going shopping now or I have to go to a few different places, I just try to organize it so there's a route, right - not wasting energy\". In general, all of the participants stated that they would recommend the program to other people on dialysis. P1 felt the program should be completed by everyone on dialysis : \"I kinda think everyone in here should go through this. I think it would help everybody. I'm glad I did it\". 5.5.2.2 Weaknesses and recommendations The participants identified few weakness es and had few recommendations about the PEP program . Indeed, when asked, P1 and P2 stated that they had no suggested improvements or recommendations they would make to the program . P3 suggested offering the program in a group -based format, because he would have liked the opportunity to learn from his peers. P4 expressed the importance of being motivated in order to benefit from the program, and wondered whether this could somehow be facilitated in the program for other s on CDT . P4 also recommended th at the program modules be made available on a tablet, to increase portability and convenience . P5, meanwhile, felt that financial budgeting was not a perfect analogy to use to explain how one should manage their energy, and that discrepancies between the two shoul d be further clarified. He also expressed that the way fatigue was described in the videos did not align with his experience of sometimes gaining energy and momentum by engaging in tasks, and felt this should be further clarified as well. 83 5.5.2.3 Delivery mode The mode used to deliver the program was well -received, and said to be convenient by all participants. P1 and P2, who completed the program sessions while on in -hospital hemodialysis, expressed that they preferred doing it on dialysis rather than during thei r own time, and that it helped to pass the time during dialysis. For example, P2 stated: \"I think it's perfect to do it here, because, what do you do with the four hours? You know, at least you have this to look forward to! So it's very good.\" P3, however, expressed that he found the dialysis unit to be noisy and distracting, and that he would have preferred to do the sessions outside of dialysis if it were feasible for him. P4 and P5, who completed the program on their own with weekly phone contact, both endorsed th e phone - based format. P4 expressed that the phone -based delivery was convenient because it meant he didn't have to come to the hospital for sessions. P5, however , shared that he would have been willing to coming to the hospital for the program se ssions if necessary. P2 and P5 also shared that they liked how the weekly intervals between program sessions gave them time to think about and reflect on strategies throughout the week . 5.5.2.4 Web modules All participants felt that the web modules were an importa nt part of the program , and all expressed that the computer -based delivery was acceptable and easy to use . P1, P3, P4 and P5 all shared that they found the modules were simple and understandable . P3 and P4 shared that they found the combined audio -visual d elivery of the information to be effective. P1 and P5 further stated that they found the pace of the modules good; P5 expressed that he liked that they gave him enough time to absorb the information . P3 expressed that he had \"learned a lot\" from the module s; however, P4 expressed that the modules moved too slowly for him at times . Participants ' viewpoints were conflicting about whether they used the information from the modules when engag ing in the personalized goal -based problem solving part of the program. 5.5.2.5 Personalized goal-based problem solving The participants all expressed that they valued the personalized goal -based problem solving part of the intervention. For example, P4 and P 5 expresse d that they liked the program's focus on their personal goals, while P2 expressed that she preferred the \"personalized\" section of the 84 program to the computer modules, because it was easier to use the personalized information. P3, however, found it challen ging to try to imagine himself doing tasks for the purpose of exploring his performance breakdowns, because every time he performed the task was different. He felt it would have been easier to problem -solve while he was actually doing the task in question. P1 and P 4 expressed that the guidance provided by the therapist during the PG -BPS was helpful for generating new strategies. The participants' experiences with the Goal -Plan-Do-Check (GPDC) problem -solving strategy were disparate. P5 expressed strongly that he believed the GPDC process was a good way to approach problem -solving , and P3 shared that he was still using GPDC in his day -to-day life. However, P1 and P 4 did not recall using the GPDC strategy at all. 5.5.2.6 Inconsistencies between qualitative and quanti tative Findings The positive qualitative reports on the PEP program from P2 and P5 were found to be inconsistent with their negative quantitative outcomes. As such, P2 and P5 were asked to provide further insight into their experiences with the program. U pon further probing, P2 seemed conflicted about her experience with the program. She repeatedly emphasized that the program had benefitted her. However, she also shared that she felt she was \"in a rut\", and that it was not necessarily the responsibility of the program to change that . She talked about the need to be motivat ed to change, and that because she lived alone, her current activity patterns were adequate for her. She also stated that what she really needed to solve her fatigue was \"a new kidney\". Generally, she expressed during the interview that the program may not benefit everybody . However, she also repeatedly emphasized that she felt the program had benefitted her personally. P5, meanwhile, confirmed that he did feel had benefitted from the progr am, and stated that it had helped him to be able to \"do more things. \" 5.6 Discussion This is the first study to explore the efficacy of an energy conservation education program, the \"PEP\" program, for changing fatigue and life participation outcomes in adults on CDT. Quantitative findings on the effect s of the program were mixed: three participants demonstrated a consistently positive response to the program , across multiple measures of fatigue and life participation, while two demonstrated an inconsistent or no response. However, q ualitative findings indicated that all of the participants identified benefits of participating in the program , with the most common reported benefit being that it had made their lives and/or their daily 85 activities easier. The format of the program was also largely said to be feasible and convenient by the participants. These findings provide preliminary , proof -of-principle evidence that the PEP program has the potential to fill the current gap in interventions targeting fatigue, and its impact on life participation , in people on CDT . At present, there is a widely -recognized dearth of clinical interventions that can be used to address fatigue in people on CDT (Artom et al. , 2014) . Despite the longstanding use of ECE to target fatigue in other chronic disease populations, and evidence of positive effects (Farragher, unpublished) , ECE had never been studied as a fatigue management i ntervention for the CDT population prior to this study. The improvements seen in fatigue and self -efficacy associated with the PEP program , are consistent with other results on ECE in different chronic disease populations , such as MS (Finlayson et al. et al. , 2003) . Howe ver, t he positive changes observed in life participation are relatively novel for ECE research (Farragher, unpublished) . The approach to personalized goal -based problem solving (CO-OP) used in the PEP program , was included to strengthen the effect of ECE on this outcome, given CO -OP's strong evidence for improving life participati on in other disease populations (Dawson et al. , 2009; Ng , 2013) . However, CO -OP had yet to be studied in the CDT population prior to this study , and yet to ever be applied to address fatigue with energy conservation strategies. The positive changes in life participation observed in three participants are consistent with other recent p reliminary studies (Kim et al. , 2017; Raina et al. , 2016) , which have similarly employed a goal -based approach to ECE. Collectively, these studies suggest that a personalized , goal -focused approach to ECE might be optimal for improving life participation outcomes in people with fatigue, although further, more rigorous investigations are needed to confirm th ese preliminary findings. Although positive life participation outcomes were achieved in three participants in this study, their effect sizes were small to moderate according to the time -series analyses . The CO -OP approach has previously been associated with larger effects on life participation outcomes (Dawson et al. , 2009; Polatajko et al. , 2012) . In this study we used a modified version of CO -OP, which was created to be more feasible for individuals on CDT , and better suited to address fatigue -related problems. CO-OP is normally studied as a protocolized intervention , and several intervention components are believed to mediate its effect s. These include the use of dynamic 86 performance analysis to identify individual's specific performance breakdowns of their goal activity , and an iterative process of generating, trying, and revising plans to address the breakdowns (Missiuna et al. , 2001) . The modifications we made to CO -OP included reducing the number of sessions provided; using a revised approach to dynamic performance analysis that relied on visualiz ing, rather than actual ly perform ing, the target goal ; and trying, or \"doing\" , plans outside of therapeutic sessions , instead of during therapy . Reports from the qualitative interviews suggested that these changes may have attenuated CO -OP's effectiveness; for example, one participant expressed that the process of analy zing his performance using visualization was difficult and frustrating at times, and two participants did not retain the metacognitive goal -plan-do-check strategy that is believed to be key for promoting generalization and transfer of strategy use after CO -OP (Houldin et al. , 2018) . Further consideration of how the core elements of CO -OP could be reinforced within the PEP program may therefore be required. However, t he measure s used to assess life participation for the time - series studies were also specifically created for this study , and th us lacked thorough psychometric testin g to support their validity and reliability . There is currently an international effort underway to crea te a valid ated measure of the impact of fatigue on life participation in the CDT population (Ju et al. , 2018) , which may prove to be a valuable outcome tool to assess life participation outcomes in future studies of the PEP program. Despite the positive changes in life participation, fatigue and self -efficacy seen for three of the study participants, two participants did not show consistent signs of improvement in the study outcomes associated with the program. It is unclear why these participants may not have responded to the program. In the follow -up qualitative interviews, one of the participants emphasized that the program had impacted him positively . The other participant , however, seemed ambivalent about the program. The main program benefit she reported was an increased awareness of the activities she could be doing. Yet, she still did not feel the need to change her routines, and spoke of being in a \"rut\" that the progra m was not designed to address. The Transtheoretical model (TTM) of readiness for behaviour change (Prochaska et al. , 1993) may help to explain her response. A ccording to the TTM, people who are at a pre -contemplative stage of behaviour change are often unaware that their behavior is problematic or produces negative consequences , and do not intend to take action in the foreseeable future (Prochaska et al. , 1993) . Another participant similarly spoke of the need to be motivated to reap the benefits of the 87 program, during his follow -up qualitative interview. A different approach , grounded in the TTM, might therefore be needed to encourage readiness for behaviour change in such people on CDT who are at not yet ready for to change their fatigue management behaviours (eg. a n increased consideration of the pros and cons of their current methods for managing fatigue. ) The results of this study suggest there is potential for the PEP program to positively affect people on CDT who experience fatigue. However, although the median program administration time of just over two hours was far less than other energy conservation programs described in the literature, it may still be more than what clinicians already working in CDT care are able to commit to a program of this nature. There are also often a dearth of rehabilitation specialists working in CDT clinical settings who would be qualified to adminis ter this program, which is ideally designed to be administered by an occupational therapist. Given that other CDT clinicians (eg. nurses) have previously expressed a lack of comfort with providing rehabilitation -focused interventions to people (Painter, Carlson, Carey, Myll, & Paul, 2004; Painter et al. , 2014) , further consideration of the need f or more rehabilitation professionals on CDT multidisciplinary teams may be needed, particularly if such individuals could help people with CKD with the high - priority task of fatigue management. This study had a number of strengths . Among them were the use of a single -case, time -series design, which is a cost -effective way to generate preliminary data about an intervention (Kratochwill & Levin, 2 015). The use of multiple assessments of the dependent variable throughout the study phases , also served to decrease the risk of spurious findings arising from measurement error at a single timepoint. We also used methods to triangulate the exploratory study findings, such as including multiple measures of the primary study outcomes, and interviewing participants after the study to further confirm and clarify the quantitative study findings. Study limitations included those inherent to an early explorato ry study. The first author both conduct ed the study assessments and administer ed the intervention , which means it is possible that a social desirability effect may have biased participants to report greater benefit associated with the program than they exp erienced. All participants were recruited from a common dialysis center in Toronto, Canada, which may mean the study findings are not generalizable to the broader CDT population. There was also no long -term follow up conducted as part of this study, which means is it unknown whether people maintained the improvements they made during the study. 88 In conclusion, this study provides preliminary evidence that the PEP program may be associated with positive fatigue -related outcomes, including life participation, in adults on CDT. Further, more rigorous efficacy testing of the PEP program is thus warranted. 89 Chapter 6: Summary of Findings, Discussion , and Methodological Strengths and Limitations 90 Chapter 6: Summary of Findings, Discussion , and Methodological Strengths and Limitations 6.1 Introduction This thesis sought to explore the potential for energy conservation education (ECE) to improve fatigue and life participation outcomes in the chronic dialysis therapy (CDT) population. A multi -staged project was undertaken to address the three objectives: 1. To explore what was known about energy conservation education in adults with chronic diseases; 2. To develop an ECE program for people on CDT that would be feasible, improve their lif e participation , and use sound education and design principles, and 3. To conduct preliminary efficacy testing to explore if the ECE program was associated with improvements in fatigue and life participation in people on CDT . In the following chapter , a summary of the findings as they relate to each objective is presented . The main strengths and limitations of the research are outlined, and the findings and their implications are discussed . Directions for future research are also discussed throughout the chapter. 6.2 Summary of Findings The first study of this thesis (Chapter 3) was an investigat ion into what was known about energy conservation education , in chronic disease populations who experience fatigue. The specific objectives w ere to describe the chronic disease populations in which ECE had been studied ; the characteristics of the ECE programs in the literature ; and the findings that ha d been reported regarding the impact of ECE on fatigue and life participation. Th rough the scoping study , literature on ECE was identified for seven different chronic disease populations: MS, cancer, CFS, cardiac disease, acquired brain injury, RA, and post -polio syndrome. Numerous qualitative and quantitative studies reported positive findings on a 10-12 hour, face -to-face, group -based ECE program entitled \"Managing Fatigue: A Six -Week Course in Energy Conservation\" (Packer et al. , 1995) in the MS population. There were, however, a lack of studies to demonstrate the \"Managing Fatigue\" program's effect on life participation outcomes, and adaptations of the program, including a web-supported version and an individualized version, also repor ted less consistent positive findings. In the six other chronic disease populations, the reported findings on ECE were mixed, and largely preliminary. A heterogeneous set of 19 different ECE programs were identified throughout the literature. The most comm on program design was face -to-face 91 delivery with more than five hours of total education time , and half of the programs were group - based. There was also no ECE research in some clinical populations, such as chronic kidney disease or chronic obstructive pul monary disease, who experience fatigue. In the next stage of the thesis (Chapter 4) , a new ECE program for the CDT population was developed , applying the WHO (2014) framework for health education planning to guide the development process . The CDT population's needs and assets were identified using a literature - based S trengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis, which revealed there was no existing ECE program that would meet the needs of adults on CDT of improved life participation, and feasibility in their clinical context and situation. The goals of improved life participation and feasibility in the dialysis clinical context were th en set for the new ECE program. The literature was consulted to identify theory and/or evidence -based approaches that would meet the goals of the program, and the Cognitive Orientation to Occupational Performance (CO -OP) (Missiuna et al. , 2001) was identified as a promising, personalized goal - focused problem -solving approach, to facilitate energy conservation strategy training. The CO - OP intervention was subsequently adapted to suit the dialysis clinical context , and clients' energy -related challenges. Two complementary educational web modules were also designed , which provide people on CDT with a concise and convenient method to gain relevant background information o n energy conservation prior to CO -OP. The resulting \"PEP\" program is a two -part, personalized, web-supported ECE program, which combines web-supported educational modules with personalized, goal -based problem solving to facilitate life participation goal attainment via the use of EC strategies. After initial program development, semi -structured qualitative interviews conducted with four selected key CDT informants (two people with CKD , one clinician, and one health education specialist) revealed that their perceptions of the program were positive . For example, they expressed that the program modules were novel, useful, and engaging. They also provided a number of recommended program modifications, of which 26 were implemented. Usability testing undertaken with five people on CDT , which incorporated both performance -based and subjective assessments , also suggested the program was largely usable by people with a variety of levels of computer literacy. Finally, the efficacy of the PEP program for improving fat igue and life participation outcomes in people on CDT was explored (Chapter 5) . A mixed -methods, sequential explanatory study design was used (Ivankova, Creswell, & Stick, 2006) , that included a single -case, time -series 92 experiment with four replications , and follow -up qualitative interviews with program participants. The five study participants were all on CDT, and were purposively selected to represent typical dialysis user chara cteristics including age, gender and dialysis modality. Three participants demonstrated a positive response to the program across multiple quantitative measures of fatigue, self -efficacy, and life participation, while the remaining two participants demonst rated an inconsistent response, or no response. The post -intervention qualitative interviews indicated that all five participants felt the program had benefitted them, with the most commonly -reported benefit being that it made their lives and/or their dail y activities easier. The format of the program was also largely said to be feasible and convenient by the participants. 6.3 Discussion and Implications This thesis has produced the first evidence that ECE has the potential to improve fatigue and life participa tion outcomes in people on CDT. These findings , while preliminary , are nevertheless important given recent evidence showing that fatigue and its impact on life participation are highly important to people on CDT (Ju et al. , 2018; Manns et al. , 2014) . Currently, there are few evidence -based treatme nt options for addressing fatigue that clinicians can use with the CDT population (Artom et al. , 2014) . Furthermore, t he treatments that are availabl e pose significant challenges, such as excessive specificity and/or infeasibility, which have been discussed in previous chapters. Energy conservation education is a non -specific approach to fatigue management , that can benefit people on CDT with varying fatigue aetiologies (Farragher et al. , unpublished , and can require less time or energy investment from participants than existing approaches . The single -case study participants reported experiencing various benefits from the PEP program, and confirmed in qualitative interviews that the program was easy -to-use and suitable for their needs. These findings justify the need for more research to be conducted on the \"PEP\" program , using a larger sample of patients and robust trial methodolog y (ie. control, blinding, randomization), to further understand its effects on fatigue and life participation in people on CDT. Outside of the renal population, much of the ECE research to date has focus ed on a specific face - to-face, group -based ECE program, \"Ma naging Fatigue: A Six -Week Course in Energy Conservation\" (Packer et al. , 1995) , in the MS population. The considerable body of evidence to support this program speaks to the potential of ECE for chronic disease populations more 93 broadly, in whom fatigue is pervasive and highly problematic, and justifies the need for robust randomized trials of ECE in other chronic disease populations. However, despite its strong evidence for people with MS, the \"Managing Fatigue\" program has never been studied outside of the MS population. It is possible that , as was true for the CDT population, a program which requires such extensive participant commitment may not be feasible or convenient for other chronic disease populations, or may not meet the need for a program that facilitates people 's life participation goals. The PEP program inc luded novel design components to address these limitations, as they were anticipated to be major potential barriers to progr am uptake in the CDT population. Among the most prominent was the addition of a CO -OP-informed approach, which is an established personalized, goal -based problem -solving intervention, with strong evidence for facilitat ing life participation improvements in other chronic disease populations (Dawson et al. , 2009; McEwen, 2013) . Simultaneously, o ther ECE programs have emerged in the literature that also use a more personalized, goal -focused approach to ECE (Kim et al. , 2017; Raina et al. , 2016) . CO-OP shares similarities with these approaches, such as its top -down, client -centered approach, and the incorporation of problem -solving training. However, it also has unique features (eg. dynamic performance analysis and guided discovery) that are believed to help promote generalization and transfer of strategy use to untrained tasks and contexts (Houldin et al. , 2018) . Positive quantitative improvements in both general and goal -specific life participation were observed in three people after the PEP program, and all five participants qualitatively reported that the program helped them cope with day-to-day activities. This preliminary evidence supports the potential of a CO -OP approach to ECE for improving life participation outcomes in people on CDT with fatigue. Participants also qualitatively described instances of using energy conservation st rategies after the program for life goals that were not directly addressed in therapy, which provides early supporting evidence that the PEP program may facilitate generalization and transfer of ECE strategy use to untrained tasks and contexts. These findi ngs justify the need for further investigation into the effects o f the PEP program o n generalization and transfer in people on CDT . Given its potential strengths in this area, adaptation and testing of the PEP program for other chronic disease populations who experience fatigue may also be warranted for future research. 94 The PEP program was designed to be feasible and convenient for people on CDT , via the use of web-supported educational modules to teach clients about ECE. e -Health designs have been found to be effective in other areas of health education research, but have scarcely been shown to be effective for delivering ECE ( Chapter 3 ). A variety of so urces were consulted during the design of the PEP program modules . Literature that identified important components of e -Health and ECE interventions, and l iterature on chronic kidney disease and movement science principles , were used to inform module conte nt and design. A novel, whiteboard animation -style design was also incorporated into PEP. Preliminary evidence suggested that people found the style of the modules to be engaging and interesting . This may reflect the broader potential of whiteboard animati on design to enhance the delivery of health education , as it has recently become a popular medium for delivering information in popular cultur e, but has scarcely been tested in the health education domain. Participants also reported gaining novel and usefu l information from the modules . However, the true effects of the modules on study outcomes remain unclear , based on the single -case study data. Participants' scores on the knowledge questionnaires designed to assess their learning demonstrated a ceiling ef fect at baseline . This could mean that participants already knew the information from the modules, or, that the questionnaires did not adequately capture their learning. There were a limited number of datapoints available during the module phase of the int ervention to reliably assess changes in the other study outcomes (life participation, fatigue, self -efficacy, and energy conservation strategy use) associated with the modules. Future studies on the PEP program should thus re-evaluat e the learning assessme nts to ensure they match the learning objectives of the modules, and include a larger number of study participants, to clarify the role of the modules in participants' outcomes. Although CO -OP principles were used in the PEP program to facilitate life participation, a number of modifications were made to the original CO-OP protocol to increase its feasibility in the CDT population. For example, a modified approach to dynamic performance analysis (DPA) that asked people to visualiz e perform ing their target activity , rather than actual ly performing it, was used to identif y performance breakdowns. C lients were also asked to try, or \"do\" , energy conservation plan s outside of therapy sessions , rather than trying the plan immediately during therapy. Although positive effects on life participation were reported after the PEP program, the improvements appeared to be relatively modest compared to what has been reported in other CO - OP literature (Dawson et al. , 2009; McEwen et al. , 2009) . Given that DPA and the iterative 95 process of acting out GPDC are both seen as key features of the CO -OP approach, further consideration may need to be given to how to better simulate these CO -OP com ponents in the PEP program. For example, clients may be able to video -record their activity performance using a device like a Go -pro for use in the DPA, rather than using visualization. A further training period to consolidate the GPDC process may also hel p to strengthen this component of CO -OP during PEP. Despite the positive preliminary findings on the PEP program in three of five participants on CDT , the nonresponse to the program seen in two people on CDT with fatigue also warrants consideration. The only differences observed in their characteristics , compared to those for whom the program was effective, were their female gender and PD dialysis modality, respectively, which therefore may warrant exploration in larger studies of PEP . However, d uring the post -intervention qualitative interviews, participants also spoke of needing motivation to change to reap the benefits of the PEP program. Possible reasons for a lack of motivation to change may be that people have come to accept their fatigue, or that t hey do not view their fatigue management behaviours as being problematic. According to the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) of readiness for behaviour change (Prochaska et al. , 1993) , these people may be at an earlier, pre -contemplative stage of readiness to change . A different approach might thus be needed to ready people who do not yet feel ready or motivated to use ECE strategies, such as a more extensive consideration of the pros and cons of thei r current methods for managing fatigue , as is specified by the TMM . Such a component could be incorporated directly into the PEP program in the future, or, used to precede the program for people with whom it might be beneficial. Although the PEP program was designed to offer greater feasibility than existing ECE programs in the CDT clinical context, its feasibility also remains an area for further consideration. ECE is an approach most commonly administered by rehabilitation profe ssionals. Furthermore, the CO - OP approach that is included in the PEP program typically requires clinical training for administration. There are typically few rehabilitation staff who work on CDT units, and other CDT clinicians (eg. nurses) have previously expressed a lack of comfort with providing rehabilitation -focused interventions (eg. exercise training) to people on CDT (Painter et al. , 2004, 2014) . The PEP program was designed to require less program administration time than other ECE programs , in an attempt to accommodate the limited staffing that may be available for 96 its administration. The PEP program efficacy study did reveal the median program administration time to be relatively brief, at just over two hours in total. However, this may still be more than what clinicians currently working in CDT care are able to commit to a program of this nature. Further consideration of staff resources , and how they may be adjust ed to facilitate the use of the PEP program in clinical practice , may therefore be needed , if the PEP program is found to be efficacious in more robust, controlled trials. 6.4 Methodological Strengths and Limitations The first study of this thesis employed a scoping review approach to explore the literature on ECE in adults with chronic diseases. Scoping review s are useful when there is insufficient evidence on an intervention to conduct a full systematic review , which was found to be the case for ECE. Scoping review methodology can identify gaps in literature where there is an absence of evidence, or where the available evidence is clearly at a preliminary stage. The g old-standard scoping review guidelines used for the review on ECE (Arksey and O'Malley, 2005) outline a comprehensive and systematic approach to examining the literature. The l iterature search strategy we used was co -constructed by an experienced librarian with expertise in rehabilitation, and a s ystematic process using pre -established eligibility criteria and data extraction sheets was used to select relevant studies and extract data . These steps increased the likelihood that a comprehensive and nonbiased review of the ECE literature was achieved. Furthermore, t he use of a scoping review approach enabled us to synthesize both qualitative and quantitative findings on EC E, providing an integrative overview of the literature for knowledge users to inform their clinical and/or research work. However, one of the primary limitations of s coping review methodology is that breadth is prioritized over depth ; thus, a critical appraisal of the quality of included studies is not typically performed . Additional quality -related evidence gaps may therefore exist in the ECE literature , which were not identified b y our review. Given the advancements in ECE literature that have taken place in recent years , sufficient literature may soon become available to answer more focused questions about the effects of ECE in different chronic disease populations , using systemat ic review methodology . Another limitation of the scoping review was the exclusion of non -English articles , which may limit the generalizability of the findings to non -English -speaking locations. 97 To develop the new ECE intervention for people on CDT , the WH O framework for planning a health education intervention was used . Health education planning models are used for \"planning, implementing and evaluating health education program mes and for providing a framework on which to build a plan\" (World Health Organization, 2014, p. 21) , and help to promote effective decision -making (Bartholomew, Parcel, & Kok, 1998) . A Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis, which is an established, evidence - based needs assessment tool (Nixon & Helms, 2010) , was used to systematically examine the needs of the CDT population regarding an ECE program . Relevant literature was con sulted to inform the selection of intervention approaches and strategies to include in the program, which is recommended by prominent intervention planning models such as the Intervention Mapping approach (Bartholomew et al. , 1998) . People with CKD and other key informants were also engaged during the intervention development process, which is increasingly recognized as an important factor in creating better -quality healthcare (Carman et al. , 2013) . However, limit ed time and resources meant it was not possib le to engage the full range of CKD stakeholders during the intervention development process. O ur initial program development team, key informants, and usability study participants were therefore all based out of one common health center in Toronto , which may mean their perspectives and experiences do not fully represent those of people on CDT or stakeholders from other locations. The key informants interviewed about the program were also a selected group, chosen for possessing characteristics such as insig htfulness and enthusiasm . Thus, it is possible their perspectives may not represent the average target user of the PEP program. To test the program's usability, a small sample size of five people on CDT was also used . Although f ive usability tests is accep ted by many to be adequate to uncover ~80% of a system's usability problems (Virzi, 1992) , and our participants were purposely selected to represent the most important and potentially impactful characteristics , involving a larger sample of people with CDT would nevertheless have provided more comprehensive program usability information in the target population. Finally, despite our efforts t o use best -available methods to develop a feasible ECE intervention for people on CDT , it still requires time from a trained rehabilitation clinician, which is not available in some dialysis contexts . Collectively, these limitations mean the PEP program ma y require adaptation to be used with some people on CDT and/or in some other clinical settings, where patient and/or clinical needs and resources are different. 98 Finally, a single -case, time -series design was used to explore the efficacy of the PEP program , which is considered an efficient and robust way to generat e preliminary data about an intervention (Dallery, Cassidy, & Raiff, 2013; Kratochwill & Levin, 2015) . The multiple measurements taken of the dependent variables during each study phase make single -case, time - series methodology more ro bust than a pre -post design , as they decrease the risk of random measurement error that may occur at a single assessment timepoint (Dallery et al. , 2013) . We also performed four replications of the single -case study to increase our confidence in the findings , and used people on CDT who were sampled purposively to represent a variety of patient characteristics to maximize the generalizability of study findings. Additionally, a number of triangulation methods were used to cross -validate the exploratory study finding s: we incorporated multiple measures of the prim ary study outcomes, and interviewed participants after the study to further confirm and clarify the findings from the quantitative measures. However, although the time -series design provided superior validity t o a pre -post design , the risk of excessive par ticipant questionnaire burden ultimately led us to only conduct a minimally - acceptable three baseline assessments to establis h their pre-intervention status for the study outcomes . More assessments taken during the baseline phase would have further decreas ed the risk of spurious findings, and provided more statistical power to detect changes between the baseline and intervention study phases . The exploratory nature of the study also meant that the first author was responsible for performing multiple study d uties, including both conducting the study assessments and administering the intervention. This overlap may have increased the risk of a social desirability effect biasing pa rticipants to report greater benefit associated with the program than they actually experienced . Furthermore , control groups and randomization were not used for this preliminary exploration , which means there is a risk that other factors (eg. the placebo effect ) might explain improvement s in study outcomes observed at the time of intervention. All participants were also recruited from a common dialysis center in Toronto, Canada, which may mean the study findings are not generalizable to the broader CDT population. Finally, there was no long -term follow up conducted for this study, which means that maintenance of gains made from the program is unknown. Collectively, these limitations warrant the need for a larger trial of the PEP program, using a larger, more representative sample and methodologies to further minimize the risk of bias affecting study outcomes. 99 6.5 Conclusion In conclusion, thi s thesis has shown that a n energy conservation education progr am, tailored to meet the needs of people on C DT, has the pote ntial to improve fatigue and life participation i n the CDT popul ation. F urther robust testing of the progr am's efficacy in pe ople on CDT is therefore warranted. 100 References Abdel -Kader, K., Jhamb, M., Mandich, L. A., Yabes, J., Keene, R. M., Be ach, S., ...

The ACS presents patients with a set of 80 physical car ds, each depicting one common activity of day - to - day living (eg. going to a restaurant; cleaning the house). Patients are then asked to sort the cards into one of five participation categories: \"not done prior to illness/injury\"; \"continued to do during il lness/injury\"; \"given up due to illness/injury\"; \"beginning to do again\"; and \"new activity since illness/injury\". The goal of the energy inventory was to increase clients' awareness of their energy spending habits, consider activities that they might be spending too much energy on, and identify activities they wished to allocate more energy towards. As such, the sorting categories from the ACS were condensed and modified to focus specifically on energy spending , as follows : \"I spend enough energy on it\", \"I wish to spend more energy on it\", and \"I don't want or need to spend energy on it\". As the set of activities included in the ACS were derived from a sample of older adults in the 1980's, we also updated the activity set to reflect a broader and more cu rrent occupational repertoire, using activities from the Australian Adult ACS , which were derived from a more recent, broad patient sample. We also reduced the total number of activities from 80 to 55 to make the Inventory briefer , using a systematic selec tion process that took into account the importance rank of the activity from the original paper , and the perceived relevance of the activity to current - day life. After making the final modifications to the activity set , we transferred it to an onlin e websi te, via an external card - sorting web platform, so that it could be completed online with the other PEP web module content. 134 # ORIGINAL ACS ACTIVITY ACS VERSION ROUND 1 CHANGE S REVISED ACTIVITY ROUND 2 CHANGE FINAL ENERGY INVENTORY ACTIVITY 1.

CLICK ... CLICK Slide 2 SESSION 1 MATERIALS Your PEP workbook A pen or pencil About 20 minutes CLICK TO CONTINUE SESSION For today ' s session, you ' ll need your CLICK pep workbook, CLICK a pen or pencil, and CILCK about 20 minutes. Go ahead and gather any materials you need, and click the button onscreen whenever you ' re ready to keep going. CLICK x 2 Slide 3 SESSION 1 MATERIALS Your PEP workbook A pen or pencil About 20 minutes CLICK TO CONTINUE SESSION Appendix D: PEP Program Module 1 Slides & Transcript 142 Slide 4 KIDNEY DISEASE *Living with kidney disease CLICK and being on dialysis CLICK can be a challenging experience. Kidney failure can affect the CLICK body and CLICK mind in different ways CLICK, and for many, it can create some uncomfortable symptoms. CLICK Slide 5 SYMPTOMS ITCHINESS PAIN TROUBLE BREATHING NAUSEA For example, CLICK 3 in 10 people on dialysis say they experience nausea, CLICK 4 in 10 have trouble breathing, CLICK 5 in 10 report feeling pain, and CLICK 6 in 10 have difficulty with itchiness. CLICK Slide 6 FATIGUE SYMPTOMS 7 in 10 *However, one of the most common and troubling symptoms people on dialysis experience is CLICK fatigue. CLICK 7 out of 10 people on dialysis have difficulty with fatigue. CLICK 143 Slide 7 FATIGUE Fatigue stops me from doing what I want and need to do... *And many say that it CLICK stops them from doing what they want or need to do in their lives. CLICK Slide 8 How can I make the most of the energy I have? If you can relate to this, CLICK the PEP Program may be helpful for you. CLICK The PEP program is designed to help you learn CLICK how to make the most of the energy you have, so that fatigue doesn ' t interfere with what ' s important to you so much. CLICK Slide 9 THE \"PEP\" PROGRAM PART 1: LEARNING ABOUT \"PEP\" SESSION 1 PART 2: CREATING YOUR \"PEP\" SESSION 2 SESSION 3 INDIVIDUAL THERAPY \"Energy priorities\" \"Cutting energy costs\" \"Putting PEP into action\" Working on your \"PEP\" *The PEP program is divided into two parts. In CLICK Part 1, we explain an approach to managing fatigue called \" PEP \", or PERSONAL ENERGY PLANNING, during CLICK 2 computer modules that you can complete yourself over the internet. CLICK Today ' s mod ule will explore how energy fuels everything you do, and how budgeting your energy can be a way to accomplish your priorities in spite of having fatigue. The CLICK second session will give you some ideas about how to cut your energy costs to bring your ene rgy budget into balance. 144 CLICK In part 2 of the PEP program, we ' ll focus on creating your personal energy plans. After completing a CLICK third computer module about how to put personal energy planning into action, CLICK you ' ll work on your own goals dur ing several one - on - one sessions with a specific member of your healthcare team known as your PEP partner. The name of your PEP partner and the dates and locations of your appointments are listed on page 7 of your PEP workbook. We recommend that you try to complete the 3 computer modules of PEP at some point before you meet with your PEP partner. CLICK Slide 10 THE \"PEP\" PROGRAM PROGRAM INFORMA TION Your CLICK PEP workbook also contains other CLICK information you may need as you work through the PEP program. CLICK 145 Slide 11 PAUSE/PLAY VOLUME FULL SCREEN THE \"PEP\" PROGRAM *You can pause and restart these modules anytime by pressing CLICK the pause/play button at the bottom of your screen. You can repeat a section by pressing the CLICK \" repeat \" button, or skip over something you may have heard before by hitting CLICK \" skip \". CLICK There are also buttons to change the CLICK volume, and make the CLICK module bigger on your screen CLICK Slide 12 THE \"PEP\" PROGRAM PART 1: LEARNING ABOUT \"PEP\" SESSION 1 \"Energy priorities\" Now that we ' re done orienting, let ' s get started w ith CLICK Session 1. CLICK Slide 13 = ENERGY ENERGY You may or may not have thought about this before, but your body CLICK is a lot like a CLICK power plant - it ' s constantly making CLICK energy that you use to do all the things you do in your day to day life. CLICK 146 Slide 14 ENERGY *Every time you CLICK move, you ' re using a bit of CLICK energy ... CLICK Slide 15 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ENERGY Even when you CLICK think, you use CLICK energy as your brain works to process what it ' s thinking about. CLICK Slide 16 E NE RGY ENERGY Just about everything you do requires CLICK energy, and you have a limited CLICK amount of it to use at any given time CLICK. Imagine this fuel tank was beside you all the time holding your energy, so you could watch your ene rgy levels change throughout the day. CLICK 147 Slide 17 After a night ' s rest, your CLICK energy tank would probably be close to full. But once your day started, you would start to use energy when you CLICK stood up CLICK Slide 18 Walked to the washroom, washed up, CLICK Slide 19 Headed to the closet, got your clothes out, and got dressed CLICK 148 Slide 20 And then went to the kitchen to prepare your breakfast. CLICK Slide 21 FATIGUE! If you keep on using up your energy, eventually you CLICK run out. Your body lets you know this by causing you to feel CLICK fatigue. CLICK Slide 22 This is so you know it ' s time to stop and rest CLICK, so your body can replenish your energy again. CLICK x 2 149 Slide 23 Other things can also affect your energy levels, like whether you CLICK follow your diet, and how much exercise CLICK you get. CLICK But for the PEP program, we ' re focusing on the different things you do throughout your days, and how much you rest. CLICK Slide 24 SELF CARE WORK LEISURE What to do? Eg : Showering Getting dressed Eating Eg : Job Cooking Laundry Shopping Eg : Reading Playing instrument Playing games Visiting friends E NE RGY You may not be in the habit of thinking a bout it, but you make choices about how to spend your energy all the time, when you decide CLICK what to do. CLICK Most people spend their energy on a combination of CLICK self care activities - which includes things like CLICK showering, CLICK getting dres sed, and CLICK eating - work activities CLICK - which could be things you do at a CLICK job, or work you do around the house like CLICK cooking, CLICK laundry and CLICK grocery shopping - and CLICK leisure activities, which are fun or relaxing things you d o like CLICK reading, CLICK playing an instrument, CLICK playing games, or CLICK visiting with friends. CLICK Different types of activities are important to us for different reasons - they may make us feel independent, helpful, or like we ' re enjoying life. CLICK 150 Slide 25 YOUR STORY What are 2 activities from each group ( self - care, work, leisure ) that are important to you, and what makes them important? Jot down your thoughts in your PEP workbook on page 8 . CLICK TO CONTINUE SESSION Let ' s pause to give you the chance to reflect on your own situation. What are 2 activities from each group - self care, work, and leisure - that are important to you, and what is it that makes them importan t? Open your PEP workbook to page 8 and jot down your thoughts there. When you ' re finished, CLICK click the button on the screen to continue with the session. CLICK Slide 26 YOUR STORY What are 2 activities from each group ( self - care, work, leisure ) that are important to you, and what makes them important? Jot down your thoughts in your PEP workbook on page 8 . CLICK TO CONTINUE SESSION Let ' s pause to give you the chance to reflect on your own situation. What are 2 activities from each group - self care, work, and leisure - that are important to you, and what is it that makes them important? Jot down your thoughts in your PEP workbook o n page 9. When you ' re finished, CLICK click the button on the screen to continue with the session. CLICK x 2 151 Slide 27 ANEMIA NUTRIENT & FLUID IMBALANCES INFLAMMATION POOR SLEEP WORRYING DIALYSIS *Kidney disease CLICK can affect the body ' s ability to create and use energy for different reasons. For example, CLICK anemia means your body has hard time getting oxygen to its cells, which it needs for energy. There may be an imbalance of CLICK nutrients and fluids in your body, which are important sources of energy. Your body may be slightly CLICK inflam med trying to get rid of the toxins in its system, which can use up energy. You may have a hard time refreshing your energy during CLICK sleep because of symptoms like restless legs or pain. And you may also be spending some energy on CLICK worrying becau se of the stress that comes with the disease. Even CLICK dialysis itself tends to leave many people feeling drained. CLICK Because of these things, you may have noticed that you seem to have less energy to do the things that you would normally do. You m ight think of yourself as having a CLICK fuel tank that ' s a little CLICK smaller than it used to be. CLICK Slide 28 DIALYSIS SELF CARE WORK LEISURE Eg : Going to dialysis Setting up machine Managing meds/diet When you start dialysis CLICK, you also have extra activities you have to spend your energy on - like CL ICK going to your dialysis sessions, CLICK setting up your machine at home, or CLICK managing your medications and diet. When you think of it this way, it makes sense that you ' re CLICK running out of energy trying to keep up with your normal activities C LICK 152 Slide 29 ENERGY IMBALANCE ENERGY THINGS TO DO You have an energy imbalance - where the amount of CLICK energy you have doesn ' t match CLICK all of the things there are to do. CLICK x 2 Slide 30 ENERGY IMBALANCE ENERGY THINGS TO DO Slide 31 DIALYSIS SELF CARE WORK LEISURE Some people respond by putting CLICK dialysis and self - care activities first no matter what, since they can ' t really be missed. CLICK 153 Slide 32 ENERGY IMBALANCE ENERGY THINGS TO DO This may CLICK bring things back into balance. CLICK x 2 Slide 33 ENERGY IMBALANCE ENERGY THINGS TO DO Slide 34 WORK LEISURE But it probably also means giving up things that are personally important, because CLICK work and CLICK leisure add a certain kind of value to our lives CLICK 154 Slide 35 SELF CARE WORK LEISURE DIALYSIS Another way some people might respond is to conserve as much energy as possible CLICK by avoiding activities use a lot of energy. CLICK Slide 36 DIAL YSIS LEISURE WORK SELF - CARE But this also means CLICK giving up things that are important ... CLICK Slide 37 ENERGY IMBALANCE ENERGY THINGS TO DO THINGS TO DO CLICK And it can also create CLICK 155 Slide 38 ENERGY IMBALANCE ENERGY THINGS TO DO A different type of energy imbalance CLICK Slide 39 Because when you don ' t use the energy you CLICK have CLICK, your body CLICK starts to produce even less of it. CLICK Slide 40 There is another way! ENE RGY But CLICK there is another way to address this energy imbalance CLICK 156 Slide 41 ENERGY BUDGETING And that ' s by using energy budgeting CLICK Slide 42 RENT CAR FOOD BUDGETING BUDGET You ' re probably familiar with budgeting when it comes to CLICK money. All of us have a certain amount of money to spend, which we could call our CLICK budget CLICK - and different things we CLICK want or need to buy with it. CLICK Slide 43 THINGS TO BUY MONEY BALANCED BUDGET Someone has a \" balanced budget \" when they have enough CLICK money to buy the CLICK things they want or need. CLICK 157 Slide 44 The CLICK smaller our budget is CLICK, the more helpful it is to be careful and strategic about what CLICK we spend it on. CLICK Slide 45 BUDGETING MONEY Cut costs THINGS TO BUY We have to take a CLICK close look at what our pr iorities really are CLICK, and find creative ways to CLICK cut costs that aren ' t necessary from our budget CLICK in order to keep it balanced CLICK x3 Slide 46 MONEY THINGS TO BUY BUDGETING 158 Slide 47 Examples of money - saving ideas could be making CLICK coffee at home, using CLICK public transit instead of buying a car, or waiting to buy your favourite shoes until they ' re on CLICK sale. CLICK Slide 48 During the PEP Program CLICK Slide 49 BUDGETING YOUR ENERGY We ' re going to take a similar approach to CLICK budgeting your energy CLICK 159 Slide 50 ENERGY BUDGETING ENERGY THINGS TO DO Cut energy costs Today, we ' ll take CLICK a close look at what your energy priorities are, and then starting next session, consider creative ways CLICK you can CLICK cut your energy costs CLICK Slide 51 ENERGY THINGS TO DO ENERGY BUDGETING To bring your energy budget back int o balance without missing out on things that are important to you. CLICK Slide 52 ENERGY INVENTORY E NE RGY YOUR PRIORITIES *So let ' s consider your energy priorities now by having you take CLICK an Energy Inventory. Note that the following instructions can also b e found on page 10 of your PEP workbook. After these instructions ... CLICK 160 Slide 53 CLICK TO START THE ENERGY INVENTORY A CLICK button will appear onscreen to take you to the Energy inventory website. CLICK Slide 54 CATEGORIES ACTIVITIES There, you ' ll find a CLICK list of activities on the left side of the screen, and CLICK three categories on the right side of the screen that the activities may fall into for you. The first category is CLICK I have enough energy for it - these would be the activ ities you generally have enough energy to do without too much trouble. The second category is CLICK I want or need more energy for it, and these are the activities you wish you had MORE energy to do. CLICK The third category is CLICK I don ' t do it and that ' s fine, which are activities that you don ' t tend to want or need to do. CLICK 161 Slide 55 Choose 5 you want or need to work on the most. Write them down in your PEP workbook on page 11. *Sort the activities into the right categories by clicking and holding the activity with the mouse button, dragging it over to the right box, and then dropping it under the category title by releasing the mouse button. CLICK x 3. Be sure to drag the activity into the CLICK dark grey part of the category box, rather than the light grey part. CLICK When you ' re finished, take a moment t o look over the activities you have enough energy for. This is where you ' re currently choosing to spend your energy. Then, go over the activities you want or need more energy for and choose 5 that you ' d like to work on the most. Write them down in your PEP workbook on page 11, because we ' ll revisit them later on in the PEP program CLICK Slide 56 Also, remember to click the CLICK button on the top right - hand side of the screen when you ' re finished the activity to make sure it gets saved. CLICK 162 Slide 57 CLICK TO START THE ENERGY INVENTORY *Enjoy completing your energy inventory, and we ' ll see you back here again soon for module 2 of the PEP Program, when we ' ll look more closely at how to cut your energy costs. CLICK 163 Appendix E : Full Account of Key Informant Interview Findings Program Strengths The informants' overall impressions of the modules were generally positive, and largely supported that the modules successfully accomplished many of their intended objectives. The patient informants expressed that the modules validated their lived experience of fatigue, and its impact on their everyday activities. They both identified the information about the causes of fatigue in kidney disease as being at least somewhat new, a nd helpful to hear. One patient appreciated that the program had confirmed his fatigue was not merely psychosomatic in nature: \" That's the big gain, is that yes, this, the reality of it is I only have so much energy, it's not just in my head, I'm not react ing to this from an emotional psychosomatic way - I am tired - and so this whole thing validates that, which is huge.\" The patient informants expressed that the modules raised their awareness about their own energy spending, and the need to make active cho ices about what activities to engage in. The two patient informants communicated that the modules, and the energy inventory in particular, helped them to reflect on and identify their activity - related priorities, as described by the patient on dialysis: \" The things I discovered about myself already are helping me, just to see my priorities... I see where this is going, and I'm really excited about this.\" The patient informants also described that the modules enabled them to recognize and break down their own energy costs in more detail than what they otherwise would have been doing : \"It just breaks down something that people can all just lump together. Ok, I don't have the energy to do everything, so I have to cut some things out - I mean, that's no problem. But here, if you really look at it and break it down further, then all of these things can start adding up.\" The program's core approach of budgeting energy as a way of managing fatigue was described as novel, relevant, and relatable by all informants. Thi s was exemplified by the CKD Stage 3 patient: \"I thought it was good - because it was going directly to a key question for me, which is, how much energy do I have? And am I out of bounds thinking that I have to, uh, budget - for lack of a 164 better word - and this whole idea of having to rethink how much energy you have all the time, for me anyway, is pretty new.\" The CKD patient informant further expressed that the overall approach of planning ahead, and anticipating versus reacting to challenges, was a valua ble way to approach his fatigue. The content provided about the energy - saving strategies was seen as valuable by all informants. Although the nurse and the CKD informant anticipated that some patients on dialysis may already be familiar with the strategies , they expressed that it was nevertheless beneficial because it provided a methodology, or framework, that could be used to apply the appropriate strategies. The CKD patient also described how the modules were encouraging him to take action in response to his fatigue: \"I'm thinking about it a lot more concretely, instead of just, going around in a big circle - yeah I'd love to take guitar lessons, but I don't know if I have the energy, and yes I want to take guitar lessons, but... and then it's like okay, not next week....whereas really it has to be, do it, and budget, so that you can do it.\" The personalized aspect of the program was identified as another strength by the dialysis patient, who conveyed that she appreciated how the program allowed her to focus on what was important to her. The patient informants could both readily identify personal energy goals they would want to work on in Part 2 of the program. With respect to design, the key informants expressed that the modules were generally well - designed, e ngaging and interesting. The health education consultant expressed that the program had good flow, and the length and pace of the modules was said to be suitable by all key informants. The visual design of the modules was said to be strong by all informant s, who spoke specifically about the clarity and effective illustration of the concepts being explained. Some of the visual imagery in particular, such as the energy tank used to depict one's energy capacity and the stick - figure protagonist used to demonstr ate key concepts, were endorsed by multiple key informants, and said to make the underlying concepts concrete and relatable. The spare design and ample white space used in the slides was also identified as a visual design strength by two of the key informa nts, including the health education specialist: 165 \"It felt like intentionally spare design that's meant to allow somebody a lot of mental freedom to put themselves in there or not. I felt like I wasn't forced to imagine something in particular\" Two of the ke y informants also expressed that that the narration used in the modules was effective and used the right tone. The examples and activities incorporated into the modules were described by all informants as being relevant and relatable for the patient popula tion. The health education specialist expressed that she felt the examples would encourage participants to think creatively: \"Those were great examples, and they really made me think in a way - I think it would encourage some creative thinking for people t hat they may not have thought of.\" In general, the program design was praised for its overall clarity and simplicity. The nurse informant felt the simplicity of the modules was particularly beneficial for patients using the modules who may have cognitive i mpairments. Overall, the PEP program was said to be needed by the key informants, and was seen as filling a gap in care provided to this population. The patient informants endorsed that they would recommend the program to other patients with CKD on dialysi s. Two of the informants also expressed that they felt caregivers would benefit from seeing the modules, to validate the experiences of their loved ones and/or to learn about the intervention approach. Both patient informants endorsed that they benefited f rom the modules enough to want to continue onto Part 2 of the program, as exemplified by the dialysis patient informant: \"I'm ready to use a PEP partner! I really would like to [go to the next step], I think it's a good program. I need the help.\" Program W eaknesses and Recommendations A number of critiques and recommendations about the program content were identified by the key informants during the interviews. For example, both the CKD patients and the health education specialist felt that it would be help ful to clarify whether there were ways to increase one's energy besides just taking rest breaks, which is the strategy that is emphasized in the program. The Stage 3 CKD patient also expressed that he was not necessarily yet at the stage 166 where he was ready to cut his energy costs, if that meant sacrificing or changing activities he valued. As such, he wished the program spent more time addressing the mental recalibration required to accept his growing personal limitations, as he felt that this was the issue he was most struggling with. Two of the key informants felt that there was conflicting information about whether low - energy activities and/or mental activities drain versus refresh energy, and suggested clarifying this point. Two informants also suggested providing information on how to communicate with family about the need for their assistance to complete activities. One informant identified the monetary cost of some of the energy - saving strategy examples as being a potential barrier for some patients, w hile another wondered about the long - term feasibility of having to write down energy plans while engaging in the goal management process outlined in Part 2 of the program. The informants all also expressed that they found some of the content to be overexpl ained at times. However, there was ambivalence about this issue across informants, because they also appreciated its clarify and simplicity and struggled to identify how specifically they would alter the modules to address this issue. The CKD patient infor mant further expressed that even if some patients found parts of the modules too slow, he believed the overall content would nevertheless be valuable for anyone: \" I think I would anticipate that anybody, at any level of education, would get something out of this.\" Despite the simplicity and user - friendliness of the program design, the nurse informant also still wondered about the feasibility of some patients completing the computer modules independently due to their burden of health - related impairments. Sh e also wondered about the feasibility of Part 2 of the program, which requires a healthcare provider to work 1:1 with the patient for several half - hour sessions (4 - 6). The nurse informant felt that Part 2 of the program would be important to ensuring the p atients would implement the strategies learned in Part 1, but was unsure who on the healthcare team would have the time or knowledge to work with the patients. She suggested that allied health members of the team such as the social worker may be able to ad minister the program, or, that units may need to hire an occupational therapist to administer the program. A number of minor modifications to several visual images, slide transitions, and narrative 167 components were also recommended by the key informants. Se veral technical issues were also identified during the sessions, such as audio skipping and buttons not working. Following the key informant interviews, the research team met to discuss the comments and recommendations put forth by the key informants. A to tal of 60 recommended modifications were derived from the participant comments, and 25 were implemente d . Recommended modifications that were conflicting between informants, that were held by a minority of informants, or that were deemed to be infeasible, w ere not implemented. 168 Appendix F: Outcome Measures for PEP Efficacy Study FATIGUE SEVERITY SCALE (FSS) Date ______________________________ Participant ID:___________________________ Please circle the number between 1 and 7 which you feel best fits the following statements.
