BPH is a natural result of getting older. BPH symptoms can be very frustrating and include: - Frequent urination - Waking up multiple times each night to use the bathroom - Hard time starting and stopping - Weak urine stream - Painful or burning urination - Lack of control over your urination You are not alone. BPH affects up to 90% of men over the age of 85.1 The good news? There are many enlarged prostate treatment options available, including natural BPH treatments.2 So, what can you do? For starters, speak with your doctor freely about your BPH. While there are many BPH symptom treatments, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Your doctor can help you choose the best treatment for you, including the best natural treatment for BPH, after learning more about your condition. [Here](https://www.rezum.com/what-is-rezum/questions-to-ask-your-doctor.html) are some suggested questions to help get the conversation started. Going the Natural Route Watchful Waiting Watchful waiting means to keep an eye on your symptoms. Wait to see if there are any changes before you think through treatment options. Your doctor may suggest watchful waiting if you have mild symptoms that do not bother you much in your daily life. Things to watch include:3 - Urge to urinate often - Feeling that your [bladder](https://www.webmd.com/urinary-incontinence-oab/picture-of-the-bladder)is full, even after you've just gone - Sudden need to pee - Weak stream - Trouble starting and stopping - Urine leakage If your symptoms get worse over time, it's a good idea to see your doctor. Lifestyle Changes It's never too late to make healthy lifestyle choices. There may be ways to ease BPH symptoms by making small changes. You can:4 - Follow a balanced diet, rich in fruits and vegetables - Hold back on drinking liquids at night, above all before bedtime - Lower caffeine intake - Exercise regularly - Reduce stress These changes often help ease BPH symptoms. They will also help you remain healthy and active. Other Natural Remedies There are some other remedies that may help BPH symptoms because of their natural properties. These include: - Saw palmetto: Studies have shown that the berry of the saw palmetto can prevent testosterone from changing into an inflammatory type of testosterone (DHT) and reduce the size of the inner lining of the prostate.5 - Onions and garlic: Research shows that typically men who have BPH have a lower intake of onions and garlic which suggests that increasing intake of such vegetables may help ease symptoms of BPH.6 - There are other natural remedies, but it is important to learn and read more in detail before beginning to use any of them. It's important to speak with a doctor before attempting any remedies on your own. A doctor will tell you that sometimes watchful waiting, changing your habits and natural remedies do not work to control your BPH symptoms. If symptoms get worse over time and BPH affects your life in a larger way, there are other treatment options that can help. Other Treatment Options You can also speak with your doctor about medications. There are two main categories of medications. The first, Alpha-Blockers, help to relax the muscles in the bladder and prostate. This allows urine to flow more freely.7 The second common category of medications is 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors. These medications are designed to stop the growth or shrink the prostate by lowering production of the hormone DHT (a male sex hormone).8 Sometimes, medications have side effects such as drop in blood pressure, dizziness, fatigue and erectile dysfunction, among other things.9 In fact, 71% of people stop taking their medications within a year due to these negative tradeoffs.10 You can also talk to your doctor about minimally invasive enlarged prostate treatment options. Rezm Water Vapor Therapy is a minimally invasive option to reduce the size of the prostate. Rezm Therapy uses the natural energy stored in water vapor, or steam, to shrink the prostate so urine can flow freely again.11 Rezm Therapy is an option for men who are looking to treat their BPH and not just the symptoms of BPH. It's quick, and most patients get back to their daily activities in a few days.*12 Many patients begin to feel the benefit within weeks. Rezm Therapy can reduce the need for medicines and preserve your sexual function.11,12 Beyond these, there are several other treatment options available. The prostatic urethral lift (PUL) uses permanent implants to lift and hold the enlarged prostate tissue out of the way. And, there are other effective surgical procedures such as prostatectomy, laser therapy and transurethral resection of the prostate. You can take back control of your BPH by finding ways to treat it.
