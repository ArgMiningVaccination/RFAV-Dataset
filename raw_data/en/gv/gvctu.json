Naturopathic Medicine is a field of medicine that uses natural therapies, such as herbs, diet, nutritional supplements, hydrotherapy, homeopathy, and lifestyle management, to assist the body in its ability to heal itself. It focuses on identifying and treating the cause of disease rather than merely managing symptoms. Chinese Medicine identifies disease as a body that is out of balance and restores balance with the use of Chinese herbal formulas and acupuncture. Dr. Sijbrant's ability to combine these two fields of medicine is unique and will generally speed up your healing process. Dr. Sijbrant works with individuals of all ages and emphasizes prevention and self-care. My initial experience with your office was the most amazing ever. Dr Sijbrant is the best Acupuncturist and Naturopathic doctor I have ever been to. I have already referred 3 people in my office to him. I am looking forward to regular treatments and the benefits his expertise provides his patients. I am so happy I was referred to him, in one session he has made the pain go away and I feel a lot better. The consistent level of medical expertise, patient care and understanding is unsurpassed by anything I have ever experienced. I have been struggling with a medical problem for most of my life with no definitive answer even after working with multiple specialists. Dr. Sijbrant listened intently to my \"story\" and suggested a couple of tests. The results of those inexpensive tests revealed the source of my difficulty which now allows us to form a plan to help my body work properly. All of this without drugs, anything invasive, complicated or expensive. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! Dr. Sijbrant is extremely knowledgeable in Naturopathic medicine, Chinese Herbal medicine and Acupuncture. Definitely a one-stop-shop for all your medical needs. He is also kind, compassionate, caring, efficient and is a great listener. I walk away feeling heard, understood and encouraged that things will get better. I always leave with a smile on my face! Dr. Sijbrant is an excellent listener, very respectful, and willing to cater to your exact needs. One of the best doctor visits that I've had because at no point was I being told what I had to do, being guilted or shamed into anything, or trying to be sold something. It's nice to feel like a doctor is on the same team as me for once. Dr. Sijbrant is a true, compassionate physician that always puts his patients first and does what is best to treat whatever the issue. I have been treated for digestive issues, specifically diverticulitis. Dr. Sijbrant has also diagnosed me with an allergy to gluten and dairy that I now no longer consume. He has provided an effective treatment, that includes education on my issues, the correct meal plan, acupuncture (when needed) and the best natural herbs to help reduce inflammation, eliminate the pain, and get my body back to a healthy state. His treatment has improved my quality of life and I am so thankful to have him as a physician. I am so appreciative of Dr. Sijbrant and his great skill and knowledge - it has truly been a blessing to be in his care. He has helped restore hormonal balance to my body through his extensive knowledge of natural remedies as well as Eastern healing arts and I am grateful for his warmth and genuine concern for my well being as well. Dr. Sijbrant made me a believer in acupuncture even after I swore I would never let anyone put needles in me! His sage advice and wealth of knowledge, along with his calm, warm and caring demeanor make him my family's go-to doctor when it comes to questions about our health. We are very lucky to have him! Dr. Andreas Sijbrant graduated from the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon with a Doctorate in Naturopathy (N.D.) and from the Acupuncture & Integrative Medicine College, Berkeley (AIMC Berkeley) with his Masters of Science in Oriental Medicine (MSOM). He combines his western knowledge of disease and human systems with that of eastern medicine to devise individualized treatment plans that may consist of nutritional supplements, dietary counseling, herbs (Western or Chinese herbal formulas), homeopathic remedies, and acupuncture. Dr. Sijbrant works with a variety of acute and chronic conditions, however, has particular interest in gastroenterology and endocrinology including fertility counseling. Dr. Sijbrant is one of the first licensed NDs in CA and is an active member of the California Naturopathic Doctors Association (CNDA). He is the recipient of CNDA's Doctor of the Year Award for 2011. 905 Laurel St San Carlos, "}
