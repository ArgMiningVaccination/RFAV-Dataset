This Guideline applies to swine products and swine byproducts from Puerto Rico (PR) and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) moving interstate to other parts of the United States, including other U.S. territories. This Guideline does not apply to live swine and swine germplasm, transport of which will continue to be suspended from PR and USVI to other parts of the United States, including other U.S. territories. On September 17, 2021, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) issued Federal Order DA-2021-0002 suspending the interstate movement of all live swine, swine germplasm, swine products, and swine byproducts from Puerto Rico (PR) and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) to other parts of the United States, including other U.S. territories until sufficient mitigations could be established to authorize such movement. APHIS took this action out of an abundance of caution to further safeguard the U.S. swine herd and protect the interests and livelihoods of U.S. pork producers from African swine fever (ASF), which was confirmed in the Dominican Republic on July 28, 2021. APHIS subsequently issued revised Federal Order DA-2021-0003 on December 2, 2021, outlining mitigations to allow certain commercially processed swine products and swine byproducts from PR and USVI to move to other parts of the United States, including other U.S. territories, while continuing to provide the necessary protections against ASF. The September and December 2021 Federal Orders do not restrict the inter-island movement of cooked and raw swine products between PR and the USVI in both passenger baggage (travelers) and cargo (commercial). For commercially processed swine products or swine byproducts from PR or USVI in passenger baggage: Only canned meat/meat products or baked goods that are commercially labeled and packaged, and shelf-stable without requiring refrigeration will be eligible for entry. The passenger must declare swine products and swine byproducts to the USDA inspector at the airport before leaving PR or to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer before leaving the USVI. For commercially processed swine products or swine byproducts from PR or the USVI in cargo (including mail), a USDA Veterinary Services (VS) transport permit will be required unless the commodity has met the cooking and documentation requirements below. A USDA VS transport permit will not be required if the processed swine products and swine byproducts are accompanied by supporting documentation confirming one of the following heat treatments: Supporting documentation verifying the above requirements must include a signed producer statement on company letterhead. In addition, information on invoices, bills of lading, packing lists, or other verifying documents may also be required to verify compliance with the above requirements. VS recommends that the supporting documentation of the above treatments accompany each shipment. VS does not recommend that the documentation be placed inside the shipping container and further recommends that a copy of this guideline be provided to the producer/shipper in PR and/or the USVI. For fresh frozen/chilled pork/pork meat products from PR or the USVI in commercial cargo - VS transport permits will be required for all commercial cargo shipments of fresh frozen/chilled pork/pork meat products, and other swine products and swine byproducts not meeting the above requirements that are shipped directly from PR or the USVI to other parts of the United States, including other U.S. territories outside of the protection zone (PR and USVI). Please contact USDA APHIS directly at [APIE@usda.gov](mailto:APIE@usda.gov) for specific permitting procedures. When applying for a USDA VS transport permit, provide documentation such as manifests, invoices, producer/shipper statements on official company letterhead, or other shipping documents which provide the following information: The permit application and instructions, including information on the user fee and e-authentication, is available on the APHIS web site at [http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/permits/.](http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/permits/.) The current permit processing fee is $150 and permit duration is one year. Applications can be submitted by any of the "}
