Whether COVID-19 mRNA vaccine can induce this complication in children is unknown. We aimed to assess the risk of hyper-inflammatory syndrome following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in children. Methods We conducted a post-authorization national population-based surveillance using the French enhanced pharmacovigilance surveillance system for COVID-19 vaccines. All cases of suspected hyper-inflammatory syn- drome following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in 12 17-year-old children between June 15th, 2021 and January 1st, 2022, were reported. Cases were reviewed according to WHO criteria for MIS-C. The reporting rate of this syndromewas compared to the MIS-C rate per 1,000,000 12 17-year-old children infected by SARS-CoV-2. Findings Up to January 2022, 8,113,058 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine doses were administered to 4,079,234 12 17- year-old children. Among them, 12 presented a hyper-inflammatory syndrome with multisystemic involvement. Main clinical features included care unit transfer, and 3/12 (25%) hemodynamic support. All cases recovered. In eight cases, no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was found. The reporting rate was 1.5 (95%CI [0.8; 2.6]) per 1,000,000 doses injected, i.e. 2.9 (95%CI [1.5; 5.1]) per 1,000,000 12 17-year-old vaccinated children. As a comparison, 113 MIS-C (95%CI [95; 135]) occurred per 1,000,000 12 17-year-old children infected by SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation Very few cases of hyper-inflammatory syndrome with multi-organ involvement occurred following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in 12 17-year-old children. The low reporting rate of this syndrome, compared to the rate of post-SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C in the same age-group, largely supports the vaccination in a context of an important cir-culation of SARS-CoV-2.

This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ) Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children(MIS-C) is a novel clinical entity rst described in April 2020. 15Its association with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been documented, with a previous infection occur- ring 4 to 6 weeks before MIS-C onset.47The main clinical features of MIS-C are frequent acute cardiacdysfunction, shock, multi organ failure that often require pediatric intensive care unit transfer and hemodynamic support. 8Thus, numerous studies showed that MIS-C is by far the most severe clinicalsyndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and a leading source of morbidity related to SARS-CoV-2 in this age group. 8,9The pathophysiology of this disease remains unknown, but previous investigations showed that MIS- C is characterized by a cytokine storm10associated with a superantigen-like activation of T cells with an expan-sion of V b21.3-expressing T cells which is not seen in toxic shock syndrome, Kawasaki disease or other COVID-19 features. 1114Notably, SARS-CoV2 spike har- bors a motif located in the receptor binding domain thatis predicted in silico to interact with V bregion in T cells. Whether antigenic exposure limited to the Spike protein can lead to similar dysregulated immune responseremains unknown. Several COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have been shown to be efcacious and well tolerated in adults,and have been introduced since December 2020. 15The Lancet Regional Health - Europe 2022;17: 100393 Published online xxxhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j. lanepe.2022.100393Articles 2 www.thelancet.com Vol 17 Month June, 2022Post-authorization studies conrmed their major impact on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics,16with very few serious adverse events reported to date.17,18Israel reported a risk of post-mRNA vaccine myocarditis of 1.76 per 100,000 individual, mainly affecting young males.19In children, the immunogenicity, efcacy, as well as frequency of adverse events have been assessedin trials involving thousands of 12-17-year-old chil- dren. 20Based on these studies, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European MedicinesAgency (EMA) authorized formulations of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for ages 12-17-year. However, rare serious adverse events following immunization couldnot be detected by these clinical trials, which were not designed to assess the risk of rare hyper-inflammatory complications. Especially, whether exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens due to mRNA vaccine can induce MIS-C is unknown. Given the lower burden of S ARS-CoV-2 related dis- eases in children compared to adults, elucidating thesafety prole of mRNA vaccine, especially regarding MIS- C, is of critical interest to establish its benet-risk balance in this population. In this conte xt, monitoring post-vaccine MIS-C has been identied as a priority by the FDA, the EMA, and the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products safety (ANSM). 2123Several cases reports of children with MIS-C follo wing mRNA vaccine recently raised important concerns regarding this potential vac- cine-related adverse event.2427 Using a well-established national pharmacovigilance surveillance system coordinated by ANSM,28,29we aimed to evaluate the potential association of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and subsequent hyper-inflammatorysyndrome in children. Methods Study design and settings We conducted a post-authorization prospective nationalpopulation-based surveillance using the well-established ANSM pharmacovigilance system. 28,29This network is based on 31 regional pharmacovigilance centers, whichcover all the French territory, and is coordinated by ANSM since 1973. 28All ambulatory or hospital-based health practitioners throughout France or patients thatobserve a suspected adverse drug reaction (ADR) report the event to the regional center via a secure platform. 28 Reporting of all ADRs, independently of the seriousness or expectedness, is compulsory for health practitioners. All reports undergo a pharmacological, clinical and bio- logical assessment process by a trained assessor of theRegional Center. All reports are then registered in thenational computerized pharmacovigilance database, centralized at ANSM, to allow anonymized caseResearch in context Evidence before this study We searched PubMed for articles published in English up to February 15, 2022, using the terms \"Multisystem inflammatory in children (MIS-C) is the most severe clinicalentity associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. The pathophysiology of this syndrome remains unclear, and concerns have been raised regarding the possibilitythat exposure to Spike protein antigen with mRNA vac-cines could induce a multisystemic hyper in flammatory response. Several case reports of MIS-C following mRNA vaccines involving children of adults have beenreported, and a recent surveillance investigation from USA reported several cases of MIS-C in children who received a COVID-19 vaccine. Population-based phar-macovigilance studies are required to assess this riskand compare it to the rate of post SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C. Added value of this study Using a French national post-authorization pharmacovi- gilance study, we identi ed 12 children aged 12 to 17 years old who developed a hyper in flammatory syn- drome following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, with a multi-systemic involvement. In 8 cases, no evidence ofprevious SARS-CoV-2 infection was found. 10 out of 12 cases displayed a cardiac involvement . We observed a male predominance (10/12, 83% of cases), as reportedfor rate was 1.5 (95%CI [0.8; 2.6]) per 1,000,000 doses injected, i.e. 2.9 [1.5; 5.1]) per 1,000,000 12 17-year-old As a comparison, 113 MIS-C (95%CI [95;135]) occurred per 1,000,000 12 17-year-old children infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the same population. Clinical features (hepatic involvement, in flammatory parame- ters, cytopenia) slightly differed from post-SARS-CoV-2MIS-C, along with short-term outcomes (less PICU trans- fer than MIS-C). Implications of all the available evidence This study shows that very few cases of hyper-in flam- matory syndrome, with multisystemic involvement, may be observed after COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in chil-dren. The incidence of this event, compared to the rate of MIS-C following SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same age-group population, may help policy makers estimat-ing the bene t-risk balance of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in children. Large pharmacovigilance studies from other countries are required to precisely determine the role of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in this syndrome, and to delin-eate the clinical spectrum of this entity compared topost-SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C.Articles www.thelancet.com Vol 17 Month June, 2022 3reviewing at a national level by ANSM and experts in the eld, drug causality assessment, and to recommend specic measures if required.29The detailed methodol- ogy of this French pharmacovigilance system has been previously published.28,29 As part of the national COVID-19 vaccination cam- paign, ANSM had put in place a specic reinforced pas-sive and active surveillance system to provide real-time monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines ADRs at a national level. 23,30This is part of the risk management plan coor- dinated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The objectives are to carry out a continuous assessment of the safety of vaccines COVID-19 vaccines in order toconrm their safety or to quickly take the relevant meas- ures, and to allow the Health Ministry to adapt the vacci- nation strategy, if necessary. For each marketed COVID-19 vaccine, two to ve regional pharmacovigilance cen-ters have been designated to gather and assess on a daily basis all adverse drug reactions reported following immunization. An expert of the organ involved is soli-cited to analyze all reported cases every week, to identify atypical and/or serious patterns leading to potential safety signals. 23Then a weekly meeting involving ANSM and all regional pharmacovigilance centers is organized to discuss the expert pharmacovigilance reports, potential safety signals, and new data from theliterature, in order to conrm or not safety signals. 23,30 A complete report including the synopsis of these meet- ing are published by ANSM every two weeks.23,30If a national safety signal is validated, appropriate measuresare issued in relation with European Medicine Agency to prevent or reduce the likelihood of the risk occurring in vaccinated people. The detailed methodology of thisspecic COVID-19 vaccine monitoring is available elsewhere. 23,30 Cases review to assess WHO criteria for MIS-C All paediatric cases of inflammatory syndrome, fever >3 days, shock, or acute organ dysfunction without any obvious cause, occurring any time after COVID- 19 mRNA vaccine injection in children under18 years of age in France reported to the surveillancesystem from June 15 th,2 0 2 1 ,t oJ a n u a r y1st,2 0 2 2 , were eligible. Each case was reviewed by a multidis- ciplinary committee, with experts in pediatric immu-nization, pediatric infectious diseases, pediatric rheumatology, immunology and internal medicine, pediatric intensive care, pediatric cardiology, andexpert pharmacologists from pharmacovigilance cen- involved in MIS-C sur- veillance and management in France as part of theFrench MIS-C consortium, and developed specic expertise in this eld. 5,31,32Medical records were obtained for all cases to accurately assess if cases ful-lled WHO criteria for MIS-C, with COVID-19mRNA vaccine exposure replacing SARS-CoV-2exposure criteria, as indicated by recent Brighton Collaboration denition guidelines. 33Cases were included after reviewing if they fullled WHO MIS-C criteria, with a delay between the last vaccine administration and disease onset <2 months, based on available data from the literature regarding thedelay between SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-Conset. 46An important part of the vaccine causality assessment relied on identifying other potential causes for the event.33,34For hyper-inflammatory syn- drome, extensive investigation of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 over the past two months was criti- cal, and relied on investigating history of docu-mented infection, and performing nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-Nucleocapsid (anti-N) serology. 33,35 have been intro- duced for 12 17-year-old children on June 15th, 2021 in France.36It has been followed by mRNA-1273 approval for same age children on July, 27th, 2021.36A higher risk of myocarditis or pericarditis has been suggestedfollowing mRNA-1273 compared to BNT162b2 in adults younger than 30 years old. 37This has led French author- ities to prioritize BNT162b2 for 12 17-year-old children immunization. Thus, by January 1st, 2022, the large majority of vaccinated 12 17-year-old children received BNT162b2 ( >95%).32 Outcome measure The main outcome was the national reporting rate of hyper-inflammatory syndrome following COVID-19mRNA vaccine per 1,000,000 doses in 12-17-year-old children in France. To calculate national reporting rate, we used as a denominator the total number of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose administered in 12-17-year-old children over the study period (available at https://solid arites-sante.gouv.fr/grands-dossiers/vaccin-covid-19/article/le-tableau-de-bord-de-la-vaccination ). We also analyzed the reporting rate of hyper-inflammatory syn- drome following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine per 1,000,000 12-17-year-old vaccinated children in France. Then, we estimated in the same age-group, in the same population, the rate of post-SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C cases per 1,000,000 infections in 12-17-year-old chil-dren in France for comparison. Secondary outcomes were the reporting rate of hyper-inflammatory syndrome following rst and sec-ond injections of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in 12-17- year-old children in France, reporting rate by sex, and comparison of clinical features of hyper-inflammatorysyndrome following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine versuspost-SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C cases.Articles 4 www.thelancet.com Vol 17 Month June, 2022MIS-C following SARS-CoV-2 infection surveillance system To estimate the rate of post-SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C cases per 1,000,000 infections in 12-17-year-old children in France, we used data from the French COVID-19 Pedi- atric Inflammation Consortium, coordinated by Publichealth France. 5,31,32As previously published, since April 2020, all suspected MIS-C cases in France were manda- torily reported to Public health France. Each suspected case was then assessed following WHO criteria for MIS-C. 5,31,32Furthermore, Public health France also con- ducted seroprevalence studies that allowed estimating the proportion of 12-17-year-old old children infected bySARS-CoV-2 since the beginning of the pandemic. 38 Thus, to estimate the rate of post-SARS-CoV-2 MIS-Ccases per 1,000,000 infections, we used as a numeratorthe number of conrmed 12-17-year-old MIS-C casesreported to Public health France since the start of the pandemic, and as a denominator the estimated number of 12-17-year-old French children infected by SARS-CoV-2 since the start of the pandemic, based on Public health France estimations. 38To avoid any bias in MIS-C rate estimation due to vaccine implementation,32we restricted this analysis to the pre-vaccine period, i.e. from the start of the pandemic to June 15th, 2021. This surveillance system also collected clinico-biolog- ical and short term outcome data of MIS-C cases that fullled WHO criteria.5,31,32Thus, to compare the clini- cal presentation of hyper-inflammatory syndrome fol-lowing COVID-19 mRNA vaccine to post-SARS-CoV-2MIS-C cases in the same population, we included all unvaccinated 12-17-year-old MIS-C cases fullling WHO criteria with available clinical les as same-age andsame-population comparator group. Statistical analysis We describe patient characteristics with numbers (per-centages) for categorical variables and median (inter-quartile range [IQR]) for quantitative variables. We compared clinical and biological characteristics using non-parametric Fisher's exact test for categorical varia-bles and Mann-Whitney U test for quantitative varia-bles. A two-sided p-value <0.05 was considered statistically signicant. Reporting rate of hyper-inflam- matory syndrome was expressed as cases per 1,000,000vaccine injections with 95% CIs. All statistical analyses involved using R v3.6.1 ( http://www.R-project.org ). Ethics For the pharmacovigilance surveillance system, this study was performed according to the authorization from the National Commission on Informatics and Lib- erty (CNIL) n \u00b02014-302 for the national lance database done by ANSM. For the MIS-C followingSARS-CoV-2 infection surveillance system, the studywas approved by the INSERM ethics committee for eval- uation (IRB00003888). A written information form val- idated by the ethics committee was given to allparticipants. Oral consent was obtained from study par- ticipants; no family members or participants refused to participate. Results From June 15th, 2021 to January 1st, 2022, 8,113,058COVID-19 mRNA vaccine doses were administered to 4,079,234 12-17-year-old children in France (including 4,079,234 rst injections, 3,905,636 second injections,and 128,188 third injections). Over this period, 2,028 adverse drug reactions related to COVID-19 mRNA vac- cine have been reported to the pharmacovigilance cen-ters in 12-17-year-old children. Among them, 102 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis (including 78 (76%) males), and 12 cases of hyper-inflammatory syndromewere reported. All hyper-inflammatory syndrome casesfullled WHO criteria for MIS-C ( Table 1 ). Ten cases involved BNT162b2 vaccine and 2 cases involved mRNA-1273. Six cases occurred following the rst injec-tion, and 6 following the second injection. As for myo- carditis and pericarditis, a male predominance was also observed in these hyper-inflammatory syndromes (10/12 cases, 83%). The delay between last injection and dis- ease onset ranged from 1 day to 42 days. Investigation of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection All 12 cases had complete data for history of docu-mented infection, nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR, and anti-N serology. In one case, a previous infection 7months before disease onset was reported, but was too far apart to be considered as linked to the disease. All children had negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR, and four chil-dren had a positive anti-N serology ( Table 1 ). In 8 cases, no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was found (details Table 1 ). The clinical and biological details of cases depending on SARS-CoV-2 anti Nucleo-capsid serology is provided Table S1. National reporting rate of hyper-in flammatory syndrome following mRNA vaccine Considering all 12 cases of hyper-inflammatory syn- drome, a national reporting rate of 1.5 (95% CI [0.8;2.6]) per 1,000,000 mRNA vaccine doses administered in 12-17-year-old children was observed. Excluding cases for which evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infectionhas been found, the reporting rate was reduced to 1.0 (95% CI [0.4; 1.9]) per 1,000,000 mRNA vaccine doses administered. This reporting rate was similar followingthe rst and the second mRNA vaccine injections(Table 2 ).

This rare serious adverse event should be put in balance with the rate of post-SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C in the same age group in the same population, which was much higher. Two recent studies highlighted that COVID-19 mRNA vaccine may signi-cantly reduce the incidence of post-SARS-CoV-2 MIS- C. 32,40Taken together, these ndings suggest that the benet-risk balance of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine islargely in favor of the vaccination in this age group, in acontext of active circulation of SARS-CoV-2. An important issue is to delineate the clinical spec- trum of this entity, which may have overlap with severalother diseases. First, an increased risk of myocarditishas been reported following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, especially in young men. 19,41These myocarditis mainly occurred after the second dose of vaccine, few days after the injection, and were rapidly resolutive in most cases.19,41The male predominance was also observed in post vaccine myocarditis occurring in 12-17 years old French population (78/102 cases, 76%). These charac- teristics echo to the male observed in ourstudy among children with hyper-inflammatory syn- drome following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (10/12 cases, 83%), as well as the important rate of cardiacinvolvement (10/12 cases, 83%). On the other hand, myocarditis were classically afebrile, with inflam- matory parameters, and were a mono-organ involve-ment. 41These major clinical differences may allow distinguishing these two entities, that however could possibly represent a continuum. Second, all cases of hyper-inflammatory syndrome following COVID-19mRNA vaccine fullled WHO denition for mRNA vaccine (N=12)MIS-C post SARS-CoV-2 infection (N=199)P value 159 (80%) Shock (89%) 0.833 organ Cytolytic hepatitis 36 0.016Lymphadenopathy 3 (25%) 39 (20%) 0.721Renal failure 2 (72%) 0.008Hemodynamic support 3 (25%) 86 (43%) 0.24 stay 7.0 [6.8; 9.0] 8.0 [6.0; 11.0] 0.719 Table 3 : Comparison clinic-biological features of hyper-in flammatory syndrome following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and MIS-C post SARS-CoV-2 infection in France.

Biological parameter s were at admission, except for CRP, which is the maximal value during the hospitalization. Abbreviations: MIS-C: multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.Articles www.thelancet.com Vol 17 June, 2022 11Indeed, the prolonged hyper-inflammatory state, the multi-organ involvement and the severity of the disease are principal features of these two entities,8indicating at least a major overlap. However, if statistical compari- son between these two diseases was limited by the low number of cases, and should be interpreted with cau-tion, our ndings suggest that post-SARS-CoV-2 MIS-Cmay have still higher inflammatory parameters, and more cytopenia. This may be in line with the signi- cantly lower rate of PICU transfer (33% vs 72%) forhyper-inflammatory syndrome following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine cases, which might reflect a less severe immune storm and disease course. Notably, a 4-weekdelay has been observed in the context of MIS-C follow- ing SARS-CoV-2 infection. 4244Here, the delay from rst antigen exposure to hyper-inflammatory syndromeoccurred within a week in 3 patients and after 4 12 weeks in the 9 others. In the cases with early reaction, a hypereosinophilia was seen in 2 patients, a feature not seen in classical MIS-C. This observation might reflectimmunoallergic reaction distinct from the superanti- genic like features of MIS-C. Expansion of Vb21.3 expressing T cells is a hallmark of the MIS-C and can beeasily assessed by flowcytometry. 12By contrast, the two children with post-vaccination hyper-inflammatory syn- drome had no expansion of this T cell subset. Takentogether, these clinical and immunological divergences may imply distinct underlying pathways and further studies are required to expand this nding. Third, arecent study coordinated by the CDC reported cases ofmultisystem inflammatory system in adults (MIS-A) in USA, in vaccinated and unvaccinated adults. 35Twenty cases were identied, of whom seven were vaccinated.However, all of them had a documented previous expo- sure to SARS-CoV-2, questioning the direct causal role of mRNA vaccines in these manifestations, and divergingwith the pediatric syndrome reported here, with only 4/ 12 patients presenting a seropositivity to N antigen. The issue of delineating these different entities underline theneed to extensively investigate cases of hyper-inflamma- tory syndromes following mRNA vaccines, especially by performing anti-S and anti-N serology, along with explo-ration for TRBV11-2/Vb21.3 expansion. Because this hyper-inflammatory syndrome follow- ing COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was severe with acute multi-organ dysfunction, therapeutic aspects are ofmajor interest. In this cohort, most children were treated by an association of immunoglobulins plus methylprednisolone, following MIS-C therapeutic pro-tocols. 31Only one child treated with this combination required a therapeutic escalation, and received a methyl- prednisolone pulse (10mg/kg/day). All children fullyrecovered. If sample size precludes any denitive con-clusion, these ndings suggest that the association of immunoglobulins plus methylprednisolone may be a suitable approach while awaiting more evidence regard-ing these treatments.Several limitations should be discussed. First, a causal association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and hyper-inflammatory syndrome could not beasserted. Indeed, despite extensive investigation for pre- vious SARS-CoV-2 infection in all cases, pauci or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections are frequent inchildren, and may not have been documented. Further-more, false negatives can be observed for anti-Nucleo- capsid serology. 45Thus, we cannot exclude that some of the cases reported here could be related to undiagnosedSARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, an important step in assessing vaccine related adverse events is to compare them to the rate of the disease in unvaccinatedpopulations, as it was done for myocarditis. Because this entity has not been previously described in healthy populations, we could not have a control population toestimate the expected incidence of this disease in unvac-cinated children. In addition, as this event is very rare, large population-based pharmacovigilance studies from other countries are required to precise the role ofCOVID-19 mRNA vaccine in this syndrome. 17Second, we cannot rule out under reporting of adverse drug events in our population, which may have biased theestimated rate of hyper-inflammatory syndrome. How- ever, following the implementation of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, a major effort has been made by allpharmacovigilance centers to publicize that the report- ing of any suspected adverse drug reaction following these vaccines was mandatory. 28The impressive num- ber of suspected adverse drug reaction reports(>80,000 between January 2021 and January 2022 in France) suggest that underreporting may have been very rare, especially for serious adverse drug reactions. 28 In France, national guidelines recommend any sus- pected MIS-C case to be hospitalized, making the possi- bility of underreporting due to ambulatory care of hyperinflammatory syndrome unlikely .Third, given the very low proportion of 12-17-year-old children vaccinated by mRNA-1273 ( <5%), we could not provide an accurate estimation of the risk of hyper-inflammatory syndromes according to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine type. Further studies are required to explore if this risk differ betweenBNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. Fourth, because mRNAvaccines were only recommended to 12 17-year-old chil- dren in France until December 2021, we could not explore the risk of hyper-inflammatory syndrome inyounger children. Conclusion In this study, we identied cases of hyper-inflammatorysyndrome following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in 12-17-year-old children in France, with multisystemic involvement. This syndrome was very rare, and its reporting rate, in comparison with the rate of MIS-C fol-lowing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same age-group,largely supports the vaccination in a context of anArticles 12 www.thelancet.com Vol 17 Month June, 2022important circulation of SARS-CoV-2. This syndrome shared many clinical features with post-SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C, but some clinical, immunological and short-term outcomes divergences call for further studies to explore its specic pathway.
