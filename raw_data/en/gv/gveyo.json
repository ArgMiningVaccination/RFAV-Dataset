Previous reports have shown that the interaction between helium and vacancies leads to the formation of cavities for medium energy (e.g., 20 -100 keV) implants. However, the role of certain factors, such as the proximity of the surface, the damage created by the implant, and the effect ofthe implant temperature, is not well understood for low energy implants. This study explored a new regime of ultralow energy, elevated temperature implants in order to offer an insight into the effect of these parameters. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that cavity formation wasavoided for 0.5 keV, 450 \u00b0C implants up to a dose of 8 \u00d7 10 16cm2. However, extended defects in the form of {311} ribbon-like defects and stacking faults were observed. Quantitative TEM showed that the number of interstitials in these defects was less than 0.2% of the implant dose. In addition,thermal helium desorption spectrometry suggested that only 2% of the implanted He dose was retained in interstitial He and He mVncomplexes. A rst-order dissociation kinetic model was applied to assess desorption from He mVn, which closely matched energies predicted by density functional theory. This population of excess vacancies and excess interstitials was possibly formed because of incomplete Frenkel pair recombination. Raman spectroscopy showed that the stress from the implant was dominated by the stress from the interstitial-type defects. The evolution of the stressand defects was also explored as a function of post-implant annealing. Published by AIP Publishing. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5046096 I. INTRODUCTION High-dose, medium-energy He implants in Si are known to result in the formation of He bubbles.1Upon high tempera- ture annealing, these bubbles outgas He and grow into larger cavities via either migration and coalescence2,3or an Ostwald-ripening process.4,5Many studies have explored the morphology and of these cavities,5which have interstitial populations.12,13 Cavity formation is believed to occur because of the inter- action between He and vacancies. Due to its low solubility inSi, He is energetically driven to occupy sites with the largest available free volume. When He is introduced into Si by ion implantation, elastic collisions generate a large number ofvacancies and self-interstitials. These point defects are mobile even at room temperature in Si and will either recombine with one another or form larger defect clusters. Helium will prefer-entially occupy vacancy clusters, and multiple He atoms can be accommodated within these vacancy clusters, 14leading to the formation of He mVncomplexes of varying sizes. These clusters are precursors to larger He bubbles. HemVnclusters could be used as a source of vacancies for improving dopant activation. Modern devices may requiredopant activation levels in excess of their solid solubilities in Si, and it is often not possible to use dopant activation methodssuch as melting or solid-phase epitaxial regrowth with 3Ddevice architectures. 15Vacancy engineering approaches are needed, and He may be able to disrupt self-interstitial-vacancyrecombination in favor of excess vacancies. Because of the strong interaction of He with the point defects generated by the implantation process, changes to the implant conditions can have a dramatic effect on the defect structures that are generated. Elevated temperature He implantshave been shown to result in different defect structures com-pared to room temperature implants. 16-20A lower density of larger He bubbles is formed at moderate implant temperatures(e.g., 200 -600 \u00b0C), while bubble formation is entirely sup- pressed at higher implant temperatures. 19Extended defects have also been observed in the form of {311} rod- and ribbon-like defects and dislocation loops. 19This range of defects reflects the complex kinetics of the atomic processes involved, which include self-interstitial-vacancy recombination, pointdefect diffusion, and He diffusion, as well as the relative stabil-ities of various defect complexes at different temperatures. Previous studies of elevated temperature He implants were completed for implant energies greater than 20 keV.This results in projected ranges in excess of 200 nm due to the light mass of He. There have been few studies on low energy implantation of He into Si. 21,22The proximity of the surface is expected to play a role in He implantationa)Author to whom correspondence should be addressed: kschuller@u fl.eduJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 124, 165708 (2018) 0021-8979/2018/124(16)/165708/7/$30.00 124, 165708-1 Published by AIP Publishing. dynamics, as it can act as a sink for either self-interstitials or vacancies, as well as He desorption. In addition, lower energy implants generate fewer Frenkel pairs per ion, whichis likely to impact their interaction with He. In this study, the defect evolution of ultralow energy, elevated temperature He implants is investigated. Cavity for-mation and other defect structures are found to vary widely from their corresponding higher energy implants. The dynamics of He and point defect interactions is explored,which offers some insight into the evolution of Frenkel pairs in the absence of excess interstitials that are typically gener- ated by implanting dopant species. II. EXPERIMENT He+was implanted into n-type Czochralski-grown (100) Si at 450 \u00b0C using an implantation energy of 0.5 keV. Doseswere varied from 5 \u00d7 10 15to 8 \u00d7 1016cm2and beam currents of approximately 4 mA were used. Both rapid thermal anneals (RTA) and furnace anneals were investigated for temperaturesbetween 500 \u00b0C and 1000 \u00b0C under an Ar ambient. Damage evolution was monitored by cross-section and plan-view transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cross-sections were prepared with a focused ion beam using standard methods. Self-supported plan-view samples were prepared by coring 3-mm discs, which were then polishedand etched from the backside to obtain regions of electron transparency. TEM characterization was performed on an FEI Tecnai F20 microscope using [110] zone axis imaging condi-tions for the cross-sections and g 220weak beam dark eld (WBDF) imaging conditions for the plan-view samples. Raman spectroscopy was used to determine stress in the implanted region. Spectra were collected on an Horiba Aramis microRaman system with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. This wavelength has a penetration depth of approxi-mately 10 nm, which closely matches the depth of the implants investigated. Thermal helium desorption spectrometry (THDS) was used to measure the desorption of He as a function of tem- perature for a constant ramp rate of 0.5 \u00b0C/s up to 1250 \u00b0C. Released He was measured by a quadrupole mass spectrome-ter. The ultra-high vacuum chamber ( 1\u00d71 0 9Torr) pro- vides a low He background of 2 \u00d7 1010He/s. Measurements were calibrated with a high-precision glass-permeationhelium calibrated leak. III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Depth distributions for He and for Frenkel pairs gener- ated by the implant were calculated using SRIM-2013, a Monte Carlo simulation program.23Results are shown for the 2\u00d71 016cm2dose in Fig. 1. The projected range for He is 8.6 nm with the peak concentration located at 6.8 nm, while the peak of the vacancy distribution is at a depth of 3.6 nm. On average, each He ion generates 8 Frenkel pairs, accordingto SRIM. However, SRIM does not account for thermal effects, such as diffusion or recombination of implanted species or point defects. Thus, this simulation is an estimateof the distribution of Frenkel pairs generated during the implant. It is expected that most of these Frenkel pair defectswill either recombine at the 450 \u00b0C implant temperature or annihilate at the free surface, leaving only a small fraction of the initial point defect population behind. Likewise, somefraction of the interstitial helium will likely diffuse back to the surface and desorb. He bubble formation in Si has been found to be primarily dependent on the local He concentration for room temperature implants. When concentrations exceed 3 (\u00b11) \u00d7 10 20cm3, bubbles have been observed.7Based on the peak concentra- tions of He for the doses in this study, all samples would be expected to form He bubbles if 100% of the implanted helium were retained. However, some fraction is likely to diffuse out atthe high implant temperature. It should also be noted that a sig- nicant portion (21%) of the incident ions are re flected (back- scattered) from the sample without implanting. In addition,sputtering effects are non-neg ligible for the two highest doses. SRIM estimates that approximately 3.1 and 1.6 nm are sput- t e r e df r o mt h es u r f a c ef o rad o s eo f8\u00d71 0 16and 4 \u00d7 1016cm2, respectively. Using an iterative method to account for the moving surface during implantation,24the amount of He lost due to sputtering is estimated to be less than 6% and 3%,respectively. Adjusted ion and vacancy pro les for the highest dose are provided in the supplementary material . TEM cross-sections were prepared for each of the implanted doses, as shown in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 2. No He bubbles were visible, even for the highest doses. However, extended defects were visiblefor doses above 5 \u00d7 10 15cm2. Stacking faults along {111} planes and ribbon-like {311} defects were both observed (Fig. 3). The defect density appear ed to increase proportionally with the dose. The defects were largely present within 30 nm of the surface, corresponding to the damage pro le predicted by SRIM. However, some of the defects were located consider-ably deeper, up to 60 nm beneath the surface. This indicates that the point defects that make up the extended defects were very mobile at the implant temperature and may have nucleatedheterogeneously on an impurity or pre-existing defect. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) ltering was used to inves- tigate the nature of the extended defects. Implant damage istypically interstitial in nature, as explained by the \"plus-one \" model. 25Most interstitial-vacancy pairs recombine during FIG. 1. SRIM simulations for the He distribution and vacancy distribution for a 2 \u00d7 1016He/cm2implant at 0.5 keV.165708-2 Haynes et 124, 165708 (2018)implantation and upon annealing, leaving behind a quantity of interstitials that is approximately equal to the implanted dose. However, He is dynamically removed during elevatedtemperature implant, and the dominant observable defects after He implantation are generally cavities, i.e., large vacancy clusters that may contain He. Therefore, the natureof these extended defects needs to be carefully examined to determine whether it is intrinsic or extrinsic. A representative HRTEM image of a stacking fault and an FFT ltered image are shown in Fig. 4. The lattice fringes clearly bow outward around the stacking fault, indicating that it is made up of an inserted plane of atoms and con rming its extrinsic nature.The fact that cavities were not formed is a departure from higher energy studies that were completed at similar implant temperatures and doses. David and Oliviero observed cavityformation for 50 keV 5 \u00d7 10 16He/cm2implants completed at implant temperatures up to 600 \u00b0C.18,19,26,27Bubble formation did not occur in this study. This may indicate that the proximityof the surface allows He to escape more ef ciently than for a higher energy implant. It could also be related to the lower number of vacancies generated. According to SRIM calcula-tions, a 0.5 keV implant creates about 8 vacancies/ion com- pared to 166 vacancies/ion for a 50 keV implant. Despite this difference in He bubble formation, the interstitial-type defectsobserved are similar to the higher-energy implantation studies, which also noted rod-like defects, ribbon-like defects, and dis- location loops for 600 \u00b0C.

Phys. 124, implantation to a dose of 7 \u00d7 1015He/cm2at implant temperatures above 300 \u00b0C.20 THDS revealed two desorption peaks, as shown in the results for the 8 \u00d7 1016cm2dose of Fig. 5. A higher intensity peak was centered at 65 \u00b0C, while a lower intensity peak was centered at 300 \u00b0C. Both desorption peaks have been previ- ously observed and have been attributed to interstitial He22,28 and He mVntraps,1,22,29respectively. There was no desorption peak between 700 \u00b0C and 1200 \u00b0C as would be expected ifthere were He bubbles present. The total retained He dose (as determined from the integrated THDS signal) was determined to be 1.3 \u00d7 10 15cm2for the 8 \u00d7 1016cm2dose. This repre- sents approximately 2% of the implanted He dose. The total retained He is observed to increase with increasing implanta- tion dose. For example, retained doses of 1.8% and 1.2% werecalculated for \u00d7 1016cm2doses, respec- tively. Values for the lower dose samples were not determined, as the detection sensitivity of the THDS was reached at lowerimplanted helium contents. For the highest dose of 8 \u00d7 10 16cm2, approximately 80% of the retained He is associated with the lower temperaturedesorption peak, while the remaining 20% is associated with the higher temperature desorption peak. For the lower dose samples, a larger fraction of the retained dose is associated withthe higher temperature peak. For example, the 2 \u00d7 10 16cm2 dose has approximately 60% retained He in the lower tempera- ture desorption peak and 40% in th e higher temperature desorp- tion peak. The retained doses are much lower than have been observed for higher energy He implants at similar implanttemperatures. For example, Oliviero observed 65% and 25% helium retention for 400 \u00b0C and 500 \u00b0C implants at 50 keV, respectively. 18At higher implantation energies (and tempera- tures), helium retained in cavities, which have a charac- teristic desorption temperature between 700 and 1200 \u00b0C. This means that the retained helium could only desorb attemperatures higher than the implantation temperature. In the case of the ultralow energy implants in this study, He is observed to predominately desorb below the implantationtemperature of 450 \u00b0C. The traps that are associated with these low temperature peaks are not effective in trapping He at the implant temperature. This implies that, after the samplehas cooled to room temperature following the implant, only the residual He that has been unable to diffuse out of the Si has been retained. Evidently, there is something uniqueabout the low energy implant that prevents He mVnclusters from reaching the critical size necessary to form larger cavi- ties. Again, it is likely this is related to the proximity of thesurface or the lower number of vacancies generated compared to a higher energy implant. Desorption of He from Si is often modeled as a rst- order kinetic reaction. By tting the THDS data with such a model, the activation energies associated with the two dis- tinct desorption processes can be estimated. The rate ofdesorption is given by dN dt\u00bc/C0Nexp/C0E kT/C18/C19 , (1) where Nis the number of He atoms remaining in the sample, is the attempt frequency, Eis the activation energy, kis the Boltzmann constant, and Tis the temperature. Extracting a value for the activation energy requires knowledge of theattempt frequency. The attempt frequency for He desorbing from Si has been observed to be much lower than the expected Debye frequency (1 \u00d7 10 13s1).1,29Corni et al. cal- culated that it lies in the range of 3.3 \u00d7 107-1.7 \u00d7 109s1. This range was used in subsequent calculations in this work. It was found that the high temperature peak (around 300 \u00b0C) is not well t by a single activation energy. As shown by Corni et al. , it is more accurately modeled by a dis- tribution of activation energies.29This fact re flects that there is a range of energies required to dissociate from various sizes of He mVnclusters. Using binding energies determined from density function theory,14it can be shown that the acti- vation energy distribution might be modeled as a normal dis- tribution (see supplementary material ). A best- t desorption prole calculated from this model is overlaid on the mea- sured desorption data in Fig. 5. The mean of the distribution of activation energies was found to lie in the range of 1.10 - 1.28 eV, depending on the choice of the attempt frequency,while the standard deviation was 0.17 -0.20 eV. These values align quite well with those predicted for He mVnby density functional theory, which result in a mean of 1.06 eV and astandard deviation of 0.17. 14 The activation energy for the low temperature peak was determined to lie between 0.59 and 0.69 eV, which also corre-sponds remarkably well with the activation energy determined by Pizzagalli for interstitial migration of He (0.68 eV). 30This desorption peak has only been previously observed for lowenergy helium implants. 21,22An explanation can be proposed for this unique occurrence. The He remaining at the end of the implant is \"frozen \"into the nearest low-energy positions, which includes a signi cant portion on interstitial sites. Upon heating during THDS measurement, the interstitial He will FIG. 5. THDS for an 8 \u00d7 1016He/cm2implant at 0.5 keV and 450 \u00b0C. A constant ramp rate of 0.5 \u00b0C/s was used. The line is a calculation for the expected desorption based on a rst-order kinetic model with a distribution of activation energies. (Inset) The low temperature desorption peak for the same sample.165708-4 Haynes et al. J. Appl. Phys. 124, 165708 (2018)diffuse along tetrahedral-hexagonal sites, and some He will reach the surface without becoming trapped. This process isvery unlikely for higher energy implants, in which interstitial He is likely to become trapped by the high density of vacan- cies, He mVnclusters, or He bubbles that lie between the pro- jected range of He and the Si surface. This theory is supported by the literature. Corni et al. observed a delay time for isothermal desorption of He, which could only beexplained by interstitial He trapping and detrapping from vacancy-like defects. 31This supports the idea that interstitial He is present for higher energy implants as well, but it isunlikely to reach the surface without becoming trapped. Stress evolution as a function of increasing He dose was studied using Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy haspreviously been used to quantify stress in H- and He-implanted Si. 32,33In these earlier works, the resulting stress was tied to the size and morphology of the sphericalnanobubbles or platelets that are formed. No such bubbles were formed by the implants in this study. In addition, muchof the initial He dose has diffused out of the material. Therefore, by elimination, any stress must be closely associ-ated with the extended defects and defect clusters created by the implant. The primary Raman-active peak for Si is a three-fold degenerate longitudinal optical (LO) mode at 520.7 cm 1. Under stress, this peak splits and a peak shift is induced. Assuming a biaxial stress state, the magnitude of the in-planestress is linearly related to the magnitude of the frequency shiftby (MPa) \u00bc/C0250/C1(cm /C01), (2) as has been derived elsewhere.34From this equation, it can be seen that a compressive stress will induce an increase in the Raman frequency while a tensile stress will induce a decrease. Using a tting procedure, the peak position can be determined within approximately 0.1 cm1, allowing the detection of stresses as low as 25 MPa. FIG. 6. (a) Raman spectra for the as-implanted samples show increasing blue shifts with increasing He dose. (b) Compressive stresses were calculated from the magnitude of the peak shift. Error bars are 95% con dence intervals based on multiple measurements across a single sample. FIG. 7. (a) Raman spectra for the 8 \u00d7 1016cm2implant following RTA spike anneals at temperatures from 500 to 1000 \u00b0C. (b) Stresses calculated from the magnitude of the peak shifts following annealing for three of the implant doses.165708-5 Haynes et al. J. Appl. Phys. 124, 165708 (2018)Raman spectra for the as-implanted samples are shown in Fig. 6. A Gaussian-Lorentzian tting procedure was used to determine the peak position. The LO peak shifted tohigher Raman frequencies with He implantation. The stress increased monotonically with increasing dose, up to a maximum value of 1 GPa for the 8 \u00d7 10 16cm2dose. The full-width at half-maximum of the peaks also increased with He dose, which can be attributed to the lattice disorder created by the implant. Generally, self-interstitial defect clusters are expected to induce compressive stresses, while vacancy defect clusters should induce tensile stresses. Given the different con gura- tions taken by interstitial and vacancy clusters as well as the variety of cluster sizes that are likely to be present, it is not pos- sible to deduce the relative concentrations of interstitials andvacancies from these stress measurements. However, it appears that the compressive stresses induced by the interstitial-type defects dominate the overall stress of the system. Stress was also monitored as a function of annealing temperature for spike anneals performed between 500 \u00b0C and 1000 \u00b0C. The Raman spectra for the 8 \u00d7 10 16cm2dose are shown in Fig. 7. For this dose, the Raman peak position remained relatively constant around 524.0 cm1until the 800 \u00b0C anneal. At this point, the peak shifted back toward theunstrained peak position but never fully reached the unstressed state. This is roughly the temperature at which self-interstitial-type defects are known to evolve followingimplantation, 35which supports the theory that the stress state is closely tied to the defect clusters. Furthermore, as shown by the THDS results of Fig. 6, the majority of the retained He has desorbed by 800 \u00b0C. A similar shift in peak position was noted for the lower dose samples but with smaller mag- nitude shifts toward the unstressed state. Samples were also annealed for longer times at 750 \u00b0C and 900 \u00b0C in a furnace in order to observe the evolution of the extended defects. WBDF images obtained using the g220 condition are shown in Fig. 8. After a 15 min anneal at 750 \u00b0C, the defects appeared to be primarily category I loops that evolved from the flux of interstitials from dissolved {311}-type defects.36There were no loops visible in the 5 \u00d7 1015cm2 sample. Quantitative analysi s of multiple anneal times gested that the as-implanted interstitial population was less than0.2% of the generated interstitial population across the dose series and that the interstitial population increased in proportion with the dose. After a separate 20 min 900 \u00b0C anneal (notshown), the dislocation loops had coarsened and decreased density.IV. CONCLUSIONS High dose (5 \u00d7 1015-8\u00d71 016cm2), ultralow energy (0.5 keV) implants of He into Si were performed at 450 \u00b0C.The nature of the low energy implants was found to be differ- ent from higher energy implants performed at similar temper- atures. No cavities were formed, and approximately 98% ofthe helium was shown to have desorbed during the implant. THDS analysis revealed that the retained He was likely present as interstitial impurities (60% -80%) and in He mVn complexes (20% A rst-order dissociation kinetic model t to the THDS data indicated that the activation ener- gies associated with desorption from the He mVncomplexes closely matched energies predicted by density functional theory. TEM analysis also revealed {311} ribbon-like defects as well as stacking faults. These extended defects evolvedinto dislocation loops with further annealing. Stress analysis with Raman spectroscopy con rmed that the interstitial-type defects dominated the stress state of the implanted region,even after annealing. These results suggest that the proximity of the surface or the number of Frenkel pairs generated by the implants may play an important role in the defect evolu-tion, changing the dynamics of the interaction between He and point defects.
