She continues to use her teaching skills to empower her clients on their health journeys. Her homeopathic journey began when her youngest daughter was diagnosed with a chronic condition. While searching for alternative treatments, she was fascinated by how effective and gentle homeopathy was when taken. \"Our first homeopath was Dr. Ber. I was fascinated by the tiny bottles of liquids, the types of random, but very specific questions he asked and how the medicines we used worked so gently but powerfully. I wanted to learn more, so I went back to school and eventually became a certified homeopath. \"Suesan Johnson, Homeopath Call us for an appointment today: (602)307-0888 Fax (602)307-1002 Homeopathic Success Stories... I have had the privilege to walk beside my clients in their health journey. There was the young woman who was struggling to carry a baby to full term. After several miscarriages, she reached out to me. Within a few months, she was again pregnant. I am happy to say \u2014 they just celebrated their second Father's Day. Another young lady was referred by a friend. She struggled with depression and anxiety. She was on medication but it was no longer working for her. She is much improved, medication free, and learning new tools to deal with her stress and emotions including her past traumas. An older gentleman was referred to me for depression and lack of motivation. The only time he got out of bed was to come in for his acupuncture treatment. He stayed in bed drank pots of coffee and soda. His wife would bring his food to him in bed. We worked together for a period of time. He now is off riding his motorcycle and working out. We hardly see him anymore, because as he says, \"he is too busy to make an appointment\". Being a homeopath is bitter sweet \u2014 I really care for my patients, but I know my work is done when they no longer need me and are able to live their lives to the fullest, free from the restrictions of their limiting symptoms. What is Homeopathy/How Does it Work? Homeopathy is a system of holistic medicine which seeks to stimulate the body's own healing mechanisms to correct the underlying imbalance itself. This is different than Allopathic medicine which tends to more lean towards pharmaceuticals and surgery. Call us for an appointment "}
