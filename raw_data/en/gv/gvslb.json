They should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior and should not be reported in news media as established information. Preprints posted online allow authors to receive rapid feedback and the entire scientific community can appraise the work for themselves and respond appropriately. Those comments are posted alongside the preprints for anyone to read them and serve as a post publication assessment. Effectiveness of Covishield vaccine in preventing Covid-19 -- A test-negative case-control study was aimed at assessing the [vaccine effectiveness](VE) of [Covishield], which is identical to the in preventing [laboratory]-confirmed Covid-19. MethodsUsing a test-negative case-control design, information on [vaccination]status of cases with Covid-19 among [healthcare workers]in our institution in Puducherry, [India], and an equal number of matched controls, i.e., positive and negative for [SARS-CoV-2]by RT-PCR, was obtained. The cases and controls were matched for age ({+/-}3 years) and date of testing ({+/-}3 days). The groups were compared using multivariable conditional calculate [odds ratios](OR), with [adjustment]for [gender], [role], presence of symptoms and presence of a [comorbidity]condition. Per cent [vaccine effectiveness](VE) was calculated as 100 x (1-adjusted [odds ratio]). ResultsUsing data from 360 case-control pairs, VE of one [dose]and of two doses, in providing [protection]against Covid-19 was 49% (95% CI 17%-68%) and 54% (27%-71%), respectively. In view of a difference in the proportion of cases and controls [who]had symptoms, a separate [analysis]of data from 203 pairs where both the case and the control had symptoms was done, which showed VE of 58% (28%-75%) and 64% (38%-78%) after one [dose]and two doses, respectively. Among cases with moderately severe [disease]that required [oxygen] [therapy], VE ConclusionCovishield [vaccine]protected significantly against Covid-19, with the [protection]after two doses being slightly higher than after one [dose], and a particularly high [protection]rate against severe forms of Full ...
