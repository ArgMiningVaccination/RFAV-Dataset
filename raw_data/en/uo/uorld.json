And believe it or not, it isn't limited to human beings. Since everything is energy, you can cleanse your home, workplace, objects you own, or places you spend time in \u2014 anything that you sense no longer carries a positive vibe. Yet, the most significant benefit of this practice is healing your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual challenges. Spiritual cleansing can help you deal with difficulties in your life in a new way, allowing you to heal the root cause instead of the symptoms. What Is Spiritual Cleansing? It is a type of healing that seeks to identify and cure the spiritual cause of any problem manifesting in your life. Think of this as [energy clearing](https://blog.mindvalley.com/energy-medicine/) \u2014 just like your physical body needs to be cleansed daily, your energy field needs regular spiritual detox. According to Donna Eden, pioneer of energy medicine and trainer of Mindvalley's Energy Medicine Quest, our bodies and psyches are constantly challenged. Unnatural environmental energies, additives in the foods we eat, and even other people's negativity are all ways their harmonies get disturbed. She says, \"All these things throw our energies off, and then we are more susceptible to illness, depression, and confused thinking. So clearing, grounding, and balancing your energies regularly can prevent this and reduce negative impacts on our minds, bodies, and spirits.\" What Does a Spiritual Cleansing Do? Spiritual cleansing is like taking a spiritual shower \u2014 it cleanses your subtle bodies from foreign energies. It can be someone's emotions you've picked up as an [empath](https://blog.mindvalley.com/empath-definition/), toxins, and energy intrusions \u2014 lower vibrational energies. It allows you to eliminate anything that isn't your natural state and no longer serves you on your path. This is how you keep your energies clean, clear, and balanced. How is spiritual cleansing going to take care of life's problems? [Spiritual cleansing](https://managementhelp.org/blogs/spirituality/2011/09/07/rain-and-water-purifying-and-cleansing/) is based on the concept that everything is energy \u2014 humans, thoughts, plants, rocks, light, emotions, animals, space \u2014 everything there is. And energies are in constant interaction, impacting and changing each other. For example, if you are experiencing recurring or persistent challenges (physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual), then you are dealing with the [negative energy](https://blog.mindvalley.com/negative-energy/) of some trauma, unresolved issue, or unfinished business of the past. In other words, it impacts you as the underlying energy you carry throughout your life. Addressing the energetic cause and releasing that negative energy will naturally take care of the challenge and kickstart the healing process. What Can You Use Spiritual Cleansing For? Spiritual cleansing is like energetic hygiene that combines different tools to keep your energy body (or space) clean. You can also use it for: - Getting over a divorce (feelings of hurt, guilt, fear, shame, anger, resentment, and sadness, which manifest in physical problems) - Persistent financial difficulties - Negative energy, bad vibes, or lack of well-being in your home or workplace - Persistent relationship problems - Preparing yourself for doing spiritual work, such as a spiritual retreat or intense meditation - Removing a persistent feeling of negative, heavy energy surrounding you In essence, this practice helps you heal your energy pattern, whether in your health, relationships, career, or finances. Symptoms of Negative Energy If you've ever felt a heaviness or lethargy after an emotionally challenging event, you carry that negativity around. Both strong positive and negative vibes from people, places, or things may influence you if you don't do spiritual cleansing as you allow it to remain in your energy field. Jeffrey Allen, energy healer and trainer of Mindvalley's Duality Quest, explains that no one can harm you if you have your seniority. But you can let their energy in by matching it to yours. Let's look at the most common symptoms of negative energy in your system: - Blaming others - Criticizing yourself and others - Spreading rumors - Having lots of fears - Feeling confused or off - Having jealousy attacks - Experiencing negative thinking loops These symptoms are bidirectional \u2014 when you blame or criticize others, it may cause negative energy in your body. Here are the symptoms of negative energy at home: - Feeling restless and uncomfortable - Having nightmares and poor quality sleep - Experiencing lots of arguments with family members - Having sudden anger attacks - Being unable to focus Learn more: [15 Feng Shui Tips on How to Remove Negative Energy From Your Home](https://blog.mindvalley.com/remove-negative-energy/) Here's what causes negative energy: - A lack of light - Cluttered and messy space - Old or broken furniture - Unpleasant smells How to Do a Spiritual Cleansing In 3 Steps If you suspect that you're harboring negative energy in your life, what do you do?

A simple physical observation can help you discern if you have negative energy. You can also turn to an energy healer to check your aura and [chakras](https://blog.mindvalley.com/7-chakras/). 2. Spiritual analysis Becoming aware of the source of a physical problem is the second step to releasing it. For example, deeply seated pain and anger from a divorce hold the energetic signature of that event [in your cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9384857/). So getting to the root of your challenge will help you heal it for good. 3. Cleanse the energy The last phase involves cleansing energy, removing blockages and negativity, and rebalancing your energy field. You'll quickly see results as you set yourself free from the energetic burdens you carry. How to keep your aura clean Jeffrey explains that if you don't absorb the foreign energy in the first place, you wouldn't need to clear it, so permission is the critical element for it to happen. In other words, you have the seniority to choose the energy inside and outside your aura. And if you happen to pick up the foreign energy, it's because you lowered it or submitted to someone else's seniority. He teaches his students a tool called a \"permission rose\" \u2014 an energetic rose you visualize as a symbol of permission to choose the energy inside your aura. You can use it to cleanse your aura and keep yourself from absorbing foreign energy. How to use it to maintain your energetic boundaries: - Visualize a permission rose about arm's length from your body. Let it indicate that... - You have 100% permission to choose the energy inside your aura; - Others have 100% permission to choose the energy outside your aura; - Your rose is flexible and spring-loaded. It automatically adjusts itself halfway between you and others when they get close; - And other people can get a copy of your permission rose when they meet you.
