[[4]](#cite_note-Salzberg2010-4) [[5]](#cite_note-5) [[6]](#cite_note-jez-6) [[7]](#cite_note-Dal-7) The organization was established in 2005 by Lisa and J.B. Handley. Today, Generation Rescue is known as a platform for [Jenny McCarthy](/wiki/Jenny_McCarthy)'s autism related [anti-vaccine](/wiki/Vaccine_hesitancy) advocacy. [[6]](#cite_note-jez-6) [[8]](#cite_note-Coombes-8) Media campaign[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Generation_Rescue&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] The organization was established in 2005 by Lisa and J.B. Handley and 150 volunteer \"Rescue Angels\". More recently it has been led by [Jenny McCarthy](/wiki/Jenny_McCarthy), an author, television personality and former [Playboy](/wiki/Playboy) model. [[8]](#cite_note-Coombes-8) Since McCarthy has become president, the organization has been rebranded variously as \"Jenny McCarthy and Jim wrote in [Time](/wiki/Time_(magazine)), \"...McCarthy's celebrity status has meant that her affiliation with Generation Rescue, an organization that links autism with immunization, has spooked thousands of parents, encouraging them to reject vaccines for their children \u2014 the same vaccines that are responsible for saving lives around the world.\" [[10]](#cite_note-10) Causes of autism[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Generation_Rescue&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] Generation Rescue has proposed a number of possible causes for developmental-related issues, such as vaccines, the increase in the number of vaccines administered, and [thiomersal](/wiki/Thiomersal), [[11]](#cite_note-11) a [mercury](/wiki/Mercury_(element))-based vaccine preservative. [[12]](#cite_note-12) Generation Rescue claims that [biomedical intervention](/wiki/Biomedical_intervention_for_autism) can help children recover. [[13]](#cite_note-Forced_Sweating-13) The hypotheses that vaccines, such as [MMR](/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy), or [thiomersal](/wiki/Thiomersal_controversy) cause autism have been refuted by scientific research, [[3]](#cite_note-vaccines-and-autism-3) as have claims that diets, drugs or [chelation](/wiki/Chelation_therapy) can cure autism. [[14]](#cite_note-14) Because of Generation Rescue's public profile through national advertising and because its point of view is not shared by the mainstream medical community, its message has been controversial, [[15]](#cite_note-15) and the organization has been described as [anti-vaccine](/wiki/Vaccine_controversy). [[4]](#cite_note-Salzberg2010-4) [[16]](#cite_note-Anatomy_of_a_scare-16) [[17]](#cite_note-17) Promotion of products sold by board members[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Generation_Rescue&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] Several products and treatments recommended by Generation rescue to their members are sold by members of their Board of Director or their medical advisory board. A $20,000 [hyperbaric chamber](/wiki/Diving_chamber) sold by a firm whose President is then-board member Samir Patel was promoted by the group. Generation rescue also encourages its members to seek hyperbaric treatments from Dan Rossignol, who is a member of their Science Advisory Board. Another member of that board, Anjum Usman Singh, also offers such treatments and received a reprimand by the Medical Board of the [California Department of Consumer Affairs](/wiki/California_Department_of_Consumer_Affairs) for failing to disclose she held a financial interest in the company selling the chambers she used with her patients. [[6]](#cite_note-jez-6) It recommends lollipops enriched with vitamins sold by a company co-founded by Stan Kurtz and owned by Candace McDonald, who have been respectively a President of Generation Rescue and its executive director for ten years. For a time, the lollipops were sold directly through the group's website. A $2,000 foot bath that was promoted by Generation Rescue is sold by a sponsor of the group who contributes a minimum of $25,000 to its operating budget. [[6]](#cite_note-jez-6) Each of these featured products are not recognized by the medical community as effective against autism. Until March, 2019, the organization also offered grants to some families, with which they would buy products offered by companies sponsoring Generation Rescue. [[6]](#cite_note-jez-6) [[7]](#cite_note-Dal-7) Failed clinic[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Generation_Rescue&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] On June 19, 2017, Generation Rescue held a fundraising event in [St. Charles, Illinois](/wiki/St._Charles,_Illinois) with [Jenny McCarthy](/wiki/Jenny_McCarthy) and husband [Donnie Wahlberg](/wiki/Donnie_Wahlberg), with part of the proceeds to be put aside for the construction of an [integrative health](/wiki/Alternative_medicine) clinic. Construction of the clinic begun in July, under a company managed by Candace McDonald, who was then executive director of Generation Rescue. Jenny McCarthy herself was on hand for the ground-breaking ceremony. The clinic was to open in January, 2018. [[6]](#cite_note-jez-6) [[18]](#cite_note-18) [[19]](#cite_note-19) Construction was stopped in the Fall of 2017 and the construction contractor filed a lawsuit for non-payment of invoices amounting to $500,000. Generation Rescue now denies it has any links to the construction of the clinic. [[6]](#cite_note-jez-6) [[20]](#cite_note-20) However, Generation Rescue, Candace McDonald and Jenny McCarthy were named in the suit as Respondents in Discovery. [[21]](#cite_note-21) The lawsuit was settled; while the terms of the settlement are confidential, title to the site of the proposed clinic was relinquished to the contractor, who had intended to redraw the building's floor plans and finish individual suites. [[22]](#cite_note-22) The property was subsequently developed as Fiore Salon Suites. [[23]](#cite_note-23) Reception[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Generation_Rescue&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] Generation Rescue previously co-sponsored an annual conference in [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago) along with another controversial charity, Autism One. The choice of speakers at these conferences led critics to accuse both organizations of promoting unproven therapies, such as the [Miracle Mineral Solution](/wiki/Miracle_Mineral_Supplement), as a purported cure for autism. [[24]](#cite_note-24) These conferences have also been criticized because [Andrew Wakefield](/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield) has spoken at them. [[25]](#cite_note-25) They have also been criticized because many of the speakers presenting \"so-called treatments\" have a financial interest in them. [[26]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESalzberg2012-26) J.B. Handley said of [Andrew Wakefield](/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield), originator that the MMR vaccine causes autism](/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy): \"To our community, Andrew Wakefield is Nelson Mandela and Jesus Christ rolled up into one. He's a symbol of how all of us feel.\" [[27]](#cite_note-27) [[28]](#cite_note-28) However, Wakefield's work has been characterized as \"an elaborate fraud\", [[29]](#cite_note-29) and parental fears over vaccines sparked by the controversy, and by continued advocacy of the disproven theory by groups such as Generation Rescue despite, have led, in turn, to decreased immunization rates and an increased incidence of [whooping cough](/wiki/Pertussis) and [measles](/wiki/Measles), a highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease. [[30]](#cite_note-30) Generation Rescue issued a statement that the \"media circus\" following the revelation of Wakefield's fraud and manipulation of data was \"much ado about nothing\". [Salon](/wiki/Salon_(website)) responded to Generation Rescue's statement with: But any organization using a celebrity to mislead parents with claims of \"new\" data that rely on decade-old vaccine formulas and schedules is more than disingenuous, it's flat-out dangerous.\u2014 Mary Elizabeth Williams [[31]] Much of Generation Rescue's case is based on publications that do not go through a proper [peer review](/wiki/Peer_review) process. [[13]](#cite_note-Forced_Sweating-13) [[32]](#cite_note-32) Writing for [Forbes](/wiki/Forbes), [Emily Willingham](/wiki/Emily_Willingham) characterized Generation Rescue as \"an organization devoted to the debunked notion that vaccines cause autism and that autistic people can be 'recovered' from their autism by way of various unproven and sometimes dangerous interventions, Corporation Division.
