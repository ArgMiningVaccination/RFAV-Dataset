It is an important system to balance no matter what health issues you are addressing. Your gut health is the foundation of your body's physical well-being. TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE FOR DIGESTIVE HEALTH Common digestive disorders can be caused by many factors such as infection, stress, diet, overuse of antibiotics and NSAIDs, along with the decline of functionality that can come with aging. Traditional Chinese Medicine can treat the underlying cause of a full range of digestive disorders from mild symptoms to chronic disease. Our acupuncturists can perform a Chinese Medicine diagnosis and perform customized treatments with acupuncture and give recommendations on potential Chinese herbs, supplements, Eastern nutrition, and lifestyle suggestions. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE GUT AND THE BRAIN A weak Spleen Qi can precipitate overthinking or over worrying. Or Over Worrying and overthinking can cause weakened spleen qi which then causes weak digestion that can lead to a plethora of symptoms. The spleen Qi is responsible for the digestive function, and with the modern adiet of processed, refined foods weakens the Spleens function even more. In Chinese medicine, practitioners for thousands of years have known that when the Spleen Qi is weak, it can cause even more all forms of digestive disorders, anxiety, poor sleep, weakened immune function, low energy, among other symptoms. Modern medicine is just now validating the gut/brain connection - see article above. At Source healing, we take the gut seriously. No matter what you are coming in for, we are also going to check in with the functioning of your Spleen Qi, as that sets the tone for the whole body. "}
