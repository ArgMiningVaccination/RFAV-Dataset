Her Majesty and the newly-crowned Duchess of Sussex arrived in Cheshire this morning after spending the night travelling by royal train - an invitation which has yet to be extended to the likes of [Kate](https://uk.style.yahoo.com/tagged/duchess-of-cambridge/), William or [Harry](https://uk.style.yahoo.com/tagged/prince-harry/). Upon arrival at Runcorn Station, the regal duo were met by flag-bearing crowds eager to catch a glimpse of Meghan and her new grandmother-in-law's joint appearance. For their first engagement together - Meghan's third post-wedding outing - the former 'Suits' actress certainly dressed for her newfound royal role. The 36-year-old returned to Givenchy - the label behind her iconic [wedding gown](https://uk.style.yahoo.com/meghan-markle-weds-prince-harry-bespoke-givenchy-wedding-dress-112339544.html) - in a duchess-worthy cape-dress. She accessorised the cream-hued look with a black clutch and belt (both Givenchy) and co-ordinating \u00a3265 [heels](https://orchardmile.com/sarah-flint/perfect-pump-85-black-nappa-sf9adb42ea?color=black%20nappa&utm_campaign=rewardStyle&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=linkshare) by American designer Sarah Flint. A full breakdown of Meghan's look: Meghan braved the wind with regal waves in her hair (reminiscent of the look she donned at [Trooping the Colour 2018](https://uk.style.yahoo.com/fashion-trooping-colour-2018-duchess-slideshow-wp-102803734.html)), in place of her now-trademark messy bun. Meanwhile, the Queen dazzled in a lime-hued coat by her go-to designer Stewart Parvin and spring-ready floral dress. She finished the look with a hat by Rachel Trevor Morgan.

In comparison to the Duchess of Cambridge, Meghan's debut engagement comes just over a month after the royal wedding. Kate on the other hand, joined Her Majesty on a solo outing during the Diamond Jubilee tour almost one year after she wed Prince William. During their visit, the pair will unveil the Mersey Gateway Bridge (a \u00a31.86 million project) at the Catalyst Science Discovery Centre. The royals will then be treated to a performance by local school children. They will later depart by car for a 20-mile journey to Chester where they will officially open the Storyhouse Theatre on Hunter Street. A fitting role for a previous actress, don't you agree? In the afternoon, the duo will observe the national minute's silence to mark the Grenfell Tower fire anniversary, as a siren will sound outside Chester Town Hall. Her Majesty will then enjoy a spot of well-deserved lunch with Meghan. Oh, what we would give for an invitation... The first time Meghan was photographed alongside Her Majesty was on 25 December 2017, as Harry's then-fianc\u00e9e joined the royal family at their annual church service in Sandringham. An invitation normally reserved for members of the family, the festive occasion hinted at the Queen's fondness of Meghan. In recent months, she has continued to guide her through royal etiquette and protocol ever since. Prince Charles' former royal butler, Grant Harrold, told [ Yahoo Style UK](https://uk.style.yahoo.com/queen-taken-meghan-markle-wing-110823976.html): \"What better person to do your first trip of this kind with than the Queen? It's perfect.\" He added, \"It's not a joint thing, it's not her and Harry. It's just Meghan and the Queen so it will give her an amazing opportunity to spend time with the Queen in private and in public.\" Follow us on [@YahooStyleUK](https://twitter.com/YahooStyleUK).
