Day 4's schedule features two blockbuster second round matches in the ATP draw. 2012 champion Andy Murray faces friend and frequent opponent of yesteryear Grigor Dimitrov for the first time since semifinalist Gael Monfils challenges eighth-seeded Andrey Rublev. Plus, Carlos Alcaraz, Daniil Medvedev, and Stan Wawrinka also play on Thursday. On the WTA side, 2020 Australian Open champ Sofia Kenin battles the 13th seed, Daria Kasatkina. In addition, three-time Major runner-up Ons Jabeur, who was clearly hampered by illness on Tuesday, takes on a dangerous 18-year-old in Linda Noskova. And reigning Major champs Aryna Sabalenka and Marketa Vondrousova will also be in action. Throughout the tournament, this preview will analyze the day's four most prominent matches, while highlighting the other notable matches on the schedule. Thursday's play gets underway at 11:00am local time. Andy Murray vs. Grigor Dimitrov (19) - 12:00pm on Arthur Ashe Stadium These veterans met 11 times between 2011 and 2016, with Murray gaining the decided edge 8-3. Dimitrov's most significant victory came in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in 2014, when he prevailed in straight sets. Their only encounter at this event occurred seven years ago, when Andy was easily victorious, dropping only five games. What will this matchup look like in 2023, with Andy now the bionic man? Murray won a tight three-setter on Tuesday over Corentin Moutet, while Dimitrov endured a much more grueling contest. Grigor saved three match points before eventually winning a fifth-set tiebreak over Alex Molcan. The Bulgarian was a semifinalist here in 2019, but has lost in this round in each of the last three years. With Murray possessing a significant lead in their head-to-head, and certainly being the fresher player after the first round, I like Andy's chances of advancing to the third round of the US Open for the second consecutive year, metal hip notwithstanding. Gael Monfils vs. Andrey Rublev (8) - Third on Grandstand Rublev was originally drawn to face Emil Ruusuvuori in the opening round, a player who defeated him just two weeks ago in Cincinnati. But Emil was forced to withdraw due to illness, leading to Andrey winning in straight sets over a lucky loser. Considering Rublev arrived in New York on a three-match winning streak, he certainly didn't mind facing an easier opponent. Monfils has been resurgent this summer. After injuries yet again derailed his career since last August, he rediscovered his mojo in Toronto, where he upset Christopher Eubanks and Stefanos Tsistsipas. And after picking up two more solid wins in Cincy, over Cam Norrie and Alex de Minaur, Gael overcame Taro Daniel on Tuesday in a high-quality four-setter. They have split two previous matchups, both on hard courts. Five years ago in the final of Doha, Monfils won in straights. Two years ago in Cincy, Rublev won in two tiebreak sets. In the rubber match on Thursday, I favor Gael. The Frenchman is in much stronger form this month, with Andrey currently lacking in confidence. Ons Jabeur (5) vs. Linda Noskova - Last on Grandstand What condition will Jabeur be in on Thursday? The answer to that question will likely be the biggest factor in this match's outcome. Ons was doubled over frequently during her first round contest on Tuesday, struggling to catch her breath, as she has been battling an illness since the week before the Open. Noskova is a fast-rising teenager who is having a good summer. She achieved her first WTA final at her home country's biggest event in Prague, then came through qualifying to eventually upset Petra Kvitova and Liudmila Samsonova in Cinncinnati. Linda dropped only three games in her opening round against Madison Brengle of the United States. This is a rematch from the beginning of this season in Adelaide, where Noskova upset Jabeur in three sets. And if Ons is still ailing on Thursday, a repeat of that result is entirely possible. Daria Kasatkina (13) vs. Sofia Kenin - 7:00pm on Louis Armstrong Stadium It's been nearly four years since Kenin surprisingly won the Australian Open, then reached another Major final later that year in Paris. And they've been a long four years for Sofia, who has battled illnesses and injuries, which have kept her off the court for extended periods of time. Kenin is just 15-13 this season, but she has procured a few impressive wins in recent months, over the likes of Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff. Kasatkina is 30-20 on the year, though she's only 12-11 on hard courts. This remains her weakest surface, as she's only once reached the second week of a hard court Major. Daria came back from a set down in the last round to defeat another American, Alycia Parks. While Kenin is 2-1 against Kasatkina, those victories came four and five years ago, respectively. Most recently, Daria beat Sofia 6-4, 6-0, which was last year in Sydney on a hard court. And based on recent form, I give Kasatkina the slight edge to win again on Thursday night, in what should be a tight and compelling affair. Other Notable Matches on Thursday: Jack Draper vs. Hubert Hurkacz (17) - Marc-Andrea Huesler served for the match in the third set on Tuesday against Hurkacz, before Hubi came back to win in five. 21-year-old Draper missed most of the summer due to a shoulder injury, but is vying to reach the third round here for the second straight year. Hubi is 2-0 against Jack. Jodie Burrage vs. Aryna Sabalenka (2) - Sabalenka is now 25-5 on hard courts this year. Burrage was the runner-up in Birmingham on grass a few months ago, but on Tuesday earned just her second tour-level hard court victory of the season. Martina Trevisan vs. Marketa Vondrousova (9) - Vondrousova lost only three games in the first round, while Trevisan survived a dramatic final-set tiebreak against Yulia Putintseva. This is the first career meeting between these two lefties. Tomas Martin Etcheverry (30) vs. Stan Wawrinka - As per the ATP, with his victory on Tuesday over Yoshihito Nishioka, Wawrinka became the oldest man to win a match at the US Open since Jimmy Connors in 1992. On the same day, Etcheverry survived a fifth-set tiebreak to advance. Elina Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova Svitolina is now 10-2 at Majors this year. Pavlyuchenkova continues to battle injuries, and has only played two tour-level matches since reaching the Roland Garros quarterfinals three months ago. Anastasia leads their head-to-head 3-2. Carlos Alcaraz (1) vs. Lloyd Harris - Alcaraz only had to play a set and a half in his opening round, as Dominik Koepfer retired after rolling his ankle early in the match. Harris was a quarterfinalist here two years ago, but is currently ranked 177th in the world, as he missed most of 2022 due to injury. Daniil Medvedev (3) vs. Christopher O'Connell - Medvedev dropped just two games in his opening round, while O'Connell notched an impressive four-set win over an in-form Max Purcell. Daniil has twice beaten Chris on a hard court, though their match earlier this season in Doha went to 7-5 in the third. Patricia Maria Tig vs. Jessica Pegula (3) - Pegula comfortably eliminated Camila Giorgi on Tuesday afternoon, while Tig secured her first tour-level victory since June of 2021, after recently being inactive for over a year-and-a-half.

[Focus](https://www.ubitennis.net/category/focus/) Alcaraz Fell Victim To Unbeatable Medvedev Carlos Alcaraz was no match for Daniil Medvedev in the US Open semi-finals. A star had to fall. There was no other way. This time, Carlos Alcaraz was the victim. Daniil Medvedev was unbeatable. The 6-6 Russian was everywhere, playing almost perfect tennis in a 7-6 (3), 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 win over Alcaraz. So, one former champion went down while one advanced to Sunday's final at the U.S. Open. And then there was Novak Djokovic, another former champion headed for the title match. U.S. OPEN WAS THE BIG WINNER FRIDAY The U.S. Open couldn't lose once Djokovic dominated young American Ben Shelton, 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (4). Djokovic appeared to be content with just winning while getting the preliminaries over with. He seemed to be a little miffed by Shelton's cockiness. There were no hugs or embraces when the match ended. Just a handshake. Shelton has huge potential, but it's going to take some time before he's ready to join the likes of Djokovic, Medvedev and Alcaraz. He's a better athlete than he is tennis player. Novak is ready to go for a record 24th Grand Slam title. Believe it or not, Medvedev will be playing in his fifth Grand Slam final. Sunday should be a great day in Arthur Ashe Stadium, with two former champs, Djokovic and Medvedev, going against each other. CAN COCO HIT WITH SABALENKA The women's final will be interesting. Can Coco Gauff compete with Aryna Sabalenka? Sabalenka looked helpless against Madison Keys' big strokes and serves in the first set of their semifinal on Thursday. Sabalenka couldn't win even one game in that set. She looked helpless. But she obviously felt all along that she could beat Keys anytime she wanted. Or why else would the powerful Sabalenka go for broke on almost every shot? And it almost cost her. Amazingly, Sabalenka waited almost to the final moments to decide to play within her game and stop the wildness. Once Sabalenka decided to settle down and play to win, Keys went just the opposite way, similarly to her one-sided loss to Sloane Stephens in the 2017 U.S. Open final. Keys appeared ready to win this time as she held a 6-0, 5-4 advantage over new world's No. 1 Sabalenka, who seemed to be stumbling all over the court as she repeatedly hit wild shots in every direction. Just like that, everything changed. Sabalenka started hitting winners everywhere as Keys reversed roles with Sabalenka. Not only did Sabalenka win the second set while dropping just one point in a tiebreaker, she stormed through a decisive 10-point third-set tiebreaker to win the match. \u2014 James Beck was the 2003 winner of the USTA National Media Award. 1995 MBA graduate of The Citadel, he can be reached at [Jamesbecktennis@gmail.com]. [Focus](https://www.ubitennis.net/category/focus/) Daniil Medvedev Stuns Top Seed Alcaraz to Reach Fifth Grand Slam Final and Faces Djokovic in Showdown 2021 Champion Daniil Medvedev Praises 'Unbelievable Crowd' Amid Tense Finish. By Anshu Taneja Third seed Daniil Medvedev overcame a nervy finale to finally put away defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in four tight sets 7-6 (3), 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, and now faces Novak Djokovic in Sunday's decider. In a match lasting three hours and nineteen minutes on a sold-out Arthur Ashe Stadium, the match lived up to its billing and did not disappoint, featuring numerous outstanding rallies as both men displayed all the best of their attacking and defensive skills from all parts of the court. \"The crowd was unbelievable today. Absolutely unbelievable, I mean it\" said Medvedev in his on-court interview afterwards. \"We had some crazy points and there was love to both sides. Some Spanish guys started screaming at 5-3 [in the fourth] during the points which is not so nice but I guess they were desperate. I said I needed to play 11 out of 10. I played 12 out of 10, except from the third set.\" This was the third meeting between the two this year with Alcaraz winning both matches very convincingly: the first a straight sets demolition in the Indian Wells Final - where Medvedev criticized the slow-paced surface - and then again in the Wimbledon semis where he won every set 6-3. Both players held serve in an impressive opening set. At 4-5 down and with no room for error, Medvedev held to love and had 0-30 in the next game. Then Alcaraz held firm in a quality rally ending with a brilliant inside out forehand and escaped the game to go 6-5 up. The next game featured the best rally of the first set with Alcaraz covering the net like a man possessed and even though he pushed a volley wide, it drew a standing ovation from the crowd. Fittingly, the set would be settled on a tiebreak where Medvedev took the first mini-break with a stunning forehand up the line but the Russian gave it straight back with a double fault and they switched ends at 3-3. But Alcaraz failed on a drop shot, and then missed a forehand to give Medvedev a real chance of taking the set - and two points later he won it with 85% of first serves won and a whopping 40% of unreturned serves. Alcaraz, who had failed to take advantage of two breakpoints early in the first set, suddenly found himself facing one at the start of the second and surrendered his serve meekly with another failed drop shot. Meanwhile Medvedev continued dominating the baseline exchanges and took a 3-0 lead having won 14 of the first 18 points. He even carved up two more breakpoints in the next game and though he couldn't take one, he was cruising on his service game, holding for 4-1 having not lost a point on serve thus far, and broke again in the next for 5-1. Medvedev, who came through his quarter final in straight sets against Andrey Rublev, had now won the set 6-1 with just three unforced errors - a tactical masterclass. Simply outstanding from the World Number three, who was the tour leader with 37 wins on hard courts this year, and now tantalizingly close to his fifth Grand Slam Final. Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz had never recovered from two sets down in a Grand Slam in five previous attempts, and now had a mountain to climb. But he slowly worked his way into the set by getting the upper hand in the baseline rallies, and began focusing on Medvedev's backhand and upped his percentages on serve. Along with thirteen blistering winners, he also converted 13 of 15 net approaches and using the energy of the crowd and relying on his inner belief, he converted on his only breakpoint with a beautiful rolled backhand lob to go 3-1 up. He held on to that lead throughout to take the set 6-3 to the delight of the crowd. Game on again. But once again Medvedev raised his game in the fourth. Games went with serve until the sixth where Alcaraz found himself under serious pressure with some long physical exchanges and six deuce points. After thirteen long minutes Medvedev broke for a 4-2 lead. Both players held, and then at 5-3 and now serving for the match, the Russian went 0-30 down and then 15-40 down to hand some final hope to Alcaraz. He saved both and then reached match point but inexplicably threw in two double faults - showing just how much tension there actually was on court. Once again, the crowd were treated to fabulous points in the nervy ending which see-sawed both ways at deuce before Medvedev finally put away his fourth match point to settle the enthralling contest and deny Alcaraz, meaning that Roger Federer still remains the last man to successfully defend the title back in 2008. Medvedev has made his living with his unorthodox style of play mixed in with excellent court coverage and had a 28-5 lifetime record at the US Open over the last six years. Coming in to the match, the general consensus was that it was he who would have to come up with a different game plan and not stand so far back at the court. \"Before the match for sure I had a lot of doubts after losing easily to him twice this year. He is honestly just really unbelievable\" explained Medvedev afterwards. \"To beat him you need to be better than yourself and I managed to do it. The third set was not so bad. I lost one serve and I felt I wasn't so far away on his. I managed to do some amazing points in the fourth and he started to miss a bit which we don't usually see.\" [Focus](https://www.ubitennis.net/category/focus/) US Open: Novak Djokovic Neutralises Ben Shelton To Reach 10th Final Novak Djokovic is into his tenth US Open final after a straight sets win over Ben Shelton. Novak Djokovic is into his tenth US Open final after defeating Ben Shelton 6-3 6-2 7-6(4). The Serb's quest for a 24th Grand Slam title continues after neutralising the powerful American for a straight sets win. Djokovic will now have a blockbuster showdown with rival Carlos Alcaraz or the last person he played in a US Open final in Daniil Medvedev. Both players brought their A game in the early stages with Shelton unafraid by the occasion as he pummelled serves and forehands past Djokovic. Meanwhile the three-time champion responded with aggressive shot-making from the baseline and consistent defensive shots. After an equal start, Djokovic used his experience to test the American's nerves in the sixth game with Shelton ultimately faltering as he conceded the break to 15. The soon-to-be world number one wasn't done there as he threatened the double break in his next return game. However Shelton refused to back down as not only did he hold in the eighth game but had break point when Djokovic served for the opening set as he played some ruthless tennis. The American missed a forehand into the net, to his frustration, and ultimately Djokovic survived to take the opening set 6-3 which culminated in a massive roar to his team. In the second set, Djokovic created six break points and faced no resistance from the American who continued to produce unforced errors. The Serb's depth and pace was too much for Shelton as he converted two of those break points to take a 5-2 lead. Djokovic comfortably served out the second set with ease and started the third set with an immediate break of serve. Despite being outclassed for most of the match Shelton did impress Djokovic on occasions as the American produced some impressive power from the baseline and some high-quality play at the net which Djokovic acknowledged. As the match neared its conclusion, Shelton played with more and more freedom while Djokovic was a bit more passive with his play as the American was allowed to play powerful tennis. That would cost Djokovic as some missed first serves and unforced errors saw Shelton break back in the eighth game for 4-4. The complexity of the match had changed as Djokovic started to miss first serves with Shelton having a couple of set points in the tenth game. However Shelton was made to pay for his missed opportunities as a poor service game in the eleventh game allowed Djokovic to break and serve out the match for a second time. There would be another twist in the tale as Djokovic lost focus in the crucial moments and on Shelton's third break point of the game a missed smash into the net from the Serb saw the American break as Djokovic failed to convert match point. In the end, Djokovic's passive play didn't matter too much as he was clinical in the tiebreak as he reached his tenth US Open final where he will play one of the former champions from the past two years in either Carlos Alcaraz or Daniil Medvedev.
