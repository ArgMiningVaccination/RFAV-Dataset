A description of the CDC influenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each data component, is available on the [surveillance methods](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm) page. Additional information on the current and previous influenza seasons for each surveillance component is available on [FluView Interactive](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm). [U.S. Virologic Surveillance](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm#LabSurveillance) Clinical Laboratories The results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories (the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza) are used to monitor whether influenza activity is increasing or decreasing. |Week 34|| | Data Cumulative since October 2, 2022(Week 40) |No. of specimens tested||33,251||3,929,713| |No. Laboratories The results of tests performed by public health laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from public health laboratories are used to monitor the proportion of circulating viruses that belong to each influenza virus type/subtype/lineage. Viruses known to be associated with recent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) receipt or found upon further testing to be a vaccine virus are not included as they are not circulating influenza viruses. |Week 34||Data Cumulative since | October 2, 2022 (Week 40) |No. of specimens tested||1,479||279,183| seasons: Methods](/flu/weekly/overview.htm#LabSurveillance) Respiratory Illness Surveillance](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm#ILINet) The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-confirmed influenza, and may capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with any pathogen that can present with similar symptoms, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. Therefore, it is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. Other respiratory virus surveillance data can be found on CDC's [COVID Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home) [, NCIRD Surveillance Systems website](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/surveillance/index.html) Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website](https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html). Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits Nationwide during week 34, 1.7% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location. * Effective October 3, 2021 (week 40), the ILI definition (fever plus cough or sore throat) no longer includes \"without a known cause other than influenza.\" Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits by Age Group More than 70% of ILINet participants provide both the number of patient visits for respiratory illness and the total number of patient visits for the week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patient visits for respiratory illness by age group. During week 34, the percentage of visits for respiratory illness reported in ILINet was 5.8% among those 0-4 years, 3.0% among those 5-24 years, 1.5% among those 25-49 years, 1.0% among those 50-64 years, and 0.7% among those 65 years and older. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Activity Map Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of [ILI activity*](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm#anchor_1633697504110) by state/jurisdiction and Core Based Level||Number of Jurisdictions||Number of CBSAs| |Week 34 | (Week ending |Week 33 | (Week ending |Week 34 | (Week ending |Week 33 represent certain populations within a jurisdiction or CBSA, and therefore, may not accurately depict the full picture of influenza activity for the entire jurisdiction or CBSA. Differences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by some health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with data presented by the health department likely being the more complete.

FluSurv-NET hospitalization data are preliminary. Patients admitted for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalization after April 30, 2023, will not be included in FluSurv-NET for the 2022-2023 season. Data on patients admitted through April 30, 2023, will continue to be updated on FluView Interactive as additional information is received.

During week 34, 779 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza were admitted to a hospital.

This percentage is above the epidemic threshold of 5.5% for this week. Among the 1,484 PIC deaths reported for this week, 436 had COVID-19 listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death on the death certificate, and 9 listed influenza. The data presented are preliminary and may change as more data are received and processed.
