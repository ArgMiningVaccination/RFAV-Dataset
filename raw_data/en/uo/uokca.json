This report illustrates the tremendous accomplishments of our research faculty, students, and staff and provides a glimpse into the rich programmatic breadth of the research activities occurring on our campus and throughout our great city. At UIC we understand that research is a powerful investment that impacts the economy of Chicago and Illinois while also providing the best education for our students, a higher quality of life for our patients, and a more sustainable world in which to live. Despite the myriad of global, national, and local challenges that we face, UIC has continued to invest soundly in our research programs, and the value of that investment can be judged by the growth in our sponsored research portfolio. Our faculty continue to generate new ideas, discoveries, and inventions on a daily basis. Throughout this annual report, you will read stories that reflect the depth of research that takes place at UIC and you will be impressed by the quality of our faculty, students, and staff. During my two-year tenure as vice chancellor for research, I was privileged to have been a part of the continuing growth in our research portfolio. In order to stimulate this growth, three VCR Councils were convened in the fall of 2010 focusing on the following research and scholarly themes: Community Disparities Biomedical Discovery Urban Resilience and the Global Environment The work of these councils and the resulting areas of research excellence are reflected in this annual report and will continue to help shape the future of research at UIC through new programmatic initiatives, faculty recruitment, and other strategic research reinvestments. UIC's continued commitment to excellence in research will continue to increase the recognition of our outstanding community and attract the best and brightest talent. While we are proud of the accomplishments highlighted here, we realize that there are many more stories we have not been able to showcase because there are simply too many good things happening to include in this issue. I encourage you to learn more about research at UIC by connecting online at www.research.uic.edu. Best regards,Skip Joe G. N. \"Skip\" Garcia, MD Vice President for Health Affairs Vice Chancellor for Research (February 1, 2010-January 31, 2012)Earl M.

This gave me an edge when I got to college. It wasn't simply a profession, it was my passion.\" And as it turns out, even though video games are often thought of as frivolous, they are, in fact, not too different from the computer simulations that weather scientists, car manufacturers, and chemists use to forecast weather, design new cars, and develop new drugs. When asked to describe his research, Dr. Leigh said, \"My research area is data visualization\u2014developing techniques to help people make sense of the mountains of data that they are increasingly becoming buried under because the Internet has made it so easy to collect and store data, regardless of whether it is useful or not.\" One specific area of interest is the development of computer displays that help with data visualization. \"When we were studying biology or physics in high school, we used instruments like microscopes and telescopes,\" he said. \"Today, modern science records those types of images directly into the computer; in essence, the scientist never looks through those traditional optical microscopes and telescopes. The modern-day versions of those instruments are computer displays, like the one sitting on your desk. So my research is in developing better microscopes and telescopes to help people digest exponentially growing data.\" Dr. Leigh and his colleagues\u2014lead investigator and computer science associate professor Andrew Johnson, PhD; EVL associate director Maxine Brown, MS; and EVL computer science adjunct assistant professor Tom Peterka, PhD \u2014 received a three-year National Science Foundation grant to help build the next generation (NG) CAVE. \"Experiencing the NG CAVE will be like stepping into the highest-resolution planetarium ever built,\" he said, \"but of course you can see much more than stars. You can look at 3D molecules for those who are searching for drugs to cure cancer. You can look at geologic data if you are searching for oil or studying earthquakes and tsunamis. You can even look at complex financial-trend data so that you can better govern a city, state, or country. You can create virtual reality simulations that help train students, soldiers, doctors, fire fighters, and astronauts. You can even play video games never before imagined.\" Dr. Leigh has also developed a novel way to achieve immortality\u2014by creating a lifelike avatar of himself. Profiled on the NOVA scienceNOW episode \"Can We Live Forever?,\" which aired in January 2011 on PBS, the show examined whether we can slow down the aging process. Dr. Leigh's Project LifeLike, which is pioneering avatar technology that will allow you to impart your wisdom, humor, and unique insight long after you are gone, was highlighted.

They develop visualization tools for Argonne National Laboratory, the Department of Homeland Security, or Pixar. They develop interactive exhibits for Adler Planetarium or the Science Museum of Minnesota.\" Dr. Leigh chose UIC because \"there is a lot of infrastructure here that would be difficult to get anywhere else. For example, UIC has some of the best medical-imaging technology in the world. We are also one of the few campuses that has extraordinary network bandwidth on the order of 30 gigabits per second and will soon increase to 100 gigabits per second.\" He also finds that one of the great advantages to doing research in a university with so many diverse departments is that you can easily find collaborators. \"It is an exciting time at UIC,\" he said.

While she is involved in many different areas of women's health research, she says her \"global maternal-health work is the most meaningful work I do.\" \"I have been working globally, primarily in Africa and Southeast Asia, to reduce death and morbidity from postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). I have been able to conduct NIH-funded clinical trials to examine the efficacy and safety of drugs to reduce PPH and then translate those findings to change Ministry of Health policy within a country and implement workable programs in the field.\" As a testament to the impact her work has in these nations, Dr. Geller was installed as Development Queen Mother of the Manso Nkwanta Traditional Area in Ghana by the Queen Mother and King of Manso Nkwanta. She is now known in the area as Nana Akosua Kannin I. The king asked Dr. Geller to contribute to the area by helping to improve education for girls and decrease teenage pregnancy.Stacie Geller, PhD, gives a speech to the community on the day of her installation as Development Queen Mother of the Manso Nkwanta Traditional Area in Ghana.

Recipients of the 2009 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring, awarded in January 2011. Dr. Geller completed an NIH- funded five-year National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) randomized clinical trial comparing the use of oral misoprostol to standard care to reduce PPH in rural India. This study found that with a simple intervention, such as misoprostol, PPH could be reduced by 50 percent. She is currently working with the MacArthur and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundations to implement a continuum of care model to reduce PPH in India, Nigeria, and Ghana. Faculty Highlights University of illi nois at chicago 4Dr. Geller serves as director of the Center for Research on Women and Gender (CRWG) and head of the National Center of Excellence in Women's Health, where she promotes collaborative multidisciplinary work related to women's lives.When asked to describe her research, Dr. Geller said, \"My work is about helping those that need help the most\u2014those who are most vulnerable and without other resources.\" UIC was designated a National Center of Excellence by the Office on Women's Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in 1998 and was named an Ambassador for Change in 2006. The program is designed to integrate biomedical expertise with the grass roots women's health vision and emphasizes partnership across disciplines and professions, between academics and communities, and between health-care providers and patients. Dr. Geller also serves as principal investigator of the NIH-funded women's health research career development program, Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health (BIRCWH). Dr. Geller also serves as director of the Center for Research on Women and Gender (CRWG) and head of the National Center of Excellence in Women's Health, where she promotes collaborative multidisciplinary work related to women's lives. Under Dr. Geller's leadership, the CRWG's Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program, which encourages girls and young women in math and science, received the 2011 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring. The award, announced by President Obama in January 2011, honored WISE's mentoring initiatives and included a $10,000 grant for continued mentoring work. Dr. Geller had the honor of meeting President Obama in the Oval Office. Her commitment to improving the lives of women around the world was recognized by the UIC campus in 2010 when she was selected as the UIC Woman of the Year. Established in 1992, this annual award honors a UIC woman who has consistently worked on women's issues beyond the call of duty and who is an exemplary role model. Dr. Geller was nominated by Sarah Kilpatrick, MD, PhD, who wrote: \"Stacie is an ideal candidate for this award because she has directly, positively impacted women through her research, her mentorship, and her leadership.\"Dr. Geller greeted by President Barack Obama as she enters the Oval Office.

An accomplished researcher, Dr. Campuzano has made significant contributions to the science of high-temperature superconductors and to the phenomenon of photoemission spectroscopy. He is recognized as one of the two undisputed world leaders in the use of angle resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES), now universally recognized as one of the most powerful experimental tools used to probe novel materials. Describing his research, Dr. Campuzano said, \"The materials my students and I are studying now are the high-temperature superconductors. Although these have many potential transformative applications, from contributing solutions to the energy problem to medical diagnosis, we concentrate on their fundamental properties.\" \"The area of physics related to materials is called condensed matter physics,\" he said. \"Most materials in use today are well understood and described in textbooks used in the classroom. Our experiments show that the high-temperature superconductors do not follow any of the known rules.\" As a testament to the extent of his scientific impact, it should be noted that his research publications (numbering more than 80) have been cited in the literature over 6,000 times, and at one point, his first paper on the pseudogap in high-temperature superconductors (published in 1996 in the journal Nature ) was the most highly cited paper in all of physics. Born and raised in Asuncion, Paraguay, he joined the faculty in the UIC Department of Physics in 1985, where he has remained ever since. In 1987, Dr. Campuzano also joined Argonne National Laboratory as a physicist in the Materials Science Division; he became a senior physicist 12 years later. He says once he and his wife decided to return to the United States to raise a family, he applied to several places. \"It was excruciatingly difficult to decide where to go. Just then, the BBC aired a wonderful series with Studs Terkel lovingly talking about the wonders of Chicago. He made the decision for us. Chicago is a wonderful place to live.\" Dr. Campuzano is the winner of the prestigious 2011 Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize and is recognized as one of the two undisputed world leaders in the use of angle resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES), now universally recognized as one of the most powerful experimental tools used to probe novel materials. Juan Carlos Campuzano, PhDFaculty Highlights University of ill inois at chicago 6Robe Rt bailey, PhD, MP h Professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics School of Public Health A study by epidemiologist Robert Bailey, PhD, MPH, along with two other studies conducted in African countries, has shown that medical circumcision dramatically reduces a man's risk of acquiring HIV from an infected woman. In fact, in December 2006, the National Institutes of Health halted Dr. Bailey's clinical trial of male circumcision after an interim review of the data showed that the procedure dramatically reduced transmission of HIV and recommended that all men enrolled in the study who remained uncircumcised be offered circumcision due to the clearly protective effect. Details of those studies were published in The Lancet . In the two randomized trials, which included 7,780 HIV-negative men in Rakai, Uganda, and Kisumu, Kenya, researchers found that medically circumcised men were at approximately 60 percent less likely than uncircumcised men to acquire HIV during sex with women. The editors of The Lancet called the discovery \"a new era for HIV prevention.\" This discovery, that circumcision can prevent HIV transmission, was ranked as the #1 medical breakthrough for 2007 by TIME magazine. Since 1995, Dr. Bailey and his colleagues have conducted research on male circumcision and HIV infection in eastern and southern Africa. His most recent clinical trial showed that medical circumcision reduces a man's risk of acquiring HIV during heterosexual intercourse by 59 percent. The results of this and two additional trials, Bailey said, \"led to a major policy shift to provide circumcision services widely throughout eastern and southern African.\" Since 2008, with assistance from Dr. Bailey and his collaborators, Kenya has achieved 440,000 circumcisions, which will likely prvent nearly 100,000 new HIV infections over the next ten years Recently, Dr. Bailey completed a study on men who have sex with men (MSM) in Kisumu. In Kenya, males who are discovered to be homosexual can face up to 14 years in jail and are therefore a highly stigmatized and vulnerable population. This can make it difficult for these men to be identified, offered HIV testing and counseling and treated for sexually transmitted diseases. Over 415 men enrolled in the study, which found very high rates of HIV in the MSM population and learned that more than half of MSM sell sex for money or goods. Two thirds of them also have high risk sex with women. Because of the stigma against homosexuality in the community, 60 percent of these men have expereinced violence and most are rejected by their families and neighbors. In part due to the findings of Dr. Bailey's study, a center has been established to support MSM in Kisumu, and these men now have access to affirming clinical and counseling services, and HIV positive MSM are getting care and appropriate drug treatment. The male circumcision program has now trained over 1,900 clinicians and has built capacity all over Kenya. They have also conducted a pilot on infant circumcision, but this is still not popular and requires more education. Right now, they are still focusing on men 18-30 years old who are at highest risk, because circumcising this age group will have the most immediate impact of the HIV epidemic. Dr. Bailey is part of the leadership for the Chicago Developmental Center for AIDS Research. In its fourth year, the Chicago D-CFAR is a consortium of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Rush University Medical Center, and Cook County Health and Hospitals System. The three work together to develop new interdisciplinary collaborations that will further AIDS research and ensure that research findings are accessible to affected people regionally and nationally. Dr. Bailey serves as Codirector of Chicago D-CFAR.

The MERIT Award (Method to Extend Research in Time), provides long-term, stable support to selected investigators. Natarajan studies acute lung injury or ALI, which causes the lungs to swell with fluid so that breathing becomes impossible. Acute lung injury and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are syndromes of acute respiratory failure resulting from acute pulmonary edema and inflammation. Natarajan focuses on a critical feature of acute lung injury: how the capillaries become leaky and allow fluid to fill the lungs. Building on work begun decades ago at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Chicago, Natarajan and his colleagues identified a protein that plays a key role in the processes that affect the permeability of blood vessels in the lungs.

The intervention, known as the ATVV intervention, provides auditory stimuli via the female human voice; tactile stimuli via moderate touch stroking; visual stimuli in the form of eye-to-eye contact; and vestibular stimuli, such as rocking. She has documented patterns of maternal-infant interaction to improve when mothers are taught ATVV to administer on their premature infants. The ATVV has also been shown to improve feeding progression, neurobehavioral orga - nization, and development and to decrease the length of hospital stay. Dr. White-Traut and her team are now testing an integrated intervention, the H-HOPE, which includes the ATVV with the addition of home visits by nurse/community advocate teams.

The company was formed following a major discovery by the lab that the pre-B cell colony enhancing factor (PBEF) plays a very important role in the pathology of ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) and acute lung injury (ALI), two highly interlinked syndromes with high, unacceptable mortality rates. Dr. Garcia's group discovered that neutralizing antibodies raised against PBEF can be effectively used to treat VILI/ALI. The company is in the process of developing highly efficacious humanized neutralizing antibodies against PBEF that will be used to treat the above two syndromes. rela ted ni h Fu nding: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)Cytoskeletal Regulation of Lung Endothelial PathobiologyP01 HL058064PI: Garcia, Joe G.

They have conducted basic animal investigations to identify and characterize the neural networks responsible for modifying the regulation of breathing patterns in differing sleep/wake states. These studies also aim to identify specific derangements of the nervous system that may lead to clinical disorders, such as sleep apnea syndrome. Based on their combined discoveries, they have recently started Pier Pharmaceuticals, a medical technology company focused on developing improved diagnostic and therapeutic options for these clinical disorders.Drs. Carley and Radulovacki were jointly named the 2010 UIC Inventors of the Year for their work related to sleep-related breathing disorders. Traditional treatments for common disorders, such as sleep apnea, involved complex devices or surgery to widen the soft tissue in the airway. Carley and Radulovacki found that turning up or down the signaling pathways of certain neurotransmitters can reduce the incidence of sleep apnea. rela ted ni h Fu nding: National Institute on of Sleep Apnea in AgingR01 AG016303PI: Carley, infectious diseases DR.

A major research focus for Nancy Freitag, PhD (associate professor of microbiology & immunology) is the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes that is commonly found in soft cheeses and chilled ready-to-eat foods. In susceptible individuals such as the elderly and pregnant women, Listeria infections can cause serious illness that involves CNS, the placenta, and the fetus. About 10 percent of infections can target the heart, and of those, one third are fatal. Using the mouse model, Dr. Freitag and collaborators recently showed that a specific strain of Listeria targets the heart and 90 percent of field mice developed cardiac infections with ten times more Listeria in the heart compared to mice infected with other strains of Listeria . The above strain-specific study is likely to advance not only our understanding of the Listeria -related pathobiology, but will also trigger the development of strain-specific therapies. rela ted ni h Fu nding: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)Listeria Virulence Gene Expression within DUNCAN WARDROP AND LIJUN RONG DISCOVER SMALL MOLECULES THAT EFFECTIVELY INHIBIT THE DREADED EBOLA VIRUS .

THOMAS DIEKWISCH AND HIS GROUP DISCOVER A WAY TO ATTACH KNOCKED -OUT TEETH USING A STEM CELL -BASED THERAPEUTIC APPROACH . Human teeth snugly sit in sockets and are anchored to the underlying bone via hundreds of strong fibers that collectively make up the periodontal ligament. This allows for the slight movement that serves as a shock absorber while chewing and biting the food we eat. The lab of Thomas Diekwisch, DMD, PhD (sc), PhD (phil) (professor and head of oral biology; director, Brodie Laboratory for Craniofacial Genetics; Allan G. Brodie Endowed Chair for Orthodontic Research; professor of anatomy & cell biology, bioengineering, orthodontics, and periodontics) discovered in a mouse model a way to grow periodontal stem cells that differentiate into fibers that form the ligament and anchor the tooth. The above stem cell-based therapy has tremendous translational potential to treat accident victims. In a separate collaborative study, Dr. Diekwisch's group recently discovered that the number of proline repeats determines the strength of enamel prisms that cover the teeth. The work is based on research carried out in amphibian and other animal models. The tooth enamel is bathed in bubble shaped groupings of proteins that range from 5 nm in cows to 20 nm in frogs. The smaller the bubble, the longer the associated enamel crystals. The smaller bubbles result from proteins containing relatively high proline content that are able to contract more. The above work is likely to help in developing ways to grow and strengthen human tooth enamel. related nih Funding : National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial ResearchEnamel Structure Sophistication through Amelogenin EvolutionR01 DE018900PI: Diekwisch, Thomas$388,575/year possible new therapeutic approaches to multiple sclerosis and autism DR. DOUGLAS FEINSTEIN DISCOVERS THAT REDUCTION IN NORADRENALINE , AN IMPORTANT NEUROTRANSMITTER , IS ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS). Noradrenaline is mostly produced by neurons in an area of the brain referred to as locus coeruleus (LC). Using a mouse MS model, Douglas Feinstein, PhD (professor of anethesiology and anatomy & cell biology) and colleagues demonstrated significant damage to the LC region and reduced levels of noradrenaline. These changes are similar to those seen in human brains with MS. The relatively low levels of noradrenaline could be the reason underlying a loss in the blood brain barrier and the infiltration of white blood cells to the inflamed sites in MS brains. The above study has tremendous therapeutic potential as there are FDA approved drugs that are known to elevate noradrenaline. related nih Funding: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and of Demyelinating Disease with HSP90 InhibitorsR01 EDWIN COO K I NVESTIGATES T HE G ENETICS O F SER OTONIN I N A UTISM .

Specifically, we look at vascular endothelial function, thought to be an early predictor of overall cardiovascular health.\" Dr. Phillips looks at why and how circulation changes during exercise and/or dieting. In a study overseen by Dr. Phillips and published recently in Nutrition Journal , sedentary people on a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet lost pounds but few inches from around their middles. They also showed signs of impaired blood vessel health after six weeks on the diet. \"There are different ways to lose weight,\" he said. \"Our overall goal is to find healthy ways to lose.\" Exercise is another important component in losing weight effectively. Dr. Phillips and his laboratory are examining the risks associated with exercise at the beginning of a program. UIC is an ideal place to conduct research like this because everything is in close proximity: the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), the Clinical Research Center, the Medical Center, and Dr. Phillips's lab. He is able to bring research subjects, physicians, and collaborators to one central location. \"Having all of this within walking distance is critical,\" he said, and it allows him to collaborate with colleagues from Dentistry, Medicine, Applied Health Sciences, and Nursing. \"It's hard to pinpoint many academic medical centers that have the full complement of health professions in a large urban center,\" said Phillips, \"but that is one of UIC's strengths, and with that strength comes the students, fellows, and trainees in each of these programs.\" When he joined the university in 2007, he was one of CCTS's first scholars. \"CCTS helped me understand the uniqueness of UIC, the importance of having collaborators, making collaborative links with people in other colleges and really meeting new mentors and colleagues.\" Dr. Phillips was awarded a K23 career development award for mentored patient-oriented research to examine the mech-anisms of exertional hypertension and vascular dysfunction.

Researchers at UIC are working to bring this area to national attention through their work at the Center for Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration (CWHTR). The CWHTR is a unique community of scientists, including immunologists, cell biologists, and bioengineers, as well as clinicians devoted to the study of injury, wound healing, and regeneration. The members of this multidisciplinary research center investigate the body's reaction to injury, as well as mechanisms of repair and regeneration of tissues. Luisa DiPietro, DDS, PhD, an immunologist and cell biologist who is a professor of periodontics, leads the center, which is housed in the College of Dentistry. Dr. DiPietro and her research group study wound healing in oral mucosal tis-sues, which protect the oral cavity. These tissues heal more quickly and with less scarring than skin and may provide clues to human regenerative capacity. \"Looking at the process by which these tissues repair and regenerate could suggest ways to minimize scars from skin wounds,\" said Dr. DiPietro. \"Regenerative medicine is truly the evolution of wound healing. From a regenerative medicine standpoint, skin is the first area we can easily take from bench to bedside because we can see the target organ,\" said Dr. Ennis. He notes there is a unique opportunity here. \"UIC is uniquely situated to lead this effort as both basic science and clinical expertise are readily available on campus.

ACWHTR was founded to fill a void in the medical education of physicians with regard to wound healing and tissue repair. The organization will also work to transfer the curriculum to multiple medical institutions throughout the country and to achieve formal board certification for physicians in the future. At the inaugural meeting of the ACWHTR, one of Dr. Ennis's patients, Charles Rakis, described his battle with a nonhealing wound. Paralyzed twelve years ago, Rakis has had a persistent wound for the last ten years. After seeing multiple physicians and enduring multiple surgeries, he was referred to Dr. Ennis. \"I truly believe that I would be dead by now if it weren't for Dr. Ennis,\" he said. Rakis had been considering a move to the East Coast to be close to major research universities, such as Yale and MIT, but realized he was getting the best possible care at UIC. He emphasizes the importance of training everyone from physi-cians to nurses to home health-care workers. \"I still find that many health-care providers do not know how to care for my wounds the way that Dr. Ennis does.\" Dr. Ennis describes Rakis as a patient, advocate, and friend. \"He's not afraid to ask the tough questions, ones that we can't always answer immediately, but with collaborations like this, will be able to answer in the future.\" William Ennis, DO, MBA (far right) and a fellow team member interview a patient.

In Compa\u00f1eros: Latino Activists in the Face of AIDS (University of Illinois Press, 2011), Ramirez-Valles writes about the life histories of GBT Latinos who come together to fight racism and homophobia and, in the process, change themselves. \"Compa\u00f1eros tells us what it's like to be an activist, a volunteer, and get involved in community affairs,\" said Ramirez-Valles. \"The book is about Latino gay men and transgender individ - uals, but it speaks to the broader idea of getting involved in the community\u2014not only to change major social forces that shape our lives, but to change our-selves, to connect with others, and in the process become better individuals and better citizens.\"As a public-health researcher, Ramirez-Valles has studied gender and race in health promotion and HIV/AIDS and substance abuse prevention in the United States and Latin America. He also produced a documentary, funded by the National Institutes of Health, featuring individuals in his book. The book and film are based on scientific research on discrimination and stigma and the consequences of these behaviors on GBT Latinos. In the late 1990s, Ramirez-Valles became interested in how HIV/AIDS patients transformed their lives by becoming activists\u2014from protest - ing against the inaction of the federal government to volunteering in the neighborhood to distribute food and take care of patients. He soon realized there were positive effects on self esteem, decreased depression, and improved health outcomes associated with vol - unteerism and activism, and he began writing about the subjective experiences of these individuals, or compa\u00f1eros.Ramirez-Valles hopes the book will change negative attitudes, particularly in the heterosexual community, about HIV/AIDS and that readers will find inspira-tion in the personal stories. \"The life sto-ries of gay men and transgender women are movingly presented with both pas-sion and clarity, giving a feeling of great respect and admiration for a group who heroically turns oppression into a source of resilience and strength, as well as a solidarity seldom seen in contemporary social movements.\" Improving Access to Healthy Food for Chicago's Latinos, African Americans The UIC Midwest Latino Health Research, Training, and Policy Center has received an $850,000 grant to address health disparities in Chicago.

The center provided grants to organizations operating in the Pilsen, Englewood, Humboldt Park, Roseland, Austin, and Logan Square neighborhoods of Chicago.Sheila Castillo, MUPPJesus Ramirez-Valles, PhD OVCR Annu Science of Preven Ting viol ence Violence is something many urban dwellers take for granted as part of the price of living in the city. Researchers at UIC are trying to change this with innovative violence prevention programs that are showing remarkable success. The study of the causes and consequences of violence in communities, and newly discovered methods for prevention, are particular strengths at UIC. The university has world-renowned researchers who are experts on violence, including terrorism, interpersonal violence/victimization, community violence, workplace violence, domestic violence, sexual violence, and school violence. CeaseFire, founded by UIC professor Gary Slutkin, MD, is a scientific initiative that grew out of the Chicago Project for Violence Prevention in the School of Public Health and is now in great demand nationally and globally. \"CeaseFire is an entirely new way of approaching reducing violence\u2014we are treating violence as an epidemic disease,\" said Dr. Slutkin. \"We are shifting the thinking from bad people to acquired or learned behavior that spreads like an infectious disease.\" What separates CeaseFire from other violence reduction methods is its basis on a public-health model, plus a high degree of focus on lethal violence. Dr. Slutkin, professor of epidemiology, School of Public Health, and executive director of CeaseFire, came up with the idea in the mid-1990s after treating infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, cholera, and AIDS, in developing countries, primarily in Africa with the World Health Organization. One of the main reasons CeaseFire works is because the method uses a professionalized system for recruiting and training people in the community to work as outreach workers and interrupters, therefore approaching violence as a disease rather than a law and order problem. \"Interrupters are trained to detect and interrupt events and in the past five years have interrupted 1,400 potentially lethal events,\" said Dr. Slutkin. The initial results of CeaseFire showed an average 45 percent reduction in shootings in five Chicago neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods are now showing reductions of up to 67 percent. CeaseFire was recently show- cased in the film The Interrupters , produced by director Steve James (Hoop Dreams ) and Alex Kotlowitz (There Are No Children Here ), which tells the story of three of Gary Slutkin, MD, with long-time CeaseFire supporter and Chicago media personality Merri Dee at the Chicago premiere of The Interrupters , a movie featuring CeaseFire violence prevention workers.

The film had its world premiere at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. UIC is also home to the Interdisciplinary Center for Research on Violence (ICRV), an informal center that received one of the 2010 Center Seed Grant Awards. This group of approximately 35 scholars from libe ral Arts and Sciences, Public Health, Applied Health Sciences, Social Work, Medicine, and nurs ing has been working on collaborative grants with 24 different community partner organizations in Chicago and statewide. Sarah Ullman, PhD, professor of criminology, law, and justice, and one of the principal investigators for the 2010 Center Seed Grant, said that \"violence is endemic to our society and communities.\" She goes on to explain that \"exposure to violence, including the witnessing of domestic violence by children in the family, is associated with poorer physical and mental health and higher rates of substance abuse, suicidality, and criminal behavior.\" Dr. Ullman is currently conducting an nIH- funded longitudinal study of rape victims' recovery to better understand the risk and protective factors that affect their risk of revictimization and PTSD, substance abuse, and seeking of services. \"UIC is an excellent setting for this work in providing necessary support for health-related research in a large, diverse urban setting where, unfortunately, violence and crime are major issues,\" she said. When asked how he viewed the future of research in this area, Dr. Slutkin noted that the violence-research field is very promising and that the area can be further developed. \"We are now working with 15 cities and five other countries and are expanding into new areas of great interest, including deeper looks at behavior change, norm change, and the use of technology.\" Many researchers in this area agree that the research into violence dovetails other work on health disparities and minority access disparities. This is especially relevant for urban, underserved minority women and children and other diverse populations. Said Dr. Ullman, \"Given the ongoing recession and its likely continued impact in the short- and long-term, violence will continue and has already shown signs of increasing. This warrants continued attention and research-based prevention/intervention strategies, particularly for research universities in urban areas such as UIC.\" Sarah Ullman, PhD OVCR Annu Al Rep ORt 35\" the mission of the mon arch cen ter is to ensure that all personnel programs are incorporating evidence-based practices and that they are preparing educators who can effectively serve children from diverse backgrounds through the use of culturally responsive practices.\" \u2014 N ORMA L OPE z-RE YNA , PhD university of i LLin ois at chicago 36UIC takes pride in the fact that researchers across campus are working to combat health and educational disparities in the neighborhoods surrounding our campus and across the nation. The UIC Monarch Center is focused on just that. The center, the only one of its kind, was established in 2003 to support teacher and related services preparation programs and increase the numbers and quality of their professional graduates. \"The overarching goal of the Monarch Center is to effect posi- tive change in the lives of children with disabilities, particularly those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds,\" said Norma Lopez-Reyna, PhD, associate professor of special education and the center's director. The Monarch Center is a national technical assistance center, funded by the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) in the Department of Education. \"Our pur-pose,\" said Dr. Lopez-Reyna, \"is to provide support, services, and resources to higher-education faculty across the nation who are engaged in personnel preparation of special education teachers, school psychologists, speech language pathologists, occupational therapists, and physical therapists toward serving children and youth with disabilities in school settings.\" The center provides direct technical assistance to faculty who train special educators at minority institutions of higher education (MIHEs) where the enrollment is at least 25 percent minority, including historically black colleges and universi-ties (HBCUs) and tribal colleges serving Native Americans. Statistics show there is an overrepresentation of minority students who are receiving special education services. Researchers theorize that this may be because some teachers are unable to distinguish cultural differences from disabilities and refer minority students to special education when it is not needed. \"Furthermore,\" said Dr. Lopez-Reyna, \"as the proportion of our nation's school pop-ulations continue to grow in cultural and linguistic diversity, it is imperative that all educators be prepared to serve children from diverse backgrounds and with a range of learning abili-ties and needs.\" \"The mission of the Monarch Center is to ensure that all personnel programs are incorpo-rating evidence-based practices,\" said Dr. Lopez-Reyna, \"and that they are preparing educators who can effectively serve children from diverse backgrounds through the use of cultur-ally responsive practices.\" \"We offer work - shops, seminars, and individual consultation on topics including everything from how to write successful grant proposals for obtaining scholarship funding for students, to how to improve the content and quality of course work and field experiences for educators in training. Most important is that we also provide 'follow-along' support after they have attended a workshop or seminar,\" she said. \"We assign a mentor, a more experienced faculty member from another institution, who provides guidance based on their knowledge and experience.\" The Monarch Center's coprincipal investigators are Mary Bay, PhD, associate professor emerita of special education, and Barbara Guillory, PhD, project coordi-nator in special education. All three work as a team to determine Monarch's goals and to design and guide activities to reach these goals, monitor progress, and disseminate results. Over the past eight years, the center has been effective, as evidenced by the doubled probability of grant fund-ing by faculty members who receive their services compared to those who do not and by the detailed reports from faculty regarding the development of new pro-grams and the redesigning of existing programs to better serve future educators. Dr. Lopez-Reyna finds that UIC offers a \"great intersection of excellent colleagues, a multitude of communities that we can work with, a diverse population of students from which to recruit, and strong supports for research.\" MONARCH CENTER TRAINS PROFESSIONALS TO SERVE MINORITy CHILDREN Mary Bay, PhDNorma Lopez-Reyna, PhD The center provides direct technical assistance to faculty who train special educators at minority institutions of higher education (MIHEs) where the enrollment is at least 25 percent minority, including historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and tribal colleges serving Native Americans.

Not even a decade ago, his work on genetic markers informative for ancestry was rebuffed by his colleagues. Now, ten years later, these biomarkers have become standard in research. Dr. Kittles, associate professor of hematology and oncology in the Department of Medicine, studies diseases that dispropor - tionately impact people of African American descent, primarily focusing on prostate cancer. His findings are interesting because many susceptibility loci found in white males are not necessarily risk factors for African American men. Dr. Kittles, who was recruited to UIC in 2010, was part of a large collaborative group across 10 research institutions that recently completed a genetic study examining over 3,500 African American men with prostate cancer. From that study, he found that one of the major regions in the genome that impacts risk is on chromosome 8, but there is no clear gene there. \"You traditionally find DNA variants in genes so you can say that a malfunction in the gene is contributing to the risk, but not in this case. What's interesting about chromosome 8 is that there is no gene in this region of increased risk. In this case, we have what is known as a 'gene desert.'\" Dr. Kittles's work continues to open up new paradigms in genetic research on prostate cancer risk. \"We have improved the predictability of the PSA biomarker test for prostate cancer,\" he said. \"We found that if we also estimated genetic ancestry, we could increase the predictability of the biomarker. This is helping us improve diagnostics to determine who is at a greater risk. We are working on determining the molecular phenotype of the tumors, so we will be able to target the more lethal strain of prostate cancer and be aggressive in treatment.\" Dr. Kittles and colleagues were among the first to develop and utilize ancestry informative markers. \"Biologically, there is a great deal of genetic diversity within the African American population, yet historically there was a lot of neglect in terms of study,\" he said. \"Scientists did not know how to handle so much genetic variation.\" But now, thanks to his research, they can take advantage of that variation and leverage it to map genes for disease. In addition to his research and community outreach, he is scientific director and cofounder of African Ancestry, Inc., a private company that provides DNA testing services for tracing African genetic lineages to genealogists and the general public around the world. Dr. Kittles is committed to prostate cancer because of the disparity in incidence and mortality among underrepresented minorities. Little attention has been placed on Hispanics and African Americans with prostate cancer until now. Educating these groups is just as important as finding ways to treat them, which is why he has also taken on the role of associate director for outreach in the UIC Cancer Center. \"In our attempt to under - stand complex disease, you can't focus on just one group,\" he said. \"You need diversity, and UIC has that.\" PIONEERING GENETIC ANCESTRy RESEARCH Dr. Kittles's research teamEdwin Cook, MD Xavier Llor, MD, PhDThe Institute of Human Genetics (IHG), led by Rick Kittles, PhD, is a new program at UIC whose mission is to investigate the genetic basis of human disease and to translate novel discoveries in human genetics to improve the medical management of human disease.

A lack of governmental oversight is one of the reasons that community and homeowner associations don't function as intended, noted McKenzie, who wrote Beyond Privatopia: Rethinking Residential Private Government. \"The key to effective privatization is maintaining accountability to government standards,\" he said. \"The current system needs clear operational standards, required training in housing association management for affiliated volunteers and professionals, and efficient low-cost grievance procedures.\" A development's control of neighborhood services is often a selling point to potential buyers, but McKenzie points out that the law of common interest communities can often impinge on civil liberties. \"Residents often contend with intrusions an elected government would not be able to make, like a ban on pets or yard decorations,\" he said. \"If things go wrong, the contracts residents must sign to purchase within the community give them little legal recourse.\" \"Municipalities can help the situation by restoring choice to the housing market by ceasing requirements that all new housing be in common interest developments,\" said McKenzie, who is an attorney. He recommends that state governments follow the lead of Nevada, Florida, and Virginia by establishing an intermediary office to handle residents' complaints. Home-owner and condominium associations, land use, and urban politics and policy are among McKenzie's areas of research interest. He also works on related matters as an attorney, consultant, and expert witness. In 2006, his testimony was cited in the first ruling by a federal court that said private home-owner associations must follow constitutional protections such as freedom of speech. Beyond Privatopia is a follow-up to McKenzie's award-winning 1994 book, Privatopia: Homeowner Associations and the Rise of Residential Private Government , from Yale University Press. uIc Faculty books Dennis Judd, PhD, Professor, Political Science CITY POLITICS: THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF URBAN AMERICA Praised for its narrative style, strong research base, and distinctive theme\u2014that urban politics in the United States has evolved as a dynamic interaction between governmental power and private purposes\u2014the Fifth Edition of this text focuses more explicitly on tracing the three distinct periods in the nation's urban development: the industrial era, the era of urban crisis, and the global era.

What may surprise people, accord-ing to Matthew Hall, PhD, assistant professor of sociology, \"is that there are actually more high-skill than low-skill immigrants in the United States today, and the areas with the largest con-centrations of high-skill immigrants are places we don't par-ticularly think of as being high-skill hubs: Pittsburgh, Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, Baltimore, and other old industrial cities.\" This finding, detailed in a new study from the Brookings Institution coauthored by Dr. Hall, The Geography of Immigrant Skills: Educational Profiles of Metropolitan Areas , concludes that the growing economic contributions of America's immi - grants need to be better reflected in national policy. Dr. Hall's hope is that these findings encourage policy makers to think more broadly about immigrant policy. \"We should not just be having a conversation about illegal immigrants in our communities, but focusing on how we can leverage the strengths of the diverse immigrant population we have for our nation's economic advantage,\" he said. Research by Dr. Hall focuses on the causes and consequences of \"new\" (post-1980) immigration. Most of his work focuses on immigrant settlement in emerging destination areas\u2014commu - nities outside of the major gateways of New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles. For example, he has examined where, within these broader areas, immigrants settle and with whom they share neighborhoods, how immigrants in these labor markets fare economically, and the impact of local immigration on native-born residential and economic outcomes. Dr. Hall's research has also shown that \"immigrant-native segregation is higher in 'new' destina-tions than in traditional gateways.\" While undocumented immigration tends to bolster segregation between Mexican immigrants and native whites, it actually has the opposite impact for segregation between Mexican immigrants and native blacks\u2014leading to more inte-gration between the two groups. The research, he said, \"shows that we need to be sensitive to how responses to immigration vary by location and by group. More specifically, we need to be mindful that immigration has the potential to bring great benefits to communities, but that the native populations in 'new' areas often respond negatively to immigrants. What the mechanisms behind these responses are clearly needs to be on the future research agenda.\" UIC and its students have gained advantages from his research. \"I believe my research has been beneficial to the UIC commu-nity as the perspective I bring\u2014one that is interdisciplinary in focus\u2014is unique to the campus,\" Dr. Hall said. Dr. Hall also has an appointment as an assistant professor in the Institute of Government and Public Affairs. \"It is very important for me to be affiliated with a department that includes a mix of academics and researchers from several different disciplines who are interested in engaging the nonacademic world,\" he explained. Dr. Hall said he chose UIC because of its strong reputation as a top-tier urban university. \"UIC, and particularly the depart-ments I am affiliated with, have outstanding scholars who push me to improve my research in impor- tant and varied ways,\" he noted. \"Moreover, being able to observe and study the populations that I am interested in within the City of Chicago is incredibly valuable.\" SOCIOLOGy PROFESSOR BRINGS WISDOM TO EMOTIONAL IMMIGRATION DEBATE Matthew Hall, PhD While undocumented immigration tends to bolster segregation between Mexican immigrants and native whites, it actually has the opposite impact for segregation between Mexican immigrants and native blacks \u2014leading to more integration between the two groups. OVCR Annu Al Re pORt 47Fuel cells that use hydrogen or methane to generate electricity in chemical reactions\u2014while shedding only harmless byprod-ucts like water\u2014are dream products for anyone searching for clean, alternative ways to power tomorrow's vehicles. While high hurdles stand before the cheap manufacturing of fuel cells, engineers and scientists at UIC and Argonne National Laboratory are starting a tightly focused research project to develop solid-oxide fuel cells to meet this goal. \"Solid-oxide fuel cells offer the potential to scale down to very small dimensions,\" said Christos Takoudis, PhD, professor of bioengineering and chemical engineering. Dr. Takoudis is lead investigator in a new $475,000 National Science Foundation grant to investigate ways to synthesize and characterize this type of fuel cell in a lower temperature range than currently used. Solid-oxide fuel cells oxidize fuels by electrochemical conver- sion to create electricity, using a solid oxide as the electrolyte between an anode and cathode circuit. While their small size and solid state are attractive, the higher operating tempera-tures required by solid-oxide fuel cells\u2014as high as 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014are a big drawback. Dr. Takoudis and his colleagues hope they can lower the operating temperatures to an \"intermediate range\" of between 1,100 and 1,500 degrees. They also want to see if such fuel cells can be created at the \"nano\" level, measuring thickness in mere single-digit layers of atoms.\"We're trying to come up with new materials and processes to make these fuel cells very efficient at lower temperatures. Material and design demands for higher temperatures are much more severe and require additional precautionary mea-sures,\" Dr. Takoudis said. \"As dimensions shrink, it becomes even more important because the actual contact area is much greater with respect to the total volume than it is in bigger systems,\" he said. UIC researchers will grow materials to test as potential solid anodes, cathodes, and electrolytes for the fuel cells. They will then use Takoudis's lab and Argonne's Advanced Photon Source for a close probe of the materials as they generate electricity. Jeffrey Miller, PhD, leader of Argonne's heterogeneous catalysis group, will oversee that part of the work. Other project investigators working with Dr. Takoudis include Gregory Jursich, PhD, and Alan zdunek, PhD, adjunct professors of engineering, and Robert Klie, PhD, associate professor of physics. Creating microscopic-sized, cooler-operating, highly efficient solid-oxide fuel cells may open up a world of possible applica-tions that are both ecologically benign and cheap. \"Today's cost of fuel cells is prohibitive,\" Dr. Takoudis said. \"Our group wants to push the technology envelope to help make the costs reasonable and create a power source that does little harm to the environment.\"IN SEARCH OF CLEANER, SAFER POWER Story by Paul FrancuchChristos Takoudis, PhD University of ill inois at chicago 48Cool Idea Gets Warm response The pitch for the award-winning thermos-like invention Alan Feinerman, PhD, developed makes you want to listen closely. It's called a tensile \"vacuum insulation panel,\" or \"VIP\" for short, and he says it can reduce diesel fuel consumption by 75 percent for refrigerated trailers. He estimates this would save 360 million gallons of diesel fuel each year in the United States\u2014\"nearly the volume of the Willis Tower.\" Dr. Feinerman, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering, won the $30,000 business concept award in the 2011 Clean Energy Challenge, a contest that pits area companies against each other for the best clean energy business ideas. While flat VIPs already exist, Dr. Feinerman says his design is better because of its inexpensive tensile supports, stainless steel puncture-resistant exterior, and minimal heat loss at the edges. Dr. Feinerman is building his first prototype. National Science Foundation funding helped get the project started. The Clean Energy win means an additional $15,000 match from the NSF to help keep it going. The Clean Energy prize will help pay for salaries and equipment for a company Dr. Feinerman and three UIC MBA students started, Thermal Conservation Technologies. \"The students did an incredible job pitching the concept at business plan competitions across the country,\" he said. \"I think they won an award in every competition.\" Two of the students took a buy-out after Dr. Feinerman received NSF funding. He continues to work with James Parks, who studied under Rod Shrader, PhD, associate professor of managerial studies, and doctoral student Prateek Gupta. Dr. Feinerman hopes to expand into refrigerator, oven, and building insulation. \"Our VIP offers significant energy, cost, and space savings\u2014and is scalable,\" he said. The Clean Energy Challenge is part of the Clean Energy Trust, funded by a U.S. Department of Energy grant. It was founded in 2010 by Chicago investor Nicholas Pritzker and Michael Polsky, president and CEO of Chicago-based Invenergy, a wind-power firm. Alan Feinerman, PhDStory by Paul Francuch dr. alan Feinerman was named the 2011 UIC Inventor of the Year. His groundbreaking research into the development of ultra-low thermal conductivity insulation panels, combined with a firm dedication to seeing his discoveries transition from the lab to the marketplace, truly reflect the outstanding spirit of innovation and inventorship that exists across the UIC campus.
