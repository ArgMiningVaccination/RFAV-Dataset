Across European Union member states, life expectancy at birth was about 69 years in 1960 and raised to about 81 years in 2017 [2, 3]. At the same time, total fertility rates have declined sharply since the post-World War II baby boom [2]. As a consequence, the population structure has considerably changed in the past decades. The number of older people (i.e. people aged 65 years and older) in today's Western society has been growing in absolute and relative numbers, and is expected to further increase in the decades to come [4]. The process of getting older brings both gains and losses. On the one hand, ageing is being accompanied by increased life experience, freedom and time for new interests and social activities [5, 6]. On the other hand, it should be mentioned that many older people fear growing older because of possible deteriorations in health, affecting their wellbeing and independence [6]. The literature confirms that aging is a well -established risk factor for the development of multiple (chronic) diseases and disabilities [7, 8]. These often challenge older people's social participation and independent living, and result in complex care needs [9-11]. Despite limitations older people with complex care needs are confronted with, they want to preserve their autonomy and independence and live a meaningful life in their homes and communities for as much as they can [12, 13]. Furthermore, governments in and outside Europe are pursuing an agenda that seek to enable older people to participate in society and to live at home for as long as possible [14-16]. In order to support older people with complex care needs to live at home for as long as possible, mobilisation of both health care services (such as nursing or home physiotherapy) and social care services (such as assistance with instrumental activities of daily living or making adaptations to the home environment) are required [17, 18]. However, collaboration and alignment between professionals within and between health and social care organisations is a major challenge [19-21]. As a result, care and support for older people are experienced fragmented, and are lacking continuity and coordination. This has negative consequences for an older person, including gaps in care, underestimation of accumulation of risks and deficits, duplicative tests, adverse drug events, unnecessary hospitalisations and increased use of emergency facilities [22-25]. In order to address such challenges, integrated health and social care is increasingly being promoted to be a promising approach for organising care and support for with complex care needs [18]. Integrated care aims to achieve better patient and staff experiences of care, improved health and wellbeing and lower health and social care costs [26-28]. Efforts to integrate health and social care services In addition to being a promising approach, integrated care is also considered a complex phenomenon and subject of many unanswered questions. The literature shows that underlying definitions and conceptualisations of integrated care differ considerably [29, 30]. This diversity is reflected in existing integrated care initiatives. Across Europe and beyond, several integrated care initiatives have been initiated that proactively seek to structure and coordinate care and support for older people with complex care needs living at home, centred around older people's needs and preferences [31-35]. These initiatives have been developed in a wide range of settings and contexts and show great diversity in the types of care services they provide, the aims they pursue, the populations they serve, and their outcomes or impact on clinical and organisational level [36-39]. On the one hand, this rich and varied field of practical examples shows that integrated care initiatives have been tailored to the specific context for which they were designed. On the other hand, this heterogeneity makes it challenging to compare integrated care initiatives and their outcomes, and to exchange knowledge of what works and what does not work across different care settings and countries. As a result, integrated care initiatives are struggling how to learn from each other and to successfully implement and improve integrated care for older people in practice. In order to support the exchange of good practices across national borders, including meaningful interpretation of lessons learned, it is important to understand about whom (i.e. older people targeted by integrated care initiatives) we are talking exactly. Yet, there is still much to learn about the characteristics of older people living at home in Europe in terms of their health and functioning, specifically regarding differences and similarities between different European populations. Also knowledge of older people's perspectives on living independent in their own homes and their needs and preferences in relation to initiating and receiving care and support is still limited. In addition to facilitating exchange of knowledge across countries, these insights will also provide starting-points for designing and improving integrated care that is tailored to the health and social care needs and preferences of older people in Europe. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the characteristics of older people living at home in Europe in terms of their health and functioning as well as their needs and preferences for care and support is necessary. 1 1 Furthermore, the literature shows that improvements to specific aspects of integrated care initiatives appeared to be necessary, including person-centredness, prevention-orientation, safety, efficiency and coordination of care and support [37, 40-44]. Although widely acknowledged and pursued, the further development and improvement of integrated care initiatives is considered to be a difficult task, even more because knowledge of successfully improving integrated care is limited. The specific ambitions for improving integrated care, the factors that facilitate or impede successful improvements and the eventual outcomes of improvements (which are all embedded in local contexts of integrated care initiatives) are not yet studied [45]. As a result, a general understanding of what does and does not work and with what specific outcomes when improving integrated care is lacking. To better understand how to improve integrated care, a first essential step is to gain insight into the barriers to integrated care and whether they differ across the varied field of integrated care initiatives. Also knowledge of which possible improvement areas are prioritised and possible to address considering the local contexts, as well as which improvement activities are developed in order to improve integrated care are helpful but still lacking. Therefore, more insights into what integrated care for older people looks like across different countries and care settings in Europe, including barriers to integrated care, and what ambitions integrated care initiatives have for improving their current practices need to be obtained. Improving person-centredness in integrated care One of the main aspects of integrated care that would benefit from quality improvement activities is person-centredness [46, 47]. During the past decades, a movement has taken place from the conventional way of practicing medicine, often labelled the 'biomedical model', towards a more psychosocially oriented model of care. The biomedical model focuses on biological (somatic) processes [48]. The role of the patient is limited to reporting illnesses, disorders, injuries and other related health conditions after which doctors were tasked to respond to these reports through standardised investigation, diagnosis and treatment [49]. In the movement towards a more psychosocial model of care, increasing attention is paid to the psychological, social and meaningful living aspects in organising care and support, in addition to the physical domain of health and functioning [50, 51]. In this approach, the provision of care and support centred around individual needs and preferences, across all domains of health and functioning, is an important aspect [49, 52]. Many different definitions of person-centredness have been proposed over the years [47, 49, 53-56]. Common elements in these definitions include: 1) empowering and encouraging people to participate actively, as equal partners, decision-making process regarding their own care, and/or to manage their own health and care; 2) establishing an accommodating, cooperative and ongoing relationship between the professional, the person receiving care and the informal carer, including respectful communication and active listening; 3) having an understanding of the specific (health) concerns of the person, and their individual needs and preferences; 4) addressing all domains of health (i.e. the physical, cognitive, psychological and social health domains); and 5) providing coordinated care to achieve continuity and coherence of care and support [52]. Integrated care initiatives for older people with complex care needs has made efforts in order to organise services more comprehensively around older people's individual needs and foster person-centred care. A prevalent intervention component within integrated care initiatives is the needs assessment, also referred to as the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) [30, 40, 44, 57-60]. A CGA is performed to increase the understanding of an older person's problems and impairments in health and functioning as well as their individual care needs, wishes and preferences in order to tailor care and support services accordingly [61]. Even though the CGA and other activities are implemented to organise services around older people's individual needs, it remains unclear whether these further improve person-centred care [46, 47, 62, 63]. Knowledge of the range of different activities undertaken to promote person-centredness and their applicability in different integrated care contexts is limited, as well as experiences with these activities from both the service provider and service user perspective. Therefore, a better understanding of activities undertaken that aimed to promote person-centredness in the context of integrated care for older people with complex care needs as well as experiences with these activities, from multiple perspectives, is needed. Aim and outline of this thesis To take a step forward in the development of integrated care that is tailored to the needs and preferences of older people living at home in Europe, this doctoral thesis has the following research aims:1. To describe the characteristics of older people living at home in Europe in terms of their health and functioning, and their needs and preferences to keep living independently at home. 1 1 2. To explore what integrated care for older people with complex care needs looks like across different countries and care settings in Europe, and to gain insight into the ambitions of integrated care initiatives for improving integrated care delivery. 3. To provide insight into activities undertaken that aimed to promote person-centredness in the context of integrated care for older people with complex care needs, and to explore experiences with these activities. Several steps were taken to work towards these aims, which are covered in the following chapters (see also Table 1). Chapter 2 describes and compares problems and impairments in health and functioning of older people receiving care and support at home served across different European countries from a multidimensional approach. Chapter 3 provides insights into older people's needs and preferences for receiving care and support in relation to continue living at home with problems and impairments in health and functioning. Chapter 4 describes the overall structure and approach of the Horizon 2020 research project called \"SUSTAIN\", which stands for \"Sustainable Tailored Integrated care for older people in Europe\". In this project, improvements to integrated care initiatives for older people living at home with complex care needs, across different countries and regions in Europe, have been designed, implemented and evaluated to gain insight into improving integrated care. Chapter 5 follows this by providing insight into the characteristics and existing ways of working of the integrated care initiatives participating in this project. This chapter also describes the plans local stakeholders of participating integrated care initiatives designed to improve existing ways of working. Chapter 6 dives deeper into one of the main themes of the improvement plans that are designed by the participating integrated care initiatives, which is to improve their person-centred way of working. This chapter features the activities undertaken as part of integrated care initiatives to promote person-centredness in care and support for older people and explores experiences with these activities from both the care provider and care recipient perspective. Chapter 7 further addresses one of these activities aimed at promoting person-centredness, which is conducting a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) to assess an older person's health and functioning as well as their care needs and preferences. This chapter provides insight into the many different CGA instruments and procedures for conducting them that are used in different integrated care initiatives for older people. Finally, Chapter 8 discusses the findings of this thesis and addresses their implications for practice, policy and research in the field of integrated and person-centred care and support for older introduction Table 1.

European governments are looking for sustainable solutions to organise community care in line with older people's needs. There is great interest in knowledge and experiences that can be shared across countries since they face similar challenges. For this, insight into the health and functioning of community care recipients in different countries is also necessary. Currently, these insights from a multidimensional perspective on health are lacking. This study therefore aims to provide a comprehensive picture of health and functioning and explore potential differences between older community care recipients across Europe. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted as part of the \"Identifying best practices for care-dependent elderly by Benchmarking costs and outcomes of community Care\" (IBenC) project. The study included 2884 older community care recipients from six European countries. Data were collected on impairments in different health domains, using the interRAI Home Care assessment instrument. Results Health and functioning substantially varied across the samples of community care recipients from Belgium, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Italy and the Netherlands. Overall, the Dutch sample of community care recipients experienced the fewest impairments, whereas the highest prevalence rates of almost all impairments were found in the Italian sample. Only impairments in the social domain were least often observed among Italian community care recipients compared to the other samples. Discussion Variations in the European community care contexts, such as in access to and financing of long-term care systems, are expected to contribute to these differences in health and functioning. This implies that, when sharing experiences and lessons learned about the organisation of European community care across contexts, the variation between community care recipients from different countries should be taken into account. and functioning of older community care recipients in Europe Background Across Europe, the majority of people keep living in their homes and communities until old age. As they get older, people often face multiple problems and limitations. This can affect independent living and social participation, which in turn increase their need for informal and formal care [1, 2]. Community care services are available to support older people with their health and social care needs [3, 4]. The demand for community care is expected to increase due to demographic developments, and an expected decrease in the availability of informal care. In addition, ongoing workforce shortages in the care sectors are putting pressure on community care services. European governments are therefore looking for sustainable solutions to organise community care effectively around older people's needs [4]. Much research has been conducted on how to organise and improve community care services in European regions and countries. The exchange of experiences and lessons learned between European countries can contribute to knowledge about improving community care. To facilitate the application and adaptation of experiences and lessons learned to other European regions and countries, insight into potential differences in community care between countries is considered necessary. Comparative studies show that characteristics of older community care recipients differ between European countries, for instance, in terms of marital status, living arrangements and the amount of informal support they receive. This variation is associated with cultural traditions, such as populations' attitudes towards marriage and the role of informal caregivers [4, 5]. Different financing, delivery and governance of community care across Europe may play a role as well (e.g. availability of formal care) [4, 6, 7]. These differences in access to and financing of community care are also expected to result in differences in health and functioning of community care recipients across countries [6, 8]. The few available studies that explored international variation in the health and functioning of older community care recipients mostly, but not exclusively, concentrated on physical and cognitive limitations [5, 9-13]. The measures used to evaluate health and functioning often included: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) dependence, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) dependence, falls, urinary incontinence and cognitive impairment. A broader perspective on health, which also includes other domains, such as psychological and social health, is gradually being adopted in research, policy and practice [2, 14]. This means that other aspects, such as anxiety, depressive symptoms, loneliness, and social functioning, are increasingly being included in health assessments, such as the interRAI Nevertheless, international comparative studies often do not report from this broader approach to health, which focus goes beyond addressing the individual health domains [5, 11, 13, 16]. As a result, little is known about the health and functioning of community care recipients in Europe from a multidimensional perspective. However, such insights are important, especially since for older people, a broader view on health better reflects what is important to them [2, 17, 18]. The aim of this study is, therefore, to provide a comprehensive picture of the health and functioning of older community care recipients being served by community care organisations from different European regions and countries. This will provide insight into the extent to which various domains of health and functioning differ between community care populations in Europe. Methods Setting and study population This study was conducted within the European project \"Identifying best practices for care-dependent elderly by Benchmarking costs and outcomes of community Care\" (IBenC). This project aimed to develop a new benchmark methodology based on the quality of care and cost of care utilisation, to identify best practices in community care in Europe. Six European countries participated in this project: Belgium, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Italy, and the Netherlands. Ethical approval for the IBenC study was obtained from authorised medical ethical committees according to local regulations in each of the participating countries. The design of the IBenC project was described in detail elsewhere [19]. Data were collected from older people who received community care services from one of the community care organisations that participated in the IBenC project. In the IBenC project, a community care organisation was defined as a professional care organisation that offers health and social services, including nursing care, personal care, and/or domestic care for older people in their home environments. Different types of community care organisations were recruited to participate in the IBenC project to reflect the variety of these organisations. Large and small organisations, organisations located in urban and rural areas, and organisations structured by top-down management and self-steering teams were included. In total, 38 community care organisations participated in the study: eighteen in Belgium, three in Finland, eleven in Germany, one in Iceland, two in Italy, and three in the Netherlands. and functioning of older community care recipients in Europe Community care recipients were eligible to participate in this study if they: 1) received community care services for at least fourteen days from an organisation that participated in the IBenC project, 2) were aged 65 years or older, 3) lived in their own homes, and 4) were expected to remain care recipient of the community care organisation for at least six months after inclusion. This means that this study specifically focused on long-term community care recipients. Community care recipients with (severe) cognitive impairments who did not have a known informal caregiver or legal representative were excluded from the study. All participating community care recipients living in the same country together represented the sample of community care recipients for that specific country (e.g. all participants living in Finland represented the Finnish sample, and all participants living in Italy represented the Italian sample). Data collection Data were collected among community care recipients using the interRAI HomeCare-Assessment (interRAI HC) [20]. The and fully structured comprehensive geriatric assessment instrument designed to assist the care planning process for older people receiving community care services. It comprises approximately 320 items that can provide valuable information on the characteristics of older people receiving community care services. The interRAI HC includes demographic information, health and functioning, home environment, informal care, and medical diagnoses and conditions. All items from the interRAI assessments proved to have good reliability across countries and care settings [21]. The reliability and validity of the main scales that are embedded in this instrument were extensively tested in multiple national and multinational studies [22]. Validated language versions of the interRAI HC were available in all languages required for this study. Researchers from the IBenC project approached community care recipients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Eligible community care recipients were informed in writing or orally about the IBenC study, and were then invited to participate. Participants provided (written) informed consent before entering the study. Trained nurses and research staff carried out interRAI HC assessments in the homes of the older community care recipients specifically for this study. In three organisations the interRAI HC was used in routine care practice (both Italian organisations and one Dutch organisation). Informed consent was not required for community care recipients that received services from one of these organisations, following local ethical regulations. After de-identification, these organisations transferred assessment data anonymously to the national study centres. 2 Outcome measures Different background characteristics of community care recipients were assessed, including age, sex, living situation, and informal care provision. Impairments in the different health domains were assessed using one or multiple scales or items that were selected from the interRAI HC. This selection was based on outcome measures that are common in the literature on (domains of) older people's health and functioning. Physical health The physical domain was represented by four impairments (or problems): ADL dependency, IADL dependency, recent falls and urinary incontinence. When community care recipients experienced at least one of these four impairments, they were categorised as an recipient with an impairment in the physical domain. ADL and IADL dependency were evaluated with the ADL Hierarchy scale (ADLH) [23], and IADL Capacity Hierarchy scale (IADLCH) [24]. The ADLH groups four types of activities of daily living according to the stage of the disablement process in which they occur. Early loss ADL items (for example, personal hygiene) were assigned lower scores than late loss ADL items (for example, eating). The ADLH scores ranged from 0 to 6, with a higher score indicating a higher level of ADL dependence. A score of 3 or higher was an indication of ADL dependence, which means that extensive ADL support is needed. The IADLCH identified five early, mid and late loss IADL areas. Early loss IADLs (for example, ordinary housework) are assigned lower scores than late loss IADLs (for example, managing medications). The IADLCH scores ranged from 0 to 6, with a higher score indicating less capacity in performing IADLs. A score of 4 or higher was an indication of IADL dependence, which means that a person was dependent in at least two IADL areas. Recent falls were measured with the item on whether the community care recipient had experienced a fall recently. At least one fall in the last 30 days indicated a recent fall. Urinary incontinence was evaluated by the item about incontinent episodes over the last three days. Any (infrequent) incontinence, including the use of a urinary catheter or urinary and functioning of older community care recipients in Europe Cognitive health The cognitive domain was represented by the presence of cognitive impairments, which were evaluated using the Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS) [25]. The CPS combines information on decision-making capacity, memory impairment, level of consciousness, and executive functioning. CPS scores ranged from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating a more severe cognitive impairment. A score of 3 or higher was used to indicate the presence of cognitive impairment. Mental health The mental health domain was represented by the presence of symptoms of a mood disorder. Mental health was measured using the Depression Rating Scale (DRS) [26]. The DRS is used as a clinical screening tool for symptoms of a mood disorder and includes seven items, including for instance repetitive anxious complaints, persistent anger, and crying and tearfulness. DRS scores ranged from 0 to 14, with higher scores indicating more significant depressive symptoms. Scores of 3 or higher indicated minor or major depressive symptoms. Social domain For social functioning, three problems were considered: the presence of feelings of loneliness, limited participation in social activities and a limited social network. When community care recipients experienced at least one of these three problems, they were categorised as a recipient with an impairment in the social domain. Loneliness was measured by a single item on whether the community care recipient indicated to feel lonely. Limited participation in social activities was measured by an item on whether the community care recipient participated in social activities of long-standing interest recently. A limited social network was assessed by an item on whether the community care recipient had visits with long-standing social relations/family recently. For limited social participation and limited social network, response options included 'never', 'more than 30 days ago', '8-30 days 'in last 3 days', and 'unable to determine'. Community care recipients that responded with 'never', 'more than 30 days ago' or '8-30 days ago' were considered as having limited participation in social activities or a limited social network. 2 In addition to the individual health domains, a comprehensive picture of community care recipients' health and functioning across different domains was summarised in one measure of frailty. Frailty was assessed using the Frailty Index (FI) [27]. The FI is an instrument to measure levels of frailty in older populations based on the deficit accumulation approach, and contains deficits from all health domains. An FI was constructed in the interRAI HC data [28], using standard procedures as outlined by Searle et al [27]. FI scores ranged from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating higher levels of frailty. A cutoff point of 0.25 or higher was used to indicate the presence of frailty [29]. Analysis Means and prevalence were calculated to describe the main characteristics and health status of the study sample. To enable comparison of impairments between different samples of community care recipients, the prevalence of community care recipients suffering from each defined impairment within a country were described. Analyses were performed using Statistical Software for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 24 for Windows. Results General characteristics Data were collected from a total of 2884 older community care recipients (Table 1). The mean age of the total sample was approximately 83 years, and approximately two-thirds of the sample were female. Age and sex of community care recipients were similar across most countries, except for the Italian sample, in which the proportion of women was relatively lower. In the Belgian, Italian and Icelandic samples, an informal caregiver was almost always available, in contrast to German, Finnish or Dutch samples, where this was less often the case. In the Italian sample, community care recipients received a higher number of hours of informal care as compared to other countries. Health and functioning Table 2 reports the absolute number of impairments for each community care recipient, expressed in the physical, cognitive, mental and social domains of health and functioning. The Dutch sample experienced the lowest number of impairments, whereas the Italian sample experienced the highest number of impairments (2.15 vs. 4.29, and functioning of older community care recipients in Europe country samples, impairments in the physical and social domains were more often observed than impairments in the mental and cognitive domains.

The prevalence of ADL dependence substantially differed between countries. It was highest in the Italian and Belgian samples (80.3 and 82.0%, resp.) and lowest in the Icelandic, Dutch and Finnish samples (8.3, 8.4 and 13.2%, resp.). The prevalence of IADL dependence was highest in the Italian and Belgian samples (84.0 and 81.0%, resp.) and lowest in the Dutch sample (29.7%). Urinary incontinence was also more prevalent in the Italian and Belgian samples (71.9 and 83.4%, resp.), compared to the other European samples. Compared to the other impairments, the prevalence of falls was relatively similar across the different country samples (i.e. ranging from 6.5% in the German sample to 17.0% in the Italian sample). The prevalence of cognitive impairments was lowest in the Dutch sample (1.8%) and highest in the Italian and German samples (37.1 and 27.4%, resp.). The differences in the prevalence of depressive symptoms between samples of community care recipients were smaller (i.e. ranging from 12.1% in the Finnish sample to 25.6% in the Belgian sample). The proportion of community care recipients that reported feelings of loneliness differed across the samples, with the highest prevalence in the Dutch sample (31.2%) and the lowest prevalence in the Italian sample (8.9%). In all samples, the proportion of community care recipients with limited participation in social activities was high, with the highest prevalence found in the Italian and Icelandic samples (78.9 and 80.7%, resp.). Also differences in the prevalence of a limited social network were small between the European samples, except for the German sample which showed a relatively high prevalence (71.5%). Multidimensionality As an overall measure that captures all domains of health and functioning, the Frailty Index showed that the prevalence of frailty among community care recipients was high among European care recipients (Table 2). The highest frailty rates were observed in Italian, Belgian, and German samples (97.7, 94.8 and 86.8%, resp.) and the lowest rate in the Dutch sample (50.3%). Table 3 shows the proportion of community care recipients that experienced impairments in different health domains simultaneously. Across all country samples, at least half of the community care recipients experienced impairments in two or more domains 2 Figure 1. Differences between six European countries in prevalence of impairments, expressed in deviations from the overall sample and functioning of older community care recipients in Europe simultaneously (i.e. ranging from 54.1% in the Dutch sample to 87.9% in the Italian sample).

Overall, the lowest prevalence rates of impairments were found in the Dutch sample. The Italian sample reflected the highest prevalence rates of almost all impairments. The only exception was feelings of loneliness, which were least often observed among the Italian sample. The majority of community care recipients that were studied experienced multiple impairments, and in two or more health domains simultaneously. Variations among European community care recipients To show differences and similarities in the health and functioning across Europe, previous studies often compared regions that were defined based on their physical geography. However, it is uncertain whether such comparisons make sense, since these studies came to contradictory conclusions. Some studies showed that northern and western European countries have lower prevalence rates of impairments in community care recipients 2 compared to southern and eastern European countries. This was specifically the case for ADL and IADL dependency and cognitive impairments [5, 11, 30]. Other studies, however, observed a high prevalence of ADL dependency in western European countries, for instance, in Germany [5, 11]. Our study also showed relatively high prevalence rates in the southern European country Italy, as well as in the western European countries Germany and Belgium. In line with the existing literature, geographical differences were not very clear in our findings, although it should be noted that community care recipients living in eastern and southern European regions were less well represented in our study. We should, therefore, be careful in drawing conclusions based on regions defined by their physical geography. The variation between countries is more likely to be explained by differences in accessibility and financing of community care, and in the availability of other long-term care services, such as nursing home care [6]. Across European countries, the percentages of people who receive long-term care at home differ [4, 31]. Germany and Italy have the lowest rates of people receiving long-term community care, while these countries, together with Finland, have the highest percentages of people over 65 years of age across the six observed countries [32]. In Italy and Germany, only individuals with the highest levels of care need are eligible for community care services, while, for instance, in Scandinavia and the Netherlands, also people with a relatively lower need of care are eligible for such services [4]. These eligibility criteria were reflected in the health and functioning of the Italian sample, and to a lesser extent, also in the German sample in this study. Particularly the Italian sample experienced a high number of impairments as compared to the other European samples. In addition, in Belgium and Germany, eligibility for community care is highly dependent on the level of ADL dependency [33, 34], which explains the higher prevalence of ADL dependence in these two samples. Some cultural factors may also be relevant when interpreting the findings from our study [4]. Across Europe, different values exist with regard to families' moral and legal obligations to care for the older family members [4, 35]. In some countries and regions, for instance in central and southern regions of Italy (which were also included in our study), families are expected to care for older people, rather than professionals. Therefore the number of informal care hours is high in these countries [36]. Several of these countries also have lower availability and accessibility of long term formal care services [4, 37, 38]. In countries that strongly rely on informal care, the majority of older people therefore remain in their homes with support from their families, but also from an increasing of older community care recipients in Europe number of contracted immigrant workers [7, 8]. This way, older people with multiple severe impairments in health and functioning can remain living in their homes instead of moving to residential or nursing care homes. The presence of informal care networks and the restricted access to formal care services could explain why the Italian sample of community care recipients experienced the highest number of impairments compared to the samples from the other countries. Methodological considerations This study aimed to enhance the understanding of the health and functioning across a variety of community care contexts in Europe. We were able to measure health and functioning consistently across countries by using a uniform instrument in the form of the interRAI HC [21]. Additionally, nurses and research staff who conducted the assessments followed a standardised training on the interRAI HC, which enhanced the quality of the data. Furthermore, we addressed the different sampling strategies that were used in this study. Most participants were enrolled in the study after an invitation to participate and provision of informed consent. However, for both Italian organisations and one Dutch organisation, the interRAI HC was an aspect of usual care, which meant that potential selection bias because of study refusal could not take place. To explore potential bias due to these different sampling strategies, we analysed differences in socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex) of the Dutch sample, because in that specific population both sampling strategies were applied. We analysed potential differences between these Dutch subpopulations with the independent t-test and chi-square test and found no statistically significant differences. This suggests that sampling bias was not an issue in this study. A limitation of this study is that we remain uncertain about the representativeness of our samples. We aimed to examine representative samples of 'typical users' by selecting diverse community care organisations. However, only a limited number of organisations per country were included in this study. Furthermore, in organisations where recipients were invited to participate, they likely experienced selective sampling. For example, for two Dutch organisations community care recipients were recruited using postal invitations. In these organisations, only limited numbers of persons with cognitive impairment were included since it was difficult to seek informed consent from their legal representatives. In addition, the use of postal invitations in the Netherlands could have result in acceptation to participate in this study of mainly people with less 2 2 severe conditions, compared to other countries where people were, for instance, invited in person [39]. This may have influenced the representativeness of the Dutch sample. Nevertheless, IADL and ADL dependency prevalence rates in our German, Icelandic, Dutch, Italian, and Finnish samples closely reflect prevalence rates as previously reported in national reference data and the literature [5, 8]. For other domains of health and functioning, these data were not available. Implications for policy and practice Since the prevalence of (chronic) diseases, multimorbidity, and physical disabilities increases with age [40], also this study found that a high number of older people suffer from multiple problems in the physical domain of health. However, in contrast to earlier international comparative studies, this study adopted a broader approach and also assessed cognitive, mental and social domains of health and functioning. Through adopting this broader approach, we were able to show that, in addition to problems in the physical domain, the majority of older community care recipients experienced multiple impairment(s) and in two or more health domains simultaneously. Impairments in the physical domain and social domain were often observed together. Existing literature also shows that impairments in different domains are often closely associated with each other. People with urinary incontinence, for example, are more likely to be socially isolated and to experience difficulties in participating in in social activities [41], and ADL and IADL abilities are often negatively impacted by reduced cognitive functioning [42]. The simultaneous occurrence and interrelatedness of impairments across different domains imply that a comprehensive approach to care, comprising both health and social services, is necessary. Furthermore, it can be helpful for European regions and countries to work together, share knowledge and inspire each other in order to tackle cross-border challenges and further improve community care that is tailored to older people's needs. However, policy-makers should be aware that characteristics, such as health and functioning, of community care populations can substantially differ across Europe when learning from and adopting experiences from across national borders. Addressing similarities and differences between populations may also improve the interpretation of findings from cross-European studies on community care for older people. To further support comparisons, more insight into the characteristics of community care populations in Europe is still needed. A question that could benefit from more research includes, for and functioning of older community care recipients in Europe instance, which other contextual factors are related to the observed differences in the health and functioning between different European samples. Conclusion This study showed that there are substantial differences in the health and functioning of community care recipients in research samples from across different European countries. These differences may be partly explained by differences in eligibility criteria for community care services. The variation between community care recipients needs to be considered when sharing experiences and lessons learned on improving community care across national borders. 2 DJ, Frijters DH, LA, Jansen AP, Nijpels G, van Hout HP.

International Journal of and of older community care recipients in Europe early detection initiatives: a qualitative study exploring perspectives of older people and professionals Lette M, Stoop A, Lemmens LC, 3 Abstract Background A wide range of initiatives on early detection and intervention have been developed to proactively identify problems related to health and wellbeing in (frail) older people, with the aim of supporting them to live independently for as long as possible. Nevertheless, it remains unclear what the best way is to design such initiatives and how older people's needs and preferences can be best addressed. This study aimed to address this gap in the literature by exploring: 1) older people's perspectives on health and living environment in relation to living independently at home; 2) older people's needs and preferences in relation to initiating and receiving care and support; and 3) professionals' views on what would be necessary to enable the alignment of early detection initiatives with older people's own needs and preferences. Methods In this qualitative study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 36 older people and 19 professionals in proactive elderly care. Data were analysed using the framework analysis method. Results From the interviews with older people important themes in relation to health and living environment emerged, such as maintaining independence, appropriate housing, social relationships, a supporting network and a sense of purpose and autonomy. Older people preferred to remain self-sufficient, and they would rather not ask for help for psychological or social problems. However, the interviews also highlighted that they were not always able or willing to anticipate future needs, which can hinder early detection or early intervention. At the same time, professionals indicated that older people tend to over-estimate their self-reliance and therefore advocated for early detection and intervention, including social and psychological issues. Conclusion Older people have a broad range of needs in different domains of life. Discrepancies exist between older people and professionals with regard to their views on timing and scope of early detection initiatives. This study aimed to reveal starting-points for better alignment between initiatives and older people's needs and preferences. Such starting points may support policy makers and care professionals involved in early detection initiatives to make more informed decisions. initiatives: a qualitative study Background Due to the expected acceleration of population ageing, health systems are challenged to offer care and support to an increasing number of older people [1]. Governments are hoping to support people to live independently in their own home for as long as possible, with support from formal and informal caregivers [2, 3]. At the same time, the prevalence of frailty increases with age [4, 5], which in turn increases the risk of adverse outcomes such as disability, institutionalisation and mortality [6, 7]. Traditionally, frailty has been viewed as a unidimensional concept focusing mainly on the physical problems that older people experience [8]. Recent approaches to frailty have recognised the multidimensional character of the concept, including physical, cognitive, psychological, social and environmental life domains [9-11]. Early detection of problems related to health and wellbeing and proactive delivery of care and support are employed with the aim to help (frail) older people remain independent and self-reliant for as long as possible [10, 12-14]. Various initiatives, which we refer to as 'early detection initiatives', have been developed to support this aim. Examples of such interventions in scientific literature include, for example, 'preventive home visits', 'geriatric care assessment' [15-20]. Such initiatives have been offered in different settings (e.g., general practitioner's (GP) practice, hospital, municipality) and aim at different target groups (e.g., hospitalised older people, community-dwelling (frail) older people, older people with low socioeconomic status (SES)) [17, 18, 20-29]. Broadly speaking, early detection initiatives can be clustered into two groups: 1. Initiatives that aim to detect older people at risk of deterioration, in order to provide a preventive programme, and 2. Initiatives that aim to detect problems (and needs) related to health and wellbeing in frail older people in order to optimise (current) delivery of care and support [30]. Many of the initiatives described in literature purported to focus on different life domains. However, in practice such initiatives tended to mainly address physical health problems [30] and as such merely applied the unidimensional view on frailty. This could imply that there are unmet care needs that fall within, for instance, the psychological, social and environmental domains of life (e.g., company, daytime activities, access to information) [30, 31]. Furthermore, as more recent studies have already suggested, older people tend 3 a multidimensional and person-centred approach, and would appreciate more alignment between initiatives and their needs and preferences [30-34]. In addition, evaluations of early detection initiatives are inconclusive. Some reviews have suggested that initiatives including a multidimensional perspective may reduce functional decline [16, 29, 35], hospital admissions [16, 29], nursing home admissions [16, 29, 36] or mortality [16, 35, 36], whereas other reviews did not find any evidence for such effects [15, 37, 38].As details about program characteristics and program implementation are often unknown, a more comprehensive evaluation of why some initiatives seem more effective than others is difficult [15, 29, 36]. Moreover, previous reviews have overlooked other related outcomes, such as autonomy and self-confidence [29]. In addition, as a recent study in the Netherlands has indicated, there are many initiatives that have not yet been evaluated, which would suggest much is still unknown about the potential benefit of early detection initiatives [30]. The large variety of early detection initiatives and the inconclusive results with regard to the effectiveness of such initiatives make it difficult to establish what constitutes best practice. More insight is needed into how to best design early detection initiatives. Taking the needs and preferences of older people into account is crucial for developing sustainable an effective initiatives [39]. Exploring what matters to older people, taking into account all life domains, could provide important starting points for improving the alignment of early detection initiatives with the needs and preferences of (different groups of) older people. Our study therefore aimed to explore: 1) older people's perspectives on health and living environment in relation to living independently at home; 2) older people's needs and preferences in relation to initiating and receiving care and support; and 3) professionals' views on what could improve the alignment of early detection initiatives with older people's needs and preferences. Methods Study design This qualitative study consisted of two stages. In stage one (August 2015 - January 2016), older people were interviewed to gain insight in their perspectives on health and living environment in relation to living independently at home, and to identify their needs and preferences for initiating and receiving care and support. In stage two (March 2016 - April 2016), professionals in proactive elderly care (i.e., an outreaching, initiatives: a qualitative study and integrated approach of older people living in the community, intended to prevent (further) decline in older people's functioning and wellbeing and/or to support them to live in their own homes for as long as possible) were interviewed. During these interviews, professionals reflected on the results of the interviews with older people, and indicated how, according to them, early detection initiatives could be better aligned with older people's needs and preferences in practice. Study sample Stage one: older peopleWe aimed to obtain insights from a wide variety of older people, including people from different age groups and educational levels. As we were interested in the needs of people currently aged over 65, as well as in the expectations of future older people, respondents were eligible to participate if they were 55 year or older. Additional inclusion criteria included living independently at home and being cognitively able to participate. Participants were recruited in two ways. First, we put an invitation letter in a national magazine aimed at older people, and in the newsletter of the umbrella organisation for Dutch elderly organisations. Second, we approached several of our contact persons at community centres, adult day services centres and elderly organisations, who then approached older people to provide information about the study and ask them to participate. A total of 83 respondents signed up to participate, of which 58 respondents signed up via the first procedure and 25 respondents via the second procedure. Among these potential participants, maximum variation sampling [40] was used in order to obtain a diverse study population, aiming for variation in gender, age, living situation (alone or with partner), degree of urbanization of their place of residence and educational level. One respondent did not show up to a group interview, and seven respondents who signed up to participate refrained from participating when they were contacted to schedule an interview. Reasons for this included illness, not being interested in participating anymore and no longer seeing the value of participating. Interviews were conducted until all researchers were confident no new data would emerge. Data saturation was reached after interviews with 36 participants. Of these 36 participants, seventeen had signed up via the newsletter or magazine and nineteen were enrolled via our contact persons. We personally called all remaining respondents to explain that we had not anticipated the large number of responses to our call, and to 3 let them know they would not be invited for an interview. During those phone calls we responded to any questions or comments that they had. Stage two: professionals in policy and practice A broad range of professionals in proactive elderly care was asked to participate in an interview. The sample included professionals in primary and social care, managers from care organisations, academics, community policy officers and representatives of organisations for older people. Professionals were selected 1) from the researchers' network, and 2) from research and practice in early detection, brought to the researchers' attention through literature and oral presentations during (scientific) conferences. Professionals received an email invitation to participate in the study. A total of thirteen professionals were approached, all of whom agreed to participate. In a few cases, professionals suggested to invite additional colleagues to join them in the interview. Ultimately, thirteen interviews were conducted with a total of nineteen professionals. Data collection Stage one: interviews with older peoplePrior to the interviews, participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire to collect demographic information, including age, gender, educational level, marital status, living situation, degree of urbanization and cultural background. Interviews were conducted by ML, SdB, LL and AS using a semi-structured interview guide. For the development of the interview guide, the authors built on the different domains of frailty [9-11] and as such focused on the physical, cognitive, psychological, and social domains of life (in this study summarised as \"health\") as well as the environmental domain of life. The interview guide was reviewed by an advisory committee consisting of older people working as volunteer elderly advisors and several professionals in proactive elderly care. Based on their feedback, the initial interview guide was further adapted to ensure the questions were relevant and understandable. The interview guide addressed the following topics (for full interview guide, see Appendix 3.1): 1. Health and living environment a. Experienced problems and needs in the different domains of life b. Expected future problems and needs in the different domains of life c. Factors enhancing and inducing (potential) problems and needs in the different domains of life initiatives: a qualitative study 2. Needs and preferences for initiating and receiving care and support a. Needs and preferences with regard to informal care and support b. Needs and preferences with regard to formal care and support Interviews took place face-to-face at people's home and in community centres. Initially, we aimed to interview participants in group interviews, in order to allow older people to react to each other, complement each other's statements and to stimulate discussion. Due to travel distances between participants and/or the frail condition of some participants, eventually most participants were interviewed separately. Two group interviews were held with a total of eight participants, and 24 participants were interviewed individually. In two cases (four participants), participants who had signed up as a couple were interviewed as a couple. In two cases, a partner not participating in the study was present during an individual interview. Interviews lasted 45 to 90 minutes, and group interviews took approximately 120 minutes. Stage two: interviews with professionals in policy and practice The interview guide was developed based on the results of the interviews with older people. A draft version of this interview guide was reviewed by an advisory committee of professionals in proactive elderly care as well. The interview guide addressed the following topics (for full interview guide, see Appendix 3.2): 1. Reflection on the preferences, needs and views of older people as identified in the interviews with older people 2. Suggestions and recommendations to better align early detection initiatives with older people's preferences and needs with regard to the target group, scope, setting, approach and timing Ten interviews were conducted face-to-face at the professionals' workplace and three interviews were conducted by telephone. Interviews lasted 30 to 90 minutes (on average 45 minutes). Data analysis In the sample of older people, participants aged 55 to 65 years were categorised as future older people, whereas participants aged 66 to 80 years and participants aged >80 years were categorised as older people and the eldest respectively. Although the total group of participants included both future and current older people, for the purpose of readability the total group of participants will be described as 'older people'. The educational participants was categorised into low (no education, elementary school and vocational training), medium (secondary education) and high (higher education and university). All interviews were audiotaped with the interviewees' permission and transcribed verbatim. Data-analysis was based on the framework analysis method [41-43]. The code structure, or analytical framework, was developed based on the principles of both a deductive and an inductive approach [43]. Predetermined codes, derived from the topic list for the interviews, were used for the development of the initial framework (i.e., deductive approach). After reading several interview transcripts, additional codes were added to the analytical framework (i.e., inductive approach). When no new concepts emerged from reviewing data, the analytical framework was finalised (see Appendix 3.3) and used to assign codes to relevant passages of the interview transcripts [42, 43]. ML coded the transcripts of the interviews with older people and YB coded the transcripts of the interviews with professionals. AS, LL, and SdB checked the coded transcripts and discussed differences in order to reach consensus. Software for qualitative data analysis (MAXQDA 11.0.9b and 12) was used to aid in the analysis of the coded transcripts by sorting data according to codes and themes. Data from the individual interviews and group interviews with older people were analysed separately. Patterns and themes in both data sources were compared to see whether they validated or contradicted each other. Whenever there was enough data, we checked for different patterns in the data between different groups of older people with regard to gender, age, education level and marital status. Emerging themes were discussed between ML, YB, LL, SdB and AS and then clustered according to the initial research questions. Draft study findings were shared with several respondents (including older people, academics, municipality policy officers and care and support professionals, n=9) to validate findings through 'member checking' [44]. We inquired whether the results made sense to respondents from different viewpoints. They confirmed our results and provided valuable comments, helping us to further refine our findings. Ethics statement The Medical Research Ethics Committees United has assessed the study proposal and concluded that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) does not apply to this study, and official approval was not required (reference number W15.042). All participants provided written initiatives: a qualitative study Results General characteristics of participants Tables 1 and 2 show characteristics of the two groups of participants. Among older people, the average age was 78 years, ranging from 58 to 96 years, and one-third of the participants were male. With regard to the professionals we interviewed, five were researchers, five were community policy officers, five were health or social care professionals, two were managers of care organisations and two were working as representatives of older people. Our findings are presented in three sections, corresponding to the three aims of our study. The first two sections are primarily based on data from the interviews with older people. Where appropriate, the professionals' reflections are included in these sections as well. The results in section three are based solely on the interviews with professionals. Throughout the results, quotes are presented to illustrate our findings. To reflect the diversity of our sample, quotes were selected from older people of different sexes, age groups, educational levels, marital status and living situations. Also when selecting quotes of the professionals, we took differences in their backgrounds (e.g., health care, social care) into account. What are older people's perspectives on health and living environment in relation to living independently at home? The interviews with older people confirmed that ageing at home is important to older people, and most of them explicitly indicated they want to live independently at home for as long as possible. This section provides insight in older people's perspectives on living independently at home and what matters to them in the different domains of life. Important themes emerging from the interviews were related to different life domains: mobility, cognitive functioning, sense of purpose and autonomy, social relationships and appropriate housing and living arrangements. Each theme is discussed further below. Although they are discussed separately, it should be noted that from older people's perspective, all life domains were interrelated and considered of importance in order to be able to live independently at home. They can therefore not be seen in isolation, as problems in different domains are often related to each other. 3 3 Table 1. Demographic characteristics of the sample of older people (n=36). Number Age 65 years 5 66-80 years 19 >80 years 12 Mean age (range) 78 years (58-96) Gender Male 12 Female 24 Educational level Low 9 Medium 10 High 12 No information 5 Marital status Married 11 Unmarried 9 Divorced 5 Widow(er) 11 Living situation Alone 24 With partner 11 With children >18 1 Degree of urbanization City 27 Village 9 Cultural background Dutch 32 Other 4 Mobility Most of the older people we interviewed suffered from (chronic) health problems. However, with medical treatments and clever tricks, they indicated that they felt able to deal with the consequences of their health problems. The interviews highlighted that the implication of physical problems on their mobility was an important issue. With decreasing mobility, older people discussed their fears of becoming homebound and more dependent on others. This could have a negative impact on their confidence regarding their ability to live independently, as well as on other important aspects of life initiatives: a qualitative study Table 2. Demographic characteristics of the sample of professionals (n=19). Number Occupation Academic 5 Community policy officer 5 Health or social care professional 5 Manager of care organisation 2 Representative of association for older people 2 Gender Male 4 Female 15 such as their sense of purpose and autonomy, their social life and the appropriateness of their home environment (see themes below). As one of the participants stated: \"That's what it all depends on. The moment my ability to walk decreases, it's over.\" (Older participant 1, age group >80) Although remaining mobile was important for older people in all age groups, they talked about it in different ways. For the youngest two age groups, remaining mobile was perceived as being able to go places independently (e.g., visit friends and family, partake in activities), whereas in the oldest age group it was perceived as being able to manage at home without help (e.g., move around the house, do their own groceries shopping). Cognitive functioning Although older people were asked about (potential) problems with cognitive functioning, this domain was not extensively discussed. They often appeared not to be able or willing to discuss the subject any further. Other participants indicated that cognitive functioning was essential for their ability to live independently and some of them feared potential cognitive decline. As with mobility, also cognitive decline was associated with consequences on other domains, such as loss of autonomy and social relationships. \"I think when your mind deteriorates, you'll be in trouble, and I hope I won't have to experience that.\" (Older participant 2, age 3 of purpose and autonomy Older people outlined that ageing healthily also encompasses living a meaningful life and having a sense of purpose. They indicated that they want to feel useful and undertake meaningful activities. However, issues like fatigue, immobility and dependency on others can be barriers. In the two oldest age groups, people indicated they feel like they do not matter anymore and are no longer of interest to others. They did not always feel useful or respected. As someone said: \"Well, it's just that people, you're not interesting anymore [...] I mean, it's probably just the feeling one gets, it's probably not the reality, but the feeling that you're no longer of interest to anyone anymore.\" (Older participant 3, age group >80) \"Feeling like you're part of it [society], but also being treated with respect. Because we older people shouldn't get the idea that we don't matter anymore and that we're nothing but a nuisance. And that's the way many elderly feel right now.\" (Older participant 4, age group 66-80) Older people also spoke about the importance of being in control of their life, and mentioned their wish to decide for themselves on how to arrange their different aspects of their life, such as the care and support they receive. They (expect to) experience a loss of control over their life upon becoming dependent on others (e.g., due to physical or cognitive disabilities). Older people suggested that their sense of control would be improved by being allowed and enabled to do the things they are still able to do. \"As long as this [points to head] is still good, I still can, I'm still able to decide for myself what happens to me and have the freedom to do so.\" (Older participant 4, age group 66-80) Social relationshipsOlder people often mentioned the importance of having social relationships and a social network. However, the amount of time and energy people are willing or able to invest in relationships varied. Older people who indicated to be content with their social network highlighted the importance of taking initiative and remaining interested in society. They were often actively participating in the community by doing volunteer work, joining clubs and societies, and visiting local neighbourhood facilities. As one participant a qualitative study \"And third, of course, is maintaining your social contacts. It's very important to actively invest in those and not to sit around waiting for people to come to you.\" (Older participant 5, age group 66-80) Older people who were less content with their social network indicated that they experienced various barriers to investing in and maintaining social relationships, including being homebound due to disabilities or immobility, friends and family passing away, lack of financial means to partake in activities and the feeling like others are no longer interested in or available to them. Older people did not mention loneliness per se; rather, they mentioned a decrease in social contacts by describing issues such as: \"I don't get a lot of visits\", \"my children live far away\", \"my children are very busy\" or \"I don't get out much anymore\". Interview data showed a pattern that may indicate differences in educational level between the two groups of participants, with the group of participants who were content with their social network consisting mostly of higher educated people, and the group of participants who were less content consisting mainly of lower educated people. Appropriate housing and living arrangements With regard to being able to live independently, several issues emerged from the interviews. First, older people stressed the importance of living in close proximity to facilities such as the grocery store, public transportation and the pharmacy. In addition, although older people indicated to prefer to age in a home environment, they were not unanimous as to where they preferred this to be. The older people we interviewed could be roughly divided into three categories: those who wanted to remain in their current (sometimes senior-unfriendly) home, those who preferred to move to a more senior-friendly home and those who had already moved to a more senior-friendly home. Most of the participants in the last category indicated to have decided to move after their partner passed away. Several participants who preferred to move to a more senior-friendly home were not (yet) able to, for instance due to financial constraints or a lack of appropriate houses in the area. Other older people indicated that they would like to age in their current home and remain in their own neighbourhood where they were already familiar with the people living there and the available facilities. As someone said: see, the comfort of having lived somewhere for a long time, such as I have now, is knowing people very well. Thus [I am aware that] they know that when I need help with something, it's okay for me to come to their door and ask: 'Would you mind helping me for a minute or would you mind doing this for me?'\" (Older participant 6, age group >80) Older people who did not yet live in appropriate and senior-friendly housing indicated that they need, or would need in the future, some home adaptations (e.g., stair lift, grips in the bathroom) to make their home more senior-friendly. High costs of such adaptations were mentioned as a source of concern for some of these people. The interviewed professionals stressed the importance of remaining in one's own community, although they indicated the availability of affordable senior-friendly houses is often a problem. More generally, they recognised that the financial costs of ageing in their own environments can be problematic for older people. What are older people's needs and preferences in relation to initiating and receiving care and support? This section focuses on older people's views with regard to care and support and how, in their opinion, problems and needs should be addressed in order for them to be able to feel healthy and live independently for as long as possible. Themes that emerged from the interviews were: own responsibility and asking for help, formal and informal support network, anticipation of future needs and information supply about care and support services. Own responsibility and asking for help Older people often indicated to feel confident in their ability to fulfil their current needs themselves. They indicated the need to invest in staying healthy by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preventing mobility losses, for instance by eating healthy, exercising, taking medication and using support devices (e.g., walking stick, walking frame) to prevent falling. In addition, they felt it is their own responsibility to resolve issues in the psychological and social domains of health and they prefer not to ask help for these types of problems. As someone said when asked about whether she would ask support for qualitative study \"No, that's your own responsibility. You'd need to pull yourself up by the boot- straps.\" (Older participant 7, age group >80) Again, older people found it important to feel in control with regard to the care and support they receive. Participants indicated that if they would need some help, they would prefer to ask for it themselves, instead of having help and support imposed upon them. In addition, older people indicated to prefer to ask help from someone they know and whom they trust. They also stressed the importance of being listened to, being taken seriously and not being overruled by care professionals. \"So she'd make a plan based on what she thinks is necessary, but she won't overrule me, she always tells me what she's going to do and why, and I like that. That way, you're respected as a person and that's very important to me.\" (Older participant 8, age group >80) \"It's just, if you already know someone, with whom you already have some sort of connection, it's easier to ask for help from that person, than from someone you don't know at all.\" (Older participant 9, age group 66-80) The professionals we interviewed indicated that in their experience, older people are often reluctant to ask for help. With this in mind, they recognised the importance of trust and continuity with regard to care and support. Formal and informal support network Older people indicated that in order to be able to live independently, they (expected to) need practical support in carrying out (instrumental) activities of daily living. For example, participants often indicated to need domestic help, and they also indicated that help with bathing, clothing, grocery shopping, home and garden maintenance, transportation and administration were needed or would be needed in the future. Help to fulfil such types of needs may be offered by both the formal and informal support network. The interviews revealed that for needs related to (instrumental) activities of daily living, older people preferred to receive help from the formal support network. Some participants would ask organised volunteers to help with home and garden maintenance. The informal support network was preferably only used incidentally (e.g., transport to hospital). Participants indicated that they would not feel comfortable receiving structural 3 3 care from their informal support network or that they do not have an informal support network that could provide this kind of care. As one woman put it: \"Well, you see, help from family and friends, it's just, the government is suddenly completely focusing on that. It used to be natural and in many of our cultures it still goes without saying, but I think the problem is, at least here in the Netherlands, I barely ever see my neighbours. Do you think I would ask them if I ever needed something? No, I wouldn't do that.\" (Older participant 10, age group 55-65) Professionals indicated that having a support network close-by (i.e., in their neighbourhood/community) is very important for older people, both for social contacts and practical help. Some professionals stated in this context that they would like to see that people in the community looked after each other more often. Anticipating future needs Older people often believed they managed fine at the moment. When asked if they ever worried about the future, almost all older people indicated they don't, as they 'live by the day'. They felt it was useless to worry about what the future would bring, because they believed it to be impossible to prepare for all possible outcomes. As one participant mentioned: \"It's not that I'm evading the responsibility, it's just that I think it's a waste to worry about things you won't be able to do anything about anyway, not right now at least. [...] Yeah, so I'm not really thinking about potential solutions I might someday need, because I would have to prepare for the entire repertoire and that would be a waste of energy.\" (Older participant 8, age group >80) Although the older people we interviewed actually did indicate that they expected some problems in the future (e.g., mobility loss, cognitive decline, home adaptations, as indicated in part one of the results section), this did not necessarily mean they were also looking for potential solutions to these problems. As described above, people preferred to deal with their problems in their own way and in their own time. In contrast, professionals indicated that older people often tend to overestimate their self-reliance. Therefore, they stressed the importance of early awareness among initiatives: a qualitative study people, indicating that instead of offering solutions to problems that could have been addressed at an earlier stage, they would rather provide older people with tools to anticipate and prevent these problems. As one professional put it: \"You know, it's just remarkable how often I hear older people say that everything is fine. For instance, this blind woman, 92 years old and with several disabilities, she says: \"Well, I still do my own grocery shopping, but not when it's slippery during winter, I don't dare to risk it.\" Well, you wonder, who does it for her when it's slippery? A friend of hers, who's also 90. And she says: \"Yes, everything is fine, I don't need anything, all is going well.\" And when I asked: \"What if something happens to your friend, what then?\" Well, it seemed she's never even thought about that.\" (Professional 1, social care) Information about care and support servicesResults from the interviews show that older people get information about health, wellbeing, housing, care and support in many ways. Some older people highlighted they used the internet, while others indicated to prefer information on paper, for instance from the municipality, health and social care professionals, community centres and elderly associations. In addition, older people mentioned they also remain informed via peers, their children, radio and television. Older people also indicated that they would go to their GP if they had any questions about either health or social problems, expecting their doctor to refer them to the right place. As one participant said: \"Well, just to my general practitioner. I always go to my GP and I'm sure he would refer me to the right place.\" (Older participant 11, age group 66-80) Different patterns in information seeking behaviours were observed between lower and higher educated older people. Whereas higher educated older people often actively searched for information themselves, lower educated older people often indicated to receive their information through pamphlets in their mail and via their social network. What is necessary to improve alignment of early detection initiatives with the needs and preferences of older people? Professionals were asked to share their views on the steps necessary to better align early detection initiatives with the preferences and needs of older people, taking the outcomes of the interviews with older people as a starting-point. This section describes the themes address the most notable improvement areas for initiatives: target groups, scope, setting, approach and timing. Target groups Professionals recognised the themes mentioned by older people participating in this study and indicated that these issues are indeed relevant for many older people they see in their daily work. In addition, professionals indicated that some groups of older people are insufficiently reached by current initiatives, including older people with a low socioeconomic status, older migrants, older people with psychiatric problems, care avoiders and socially isolated older people. According to professionals, early detection initiatives should be targeted at these specific groups rather than on older people in general, taking into account specific issues that are often prevalent in these groups, such as illiteracy, limited financial means or cultural differences. As someone said: \"For example, a mosque is a place where you might inform older people and say: 'This is the help and support you could ask for. It would be great if your children would arrange that, but if that's not possible you may ask for help there'. It also creates awareness among those people, like 'you're entitled to that too', that they're aware of it and indicate when they need it.\" (Professional 2, manager of care organisation) ScopeAlthough older people appeared to regard issues relating to the psychological and social domains as their own responsibility, professionals stressed that early detection initiatives should pay more attention to problems regarding a lack of purpose, meaningful activities and social relationships. In their opinion, older people should be enabled to participate in society, particularly when they themselves experience barriers in doing so. As a professional stated: \"The loneliness and [lack of] engagement. That you're part of society. I think that's very important to people. And you're only able to participate in society if you're mobile, mentally healthy and if you have a social network.\" (Professional 3, health initiatives: a qualitative study Setting Early detection initiatives are set within a variety of care settings, such as GP practices, municipalities or hospitals. Professionals suggested that early detection initiatives would be better situated within the community care setting, in the older person's neighbourhood. According to them, it is important that detection of problems and risks takes place in settings where older people feel comfortable, for instance in their own homes, at their GP practice or at facilities they visit regularly. For this to be successful, communication and alignment between the different care and support professionals in a community, as well as volunteers and informal caregivers involved, is essential and may be stimulated by for instance a community liaison professional. Community liaisons can provide a bridge between community and the health and care professionals, making sure signals are picked up by the appropriate people. \"So, one centre where health and social care are close together, and where citi-zens in particular can do all sorts of things, such as exercising, reading, dancing, eating, cooking, we can include nutrition of course. [...] And it could also have a signalling function, as volunteers who work there will notice that you didn't come in today or that you've become confused or that your appearance has changed. Such a centre shouldn't be very complicated to set up but could be very beneficial for older people.\" (Professional 4, health care) ApproachWhen talking about what would be the best approach to early detection, professionals felt that a one-size-fits-all approach, not taking into account older people's diverse range of needs and preferences, is a potential hazard. Professionals advised a more person-centred approach is important for aligning early detection initiatives with older people's needs, for instance by training care providers in motivational interviewing and providing older people with relevant information about their options for care and support. Information should be tailored to specific target groups and provided in a way that matches people's information seeking behaviour. \"From our perspective, where we see opportunities for improvement, I think, is to differentiate and align to their needs. Information provision, we also have a role 3 3 in that, and in applying, in improving the integration in our work. And, above all, working together with the elderly.\" (Professional 5, community policy officer) TimingSince, according to professionals, older people do not always appear to be open to early detection initiatives and may perceive them as patronising, they indicated that initiatives should be timed more specifically. Older people might be more receptive of early detection initiatives when a potential shift in needs occurs. For example, needs of older people may change after certain life events, such as moving house, becoming widowed or after hospitalisation. Other appropriate moments to introduce early detection initiatives could include, for example, when signs of cognitive decline or fall incidents occur, or in case of changes in laws and regulations concerning care and support. In addition, some professionals advocated the need to raise awareness of (prevention of) potential problems and risks at a relatively young age, for instance when people retire from work. As one professional explained: \"Well, then you'll see that the more frail someone becomes, the less capable this person will be to proactively go out and about in their neighbourhood and expand their social network. That's why, in our mission, we've been focusing on the people retiring from work who don't have any health complaints yet. They are fit and healthy and are..., should be able to invest in expanding their network. Those people should be stimulated to do just that, before they become too frail to actively invest in their social network.\" (Professional 6, social care) Discussion Over the years, in several countries initiatives have been implemented to proactively identify problems related to health and wellbeing in frail older people [15, 16, 29, 30, 35-38]. Despite a wide array of studies, it remains unclear how such initiatives can be best designed and implemented to address the needs and preferences of older people. In this study, we explored older people's perspectives on health and living environment in relation to independent living at home, their needs and preferences in relation to initiating and receiving care and support, and professionals' views on what might be necessary to improve the alignment of early detection initiatives with older people's needs and preferences. Our results show that important prerequisites for living independently at home are maintaining mobility, healthy cognitive functioning, appropriate housing and a initiatives: a qualitative study supporting network. In addition, maintaining independence, social relationships, a sense of purpose and autonomy are important to age in a meaningful and respectable manner. This study also highlights several discrepancies between perspectives of older people and the perspectives of professionals. Awareness of such discrepancies and their implications for policy and practice is important, and a dialogue between both parties, as well as other relevant stakeholders, is necessary to further explore such contradistinctions. As also suggested by earlier studies [31, 45-47], this study highlights that for older people, health and independent living encompasses various health (including physical, cognitive, psychological and social) and environmental domains. Although older people often have few unmet needs concerning physical health [31], our findings regarding the importance of mobility for maintaining independence and healthy ageing are supported by previous studies. Preventing and tackling mobility loss is an important part of holistically addressing older people's problems in various life domains, as mobility deficits are associated with health problems, a decrease in social contacts and a decreased ability to take part in society [48, 49]. In contrast to the physical, psychological, social and environmental domains of life, which were discussed in detail during the interviews, the majority of older people in our study did not elaborate extensively on cognitive health and functioning. Possible explanations for this are that cognitive decline did not play a role, or played only a minor role, in the older participants' lives, that they felt that cognitive decline was beyond their control and they were unsure what to say about it, or because for some it is still a taboo subject [50, 51]. In addition, previous research showed that denial and concealment of cognitive problems or unawareness of cognitive decline regularly occur among people with early-stage dementia [51, 52]. Nonetheless, awareness and early diagnosis of cognitive decline may positively affect older people's autonomy, as it enables them to be involved in the planning of their future care [53]. Autonomy is a recurring theme in the results of this study. As was also found in a previous qualitative study on older people's views of healthy ageing [45], older people want to be self-sufficient, feel in control over their life and prefer not to ask for help. When they do ask for help, familiarity and reciprocal trust are important in the relationship between the older person and his or her caregiver, as well as being respected and listened to [33, 45, 54]. The current study indicates that this feeling is not exclusive to relationships with care professionals, but is also important in other social relationships. 3 3 Enabling people to maintain social relationships is important, as loneliness and social isolation are risk factors for many negative health outcomes [55-57]. Factors found to increase the risk of social isolation and loneliness are losing a partner, decreased social activities, physical or cognitive disabilities and increased feelings of low mood and uselessness [56, 57]. As the present study shows, these are indeed prevalent issues among older people, and addressing them may be a starting point for addressing loneliness and social isolation. The importance of the environmental domains of life is supported by recent studies as well. Having a home appropriate for their needs and being able to get around in the community are important aspects of older people's quality of life [46, 58]. Physical and social neighbourhood characteristics, such as safety, accessibility of facilities and social cohesion and the availability of social support, may be crucial in enabling people to age in their own preferred environments [59]. As such, the availability of appropriate homes in supportive neighbourhoods is becoming increasingly important as people age. Implications for early detection initiatives This study reveals some discrepancies and issues with regard to timing, scope and approach of initiatives, which are considered to be important to address when developing and implementing early detection initiatives. This and previous research revealed that older people often perceive initiatives as patronising [30]. Older people prefer to be autonomous and self-sufficient, and whereas they highlighted being invested in staying healthy within the present moment, they are often not willing or able to anticipate or act on (potential) future problems. However, professionals believe that older people may over-estimate themselves and are often reluctant to ask for help, and that many problems could be prevented if targeted at an earlier stage. This difference in perspectives on timing will not be easily resolved. The discrepancy might be reduced when early detection is initiated around certain life events, such as losing a partner, moving house or hospitalisation. As these events often increase the risk of frailty and the need for care and support [60], older people may be more receptive of early detection initiatives at such moments [61]. Additionally, signals of potential deterioration, received from either older people themselves or someone close to them, may indicate an opening for professionals to discuss possibilities for care and support with older people. To make sure these signals end up with the right professional, an integrated and coordinated care and support system is needed. More alignment between professionals from different initiatives: a qualitative study domains is considered necessary to prevent older people from being confronted with a multitude of interventions [30]. With regard to scope and approach, a more person-centred and comprehensive approach is advised. First, we recommend focussing more on sustaining older people's capabilities and improving independent functioning in relation to activities that are of importance to them, despite potential limitations. As also suggested in previous research [45], ageing often involves accepting and adapting to limitations on various health and environmental domains. A more explicit focus of early detection initiatives on stimulating or enhancing the ability to adapt and self-manage is in line with emerging concepts such as positive health [62], reablement [63, 64] and function focused care [65], in which the ability to live a meaningful life is central. As a supportive environment could reinforce this ability [46, 58], there is a call for action to a varied group of stakeholders (including municipalities, project developers and housing corporations) to support the availability of appropriate homes in older people's communities. Second, as our results suggest that people value autonomy and feeling in control, we further recommend that decisions with regard to care and support are made in dialogue with older people and/or their informal caregivers, and are based on the older person's priorities [66]. For such approaches to be successful, reciprocal trust between the care professional and the older person is important. In addition, care and support professionals need to possess advanced communication skills and techniques to support deliberation and decision-making (e.g., listening, motivational interviewing) [67]. In addition, transparent and comprehensive information about the available options for care and support should be available and accessible for different groups of older people, as this will be necessary for informed decision-making [67] and will improve older people's experience of the care and support they receive [58]. Methodological considerations A strength of this study is the variety of participants included. As we interviewed both older people and professionals in proactive elderly care, we were able to reveal discrepancies between 'supply and demand'. The wide range of professionals, representing different settings of proactive elderly care (e.g., primary care, hospitals, social care and support, elderly organisations, researchers and municipalities), resulted in a broad perspective on prevalent issues among early detection initiatives from different settings. Although we aimed to include people who differed in age, gender, urban or rural neighbourhoods, marital status and educational level, some groups (e.g., women, people 3 older people in the 65-80 age group) are overrepresented in our sample. Furthermore, many people in our sample signed themselves up after seeing our invitation letter. This may have caused some bias in selection, resulting in an overrepresentation of less frail and more proactive older people. Therefore, our sample of older people may not be entirely representative of the total population of older people, and may not wholly correspond with the older people addressed during interviews with health professionals. However, by approaching people through contact persons at community and adult day services centres, we actively tried to include participants who were perceived to be more frail. Interviews with these participants did not yield any new results and after 36 interviews, data saturation was reached. In addition, the professionals we interviewed, of whom many encounter varying populations of older people in their daily practice, found our findings representative. This suggests our results are valid for a larger group of older people. Furthermore, after data analysis we used member checking [44] to inquire whether our results were faithfully interpreted, whether they contained errors and whether they made sense to older people and professionals. As we used qualitative methods, this study provided insight into themes and concepts that matter to older people, and indications for differences between different groups of older people. However, based on these results we were not able to establish which issues occur more frequently than others or to compare different groups of older people to detect potential statistical differences. To answer these types of questions, future research which includes quantitative methods is recommended. Furthermore, during our interviews with older people we did not specifically focus on their experiences of early detection initiatives. Although some older people mentioned they had taken part in one or more types of initiatives, we did not investigate their experiences with specific interventions in detail, as this did not fall within the scope of this study. It should, however, be noted that a retrospective study among recent users of early detection initiatives may provide valuable insights in experiences with specific initiatives. Conclusion This study explored the perspectives of older people and professionals on health, independent living and early detection of problems and needs. Older people have a broad range of needs in different domains of life. Several discrepancies exist between older people and professionals concerning their views on timing and scope of early detection initiatives. Although these issues seem to be difficult to solve, this study reveals a qualitative study starting-points for better alignment between interventions and needs and preferences of older people, which may support policy makers and care professionals involved in early detection to make more informed decisions.

When do you think it would be most appropriate / efficient / meaningful to offer early detection initiatives? b. How could, in your opinion, current early detection initiatives be improved to better align with these preferences regarding timing? 5. Do you recognise these preferences with regard to approach?Setting Many older people expect their General Practitioner (GP) to know what they should do with their problems. They prefer to ask the GP, or else e.g. a community nurse or volunteer they already know and trust. When they have problems in the psychological or social domain (sadness, feeling unhappy, feeling lonely) older people differ in who they would ask for help. Many older people indicate they do not want to rely structurally on informal care. Possibly for acute relief/advice, but not long-term; they do not want to burden their chil-dren/neighbours. There is a high demand for senior-friendly homes. Timing Many older people indicate they would ask for help themselves, if they think they need it. With regard to issues on the social domain, older people also indicate it is very important to take initiative. Approach Older people value autonomy and respect, they want to feel like they matter. They do not want to feel like people are imposing or interfering with their lives. Older people want to be approached as a person, and do not like it when carers are rigidly trying use lists to make an inventory of their needs. Continuity in care and support staff is important to older people, they don't want to see a new face every day. Periodical home visits from the GP or practice nurse are appreciated. 3 3 a.

International Journal of Integrated Care. 4 82Abstract Introduction Integrated care programmes are increasingly being put in place to provide care to older people who live at home. Knowledge of how to further develop integrated care and how to transfer successful initiatives to other contexts is still limited. Therefore, a cross-European research project, called Sustainable Tailored Integrated Care for Older People in Europe (SUSTAIN), has been initiated with a twofold objective: 1. to collaborate with local stakeholders to support and monitor improvements to established integrated care initiatives for older people with multiple health and social care needs. Improvements focus on person-centredness, prevention orientation, safety and efficiency; 2. to make these improvements applicable and adaptable to other health and social care systems, and regions in Europe. This paper presents the overall structure and approach of the SUSTAIN project. Methods SUSTAIN uses a multiple embedded case study design. In three phases, SUSTAIN partners: (i) conduct interviews and workshops with stakeholders from fourteen established integrated care initiatives to understand where they would prefer improvements to existing ways of working; (ii) collaborate with local stakeholders to support the design and implementation of improvement plans , evaluate implementation progress and outcomes per initiative, and carry out overarching analyses to compare the different initiatives, and; (iii) translate knowledge and experience to an online roadmap. Discussion SUSTAIN aims to generate evidence on how to improve integrated care, and apply and transfer the knowledge gained to other health and social care systems, and regions. Lessons learned will be brought together in practical tools to inform and support policy-makers and decision-makers, as well as other stakeholders involved in integrated care, to manage and improve care for older people living at home. improving integrated care for older people living at home Introduction Health and social care systems face the challenge of offering care and support to an increasing number of older people living at home [1]. This increase is partly due to an ageing population, but also governments in and outside Europe are pursuing agendas that seek to enable older people to participate in society and to live at home for as long as possible [2-4]. While a large proportion of older people are able to stay in their own homes, the prevalence of frailty, multimorbidity and disability increases with age, leading to a growing number of older people living in the community with multiple health and social care needs. These multiple needs may restrict social participation, and lead to reduced self-reliance and increased care dependence, which in turn may result in a higher utilisation of long-term care and support services [5-8]. Sustainable health and social care systems will need to be able to optimally support older people by addressing both their health and social care needs, while at the same time minimise service utilisation and expenditure. Integrated care is widely acknowledged to be a promising approach for meeting such challenges [9-15]. There are several definitions for the term 'integrated care' in place [16-18]. In this study, integrated care is defined as those initiatives that proactively seek to structure and coordinate care for older people in their own home environments, centred around their needs [12-14, 19-22]. Numerous integrated care initiatives have been rolled out, in a wide range of settings and contexts, in and outside Europe [23-26], offering a rich and varied field of practical examples. Evaluations of these initiatives have established potential benefits of greater levels of service integration, but they have also highlighted limitations. For instance, evidence for the effectiveness of integrated care programmes for older people living at home remains inconsistent [14, 27]. Also, knowledge of how to successfully implement and improve integrated care is still limited, as is knowledge of how to transfer these experiences to other contexts [28]. Furthermore, improvements to the current way of working in existing initiatives are considered necessary, to make them more person-centred, prevention-oriented, safe and efficient [24, 27, 29-31]. In addition, more insight into how to measure and evaluate (improvements in) integrated care programmes is needed to be able to capture outcomes and processes adequately and consistently across different programmes and evaluation studies. 4 4 84The SUSTAIN research project To take a step forward in the development of integrated care, the cross-European research project called 'SUSTAIN' has been initiated, which stands for 'Sustainable Tailored Integrated Care for Older People in Europe' (www.sustain-eu.org). The project is funded under Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) from the European Commission (EC). SUSTAIN's objectives are twofold: 1. to support and monitor improvements to established integrated care initiatives for older people living at home with multiple health and social care needs, and in so doing move towards more person-centred, prevention-oriented, safe and efficient care; and 2. to contribute to the adoption and application of these improvements to other health and social care systems, and regions in Europe. SUSTAIN is a four-year research project (2015-2019) carried out by thirteen partners from nine European countries: Austria (n=1 partner), Belgium (n=1 partner), Estonia (n=1 partner), Germany (n=1 partner), Ireland (n=1 partner), Norway (n=1 partner), Spain (n=1 partner), the Netherlands (n= 4 partners) and the United Kingdom (n=2 partners). The project team consists of dissemination partners focusing on knowledge translation and dissemination, and research partners who focus on supporting and evaluating improvements to the integrated care initiatives. The dissemination partners are from Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and the research partners are from Austria, Estonia, Germany, Norway, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The aim of this paper is to describe SUSTAIN's overall structure and intended approach and activities to generate evidence on improving integrated care and to transfer obtained knowledge to other health and social care systems, and regions. Methods Design and setting Using a multiple embedded case study design [32, 33], data are being collected from fourteen established integrated care initiatives for older people in seven European countries; Austria, Estonia, Germany, Norway, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The initiatives were already operating within their local health and social care systems. Each initiative, also referred to as 'site', is treated as one case study in the research. The project focuses on older people because complexity of needs and, consequently, care delivery tend to increase with age with the result that a more coordinated approach to service delivery, as pursued in the project, is required. Prior to the start of the project, SUSTAIN research partners invited integrated care initiatives in their networks within improving integrated care for older people living at home their countries, that were motivated to improve their current practice, to participate in the SUSTAIN project. Most sites already had a longstanding partnership with one of the SUSTAIN research partners. Criteria for including them in the study were defined by SUSTAIN research partners and drawn from the principles of the Chronic Care Model and related models [12, 14, 20, 22, 28, 34]. Accordingly, initiatives should: Be willing and committed to improve their current practice by working towards more person-centred, prevention-oriented, safe and efficient care, which, in line with the EC's stipulations, are SUSTAIN's four key domains (see Table 1 for definitions); Focus on people aged 65 years and older, who live in their own homes and who have multiple health and social care needs; Support people to stay in their own homes (or local environments) for as long as possible; Address older people's multiple needs, in other words, they should not be single disease oriented; Involve professionals from multiple health and social care disciplines working in multidisciplinary teams (e.g. nurses, social workers, pharmacists, dieticians, general practitioners); Be established, i.e. preferably operational for at least two years; Cover one geographical area or local site; Be mandated by one organisation that represents the initiative and that facilitates collaboration with SUSTAIN research partners. Table 1. Definitions of SUSTAIN's key domains. Person-centredness Involve older people and their informal carers in decision-making and planning their care process in order to tailor the delivery of care and support as much as possible to individual needs, preferences and capabilities, taking into account socio-demographic factors, cultural backgrounds and gender [35, 36]. Prevention orienta - tionPreserve and promote the health and wellbeing of older people with multiple needs by preventing deterioration in existing conditions, and providing active support to help them to maintain and regain as much autonomy, independence and resilience as possible, and to make optimal use of individual resources Continued. Person-centredness Involve older people and their informal carers in decision-making and planning their care process in order to tailor the delivery of care and support as much as possible to individual needs, preferences and capabilities, taking into account socio-demographic factors, cultural backgrounds and gender [35, 36]. Safety Prevent adverse outcomes of care (e.g. drug related problems, unnec-essary hospitalisations and admissions in long-term care institutions), decrease preventable decline in health status (e.g. falls) and address treatment adherence [38]. Efficiency Affordability of interventions and effective use of infrastructure, resources for sustainability (e.g. hours of service and labour allocat - ed to recipients) and equipment and technology (e.g. IT), and the extent to which interventions may be able to shift activity from acute services to primary care services, improve alignment between the care professionals involved and reduce waste in healthcare spending (e.g. unnecessary readmissions within 30 days) [39, 40]. The fourteen initiatives selected according to these criteria show great diversity in the type of care services provided (see Table 2). Their focus ranges from proactive primary care for frail older people and care for older people being discharged from hospital, to nursing care for frail older people, care for people with dementia, and palliative care. More detailed information about the initiatives can be found in an EU report that we wrote about the fourteen initiatives [41]. Table 2.

Three interrelated project phases of the SUSTAIN project. 4 4 88Phase 1: Preparation phase Between autumn 2015 and winter 2016, SUSTAIN research partners established working relationships with the fourteen participating initiatives, and identified relevant local stakeholders related to the initiative (i.e. managers, health and social care professionals, representatives of older people and informal carers, local policy officers). Furthermore, they carried out baseline assessments of each initiative's principal characteristics and also worked with local stakeholders to identify areas of current practice in the initiative, which might be subject to improvement (e.g. collaboration between formal and informal care providers, involvement of older people in care processes). For the purpose of the baseline assessments, interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide, covering the context and characteristics of the site, stakeholders' interpretation of SUSTAIN's four key domains (i.e. person-centredness, prevention orientation, safety and efficiency) and each site's performance in relation to them, facilitators and barriers to integration, and potential areas for improvement. At each site, interviews were conducted with the following four study participants: one older person receiving care services from the initiative (user), one informal caregiver, one health or social care professional involved in the initiative and one manager of the initiative. All SUSTAIN research partners used the same interview schedules for their interviews. The interviews were audiotaped with interviewees' permission. Interview transcripts from each site were thematically analysed using a uniform, structured template of analysis, generated by structured discussion among research partners. Interview findings were used as inputs for workshops with key stakeholders related to the initiative (i.e. managers, health and social care professionals, representatives of older people and informal carers, local policy officers) at each site. The purpose of the workshops was to discuss outcomes of the baseline assessments and enable sites to determine local improvement priorities. Phase 2: Implementation research to improve existing integrated care initiatives at selected sites Based on the outcomes of phase 1, local steering groups were set up in spring 2016. Steering groups consists of stakeholders who participated in the workshops together with additional local stakeholders considered relevant to the initiative. These steering groups have been designated to design and implement improvement plans, that is, sets of improvements that apply to local, site-specific priorities and address SUSTAIN's key domains (e.g. offering training to staff to promote older people's involvement in improving integrated care for older people living at home planning and decision-making). Each steering group has agreed to implement their plans over the 18-month period from autumn 2016 to spring 2018. The implementation of improvement plans and the evaluation of implementation progress and outcomes per initiative are guided by the Evidence Integration Triangle model (see Figure 2) [42]. The Evidence Integration Triangle model, which has its origins in implementation science, supports the effective implementation of theoretical models and scientific evidence in daily practice by tailoring evidence to the multi-level context (i.e. the historical, political, economic, social, environmental, and cultural settings in which a service/programme is being implemented) in which local stakeholders (e.g. managers, health and social care professionals, representatives of older people and informal carers, local policy officers) operate. The Evidence Integration Triangle model thus corresponds well with the objectives of the SUSTAIN project. There are three main components to the Evidence Integration Triangle model: 1. The intervention, which in this case are the improvement plans of the different sites to work towards more person-centred, prevention-oriented, safe and efficient care. The plans include specific areas for improvement (e.g. information exchange between health and social care professionals, assessment of older people's needs, involvement of older people in the care process) together with actions required to realise such improvements (e.g. creating a shared platform for data sharing, designing a common multidimensional needs assessment tool, training of staff to empower older people). Each site designs and implements its own improvement plan and, consequently, interventions differ across sites; 2. The participatory implementation process, which is the collaboration of SUSTAIN research partners with local stakeholders. Regular meetings between SUSTAIN research partners and steering groups of local stakeholders will take place to design and implement the improvement plans. The research partners will also continue to provide support to the local steering groups by contributing improvement support from theoretical models, scientific evidence and best practices. Following the principles of the Evidence Integration Triangle model, SUSTAIN research partners will further conduct mid-course site-specific analyses so as to share emerging interim site-specific feedback to the steering group about outcomes and progress during the implementation process. In addition, overarching analyses will be undertaken, first, around month 12 of the improvement plans' implementation and second, shortly after the end of the 18-month implementation period to compare outcomes and progress at each 4 90site and communicate emerging themes to all of them. This will support local stakeholders to further refine their improvement projects and, thereby, foster rapid learning cycles at and between sites [42]; 3. Practical measures, a set of qualitative and quantitative data collection tools (see Table 3), for evaluating how the sets of improvements for each of the fourteen initiatives have impacted on SUSTAIN's key domains. The tools will further allow us to evaluate the implementation progress by focussing on perceptions and experiences of professionals, managers and the steering group of the fourteen initiatives, and on progress in implementing the different components of the improvement plans, including factors that were perceived to facilitate and impede progress. Data will be collected at agreed and specified times during the 18-month implementation period, using the same procedures and tools for all initiatives. In addition to a core set of data collection tools applied in all initiatives, sites are being encouraged to select site-specific tools tailored to their site-specific context and improvement priorities. All data collection tools developed by SUSTAIN research partners are prepared in English and are then translated into the sites' national languages. Regular meetings and teleconferences take place between research partners to standardise methods of data collection in each country. More detailed information about how the Evidence Integration Triangle model is applied in the SUSTAIN project will be described elsewhere [paper in preparation]. Figure 2.

Strict guidelines for data entry have been developed and are shared across research partners. For each site, quantitative and qualitative data analyses will take place to monitor outcomes and progress at the different integrated care sites. Qualitative data will be analysed thematically, quantitative data will be analysed using statistical methods. The coupling of qualitative with quantitative elements is the approach of choice for evaluating complex community-based interventions which are context bound and noted for their differences in application and implementation [14, 46, 47]. Uniform templates for analysis of each data source are generated through a discussion among research partners. As per the Evidence Integration Triangle model, research partners will conduct site-specific analyses during (month 12; autumn 2017) and at the end (month 18; spring 2018) of the 18-month implementation period to give the local steering groups insight into their progress, and provide them with starting-points for follow up action. In addition, overarching analyses will be undertaken around month 12 and shortly after the end of the 18-month implementation period, in which data from the different sites will be compared and integrated to identify recurring patterns in the implementation of the tailored sets of improvements. In order to enable comparison, uniform procedures for data analysis are being developed. In the overarching analyses, we will follow the principles of the case study design [32]. There will be three steps in our analyses: 1. all data sources will be analysed separately; 2. data will be reduced to a series of thematic statements for each data source; and 3. these site analyses will then undergo a process of pattern-matching across the data from all sites using the identified actions in the improvement plans and SUSTAIN's propositions (research questions) that have been formulated a priori: I. which actions in the improvement plans are able to improve person-centredness, prevention orientation, safety and efficiency of care?; II. which actions work for whom, in what context?; III. what are possible explanations for (not) succeeding in improving integrated care?; and IV. what is necessary to guarantee transferability and applicability of actions across the EU for improvement? By comparing outcomes, barriers, facilitators, and experiences, as well as taking into account the characteristics of the study participants and initiatives, we hope to be able to explore how outcomes and implementation progress at the different sites relate to their particular contextual factors and characteristics. In addition to the results of the site-specific analyses, those of the overarching analyses will also be communicated to the different sites so that they can learn from the experiences at the other sites and, where potentially relevant, apply lessons learned to their own context. Comparing and integrating data from the 4 4 96different sites will also support us to ascertain what works for whom, in what context and with what outcomes. As such, we intend to generate EU evidence on improvements to integrated care and their adoption and application to other European health and social care systems, and regions. Phase 3: Translation to products and impacts SUSTAIN dissemination partners will merge and translate all knowledge and experiences obtained in SUSTAIN to different products for policy-makers and decision-makers from different types of organisations tasked with designing, establishing and maintaining systems of integrated care that focus on older people with complex needs (e.g. national or regional governments, care delivery organisations, and representative organisations of older people and informal carers), during and after the end of the implementation period (spring 2018). This will include the development of an online roadmap, which is a set of instructions, guidelines and proposed actions that provides a step-by-step guide for improving integrated care. In addition, a toolbox will be developed which will be embedded within the roadmap, consisting of a collection of tools (e.g. tool to evaluate person-centredness, tool to evaluate experiences of professionals and managers), lessons learned (e.g. potential solutions for certain implementation issues), scientific evidence and good practices (e.g. actions that will enhance person-centredness), to support the process of improving integrated care. The rationale for developing a roadmap and toolbox is to support the flow of theory, evidence and experiences obtained and observed during the SUSTAIN project into practice. As such, the roadmap and toolbox aim to facilitate the implementation of the tailored sets of improvements at the fourteen sites during the SUSTAIN project, and to facilitate improvements to the way of working for other integrated care sites in Europe after the SUSTAIN project. Ethics statement Ethical approval has been granted by the ethical review committees of Estonia, Spain and the United Kingdom. In Austria, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands, research activities were exempt from the need for ethics committee review as allowed under national standards and regulations. Prior to data collection, informed consent will be obtained for all study participants. improving integrated care for older people living at home Discussion This paper has outlined the overall structure and approach of the SUSTAIN project; a European project designed to improve the current ways of working in fourteen existing integrated care initiatives for older people living at home with multiple health and social care needs. Many integrated care initiatives for older people with multiple health and social care needs have been introduced in European health systems in a diversity of contexts. These initiatives offer a rich and varied field of practical examples, as described for example in European-wide initiatives including INTERLINKS, the ICARE4EU project and the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIP-AHA) [48-50]. However, there is still discussion on how to measure and evaluate integrated care. This leads to practices being evaluated in different ways, which in turn complicates international comparisons. In SUSTAIN we are not evaluating integrated care programmes as a whole as previous studies have done. Rather we focus on how to identify and implement specific practical improvements to established initiatives based on previous evidence and their experiences with implementation of integrated care to date. We believe SUSTAIN can make important contributions to the research field, especially by contributing to European-wide sharing of evidence and improvement methods by employing uniform procedures for data collection and analysis. As such, we will be able to compare different initiatives across different settings through overarching analyses, thereby encouraging an understanding of generic and contextual factors affecting outcomes and progress of implementation. In addition to responding to methodological challenges in the area of evaluating integrated care, SUSTAIN further aims to respond to challenges related to knowledge transfer. The translation of project findings and their application into daily practice is fraught with conceptual and operational difficulties. Firstly, scientific evidence is usually developed in isolation from daily practice. As a result, it often fts uncomfortably in the settings and populations where it is intended to be applied, and as such sustainable implementation is scarce. The SUSTAIN project aims to respond to this challenge by taking an action-oriented approach based on the Evidence Integration Triangle model [42], in which local stakeholders and research partners co-design and implement transformative changes. By so doing, the changes implemented are expected to be better tailored to the stakeholders' context, which in turn may reinforce their motivation to improve current practice and establish sustainable change. Secondly, the rolling-out 4 98of the research findings to other health and social care systems, and regions is often limited due to difficulties in translating context-specific knowledge and experience to more generalisable recommendations. As a methodological framework, the Evidence Integration Triangle model provides a consistent approach that, when applied across multiple contexts, may be able to produce generalisable results to make improvements applicable and adaptable to other health and social care systems, and regions. Besides the opportunities offered by the SUSTAIN project, it should also be noted that our approach poses a challenge to SUSTAIN research partners. Indeed, they will have a dual role during the design and implementation of the tailored sets of improvements in the integrated care initiatives. On the one hand, they are scientific researchers monitoring and evaluating outcomes and progress at the sites. On the other hand, they are facilitators collaborating with local stakeholders by organising meetings, bringing local stakeholders together, and supporting the design and implementation of plans to improve current services. It will be important for SUSTAIN research partners to clearly adjust to these roles and to avoid inappropriately influencing decisions taken by local stakeholders. Firstly because the improvement projects should reflect the preferences of local stakeholders at the sites to encourage the success and sustainability of the improvement projects; and secondly, because lessons learned should be applicable for other contexts not involved in the SUSTAIN project. A number of other projects aside from SUSTAIN aim to provide guidance to a broader implementation and scaling up of good practices in integrated care across European regions, including SELFIE, ACT@Scale and JA-CHRODIS [51-53]. Although each project has its own unique approach, perspective and/or target group, it will be important for these projects to look for opportunities in achieving synergy. Combining each research project's strengths and perspectives may result in for instance a more comprehensive evidence base or greater consensus on how to evaluate integrated care, upon which we will be able to provide meaningful recommendations to policy-makers and decision-makers and share what can be learned from these European-wide projects. In conclusion, the SUSTAIN project intends to generate valuable evidence on improving integrated care for older people, and to transfer this knowledge within the SUSTAIN programme and to other regions and health and social care systems in Europe and beyond. By translating lessons learned to products targeted at policy-makers and decision-makers from different types of organisations, we aim to inform improving integrated care for older people living at home those managing and improving care for older people with multiple health and care needs.

However, knowledge about further improving integrated care is limited. In fourteen integrated care sites in Europe, plans to improve existing ways of working were designed, implemented and evaluated to enlarge the understanding of what works and with what outcomes when improving integrated care. This paper provides insight into the existing ways that the sites were working with respect to integrated care, their perceived difficulties and their plans for working towards improvement. The seven components of the Expanded Chronic Care Model provided a conceptual framework for describing the fourteen sites. Although sites were spread across Europe and differed in basic characteristics and existing ways of working, a number of difficulties in delivering integrated care were similar. Existing ways of working and improvement plans mostly focused on three components of the Expanded Chronic Care Model: delivery system design; decision support; self-management. Two components were represented less frequently in existing ways of working and improvement plans: building healthy public policy; building community capacity. These findings suggest that broadly-based prevention efforts, population health promotion and community involvement remain limited. From the Expanded Chronic Care Model perspective, therefore, opportunities for improving integrated care outcomes may continue to be restricted by the narrow focus of developed improvement plans. improvement plans of fourteen European integrated care sites Introduction An increasing number of older people with complex needs live in their homes and communities into their later lives. Their complex needs require multidisciplinary collaboration to optimise the effectiveness of assessment and care coordination processes. Integrated health and social care models appear to provide promising approaches for organising continuous, person-centred care for older people with complex needs living at home [1-6]. We define integrated care as those initiatives that proactively seek to structure and coordinate care and support around older people's needs and in their home environments [3-5, 7-10]. Numerous integrated care initiatives targeted at older people have been implemented in a wide range of settings and contexts, in and outside Europe [11-14]. Integrated care delivery is expected to have a positive impact on the quality of care and outcomes for older people, including improved satisfaction with care [15, 16] and psychological health or wellbeing [17]. However, empirical evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrated care is still inconclusive, partly due to the heterogeneous nature of the integrated care sites and/or the use of different outcome measures [5, 18, 19]. In addition to implementing new care models, literature shows that improvements to existing services are necessary to enhance their effectiveness and further improve integrated care [12, 18, 20-23]. This also includes the need for a greater focus on population health promotion in integrated care programs for older people [24]. Yet, knowledge of how to implement such improvements successfully remains limited, as is knowledge of how to transfer good practices and experiences to other contexts [25]. This paper reports from the cross-national research project 'SUSTAIN' (Sustainable Tailored Integrated Care for Older People in Europe) [26], which aims to address the above challenges and to accelerate improvements in integrated care for older people. In the project, established integrated care sites for older people agreed to work with SUSTAIN researchers to develop and implement plans designed to improve their existing ways of working. Throughout the project, SUSTAIN researchers followed up and evaluated the design and implementation processes and outcomes of improvement plans for each site, of which findings were reported elsewhere [27-33]. Through studying different types of integrated care sites across different European countries and settings together, the SUSTAIN project aimed to enhance understanding of what does and does not work and 5 5 with what specific outcomes for integrated care across a rich and varied field of practical examples. Thereby, SUSTAIN intends to provide the basis for the transfer and application of learning about improving integrated care across Europe and elsewhere. In order to understand outcomes and progress of implementing improvements in the integrated care sites, as a first step, insight into the existing ways of working of the sites and content of their improvement plans is essential. The aims of this paper are therefore: (i) describing and comparing the characteristics and existing ways of working of the integrated care sites participating in SUSTAIN, (ii) describing and comparing perceived limitations in their existing ways of working, and (iii) describing and comparing the content of improvement plans drawn up by each integrated care site in SUSTAIN. Methods Study design Fourteen established integrated care sites were selected - and agreed - to participate in the SUSTAIN project. The integrated care sites were located in seven European countries: Austria, Estonia, Germany, Norway, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Criteria for their selection included a primary focus on older people living at home with complex needs and the involvement of professionals from multiple health and social care disciplines. In addition, sites should be willing and committed to improve their current practice by working towards more person-centred, prevention-oriented, safe and efficient care [26]. Prior to the start of the project, SUSTAIN researchers invited integrated care sites in their countries, known to be committed to improving existing ways of working, to participate in SUSTAIN. Most sites had a longstanding partnership with one of the SUSTAIN researchers. Local SUSTAIN research partners collaborated with the sites in each country to design and eventually implement improvement plans over an 18-month period. Improvement plans were co-created by local stakeholders and SUSTAIN researchers, and shaped by local stakeholder priorities to improve current practice in their own site. No additional resources were made available from the SUSTAIN project to contribute to funding for the costs of implementing the plans in the sites. The SUSTAIN project team comprised two groups of research partners: 1) seven country-specific research teams, who facilitated improvement processes in two improvement plans of fourteen European integrated care sites per country each by bringing local stakeholders together and supporting the design and implementation of improvement plans. Country-specific research teams were also responsible for monitoring the processes associated with designing and implementing local improvement plans, and evaluating how the sets of improvements impacted on care for older people, also referred to as 'site-specific evaluations'; and 2) a group of research partners responsible for the 'overarching analysis' through which findings from site-specific evaluations undertaken in the fourteen sites were compared and contrasted to identify recurring patterns in the design and implementation of integrated care improvements [34]. The latter team also led the drafting of this paper. Data analysis To obtain insight in the existing ways of working and characteristics of the sites, their perceived limitations and the improvement plans, all country-specific research teams were responsible for data collection and analysis in their own sites. They performed this in their own language. Based on these site-specific evaluations, they produced three sets of documents in English. As such, for each individual site, the following documents were produced: i. Baseline reports: providing insight into the characteristics of each integrated care site, their perceived difficulties and limitations regarding their existing ways of working, and potential areas for improvement [35]. ii. Project plans: providing details on the content and implementation of the improvement plan. The plans included the sites' ambitions and rationale for improving current practice, together with the actions and resources required to implement it. iii. Flow charts: depicting the existing way of working and how the improvement plan would modify it. The three sets of documents were built on qualitative and quantitative data gathered from the sites using different data sources. Data sources included interviews (with older people receiving services, informal caregivers, professionals and managers), researchers' field notes, minutes of workshop meetings, and structured templates for uniform description of the sites and the improvement plans completed by SUSTAIN researchers and local stakeholders from the sites. More information on the principal methods used for collecting and analysing site-specific data for the purpose of the three sets of documents can be found in Appendix 5.1. Because of language barriers, the group of research partners responsible for the 'overarching analysis' was not able data. They instead carried out content analysis of the three sets of documents produced for each site by the country-specific research teams for the current paper. The overarching analysis team reviewed all documents to describe, compare and contrast the characteristics and existing ways of working of the integrated care sites, their perceptions of difficulties and limitations regarding their current practice, and the content of improvement plans of those sites. In the content analysis, the Expanded Chronic Care Model (ECCM) was used to provide a conceptual framework for analysing and comparing the existing ways of working and the improvement plans of the fourteen individual sites in a consistent and systematic way. The ECCM is a development of the Chronic Care Model (CCM), where the latter is a well-known model that describes the essential elements of a proactive health system capable of improving the quality of care for people with chronic diseases [3, 36, 37]. The CCM focused on four components of integrated working: self-management support ; delivery system design ; decision support; and clinical information systems . Barr et al. argued that the CCM was developed within a too narrow paradigm and that it should be extended to incorporate a broadly-based focus on prevention by including the social determinants of health, and the principles of health promotion as well as clinical prevention services [7]. As a result, Barr et al. developed the ECCM by adding three further components: build healthy public policy ; create supportive environments; and build community capacity [7]. The ECCM was used for analysing existing ways of working and contents of improvement plans. This sought to provide insight into the extent to which existing ways of working and the improvement plans of the different sites were in alignment with the conceptualisations and ambitions of the ECCM. For the purpose of this study, the components of the ECCM were adopted to provide a common framework for identifying core characteristics of the fourteen integrated care sites. The descriptions of the components of the ECCM from the original research were subject to limited revision for adoption within the SUSTAIN project with its specific focus on care and support for older people living at home with complex needs (Table 1) [7]. The ECCM was not used as the basis or criteria for designing the improvement plans. For this study, content analysis was conducted in different steps, based on both a deductive improvement plans of fourteen European integrated care sites i. Relevant data on the existing ways of working and the improvement plans were extracted from the three sets of documents. Information about the existing ways of working and the content of the improvement plans for each site were coded according to the individual ECCM components (i.e. deductive approach): self-management support; delivery system support; systems; build healthy public policy; create supportive environments; and build community capacity. Coded data allocated to each ECCM component were then examined in order to identify and define recurring patterns in the activities across the sites. Within each ECCM component, activities were then clustered into a number of main activities (per ECCM component) to facilitate data interpretation (i.e. inductive approach). These main activities will be described in the Results section (and the Tables). ii. Also relevant data on the perceived difficulties were extracted from the three sets of documents. Data were then examined in order to identify and define recurring patterns across the sites (i.e. inductive approach). The difficulties were clustered into five subcategories, which are described in the Results section. The results obtained from this analytical process were reviewed by two members of the research team responsible for the overarching analysis (AS and GW). After the initial analyses were conducted, AS consulted members of the country-specific research teams to verify their interpretation of site-specific analysis results. This was done by sharing and discussing the tables with interpreted data with the members of these country-specific research teams at two time points. These consultations took place face-to-face (first iteration) and by e-mail and telephone calls (second iteration). Based on these consultations, AS and GW restructured and supplemented the analyses where necessary. Table 1. Components of the Expanded Chronic Care Model [7].

Results Characteristics and existing ways of working of integrated care sites The integrated care sites provided different types of care and support services including home nursing and rehabilitative care, proactive primary care for frail older people, dementia care, care for older people being discharged from hospital, and improvement plans of fourteen European integrated care sites (end of life) care (Table 2). Care settings and the type and number of providers varied across sites. Some consisted exclusively of medical professionals, whereas others involved broadly equal numbers of health and social care professionals. Staffing patterns were broadly similar in individual sites providing the same types of care and support services. For instance, in all proactive primary care sites, at least one GP and one (practice) nurse were involved. Differences between sites were observed in the numbers and combinations of ECCM components identified in their existing ways of working (Table 3). Only two sites (SUR and S\u00d8N) included all seven components of the ECCM model, six (GPC, CPC, OSO, SAB, GCM and HF) included five or six out of seven ECCM components, two (RMZ and PB) included three or four components, and four (ACC, MED, WICM and O75) included only one or two components. Differences were also observed in the types of ECCM components identified in the categorisation of existing ways of working. The components delivery system design and self-management were identified most often. All sites included actions or activities related to the delivery system design component. These were primarily associated with the establishment of multidisciplinary teams and the specification of the latters' internal operating processes, such as needs assessments and joint care planning mechanisms. Sites in proactive primary care were similarly underpinned by an emphasis on systematic needs assessment and case conferences. Self-management was primarily operationalised through the provision of information and advice to older people, and by involving them in care planning to promote shared decision-making. A number of rehabilitative care sites were specifically focused on strengthening personal capabilities to live independently at home. Most sites aimed to create supportive environments in the home, primarily through home safety assessments, providing assistive equipment (e.g. mobility aids) and installing adaptations to the physical environment of the home (e.g. raised toilet seat). About half of the sites addressed the ECCM components: build and strengthen community capacity and action ; decision support ; and build healthy public policy . Collaborations with community groups (for instance a patient advocacy organisation, other voluntary organisations and churches) were being developed to build and strengthen community capacity and action . Actions to provide decision support primarily focused on training and advice to professionals and volunteers within the site as well as to external stakeholders (e.g. health and social care professionals providing care and support to people with dementia). To build healthy public policy , the sites aimed to influence national or regional 5 health policies, for instance through participation in national working groups and networks, or by providing service development exemplars through their status as pilot projects. Information systems were in place in some sites. However, none had created a comprehensive information system including all the participating care and support organisations. Instead, professionals from the same sector usually exchanged information about service users using e-mail, electronic messaging systems or electronic patient record systems. Perceived difficulties in the existing ways of working Several common difficulties associated with existing ways of working were reported across the fourteen sites during interviews and workshop meetings with local stakeholders from the sites. The importance of the difficulties for the sites was highly context-dependent. Table 4 shows how we clustered them into five categories. The first, mentioned in almost all sites, was the difficulty they encountered in securing coordination and collaboration among the organisations and professionals participating in the site. This category included some very basic barriers such as the absence of sustainable and clear agreements about roles and responsibilities of organisations and their professional staff. In addition, a lack of knowledge about and trust in areas of expertise of different health and social care providers were observed. Co-operation between organisations providing services within the same care setting (e.g. primary care) was considered easier than co-operation between organisations from different care settings. Because of differences in cultures and visions of organisations, stakeholders from some sites specifically reported that collaboration with external stakeholders, for instance with the community and social care sectors, was weak or not yet in place despite the recognised importance of assessing and addressing the broad range of older people's needs. A second frequently reported difficulty was the lack of information sharing within and between organisations. The absence of shared IT systems or incompatibilities between systems complicated information flows and contributed to restricted levels of communication and collaboration between professionals and organisations. A third difficulty related to limited resources and support, and particularly having to rely on temporary funding for integrated care sites with all the uncertainties about their longer term future which accompanied such funding. Its consequences influenced levels of staff recruitment and retention. Furthermore, financial barriers between the health and social care sectors were perceived as major obstacles for working in an integrated way. Stakeholders from different sites indicated that these barriers could be partly due improvement plans of fourteen European integrated care sites to absence of vision on integrated working and commitment to removing or at least minimising financial barriers at national, regional and local levels. A fourth difficulty flowed directly from the third in the shape of the impact of staff shortages in health and social care. Professionals reported heavy workloads, and saw this factor as one which limited their motivation and capacity to participate in training programmes. A final area of difficulty was in developing better quality person-centred practice. Particular instances included limited communication with older people and their informal caregivers, lack of shared-decision making, and difficulties in tailoring services to the needs and preferences of the older person. Possible explanations given by local stakeholders were professionals' limited time availability and lack of knowledge. The fundamental nature of these limitations suggested person-centred practice in at least a number of sites was at a fairly early stage of development. Improvement plans In all sites, local steering groups were set up. Steering groups consisted of stakeholders who participated in the interviews and workshop meetings together with additional local stakeholders whose participation was considered relevant. During one or several meetings, depending on the site, members of these steering groups designed improvement plans with support from country-specific research teams. Sites differed in the extent to which discussing local improvement priorities and designing together improvement plans was a straightforward process. Most sites based their improvement plans on the difficulties they had identified during interviews and workshops with their research partners. However, a small number of sites drafted plans focused on issues that were based on pre-existing issues identified by managers before the workshops took place. Table 5 presents twelve improvement plans including their objectives and planned actions and activities for realising them. Table 5 can be found in Appendix 5.2. Two sites decided to withdraw from the SUSTAIN project before the completion of the design of their improvement plan (WICM and CPC). They felt unable to design a plan with a realistic prospect of implementation due to limited staffing, restricted time and a lack of support from stakeholders. Table 5 shows that the objectives of the twelve improvement plans could be grouped according to one of two major emphases: i. General improvements to local capabilities for coordination, collaboration and communication with other care and support organisations and especially by enhancing knowledge and understanding of different organisations' roles 5 and responsibilities. Plans focused on both internal and external partners with whom collaboration was seen to be sub-optimal or non-existent. Examples of activities or actions were: meetings to improve understandings of professionals' roles and working relationships including inter-professional training based on case examples. This focus on improving inter-professional relationships was expected to improve care delivery processes at the clinical level. ii. The second main approach to improvement in the plans was to focus more directly on improving specific care delivery processes. Some plans concentrated on providing care in a more person-centred way, while others focused on specific aspects of the care process such as improving case management and arrangements for hospital discharge. Other examples included: organising effective meetings between health and social care professionals, older people and their informal caregivers to shape and validate their care plans; and providing rehabilitation services at home instead of in an institution. Five plans (SUR, S\u00d8N, OSO, SAB and O75) covered five out of seven ECCM components, three plans (ACC, PB and HF) covered four components, two plans (GPC and MED) covered three components, and two plans (RMZ and GCM) covered two components. All improvement plans included actions or activities related to delivery system design . These activities included the development of co-operation and communication between staff of different organisations and professions by, for example, conducting joint care reviews and establishing agreements on information sharing for individual patients. Decision support improvements were targeted in most improvement plans and included proposals to adopt new needs assessment templates and joint care planning frameworks to support comprehensive and person-centred ways of working. Training programmes for staff working with such tools were also included in decision support improvements. A smaller number of the improvement plans addressed self-management , strengthening community action , information systems and creating supportive environments . Self-management improvements primarily built on current ways of working such as the provision of information and advice about the availability of local services, and the involvement of older people and their informal caregivers in the development of their care plans. Actions to build and strengthen community capacity and action included developing the capacity and contribution of voluntary organisations to support integrated care. Information system activities included the development or expansion of access to paper-based improvement plans of fourteen European integrated care sites electronic patient records for existing and/or new organisations and professionals. Under the heading of creating supportive environments , one project designed a resource map to expand access to advice and information services about neighborhood resources. Discussion Summary of results The aim of this paper was to describe and compare existing ways of working, perceived limitations and plans for improvement among fourteen integrated care sites participating in SUSTAIN. Although the fourteen sites were spread across seven European countries and, to varying degrees, differed in their basic characteristics and existing ways of working, a number of the difficulties and areas for improvement were very similar. In many sites, difficulties were associated with coordination, collaboration and communication (information sharing) between different health and social care providers, together with aspects of funding, staffing levels and person-centred working. Most improvement plans were based on those difficulties, although some plans focused on pre-existing issues already identified by managers from the sites. Similarities in the objectives of improvement plans were also observed. Objectives of improvement plans could be grouped according to two major emphases: 1) improving or expanding inter-professional coordination, collaboration and communication among care and support organisations in order to more fully engage them in the site, and 2) improving the actual care delivery process including more attention to person-centred working. Understanding these results in the context of the integrated care literature The difficulties in existing ways of working, as identified in this study, are also observed in other studies as barriers to successful integration of care for older people across Europe [38-41]. Although knowledge about improving integrated care is yet limited, the aims and activities within the improvement projects were also found in other studies [38, 39, 42, 43]. Coordination, collaboration and communication and person-centred working were recognised in the fourteen sites participating in SUSTAIN as frequent shortcomings in their existing ways of working as well as constituting priority themes in most of the improvement plans. In contrast, limited (financial) resources and staff shortages, though frequently mentioned as important difficulties, were not explicitly addressed in the improvement plans. Such issues are more generally within the remit and influence of \"higher level\" policy-makers and decision-makers than staff of local projects [41, 44, 45]. The improvement plans' focus on improving person-centred and collaborative practice between local stakeholders can, therefore, be considered consistent with their day-to-day experiences of delivering care and the improvement routes open to personnel at their level. Knowledge about the impact of sufficient (financial) resources or lack of (financial) resources on the objectives and content of improvement plans is still limited. Also in our research proposal, financial data or information about funding for integrated working to gain this insight was not included. We suggest it might be a priority for future research on improving integrated care [46-49]. The need for improved coordination, collaboration and communication, are also important themes in earlier studies on integrated care [38, 39, 50]. As observed in this and earlier studies, working towards good inter-professional collaboration requires knowledge, understanding and communication about one another's roles, responsibilities and expertise [38, 39, 50]. The joint development of care plans and the opportunities for more frequent communication provided by multidisciplinary meetings can be necessary building blocks for improving collaboration [51]. There is also evidence from other studies, as from this one, highlighting the importance of sharing personal data about individuals' health and wellbeing, and the development of joint care plans across organisational and professional boundaries [52, 53]. In this context, shared data systems or other IT strategies may support communication and patient information exchange [38, 51]. In the SUSTAIN sites, however, data sharing and communication were impeded, as in other programmes, by incompatibilities between IT systems together with data-protection and privacy concerns. Overcoming these challenges has been found to be difficult in earlier studies [38, 50]. However, increasing attention to digital solutions in care may generate more technical options and support for shared data systems and other information technology that enable communication and knowledge transfer in integrated care. Policy-makers should therefore concentrate on technological infrastructures that enable seamless data sharing together with robust data protection and that can be operated through inter-operable (national) digital systems to support well-coordinated integrated care systems. Actions and activities related to the ECCM components delivery system design , decision support and self-management were most frequently found in the improvement plans. To the best of our knowledge, no other studies used the ECCM to describe ways of working of integrated care programmes and the content of improvement plans. Other studies in which CCM components were used to describe such programmes also primarily included activities related to delivery system design and/or self-management [5, of fourteen European integrated care sites 55]. The incorporation of actions and activities related to these components suggest a collective recognition among local projects of the need to work towards better inter-professional and inter-organisational collaboration and communication, and also towards the empowerment of older people and informal caregivers. However, actions and activities related to the three additional components of the ECCM (build healthy public policy , create supportive environments , and build and strengthen community capacity and action ), and most especially actions related to building healthy public policy , were found in only a smaller number of existing ways of working and improvement plans. As mentioned, the ECCM, rather than the CCM, was used to provide a framework for describing and comparing the integrated care sites in SUSTAIN. The ECCM incorporated a broadly-based focus on prevention by including the social determinants of health, and the principles of health promotion as well as clinical prevention services [7]. The additional ECCM components reflected the need for closer associations between health service systems and the community, including social care and the voluntary sector. As such, the ECCM was consistent with the criteria we developed for inviting integrated care sites to participate in the SUSTAIN project, being broadly-based prevention and involvement of community services [26], and therefore thought to be suited better to this study. However, our analysis showed that integrated care sites were more often underpinned by components from the CCM than by the additional ECCM components. Thus we concluded that most of the sites in our study did not appear to have adopted the approaches based on addressing social determinants of health, population health promotion and community capacity building that the ECCM and its evidence base suggest are necessary for optimising integrated care. Similar limitations have also been recognised in earlier studies [24]. A possible reason may be the composition of groups of stakeholders involved in developing the improvement plan, which were particularly medically focused and lacked representation from health promotion practitioners. Merging population health promotion with clinical health care services may yet contribute to improved outcomes for older people and their informal caregivers [7]. As such, the under-representation of ECCM components highlights the need for greater attention to the population and community-oriented elements within integrated care for older people with complex needs [24, 56]. Further knowledge about how to incorporate population health promotion and enhanced community participation into integrated care models appears to be required. 5 5 Strengths and limitations of data collection and analysis Comparison of integrated care sites across different countries and care settings, necessarily poses methodological challenges. Accordingly, the country-specific research teams were expected to employ common templates for data collection and analysis. Although small variations in the way data were collected were observed, no significant differences were found, which provides a reasonable degree of confidence about the consistency of our approach. To understand the coherence between individual data sources for each site and to overcome issues with different languages in which data have been collected, the overarching analysis team conducted content analysis of documents provided by the country-specific research team. The reliability and validity of our findings were also tested, as described above, by checking the results from the overarching analysis with country-specific research teams and their local sites. In all these ways, therefore, the SUSTAIN project sought to mitigate the challenges posed by its multiple sources of data, and multiple contexts as well as the different (methodological) backgrounds of its research partners. In addition to collecting and analysing site-specific data, country-specific research teams also collaborated with local stakeholders to facilitate the design of the improvement plans. The potential risks to methodological rigour of this dual role should be acknowledged [26]. SUSTAIN's approach had anticipated this by distinguishing two types of research partners. The overarching analysis team consulted members of the country-specific research teams about the sites in their countries, which was intended to mitigate these potential risks by reinforcing their scientific distance from their data as well as creating space for critical reflection on their own role in the research process. Conclusion Integrated care sites across Europe that sought to implement improvements were found to experience similar challenges in their existing ways of working. Improvement plans to address the challenges tended to have one of two different emphases: 1) improvement of local stakeholder communications and collaborative processes, leading indirectly to improvements in care delivery, and 2) direct improvement in care delivery systems and tools. Adoption of the ECCM model as a tool for cross-site comparison suggested that, in the main, the sites did not draw on the perspectives and approaches associated with broader approaches to prevention, population health promotion and community involvement. Greater attention to the population and community-oriented improvement plans of fourteen European integrated care sites within integrated care for older people with complex needs may bring the development of integrated care a step further.

International Journal of Integrated fourteen European integrated care sites Appendix 5.1 Site-specific data collection and analysis For each site, the following sets of documents were reviewed for the purpose of the overarching analysis. These documents were produced by country-specific research teams in English, based on data collected and analysed for each of their sites in their own language. In all sites, data were collected and analysed using standardised procedures and tools to ensure consistency of approach. The principal methods used for collecting and analysing site-specific data for the purpose of these documents are described here: Baseline reports To gain insight into characteristics and existing ways of working of each integrated care site, their perceived difficulties and limitations, and potential areas for improvement, mixed-methods evaluation approach was used. 1. Interviews: interviews were conducted with the following four study participants per site: one older person receiving care services from the integrated care site in that particular country, one informal caregiver, one health or social care professional involved in the site and one manager of the site. In two sites, the interview with the older person or the informal caregiver did not take place because of difficulties in recruiting participants and scheduling the interviews. The professionals and managers were recruited by the research partners, while the users and informal caregivers were recruited by professionals and managers. Interviews covered the context and characteristics of the site, the existing ways of working, perceived strengths and difficulties in the existing ways of working, and potential areas for improvement. The interviews were audiotaped with interviewees' permission and transcribed verbatim or summarised. All research partners used the same semi-structured interview schedules for their interviews to ensure uniformity of approach. 2. Characteristics of site tool: managers were also asked to provide factual information on the \"characteristics\" of their site (e.g. rationale, aims and objectives, structure, outcomes) and to highlight key stakeholders for the sites. 3. Workshop meetings: workshop meetings with local stakeholders were organised to discuss outcomes of the interviews and to determine local improvement priorities based on perceived difficulties. Stakeholders included managers, health and social care professionals, representatives of older people and informal caregivers, and/or local policy officers. In some sites, workshop participants 5 5 also included health care purchasers and health care regulators, (representatives of) older people/service users and informal caregivers, and the regional health authority. Workshop participants were selected and invited by the workshop leaders (who were either the managers of the site or the research partners in that particular country). Attendance of these meetings varied between sites, ranging from six to thirteen participants. The number of workshop meetings varied across sites, depending on local needs and preferences. A workshop protocol was designed collaboratively by the research partners to provide guidance to the workshop leaders, and to ensure uniformity of approach. Research partners attended these meetings and took minutes and field notes of them. AnalysisSite-specific data were centrally managed in a secure online database accessible to research partners. Interview data were analysed thematically using uniform templates for analysis. The \"characteristics of the site\" tool was analysed using a uniform Excel template. Themes were extracted from workshop meetings minutes. Project plans A template to support a structured and uniform description of the implementation of the improvement plans was generated by structured discussion among research partners. Country-specific research teams completed the template after agreement on the (first version of the) improvement plan. Flow charts Guidelines for creating a flow chart depicting pre-existing patient pathways and changes required by each improvement plan were developed through structured discussion among research partners. The flow charts included new or modified actions, stakeholders, materials and processes to realise it. Country-specific research teams completed the flow charts after agreement on the (first version of the) improvement plan. of fourteen European integrated care sitesAppendix 5.2 Table 5.

Introduction Although person-centredness is a key principle of integrated care, successfully embedding and improving person-centred care for older people remains a challenge. In the context of a cross-European project on integrated care for older people living at home, the objective of this paper is to provide insight at an overarching level, into activities aimed at improving person-centredness within the participating integrated care sites. The paper describes experiences with these activities from the service providers' and service users' perspectives. Methods A multiple embedded case study design was conducted that included thirteen integrated care sites for older people living at home. Results Service providers were positive about the activities that aimed to promote person-centred care and thought that most activities (e.g. comprehensive needs assessment) positively influenced person-centredness. Experiences of service users were mixed. For some activities (e.g. enablement services), discrepancies were identified between the views of service providers and those of service users. Discussion and conclusion Evaluating activities aimed at promoting person-centredness from both the service providers' and service users' perspectives showed that not all efforts were successful or had the intended consequences for older people. Involvement of older people in designing improvement activities could ensure that care and support reflect their needs and preferences, and build positive experiences of care and support. integrated care for older people Introduction In Europe, integrated care sites are increasingly being put in place to provide care to older people with multiple health and social care needs who live at home [1, 2]. In this context, integrated care is defined as those approaches that proactively seek to structure and coordinate health and social care for older people in their home environments, centred around older people's needs [3-7]. One of the main principles of integrated care is person-centredness [8-12]. The literature includes several definitions of person-centredness but a universally agreed one is lacking [13-18]. Common elements in these definitions include: 1) empowering and encouraging people to participate actively, as equal partners, in decision-making processes about their own care, and/or to manage their own health and care; 2) establishing an accommodating, cooperative and ongoing relationship between the professional, the person receiving care and the informal carer, including respectful communication and active listening; 3) having an understanding of the specific (health) concerns of the person, and their individual needs and preferences; 4) addressing the physical, cognitive, psychological and social domains of the person's life; and 5) providing coordinated care to achieve continuity and coherence of care and support [19]. Even though integrated care appears to be a promising approach for organising services more comprehensively around the needs, preferences and capabilities of individual older people [20], effective implementation of person-centred care is still a challenge [21, 22]. Involvement of older people in decision-making regarding their own care and support processes is often limited, since they are often regarded as passive recipients of care rather than active participants. This results in services that are insufficiently consistent with older people's values and preferences for care and support [16, 23]. Additionally, studies have reported difficulties with communication and information exchange between professionals and older people. Such difficulties included the lack of attentive listening, and insufficient efforts to understand older people's individual needs [16, 24, 25]. Overall, successfully embedding person-centred care remains a struggle. In addition, person-centredness is a multi-dimensional concept, perceived by different actors in different ways. Some efforts made by professionals to improve person-centredness may be experienced rather differently by those receiving the care and support [26-28]. Therefore, the perspectives of both service providers and service users (i.e. older people and their informal carers) need to be taken into account to obtain a comprehensive and accurate picture of person-centred ways of working. 6 The research presented in this study aims to promote an understanding of how person- centred care is delivered in the context of integrated care, and to do so from multiple perspectives. This study was conducted within the European project SUSTAIN (Sustainable Tailored Integrated care for older people in Europe). It aimed to improve integrated care for older people living at home across different regions in Europe [7]. In the SUSTAIN project, stakeholders from established integrated care sites and researchers collaborated to develop and implement a wide variety of activities to improve different aspects of integrated care, including person-centredness. Within the above context, the objectives of this paper are: 1) to identify the activities undertaken as part of integrated care sites within SUSTAIN that aimed to promote person-centredness in care and support for older people living at home; and 2) to understand the perspectives of multiple actors (i.e. managers, health and social care professionals, older people and their informal carers) on these different activities undertaken. For this paper, we provide insights on person-centredness in the context of integrated care, and from a SUSTAIN-wide perspective. Thus, the paper's perspective is on the overarching patterns that were identified across all the SUSTAIN sites, rather than on findings and experiences from individual sites. Methods Design and setting In the SUSTAIN project, thirteen integrated care sites were involved, and they were located in seven countries in Europe: Austria, Estonia, Germany, Norway, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. These sites served different target groups and provided different types of care services, including proactive primary and social care for frail older people, care for older people being discharged from hospital, care for people with dementia, and home nursing and rehabilitative care (see Table 1). Between autumn 2015 and spring 2018, SUSTAIN's research partners supported local steering groups at the integrated care sites, consisting of representatives from different organisations (e.g. GP practice, hospital, home care organisation, social care organisation, municipality, advocacy organisation for older people), to design and implement their improvement plans. Plans consisted of sets of activities to improve different aspects of integrated care, including person-centredness, and reflected the priorities of local stakeholders [7, 21]. For each of the thirteen integrated care sites, SUSTAIN's research partners evaluated: 1) progress in implementing the different sets of activities that were part of the improvement plans, including factors that were perceived to facilitate or impede progress, and 2) the impact of the improvement plans on aspects of integrated care. integrated care for older people In SUSTAIN, a multiple embedded case study design was adopted to evaluate and compare the implementation of activities to improve integrated care across different existing integrated care sites for older people [7, 29, 30]. Each site served as one case study, using data triangulation to enhance the robustness of the study [29, 31]. The multiple case study design enabled analysis of data across different situations (i.e. integrated care sites) to learn about improving integrated care across Europe, and enhanced understanding of the similarities and differences between the cases [30]. Building the individual case studies A two-step data analysis approach was adopted: 1) thirteen individual case studies were conducted and written up [32-38], after which 2) an overarching analysis of the case studies was conducted. The design of the SUSTAIN project is described in further detail elsewhere [7]. This paper reports on the second step, which means we focus on outcomes at a SUSTAIN-wide, overarching level. Individual case studies were built on qualitative and quantitative data gathered from the sites using a set of qualitative and quantitative data sources. Data were collected from health and social care professionals and managers from the integrated care sites, older people receiving services from the initiatives and (informal) caregivers of these older people. More details on the set of qualitative and quantitative data sources can be found in Table 2. To build the individual case studies, the gathered data were analysed against predefined propositions (research questions) [29, 39] using a three-staged approach, as argued by De Bruin et al. [7]. The different steps undertaken for data-analysis can be found in Table 3. Standardised data collection tools and data analysis templates were employed by all research partners in order to ensure uniform research methods and methodological consistency across all case studies. Data collection tools and data analyses templates that were used across the case studies were developed through discussions between all involved research partners. Tools and templates were provided in English and subsequently translated into the national languages. Data collection and the initial phase (step 1) of data analysis were conducted in the national languages; the second and third steps of data analysis were conducted in English (see Table 3). Regular meetings and 6 place between research partners in order to standardise methods of data collection and analyses across the different case studies. The individual case studies were described in seven country-specific reports (written in English) by SUSTAIN's research partners [32-38]. Each report was dedicated to one or two case studies from each country that participated in the SUSTAIN project and paid specific attention for the local and country context where improvement processes in the sites took place. Reports described the improvement plans of each site and the experiences with and outcomes of the improvement activities from perspectives of multiple actors (i.e. managers, health and social care professionals, older people and their informal carers).

Thus, the overarching analysis aimed to identify recurring patterns and themes related to person-centred activities and experiences across all case studies, rather than on specific findings from individual sites. The starting-point of this overarching analysis was a content analysis of the country- specific reports in which the individual case studies were described. One researcher (AS) extracted data from the reports that provided information on activities that aimed to promote person-centredness, and on experiences of managers, professionals, older people and their informal carers with these specific activities. The common elements of person-centredness (i.e. sharing power and responsibility; therapeutic relationship or alliance; patient-as-person; biopsychosocial approach; and coordinated care) were used to retrieve relevant information about promoting person-centredness from the reports [19]. The overarching content analysis was guided by the Framework Method, which supports thematic (qualitative content) analysis of textual data [44]. To conduct the analysis, a coding scheme was developed based on the objectives of this paper (i.e. deductive approach) and on the themes that emerged from reviewing the data (i.e. inductive that aimed to improve person-centredness. Specifically, managers' and professionals' views and those of older people and informal carers were compared to see whether they were in agreement with or contradicted each other. When gaps in knowledge or uncertainties based on the country-specific reports were identified, the analysis templates from individual case studies were consulted. Relevant additional data gathered from 6 6 this latter step were included in the overarching analysis. Draft findings were discussed among all authors throughout the analysis process. Table 3. Description of three-staged approach for data-analysis of the case studies. Step 1 Data were analysed seperately for each individual data source (for each indi- vidual case study). For each data source, uniform templates for analysis have been generated, as appropriate for that specific data source. Qualitative data have been analysed thematically, quantitative data have been analysed using statistical methods. Appendix 6.1 provides the templates that have been developed to analyse each data source. Step 2 After analysing each individual data source, results for that source were reduced to a series of thematic statements (in case of qualitative data) and summaries (in case of quantitative data). These summaries and thematic statements were provided in English. Step 3 For each case study, English thematic statements and summaries were amalgamated and underwent a process of pattern-matching across the data to gain insight into the experiences with the improvement process of the integrated care site. In order to guide this process, an analysis framework was developed (Appendix 6.2). Research partners analysed data against two propositions and five analytical questions: Proposition 1: Integrated care activities will maintain or enhance per- son-centeredness, prevention-orientation, safety, efficiency and coordina - tion in care delivery. Proposition 2: Explanations for succeeding in improving existing integrated care sites will be identified.Analytical question 1: What seems to work and with what outcomes when making improvements to integrated care?Analytical question 2: What are the explanations for succeeding and im - proving integrated care sites?Analytical question 3: What are the explanations for NOT succeeding and improving integrated care sites?Analytical question 4: Are there any factors that are particularly strong in your analysis that could be seen as having an impact on integrated care improvements?Analytical question 5: What factors can you identify in your site analysis that could apply to integrated care improvements across the EU, and be integrated care for older people Ethical considerations Ethical review committees of Estonia, Norway, Spain (Catalonia) and the United Kingdom provided ethical approval of the SUSTAIN project. In Austria, Germany and the Netherlands, national standards and regulations allowed for the exemption of research activities from the need for ethics committee review. Informed consent was obtained for all study participants in all countries (including Austria, Germany and the Netherlands) prior to data collection. Table 4 .

The second section outlines the activities undertaken as part of integrated care sites within SUSTAIN that aimed at promoting person-centredness in care and support, as identified in the document analysis. Then, the third section sheds light on patterns in perspectives and experiences of multiple actors (i.e. managers, professionals, older people and their informal carers) concerning these activities. In line 6 with the objectives of this paper, the results from the analysis (i.e. activities undertaken and recurring patterns and themes across the case studies) are reported at a SUSTAIN-wide level rather than that of individual case studies. Characteristics of study participants In total, 244 older people participated across all thirteen case studies (Table 5). The proportion of females was 67%. On average, 23% of the older people were aged between 65 and 74 years, 42% were aged between 75 and 84 years, and 35% were 85 years or older. They had 5.2 medical conditions on average (range: 0-12). The proportion of older people living alone was 51%. In total, 80 informal carers were involved across all case studies. On average, 15% of the informal carers were aged between 18 and 44 years, 39% were aged between 45 and 64 years, and 46% were 65 years or older. The average proportion of female informal carers was 69%. A total of 35 managers and 205 professionals participated across all case studies (Table 5). The average proportions of managers aged between 35 and 54 years or 55 years or older were 60% and 29% respectively. The large majority were female (80%). Similar to the managers, the professionals were also mostly aged between 35 and 54 years (59%) and the large majority were female (87%). Table 5. Number of participants involved in each case study.

To further promote and improve person-centredness, they either implemented additional activities or revised existing ones. Activities pertaining to person-centredness were found to fall into four clusters (Table 6): 1. Activities related to the design of health and social care delivery process; 2. Activities related to the organisation of training for staff; 3. Activities supporting communication and information exchange between professionals, older people and informal carers; 4. Activities facilitating the involvement of older people and informal carers in decision-making regarding their own care and support. Some of these activities were implemented by several integrated care sites in SUSTAIN, whereas others were implemented by only one or two sites. 6 that aimed to promote person-centredness as part of integrated care sites within SUSTAIN. Clusters of activities Design of health and social care delivery processWorking in multidisci - plinary care teamsImplementing electronic care plansConducting comprehensive assessment of care needsChanging the location of health and social care delivery from institutions and doctors' offices to people's homes Staff training Providing training on shared decision-making and person-centredness of careProviding training on health conditions and diseases (i.e. early de-tection of dementia) of older peopleProviding training on in - ter-professional communi - cation and collaboration Communication and information exchange between professionals, older people and infor - mal carersProviding various options for older people and in-formal carers to commu-nicate with professionalsSharing information about available commu - nity servicesProviding older people with a single point of contact as pertains to their health and social care needsGiving older people and infor-mal carers access to care plans Facilitating the involve - ment of older people and informal carers in care and supportDiscussing older people's needs, preferences, goals and prioritiesInvolving informal carers in the care processEmpowering older people (i.e. providing them with training on shared deci-sion-making and self-man - agement integrated care for older people Design of health and social care delivery process The first cluster included activities related to the design of health and social care delivery processes. Most sites implemented activities to facilitate or strengthen multidisciplinary working between professionals from health and social care organisations and/or community partners (e.g. a day centre for older people), through case conferencing meetings or multidisciplinary meetings. These meetings were organised to reflect perspectives of different professionals to support a comprehensive approach to care. Also, information about individuals' health and wellbeing were shared in these meetings. In only a few sites, professionals had access to electronic care plans, in addition to regular staff meetings, in order to support the sharing of information about older people's care needs among different professionals. In almost all sites, different professionals came together to conduct a comprehensive and joint (single) assessment of older people's care needs and to define actions to be included in care plans. The equal consideration of both the health and social perspective, and thus the recognition that they were equally valid in assessments, was expected to contribute to a thorough understanding of the broad range of older people's needs. Only a few sites paid explicit attention to the needs for care and support of informal carers. In several sites, the location of health and social care delivery was changed from a hospital, rehabilitation institution or doctors' office to older people's own homes. Services such as needs assessments and discussions about care plans, but also enablement or rehabilitation services were provided in older people's home settings. They were thought of as comfortable and secure environments for receiving services, and (more) appropriate for conducting needs assessments. As a manager stated: \"...those who earlier needed an institutional stay can now receive help at home. That means a lot to the user...Also, the changes reduce the number of transfers for the user [who] no longer has to first be transferred from hospital to an institution, and then home. Now, the user can go straight home.\" (Manager in Surnadal site) Organisation of staff trainingThe second cluster of activities pertained to the organisation of training. Sites organised staff training to facilitate a more person-centred way of working. A few of them offered training to professionals on person-centred care and shared decision-making. The intent was to increase communication skills and promote active listening among professionals 6 to improve shared decision-making processes. One site organised training for hospital staff on early detection of dementia. This was done to raise awareness of dementia so as to enable early recognition of symptoms and the provision of timely follow-up care and support. In another site, training on inter-professional communication and collaboration for professionals from different health and social care organisations were organised to encourage teamwork. Professionals learned to collaborate as a team and develop a network around the older person to ensure that older people are at the centre of care and support. As one involved professional said: \"[...] collaboration with the others involved in my working area. Or OUR working area, I should say. Just that you know where to find each other. Eventually, that will benefit the patient, when you are able to make good arrangements with each other. Co-ordinate the care together, and see what is necessary from whom and tailor that to the patient's needs.\" (Professional in Geriatric Care Model site) Communication and information exchange between professionals, older people and informal carersThe third cluster included activities supporting communication and information exchange between professionals, older people and their informal carers. Most sites offered various channels (e.g. home visits, phone calls or e-mail contact) through which professionals could communicate with older people and informal carers in a quick and easy way. Professionals shared information with older people and their informal carers about services available to help them navigate easily through health and social care. For this, one of the sites focused on increasing knowledge about community services among staff. The staff were then able to inform older people about the range of services available that may support (some of) their needs. Also a single point of contact (e.g. key contact, case manager or practice nurse) for older people and their informal carers was implemented to improve information flow about available services: \"She's [Practice Nurse] given me a telephone number so I can get in touch if I want any help.\" (Older person in Over 75 Service site) In one site, such information was made more accessible through the installation of a central information point (i.e. service centre). integrated care for older people In addition, care plans with information about older people's functioning, care needs and goals were developed. Only in a small number of the sites were the care plans shared with older people and their informal carers. Furthermore, few provided older people and their informal carers with active roles (as delineated in the care plans) within their own capabilities, and according to their own preferences. Facilitating the involvement of older people and informal carers in care and support The fourth cluster included activities facilitating the involvement of older people and informal carers in decision-making regarding their own care and support. Professionals involved both older people and their informal carers actively in needs assessments and care planning processes, and incorporated their preferences and goals into the subsequent plans for care and support. One manager explained: \"[...] We have been working on [incorporating] a ...focus on mastery in our check-lists and facilitating [this] so that [the user] can be as independent as possible. We know that we come from a \"help culture\" where we rather ask 'What do you need help with' [since we know best] rather than what we wish to turn the question towards 'What is important to you now?' and hear what the user says. [...]\" (Man - ager in Surnadal site) In only one site, older people and their informal carers were invited to a multidisciplinary meeting to express their needs and wishes, and to validate their tailored and individualised care plan. One of the sites offered workshops to older people to empower them in shared decision-making, self-management, and identifying their needs and wishes. The workshops included content related to growing older and supported older people to reflect on their needs and preferences, together with their peers. Also one of the sites offered enablement at home (i.e. in-house reablement and rehabilitation) services to older people returning from hospital, the intention being to support them to recuperate, regain and maintain their independence at home. Experiences with the activities that aimed to promote person-centredness Experiences with the health and social care delivery processOverall, case studies suggested that, from the perspective of older people and their informal carers, professionals worked well together and shared information with each other about older people's care process. In a few sites, professionals had access to electronic care plans and held regular staff meetings, all of which supported the exchange 6 6 of information between professionals such that older people did not have to repeat themselves. Even so, case studies suggested that some older people felt overwhelmed or experienced mistrust from the involvement of different professionals in the care processes and the unclear delineation of their roles. There were also practical difficulties related to involvement of different professionals, as illustrated in one case study where organising multidisciplinary meetings attended by at least one health and one social care professionals proved to be challenging. Health and social care professionals felt that conducting joint needs assessments improved person-centred working since they better understood the broad range of older people's and their informal carers' needs. Case studies showed that the experiences of older people and their informal carers were, however, mixed. On the one hand, many older people and informal carers were aware that a needs assessment had been carried out. They were satisfied and felt that all their needs were assessed and adequately met. Additionally, they indicated that professionals considered all domains of their lives rather than focusing exclusively on their illness or disabilities. Furthermore, in some sites, informal carers also indicated that their needs were assessed comprehensively, and that the support they received was practical and also focused on their wellbeing. On the other hand, case studies also highlighted that not all older people and informal carers had these positive experiences. Older people and informal carers sometimes indicated that their care needs and preferences were not fully assessed or assessed at an inappropriate time (for example within a few hours after hospital discharge), or that professionals focused mainly on clinical information instead of having a comprehensive approach towards their health and social care needs. Across the different case studies, professionals indicated that providing care at home was comforting for older people, thereby contributing to a more person-centred way of working. Home visits helped professionals to better understand the older people's (home) situation and their needs and preferences. As a result, professionals mentioned that they were able to provide advice and support that were more contextually relevant care for older people \"The added value of doing that [assessment] at their terrain [home] which is very important. [...] really the fact that you go to his context, and you go there, and that you are really there, and that they can explain to you: \"Look, this is the kitchen, this is the bathroom, I do not have that, this is what happens to me, look, there are stairs for getting into the house...\", I believe that this is an important added value, we would say, and they ... I think they have perceived it in a satisfac-tory, very much, as a plus.\" (Professional in Sabadell site) Older people and their informal carers mostly appreciated receiving care and support in their own home environments. However, some older people who were discharged from hospital experienced difficulties with receiving services in their home environments. They felt discharged from the hospital before they were fully prepared, which made them feel that the decisions being made were not in their best interest, as one older person said: \"Yeah, I wasn't 100% sure I was ready to come out.\" \"And was that a concern about anything in particular?\" \"It was just the way I was feeling in myself, I just...\" \"Sure, a general lack of confidence, you felt that you needed to be looked after (for) a little bit longer?\" \"Yeah, I just thought it was such a short (time). To me, it seems (like) quite a serious operation, and it seemed like I was just being pushed out, basically.\" (Older person in Swale Home First site) Experiences with staff training Findings from the case studies revealed that professionals had different views as to whether the training they had received improved person-centred working. Professionals indicated that training in order to increase knowledge about dementia or to promote inter-professional collaboration increased their awareness of diseases and conditions older people may suffer from, and the services available for older people. This helped them to arrange care and support services that were more aligned with older people's functioning and needs. As one professional stated: \"The lectures were the centrepiece.\" (...) \"We are much more attentive now than before. Not only the nurses are more sensitive with respect to these early signs but our physicians too. How should I put it...Yes, now, we don't pass by if something seems strange, we look twice.\" (Professional in Gerontopsychiatric Centre 6 On the other hand, not all professionals had a positive experience and they mentioned that the training did not meet their needs. They wanted more in-depth training, focused on specific communication skills, which would be helpful in discussions with older people about their wishes and preferences and, thereby, enhance older people's involvement in decisions about their care and support. Experiences with communication and information exchange Generally, case studies suggested that communication and relationships between staff, older people and their informal carers were experienced as positive. Overall, older people indicated that staff listened to them and treated them with kindness and respect. As quoted: \"Are you happy with the way they treat you; the patience, with respect, are they kind...?\" \"Yes, yes, yes! It goes without saying.\" (Older person in Sabadell site) They were also satisfied with the amount of time that professionals spent with them. Nonetheless, some older people felt that professionals gave them little time and attention, particularly when there were staff shortages. Furthermore, case studies highlighted that older people and their informal carers greatly appreciated the different ways in which they could communicate with professionals (e.g. home visits, phone calls or e-mail contact). Older people and their informal carers mentioned that this improved their personal relationship with professionals. In addition, continuity of care, for instance through a single point of contact, enhanced relationships and trust between staff and older people. The single point of contact further contributed to person-centredness as older people knew who they could contact (e.g. in case of changing care needs) and felt that they were really being cared for and that their needs were being addressed very well. \"I've recently had the flu unfortunately and all I had to do was to phone the surgery and I was speaking to the doctor straightaway. I had the flu jab. So she [Practice Nurse] said, 'you know, anything you need please phone'. I was looking after [User], and [Practice Nurse] was trying to look after me.\" (Informal caregiver in Over 75 Service site) Being transparent and clear, and using language that is easy to understand, were considered important in information sharing between professionals, older people and care for older people their informal carers. Across sites, most older people and their informal carers were satisfied with the way information was communicated to them about the available care and support services, whereas a minority indicated that information was not clearly or comprehensively shared with them. Older people differed in their awareness of the existence of care plans, in whether or not they had access to (a printed copy of) their care plan, and in how important it was for them to have access to their care plan. Although older people and informal carers might be less concerned about this, case studies noted that lack of access to care plans meant that important information about care was not readily available to older people and their informal carers, which undermined person-centred care. Experiences with the involvement of older people and informal carers in care and support Case studies showed that professionals were positive about discussing options for care and support, and setting goals together with older people and informal carers. Professionals indicated that this helped to improve person-centred practice because they felt better able to align care and support with individual wishes and preferences. Furthermore, professionals perceived that older people highly valued being involved in planning their care and support. Case studies highlighted that the experiences of older people and informal carers were, however, more mixed than those of professionals. Many older people indicated that they discussed their needs and preferences with professionals, and they felt involved in decisions about their care. As one older person stated: \"[...] I decide what I want [to receive] help with. They could have helped me wash, but I do not want that. I prefer that [my wife] does it.\" (Older person in Surnadal site) However, some older people felt that decisions were made without them and they did not feel meaningfully engaged in discussions about care options, their goals and what was important to them. They found it difficult to express their needs and wishes to professionals, or to voice their concerns if they wanted changes to their care or support or felt dissatisfied. Across different sites, also managers and professionals observed that a group of older people did not necessarily feel competent or capable of contributing to shared decision-making. This was explained by older people's (mild) cognitive impairments context, where traditionally people were not used to expressing their preferences or participating in decisions (about care). Across sites, most older people and their informal carers were satisfied with the way professionals involved informal carers in planning older people's care and support because informal carers were often well-placed to represent older people's needs and preferences. Still, informal carers were sometimes involved less than they had hoped for by professionals: \"[...] But I was not asked: Do you agree that he is going to that hospital? Other - wise I would have said: Leave him here... I always asked that: I hope he can stay until there is room in that rehabilitation centre?\" (Informal caregiver in Good in one Go site) In addition, a few older people were dissatisfied that their preferences and choices for care and support were only discussed with informal carers and not also with them, or they did not want the informal caregivers to be involved at all. Overall, workshops that were organised for older people to empower them in shared decision-making and self-management were appreciated by them and helped them to feel supported. It also enabled them to express their wishes and preferences better, thus enhancing shared-decision making and self-management. Enablement at home for older people returning from hospital can be empowering for older people, according to the professionals involved. However, older people indicated that receiving these services can be experienced as challenging. This is particularly the case immediately after being discharged from hospital and one does not have support from close informal carers \u2014 and may be feeling anxious, exhausted and in need of greater care input. Discussion Summary of results The aim of this paper was to identify the activities undertaken as part of different integrated care sites aimed at promoting person-centredness of integrated health and social care for older people living at home, and to gain insight into patterns in the experiences of multiple actors with these activities. This study shows that despite the variation between integrated care sites, similar activities have been implemented to care for older people promote person-centredness, which could be clustered into four categories: design of health and social care delivery process, staff training, communication and information exchange, and involvement in care and support. Overall, professionals and managers were satisfied with the implemented activities and thought that most activities positively influenced person-centredness. However, the experiences of older people and informal carers were mixed. For certain activities, for instance enablement services, an apparent discrepancy was identified between managers' and professionals' views on person-centred approaches compared with those of older people and informal carers. Understanding these results in the context of the literature This study describes a range of different activities that aimed to enhance person-centredness and were undertaken in diverse settings across Europe. Many of the activities, such as co-designing care plans, sharing information about available services, and engaging close relatives in the care process, were also found in other existing studies about implementing and improving person-centredness [18, 45-47]. However, this study also identified activities that were not directly related to person-centredness as conceptualised in the literature [19], but were nonetheless undertaken within the SUSTAIN case studies as part of a move towards person-centred care. These included, for example, staff training on awareness of older people's health conditions and diseases, or training on inter-professional communication and collaboration. Such activities were implemented in the hope that they would improve person-centredness indirectly, and alongside other aspects of integrated care (e.g. prevention-orientation, safety, efficiency or coordination of care). This study therefore shows that different (types of) activities to embed and improve person-centredness in integrated care do co-exist. As also stressed in earlier studies [45, 48], the operationalisation of person-centred care takes many different shapes and forms. In this study, such differences included variations in local priorities, and differences in the receptivity and readiness of older people to receive adapted, person-centred services, due to local cultural and historical factors. Since improvement processes are highly context-dependent, a one-size-fits-all approach to person-centred care would probably have been inappropriate in any case [49]. This study demonstrates that the integrated care sites had taken steps to embed and improve person-centred care, by implementing activities that aimed to improve several elements of person-centredness as conceptualised in the literature [19]. However, this study also demonstrates that further enhancements towards a person-centred care approach were still required. Some elements of person-centredness were underrepresented or 6 posed mixed experiences between service providers and service users. As in previous studies [16, 23, 50], challenges were experienced in delivering supported self-care and shared decision-making, which highlight difficulties in empowering older people. Instead of considering service users as experts in their own care and support, and making them full and essential members of their care team, empowerment is often reduced to 'patient education' [50, 51]. It seemed that some health and social care professionals remained paternalistic in their approaches to care and support and did not fully prioritise the meaningful engagement and empowerment of older people [22]. Barriers reported from the provider perspective included time and resource restrictions, professionals' competence gaps, or preconceptions about which older people or clinical situations would benefit from active involvement or shared decision-making [19, 52, 53]. However, it should also be noted that activities that aimed at promoting person- centredness - including active participation, empowerment and leadership from older people - may not always match older people's own preferences and capabilities [54, 55]. For older people, elements such as a trusting and accommodating care relationship, empathetic communication and continuity in providers may be more important aspects of person-centred care than their active participation [56, 57]. Furthermore, barriers to greater participation in the decision-making process, such as communication issues and cognitive impairment, are more prominent among older people [58]. For older people experiencing difficulties securing involvement in their care and support or navigating complex health and social care systems, receiving support to get the right care at the right time, such as in care advocacy initiatives, can be helpful [59, 60]. Overall, older people's individual interests and preferences regarding the role they wish or are able to play are important, and should be supported and respected when striving for meaningful and purposeful engagement of older people [56, 57, 61]. This study highlighted the difference in views and interpretations of person-centred care between service providers and service users (i.e. older people and their informal carers). This finding has also been observed in other studies [28, 62, 63]. Several methodological, clinical and contextual factors contributing to these different views have been described [28]. One of the potential explanations is the limited involvement of service users, not only in their own care and support, but also in the more extensive processes of service development and improvement [60, 64]. Despite increasing recognition of the distinctive role service users may play in those latter processes, successful involvement remains limited [65, 66]. Also, we found little representation and engagement of older people and care for older people informal carers in the SUSTAIN improvement processes, with only a few sites including representatives from patient advocacy organisations, despite the literature recommending the active involvement of service users (or their representative organisations) in successful improvement processes [67, 68]. Their experiences and insights had been found to help identify potential improvements not previously identified by professionals [50, 64, 67]. As a result of their inputs, improvements were more likely to respect service users' values and beliefs, thereby incorporating aspects of improvement important to them. Crucial components for promoting involvement include clarity about the rationale for their involvement and clarity about their roles and responsibilities [67]. Methodological considerations This paper describes a multiple embedded case study, in which individual case studies were compared and findings integrated. The individual case studies provided the opportunity to understand the coherence between individual data sources and the local context of an integrated care site. However, comparing and integrating the individual case studies across diverse countries and contexts posed potential methodological challenges. First, differences in the professional and cultural backgrounds of SUSTAIN's research partners, who worked across different (political, economic and historical) contexts, may have influenced their interpretations of person-centredness. This diversity, in turn, may have contributed to small differences in case study descriptions. Second, the SUSTAIN project involved seven European countries. Therefore, data were collected in multiple languages. Some countries even have multiple (official) languages, such as Estonia, where both the Estonian and Russian languages are spoken. This complicated uniform and standardised measurement and comparison between case studies, particularly with regard to the qualitative data sources. To address these challenges, a lot of effort was put into achieving harmonisation and alignment between case studies. Regular and structured discussions among the project partners enabled the development and use of standardised tools and procedures for data collection and analyses as well as for building the case studies. This supported comparability and comparison between individual case studies. Furthermore, research partners coordinating the overarching analysis supported local research partners in step 2 and step 3 of building the individual case studies (Table 3) to review and support internal consistency. No inconsistencies between research partners were found, which provides a reasonable degree of confidence about the consistency of approach across the case 6 6 studies. We were therefore able to conduct a reliable overarching analysis of findings from individual case studies in different countries and contexts. In this study, a case study design was adopted because of its perceived potential to evaluate complex community-based activities that were context bound, noted for their differences in implementation, and serving multiple purposes simultaneously [29]. While this type of design did not allow us to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the various sites' activities, we were able to provide insights into the experiences and perceptions of stakeholders from different evidence sources and their various viewpoints. New approaches, such as the case studies that were employed in SUSTAIN, are increasingly being recognised as helpful and are therefore recommended for the evaluation of complex community-based interventions. Furthermore, it should be noted that despite the fact that much effort has been put into uncovering older people's experiences of service use, it has continued to be difficult to capture data about the features of care and support that really mattered to them [69]. Due to the data collection tools that were used, SUSTAIN's research partners and local care staff also found it challenging to document the experiences of older people with multiple health and social care needs. It is recommended future research should specifically focus on how to overcome such problems. Conclusion This study shows that stakeholders from integrated care sites across Europe undertook a wide variety of efforts to place older people at the centre of their care and support. Experiences from multiple perspectives showed that several of the activities undertaken have the potential to promote person-centredness. However, not all of the efforts were successful or generated the intended consequences for older people. Further improvements in integrated service design and delivery are required to engage and empower older people more widely and more effectively in their care and support. Such improvements should be critically evaluated from the separate perspectives of users, their friends and families, and also those responsible for their planning and allocation. In addition, the meaningful involvement of older people in improvement projects is a fundamental prerequisite if they are to be more fully person-centred - and, thus, increasingly tailored to their needs and preferences for integrated care and support. integrated care for older people Funding This study was part of the SUSTAIN project which was funded under Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) from the European Commission under grant agreement No. 634144.

They were not aware of having a care plan and were not interested in the information that was written in it. Several respondents indicated to have difficulties with answering questions xx and xx. They indicated that xxx. Therefore the percentage of missing data for these questions is relatively large. Analysis template PCHC Instructions: 1. Create a table presenting the average score per single item of the PCHC 7-11 months assessment. This information can be retrieved from the output file of SPSS/SAS (or any other statistical program).

Average scores on the different items varied from xx to xx, showing that xxx. Almost all respondents (95%) indicated that they were the ones that were in control of their care. Percentage of missing values was particularly high for items xx and xx. Potential explanations may be that xxx. Scores on the three subscales were xxx. The overall mean score of the items of part B of the survey was 3.2. 6 6 Age group Living situation Educational level Males (mean; SD)Fe- males (mean; score - part B (1-5) Summary report We distinguished the following subgroups: sex, age group, living situation and educational level. The overall mean PCHC mean score was higher for males than for females. Etc. Analysis template TCI 14 items Instructions: 1. Create a table presenting the average score per single item of the TCI 0-6 months assessment. This information can be retrieved from the output file of SPSS/SAS (or any other statistical program). Please note that thematic statements no longer have to be formulated for the quantitative data since they are only used in qualitative research. Instead, please analyze your quantitative data and put the outcomes in the tables/templates suggested in this document. Please write a short summary sheet of the most striking findings, including your interpretation of the findings and including a summary of any comments that respondents gave during the completion the TCI. 2. Subgroup analyses will be conducted for the overarching analyses only and not for the site-specific analyses due to small sample sizes. However, your sites may be interested in differences between groups. So we are suggesting that, where there are sufficient data, partners can give the steering groups some impressions or 'subgroup commentary' as feedback. Most striking findings can care for older people included in the short summary sheet (see above). Subgroups you can think of include: sex, area of work and type of profession (manager vs. professional). 3. Repeat step 1-2 for the data from the TCI at 13-17 months. 4. Write a summary report reflecting most striking differences in scores on individual TCI items, the TCI subscales and overall TCI score between the 0-6 months and 13-17 months assessment data (e.g. The overall mean TCI score was a bit higher at 13-17 months assessment as compared to 0-6 months, implying that respondents' experience with team coherence improved over time, etc.). % (N=) Mean score (SD) Scores on individual TCI items (1-5)1.

The overall TCI mean score was xx, implying that xxx. The average scores on the different individual items varied from xx to xx. Percentage of missing data was largest for items xx and xx. This might have been related to the fact that xxx. 6 score on TCI subscale xx was higher as compared to the other three subscales. This seems to reflect that xxx. Etc. Subgroups Sex Area of work Type of profession Males (mean; SD)Fe- males (mean; total mean score (1-5) Summary report We distinguished the following subgroups: sex, area of work and type of profession. Total TCI mean score was higher for males than for females Etc. Analysis template user interview Instructions: 1. This template should be used to extract and analyse data from the user interviews. 2.

This template should be used to extract and analyse data from formal steering group meeting notes and your reflective notes on those meetings. You should also draw on additional data - field notes (for example correspondence with steering group members outside of meetings) 2. This process can be started as early as you like (different sites have different numbers of steering group meetings). A summary analysis should be produced just before the month 12 and month 18 steering group to inform the discussion. A final analysis should be produced after the month 18 steering group. integrated care for older people 3. Code all meeting notes based on the themes outlined in the table below. There is some guidance in italics in the sections to help you to think through what to enter, and examples drawn from a UK site in red. You can either paste extracts or write summary information into the table and analyse using Word, or use a program for analysing qualitative data. Data that are entered into the 'coded data' section of table can be in your own language. 4. For any extracts or summaries, identify where it is from, using a code and date (YY/MM): SGM for steering group minutes; RN for for field notes. E.g. SGM17/03; RN17/03; FN16/02 5. Please note that it is important not to 'invent' things just to fill the boxes. If there is no data in your steering group minutes, reflective notes or field notes that relates to a particular theme, just leave it blank. 6. Sometimes, an extract might fit in more than one box (where it overlaps two or more themes). In such cases, paste the extract in all themes that are relevant (this is like double or multiple coding). 7. After extracting coded data from ALL steering group meetings/notes, formulate thematic statements for each theme (examples are included in red). While the coded data can be in your own language, the thematic statements need to be translated into English. It is important to remember that you will be generating thematic statements based on a number of people saying similar things, not just one or two, however powerful their statement. So if one person only has raised an issue in one of the subthemes, it cannot be developed into a thematic statement unless it is echoed by others during the steering group meetings. 8. Enter onto the online database a) your thematic statements in English, and b) the final version of your completed analysis template and c) your minutes and field notes in your own language General conventions to follow (as evidenced in the examples below): 9. Make sure the year is included on every entry within the coded data boxes. You will then be able to consider time (and change over time) in the formulation of your thematic statements. E.g. \"Lack of a dedicated leader at the start of the implementation period hindered the improvement process\". \"The introduction of a political imperative to free up more beds at month 7 helped to get strategic level support for the improvement project, which enabled new resources to be allocated to it\". the data, use square brackets [like this] to replace names of people or organisations, as I have done in the example below.

Health Care in many integrated care programs, a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is conducted to identify older people's problems and care needs. Different ways for conducting a CGA are in place. However, it is still unclear which CGA instruments and procedures for conducting them are used in integrated care programs, and what distinguishes them from each other. Furthermore, it is yet unknown how and to what extent CGAs, as a component of integrated care programs, actually reflect the main principles of integrated care, being comprehensiveness, multidisciplinarity and person-centeredness. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: (i) describe and compare different CGA instruments and procedures conducted within integrated care programs for older people living at home, and (ii) describe how the principles of integrated care were applied in these CGAs. A scoping review of the scientific literature on CGAs in the context of integrated care was conducted for the period 2006-2018. Data were extracted on main characteristics of the identified CGA instruments and procedures, and on how principles of integrated care were applied in these CGAs. Twenty-seven integrated care programs were included in this study, of which most were implemented in the Netherlands and the United States. Twenty-one different CGAs were identified, of which the EASYcare instrument, RAI-HC/RAI-CHA and GRACE tool were used in multiple programs. The majority of CGAs seemed to reflect comprehensiveness, multidisciplinarity and person-centeredness, although the way and extent to which principles of integrated care were incorporated differed between the CGAs. This study highlights the high variability of CGA instruments and procedures used in integrated care programs. This overview of available CGAs and their characteristics may promote (inter-)national exchange of CGAs, which could enable researchers and professionals in choosing from the wide range of existing CGAs, thereby preventing them from unnecessarily reinventing care programs: a scoping review Introduction Older people want to stay independent and live in their homes and communities until old age [1, 2]. As the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions and disability increases with age, older people who live at home may suffer from limitations in the physical, cognitive, psychological, social and/or environmental domains of life [3, 4]. These limitations may challenge older people's social participation and independent living, and result in complex health and social care needs. There is growing evidence that integrated health and social care is a promising approach to address such care needs [5-10]. Based on the Chronic Care Model and related models, we define integrated care as those initiatives that proactively seek to structure and coordinate care for older people in their own home environments, centered around their needs [7-9, 11-13]. Integrated care programs for older people living at home vary in types and numbers of intervention components. Most programs comprise frailty screening, multidisciplinary consultation meetings, case management, individualized care plans and follow-up contacts to monitor the status of older people and the implementation of personalized care plans [14-17]. Another prevalent component within these programs to foster integration of care is the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), also referred to as needs assessment, multidimensional assessment or geriatric assessment [14-22]. The CGA can be defined as a multidimensional and interdisciplinary diagnostic process to identify older person's capacities, problems and needs, of which outcomes can serve as input for the development of a coordinated and shared plan for care and support and long-term follow up [23]. Through providing a uniform process for assessing needs, a CGA may promote shared understanding of older people's needs, common professional language and agreed-upon practices and standards, which are considered essential ingredients in integrated care [20]. A CGA helps health and social care professionals to understand problems and care needs older people experience, so that services professionals provide are matched to the needs and preferences of the people they serve [3, 24]. Also for older people themselves it is important to understand and acknowledge their (unmet) care needs, as this is expected to increase their involvement in and control over their care and support. This in turn may support them to keep living in their own home environments [24, 25]. Furthermore, a CGA enables proactive and early identification and management of care needs. Such a (preventive) assessment coupled with a plan for care and follow-up may have significant benefits for older people's wellbeing including a reduction of hospital admissions, moves into long-term care, falls and long-term mortality [26-28]. In the wide range of integrated care programs for older people living at home, different CGA instruments and procedures (i.e. standardized processes that were adhered to when undertaking a CGA) for conducting a CGA are in place. Although some studies reflect the variety of CGAs in integrated care [16, 19], a complete overview of CGAs instruments and procedures used in the context of integrated care for older people living at home is not yet available. Such an overview would provide insight into the characteristics of the various available CGA instruments and procedures for conducting them in integrated care programs, and allow for comparison between CGAs. Additionally, for CGAs as an intervention component of an integrated care program, we hypothesize that the principles of integrated care are reflected in this specific component. However, it is yet unknown how and to what extent CGAs actually adhere to these principles. Such insights may help researchers and professionals with selecting a CGA from the range of existing instruments and procedures, and increase their awareness of differences between CGAs and their applicability in different integrated care contexts. We therefore conducted a review of the literature in order to: (i) describe and compare different CGA instruments that are being used in integrated care programs for older people living at home, and procedures for conducting them, and, (ii) describe how the principles of integrated care are being applied in these CGAs. Methods In order to explore, map and synthesize information on CGAs in the context of integrated care, a scoping review was conducted. The methodological steps outlined in the Arksey and O'Malley framework for conducting scoping reviews were followed to undertake such a review [29]. This process included five steps: (i) identifying the research question, (ii) identifying relevant studies, (iii) selecting appropriate studies, (iv) charting the data, and (v) collating, summarising and reporting the results [29]. Identifying research questions The research questions were as follows: 1. What are the characteristics of the integrated care programs in which CGAs programs: a scoping review 2. Which CGA instruments and procedures are used in integrated care programs for older people living at home? 3. What are differences and similarities between CGA instruments and procedures to conduct a CGA? 4. How and to what extent are principles of integrated care reflected in CGA instruments and procedures for conducting a CGA? Identifying relevant studies A systematic literature search was conducted in the electronic databases Medline/PubMed, Embase and Scopus. The databases were searched for scientific English language papers published between January 2006 and June 2018 describing integrated care programs for older people living at home.

When considered relevant by both reviewers, the full text paper was retrieved and reviewed for its relevance again. Any disagreement between the reviewers was resolved by consulting a third reviewer (SdB) to reach consensus. In this study, three key components were selected, which were considered to represent the main principles of integrated care [9, 10, 20]: (i) comprehensiveness: focus on problems and (care) needs in different domains of life (e.g. physical, cognitive, psychological, social and environmental),(ii) multidisciplinarity: involvement of health and social care professionals from multiple disciplines and sectors, and (iii) person-centeredness: active involvement of older people and their informal carers in decision-making and planning their care process, and putting their capacities, needs and preferences at the center. For the present study, papers were eligible if they met the following inclusion criteria: 1. The integrated care program itself as described in the paper complied with our main principles of integrated care: (i) comprehensiveness, (ii) multidisciplinarity, and (iii) person-centeredness; 2. The integrated care program aimed to address frailty or complex/multiple health and social care needs in multiple domains of life which may benefit from an integrated care approach; 3. The target population of the integrated care program included people aged 65 years and older living at home. Living at home means living in their own homes or in some form of assisted living. Also papers that focus on people enrolled in an integrated care program that was started during hospitalization and was continued after people's discharge in their home environment were included; 4. The integrated care program contained a CGA and consisted of multiple components or interventions (e.g. CGA is followed by designing and executing an individualized care plan); 5. The paper concerned a study protocol of the integrated care program or an intervention study evaluating the impact of a program. These papers were expected to provide most extensive information about the CGA or provided a reference to a paper in which such information could be found. In case the CGA was described elsewhere, the paper which was referred to was also included in this study. A description included the CGA instrument and/or procedures programs: a scoping review conducting the CGA. Procedures were the standardized processes that were adhered to when undertaking a CGA including established guidelines and experiences from practice. Duplicate studies, papers not written in English or not retrievable, and non-scientific papers (e.g. an editorial) were excluded. For this study, the methodological rigor of the included studies was not evaluated [29]. This was in line with the principles of scoping reviews, as the focus of our study was to map existing literature on a specific topic (in this case CGAs in integrated care) rather than to evaluate the impact of a particular intervention. Charting the data Two authors (AS and PvG) extracted relevant data from the studies included. A standard data extraction sheet was developed to capture all relevant aspects. The identified integrated care programs were reviewed as to their main characteristics: country, program objective, target group, setting and involved professionals. In accordance with our research aims and objectives, the detailed description of the CGA instruments and the procedures for conducting the CGA included name of CGA instruments/tools, its origin, composition, extensiveness, information available about the content of the CGA, format to conduct the CGA, validity, reliability, feasibility, location where the CGA was administered, duration, and required staff training for conducting the CGA. The decision to extract this information was made after extensive review of included studies to determine most important features of CGAs and a subsequent discussion between authors. In addition, data about the way and the extent CGAs reflected the main principles of integrated care were extracted from the papers, being comprehensiveness, multidisciplinarity and person-centeredness. Collating, summarising and reporting the results The findings of this review are presented using a narrative style as well as using tables to systematically present all specific details about the CGA instruments and procedures, and the incorporation of the principles of integrated care in the CGAs. The results section will first describe the output of the literature search. Then the characteristics of selected integrated care programs will be described to provide insight into the context in which CGAs were conducted. Then, the results will report characteristics of the CGA instruments 7 and procedures for conducting them, their differences and similarities, and the extent to which they incorporate principles of integrated care. Results Study retrieval A total of 972 articles were identified in the original literature search (Figure 1). On the basis of their titles and abstracts, 128 publications were selected for full text screening, of which 39 were included in this study. Thirteen papers were added after reference tracking to provide a more thorough description of the integrated care program and the CGA when the papers resulting from the literature search did not provide sufficient information. This resulted in a total of 52 scientific papers describing 27 integrated care programs and 21 different CGA instruments. For one integrated care program, we present both the original and the updated program [30, 31]. As the programs were rather different, they were included as two separate programs. Characteristics of integrated care programs Many included integrated care programs were implemented in the Netherlands (n=12). The integrated care programs were also implemented in the United States (n=5), Canada (n=4), Japan (n=2), France (n=1), Germany (n=1), New Zealand (n=1) and Sweden (n=1) (Table 2). All but two programs [32, 33] explicitly focused on improving outcomes in older people. Eleven programs additionally focused on: (i) improving quality of care, (ii) improving efficiency of care, and/or (iii) enhancing skills of professionals and students. Except three programs, all included integrated care programs specifically targeted at older people being frail, including people with multiple health and social care needs and problems and people at (increased) risk of an adverse outcome. Three programs focused on either potentially frail older people [24], did not exclusively focus on frail older people [34-36], or addressed a frail population but did not explicitly mention frailty in the inclusion criteria of the study [37]. The settings in which the integrated care programs were implemented varied from the primary care setting to home care organizations, hospitals and specialized centers (e.g. Veterans Affairs medical centers, community-based integrated care centers). Eighteen programs were implemented in primary care practices. In about half of the programs, all implemented in the primary care setting, the CGA process relied on a core team consisting of a general practitioner (GP) (or other type of physician) and a nurse. The care programs: a scoping review GP (or physician) was responsible for the care and treatment older people receive. The nurse was often designated as case manager and responsible for coordination and continuity of care across different settings and providers of care. In many programs, the core team was supported by a multidisciplinary team of social workers, elderly welfare consultants, physical therapists, occupational therapists, dietitians, pharmacists, (specialist) nurses, psychologists, geriatricians, nursing home physicians, psychiatrists and other medical specialists. The composition of a multidisciplinary team differed, ranging from a team of exclusively medical professionals to a team of an equal number of health and social care professionals. In most programs, the core and/or multidisciplinary team also consulted or referred to other professionals or community organizations providing services beyond the (professional) expertise of the core and/or multidisciplinary team, for instance medical specialists, social workers or meal delivery organizations. Characteristics of CGAs (i.e. instruments and procedures) and differences and similarities between CGAs Instruments Many different CGA instruments were used in the included integrated programs. In the 27 integrated care programs included in this study, 21 different CGA instruments were identified. All details with regard to the CGAs can be found in Appendix 7.1 (Table S1). Most programs developed or selected a unique CGA instrument, except for the programs using the RAI-HC/RAI-CHA, EASYcare instrument and GRACE tool. These instruments (i.e. EASYcare instrument, RAI-HC/RAI-CHA and GRACE tool) were used in different included programs (Table S1 - column 'CGA instrument/tool'). The EASYcare instrument was used in five programs, all in the Netherlands. The RAI-HC/RAI-CHA was used in four programs, in the Netherlands, Canada and France. The GRACE tool was used in two U.S. programs. The EASYcare instrument was either used as a standalone CGA instrument or as part of a composite CGA instrument consisting of different instruments including the EASYcare instrument. The origin of the instrument differed across CGAs: (i) some instruments were developed to be used in different countries and health care settings, not specifically integrated care settings, such as the EASYcare instrument and the RAI-HC/RAI-CHA , (ii) other instruments were based on or adapted from an existing assessment tool or format which had previously been developed for a different purpose or target group, such as the 7 instrument and Geriatric ICF Core Set , and (iii) for all other instruments, papers disclosed little or no details of the origin of the CGA instrument. In most programs, the CGA encompassed a bundle of different types of instruments and questions to gain insight into the problems and care needs of the older person, for instance: (i) validated instruments, (ii) questions derived from clinical guidelines or literature, (iii) newly developed questionnaires or questions formulated by an expert panel or research team, (iv) biomedical measurements, and (v) items scoring physical home environment. CGAs were different in the degree of extensiveness. For instance, one CGA consisted of a 20-page assessment covering more than 300 questions [38], while another CGA seemed to be less extensive, including a standardized assessment for falls and cognition, and identification of goals and preferences [32]. Information provided about the exact content of the instrument varied between CGAs. For five CGA instruments, the content of the CGA was available in (the appendix of) the original study or in a study cited in the original study [24, 39-45]. For the other CGAs, the original study did not provide or only partially provided the exact content of the CGA, nor referred to other papers describing this information. Procedures Integrated care programs established procedures for conducting a CGA in order to enhance consistency in application. For a number of CGAs, papers explicitly mentioned that a structured format was followed for conducting the CGA, which means that instruments and questions were defined prior to the assessment and were preferably administered to each older person that was assessed (Table S1 - column 'Procedures'). Some CGAs encompassed a basic assessment that was conducted for each older person, which could be supplemented with additional assessments when considered necessary and desirable by the involved staff, older person and informal carer. Three CGA instruments were tested for their validity and reliability [41, 42, 46-48]. For four CGAs, it was explicitly indicated that the instrument was tested for its feasibility [24, 41-44, 49-51]. For nine CGAs, the average duration of conducting the assessment was described, which ranged from 30 minutes to three hours. The location where a CGA was conducted differed between the integrated care programs. Most CGAs were conducted during a visit at the older people's home. In few programs, CGAs were conducted care programs: a scoping review Figure 1. Flow diagram of literature screening process. 7 admission, via a telephone call, or during a visit at a clinic or center. Information on whether or how (frequently) a CGA was used to monitor changes in functioning and care needs of older individuals was limited in the papers. For two programs, papers explicitly mentioned that the nurse involved used a digital instrument to conduct the CGA [46, 52, 53]. Particularly professionals from Dutch integrated care programs attended a training program or (refresher) course on conducting a CGA and related topics, including care planning, goal setting, stimulating self-management, motivational interviewing, case management, interdisciplinary collaboration and the use of a computer for the assessments. Training was usually provided to the nurse responsible for conducting the CGA and acting as case manager in the program, although in several programs also other professionals, such as the GP or entire multidisciplinary team, attended a training program. Adherence to principles of integrated care Comprehensiveness: life domains addressed in CGAAs described in Table S1 (column 'Comprehensiveness'), all CGAs covered problems and care needs in different domains life (e.g. physical, psychological, functional, social and environmental domain), and can as such, based on our operational definition, be considered as comprehensive. CGAs varied in the number and type of life domains they addressed. Most frequently covered domains in CGAs were related to physical, functional, psychological, cognitive and social functioning, as well as medication. Examples of domains that were less frequently covered were abuse signs (e.g. physical or emotional abuse) [30, 46], finances [43-45], and providing informal care [24]. In addition to addressing different life domains, some CGAs included a section in which concerns, priorities and goals of the older person and the informal carer were explicitly assessed. The different domains that were addressed during the assessment were described for all CGAs except six. Some papers described the domains and its subdomains in detail (e.g. psychological domain covers cognition, delirium, depression, anxiety and dependency), whereas most papers only mentioned the elements covered by the CGA without further distinguishing of domains and subdomains. Furthermore, domains were defined in different ways in CGAs. For example, in some CGAs cognitive functioning was part of the psychological/mental domain [24, 31, 43, 44], while in other CGAs cognition was a domain separate from the psychological/mental scoping review Multidisciplinarity: professionals involved in CGA CGAs differed in the extent to which they seemed to work in a multidisciplinary way during the inventory of the older person's situation and the development of the care plan. Depending on the integrated care program, the roles of professionals from different organizations and disciplines in conducting the CGA can be roughly divided into three different ways (Table S1 - column 'Multidisciplinarity'): (i) a nurse (practitioner) conducted the CGA, in some cases in collaboration with or under supervision of a GP, higher qualified nurse or social worker. In some of these programs, additional assessments by the nurse, GP or professionals from other disciplines were conducted when considered necessary, (ii) all members of the multidisciplinary team conducted a part of the CGA which was related to their own professional expertise, or (iii) an assessor designated for performing the assessment conducted the CGA (but was not further involved in developing the care plan or providing care and support for the older person). In line with the objective of a CGA to serve as input for developing a care plan, in each initiative an individual care plan or recommendations for care and support were developed. They included identified problems, care needs, goals and actions to be taken, and were based on the outcomes of the assessment. The steps that were taken to develop a care plan differed between integrated care programs: (i) a nurse or GP formulated the care plan, (ii) a nurse presented a draft care plan to the GP or multidisciplinary team to discuss outcomes of the CGA and the initial care plan before finalizing it, (iii) all core or multidisciplinary team members met to discuss the outcomes of the CGA and together formulated a care plan and decided on further action to be taken, or (iv) professionals that were involved in the development of a care plan were not explicitly mentioned in the paper. To sum up, health care professionals (GP, nurses, allied health care professionals) were always involved in the assessment of care needs and preferences and the development of a personal care plan. Social care professionals (social services, community organizations) were less frequently involved in these stages. Person-centredness: involvement of older people and their informal carers in CGA Across the programs, older people and their informal carers were involved in different ways in conducting the CGA and developing the care plan (Table S1 - column 'Person-centeredness'). CGAs generally aimed to take needs and preferences of the older person into account in the processes of conducting a CGA and developing the care plan, although of working in a person-centered way varied between CGAs: (i) in the majority of the programs, older people were encouraged to share their concerns, priorities and goals they would like to achieve. As such, professionals were supposed to develop care plans or recommendations in a way consistent with older people's needs and preferences, and (ii) in a few programs, professionals developed care plans or recommendations based on the outcomes of the CGA without explicitly involving older people and their informal carers in conducting the CGA and developing the care plan. After formulating the individually tailored care plan, in almost all programs, the professionals discussed the specifics of the care plan with older people and collaborated with them to review and modify it. In two of these programs, the care plan was only implemented after final approval by the older person [14, 34-36, 56]. In seven programs, older people were responsible for implementing activities and recommendations that were established in the care plan [38, 43-45, 54, 55, 57-59]. To encourage active involvement of the older person and informal carer in the decision- making and planning of their care process, some papers explicitly indicated 'strategies' to stimulate professionals to do so during conducting a CGA: building trust with older people and their informal carers (for instance by making an introduction visit), allowing older people time to talk, and using motivational interviewing techniques (for instance summarizing and validating given answers). Also developing a user friendly care plan could be part of this. In addition, some programs aimed to empower older people and their informal carers by providing self-management support including coaching, advice, education and health promotion materials. Altogether, the majority of CGAs seemed to address comprehensiveness, multidisciplinarity and person-centeredness, although not all CGAs reflected all three principles of integrated care to the same extent. Some CGAs reflected one of the principles less extensively than other CGAs. The CGAs conducted in the integrated care programs Embrace [34-36] and IMPACT [33] seemed to incorporate the three principles most extensively, and as such showed how (extensively) the integrated care principles may be reflected in CGAs. These CGAs aimed to cover a broad range of health and social care needs and problems in different domains of life, involve professionals from multiple disciplines and sectors -including social workers- during the CGA and the development of the care plan, and actively include the older person and informal carers in the decision-making and planning their care programs: a scoping review Discussion The aim of this study was to describe and compare CGA instruments that were used in integrated care programs for older people living at home, and procedures for conducting them. There is a vast amount of literature describing CGAs conducted in integrated care programs. Some of these studies address the heterogeneity of CGAs used in integrated care [16, 19]. However, a systematic overview of CGA instruments and procedures, and of their differences and similarities was lacking. This scoping review addressed these gaps [60, 61], and is unique in focusing on older people living at home in the context of integrated care. In addition, it was unknown how and to what extent CGAs, being a crucial intervention component of many integrated care programs [15, 16, 20], reflected the principles of integrated care. We therefore also aimed to describe how principles of integrated care were applied in existing CGAs. Instruments and procedures In total, our review yielded 27 integrated care programs and 21 different CGA instruments. Twelve out of 27 integrated care programs were implemented in the Netherlands. This relatively large number can be explained by the Dutch National Care for the Elderly Programme which took place between 2008 and 2016. This Dutch program aimed to improve care and support for older people through funding of several research and implementation projects focused on developing a more proactive and integrated health and social care system for frail older people [16, 62]. Nine of these projects, with eight different CGA instruments and procedures, were included in this study [14, 24, 34-36, 39-44, 49-53, 56, 63]. As shown in this study, many different CGA instruments were used to identify older people's problems, care needs and preferences. Most programs developed or selected a unique CGA instrument, except for the programs using the RAI-HC/RAI-CHA, EASYcare instrument and GRACE tool, as they were used in different programs included in this study. The reason for the variability of CGA instruments and procedures for conducting them in integrated care programs is largely unknown; arguments for developing new CGAs were often not presented. One possible explanation may be related to the limited knowledge about how older people's problems and care needs should best be assessed using a CGA. Existing CGA instruments and procedures may not satisfy requirements set by other researchers and professionals of the integrated care programs. As such, these researchers and professionals may develop alternative instruments which they, 7 7 for instance, perceive to be more suitable for their specific context, or which explicitly involve the target population in the development of the instrument [64, 65]. Moreover, the existing controversy over an agreed definition of frailty, as well as the insufficient evidence on appropriate frailty screening, diagnostic instruments and effective interventions may explain the variety of CGAs [66]. Due to ambiguities on how frailty can best be screened, assessed and managed, programs may have different ideas of how to identify and address problems and care needs, leading to the development of new CGA instruments and procedures that are in line with their understanding of these concepts. Another explanation for the amount of CGAs may be a lack of awareness among researchers and professionals of the existing range of CGA instruments and procedures for conducting them, causing them to develop new CGAs themselves. This overview of available CGAs and their characteristics may support exchange of CGA instruments and procedures between researchers and professionals, which may reduce efforts to develop new ones. In addition to the variability of CGAs, there were differences in the amount of details provided about the CGA instruments and procedures for conducting them across the included studies. Some papers for instance provided limited information about the specific domains that were addressed in the CGA or how exactly older people were involved during the process of conducting the CGA and developing and implementing the care plan. This hampered our goal of thoroughly describing and comparing different CGA instruments and procedures for conducting them, including their incorporation of integrated care principles. To enhance comparability, we recommend describing CGA instruments and procedures and their adherence to integrated care principles in more detail to obtain a more extensive overview. Principles of integrated care Our results show that all CGAs in this study may be considered comprehensive, which means that, to a greater or lesser extent, the importance of addressing older people's needs across different domains of life seems to be recognized [4]. Care and support tended to primarily focus on physical health problems and needs [67, 68]. However, gradually a broader concept of health including for instance also psychological, social and environmental life domains is being adopted in policymaking, research, education and practice. The CGAs identified in this study are reflecting this broader health concept as well. care programs: a scoping review As for the principle of multidisciplinarity, multidisciplinary teams and the CGA concept of multidisciplinary assessment and management may have different potential benefits for the older person [69]. Although social workers were involved in several CGAs, health care professionals were predominating the process of conducting the CGA and developing the care plan in this study. Social care professionals (social services, community organizations) have the ability to bring to the multidisciplinary team a unique perspective concerning the people to whom they provide care and support considering their specific expertise [70]. Therefore, their involvement into multidisciplinary team working from the moment of identifying problems and care needs until addressing them with appropriate care and support is recommended. With regard to the principle of person-centeredness, there is broad consensus that older people should be encouraged to participate actively in the process of care and decision-making [71]. In most programs, older people and their informal carers were actively involved in conducting the CGA and developing the care plan. However, preferences for the degree and the way of participation in decision-making may differ between older people [72, 73]. Therefore, to actually work in a person-centered way, older people should be offered the opportunity to be engaged in the process of their care, in which their preferences regarding the role they wish to play in their care are paramount [72]. Methodological considerations In this study, comprehensiveness, multidisciplinarity and person-centeredness were selected to represent the main principles of integrated care. We realize, however, that integrated care includes more than these three components. Still, these selected components are considered common aspects of integrated care and are therefore most likely to be explicitly addressed in papers describing integrated care programs [10, 20]. The authors felt that the application of stricter criteria would mean that highly relevant papers would not appear in our selection. We performed a broad literature search to collect as many relevant papers as possible. One limitation of our search strategy is that we included scientific papers published from 2006 onwards. January 2006 was used as a starting-point as from that moment onwards, literature on integrated care programs for older people living at home, in which a CGA may be conducted, became increasingly prevalent [9, 10]. As such, we expected to find most relevant papers within the given timeframe. We only included scientific papers written in the English language because we would like the information described in the 7 7 papers to be understandable for all readers. In addition, grey literature was not included in this study. Grey literature was generally not indexed in the electronic databases we used and was therefore excluded from the search (e.g. letters, notes, conference abstracts). Therefore, we may have missed relevant integrated care programs and their CGA instruments and procedures that were described before 2006, in other languages or in grey literature. Moreover, we did not include the entire range of identified CGAs that were used in integrated care programs for older people living at home. Several papers did not provide sufficient information about the CGA instruments and procedures used in the program, which made them ineligible for inclusion in this study. To perform this study, we conducted a scoping review instead of a systematic review. Compared to systematic reviews which address more precise questions, scoping reviews also require transparent and rigorous methods in their conduct and are considered specifically helpful for scoping a body of literature on a certain topic [74]. Since this study aims to map existing literature on CGAs in integrated care, conducting a scoping review seemed to be an appropriate choice. There are also certain limitations of conducting a scoping review that should be mentioned. We provided a comprehensive overview of available CGAs in integrated care. However, our scoping review did not provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of CGAs in integrated care. Although it would be relevant for policy aims to increase our understanding of what works in what context, it will be challenging to establish a clear relationship between one specific component of integrated care programs and outcomes that may realistically be expected in the context of care for older people. Recommendations for research and practice This study provides an overview of available CGA instruments and procedures for conducting them, and insight into the extent to which they reflect principles of integrated care. Unfortunately, reasoning for the choice to select to develop a specific instrument mostly remains unclear. Still the overview in this study is useful in supporting the exchange of knowledge about CGAs between researchers and professionals, and helps them select a CGA appropriate for their context from the wide range of possible instruments and procedures. As such, this overview will enable researchers and professionals to make use of available CGAs where possible, in order to prevent them from unnecessarily reinventing the wheel. However, considering our methodological considerations, the current overview of available CGAs is not yet complete. More thorough descriptions of CGAs, as well care programs: a scoping review experiences with using them, are recommended to complete the overview of available CGAs in integrated care. Furthermore, knowledge about which qualifications a CGA should preferably meet is still limited. While this study showed the extent to which CGAs reflect principles of integrated care, there are also other key features which could determine the choice for a CGA. These include, for example, the feasibility, validity and reliability of the CGA, whether users of CGAs have open access to the instrument and procedures or how easy it is to share CGA outcomes digitally between professionals. Also the extent to which CGAs are appropriate for monitoring changes in older people's functioning or living situation in relation to their care needs could be an important aspect. Further research is recommended to gain more insight into the value of such additional qualifications of CGAs in the context of integrated care for older people, and whether the existing range of CGAs meet these qualifications. These insights could then guide the adaption of existing instruments or, if necessary, the design of new ones. Additionally, little is known about the experiences and views of older people and their informal carers with specific CGA instruments and procedures. These are, however, important when assessing existing CGAs [65]. Therefore, we would also recommend to obtain more insight into what is important for older people with regard to the content and procedures of a CGA, taking into account the wide variation in preferences of individuals. Questions that could benefit from more research include, for example, whether older people consider a CGA relevant, and if so, what important themes are that should be addressed during a CGA [4, 75], how long a CGA may last, who should be targeted [76], and which professional would be most suitable to build rapport between the older person and professionals [77, 78]? Conclusion This study shows that many different CGA instruments and procedures for conducting them are in place, each with a different perspective. CGAs vary in the way and the extent to which they reflect principles of integrated care. Most CGAs seemed to address comprehensiveness, multidisciplinarity and person-centeredness. However, in some cases, health care professionals were predominant or older people and their informal carers were not explicitly involved in the process of conducting the CGA and developing the care plan. This overview of characteristics of available CGAs supports knowledge 7 exchange between researchers and professionals, although more thorough descriptions of CGAs and experiences with using them are necessary to further complete the overview. Sharing knowledge on CGAs available in integrated care could enable researchers and professionals apply existing CGAs in their own contexts.

As people age, they often suffer from (multiple) chronic conditions and disabilities, which results in complex care needs. Care and support for older people with complex care needs lack continuity and coordination. Furthermore, care and support are insufficiently tailored to older people's care needs and preferences [1-4]. To address these challenges, numerous integrated care initiatives have been initiated for older people with complex care needs who live at home. These initiatives proactively seek to structure and coordinate care and support, centred around older people's needs and preferences [5-10]. Although integrated care is increasingly being promoted as a promising approach, several knowledge gaps remain. In order to address these knowledge gaps and advance the development of integrated care, this doctoral thesis posed the following research aims: 1. To describe the characteristics of older people living at home in Europe in terms of their health and functioning, and their needs and preferences to keep living independently at home (Chapter 2 and 3) . 2. To explore what integrated care for older people with complex care needs looks like across different countries and care settings in Europe, and to gain insight into the ambitions of integrated care initiatives for improving integrated care delivery (Chapter 4 and 5) . 3. To provide insight into activities undertaken that aimed to promote person-centredness in the context of integrated care for older people with complex care needs, and to explore experiences with these activities (Chapter 6 and 7) . This final chapter will first provide a summary of the main findings, followed by reflections on these findings. Then, some methodological reflections are shared. The chapter concludes with recommendations for policy and practice, and suggestions for future research. Main findings In response to the first research aim, Chapters 2 and 3 studied the health and functioning of older people living at home in Europe, and their needs and preferences for care and support. To this purpose, a cross-sectional study on the health and functioning of older community care recipients across Europe was performed. This study was conducted within a European research project called \"IBenC\" (Chapter 2). Furthermore, the needs and preferences of older people living at home were explored using a qualitative approach discussion (Chapter 3). Both studies focused on different domains of health and functioning, including the physical, cognitive, mental, and social domains. Findings showed that the majority of older people who receive community care experienced multiple impairments, and in different domains of health and functioning simultaneously. Impairments in the physical and social domains were most prevalent. Impairments in health and functioning differed substantially across older people receiving community care services in Europe. Older community care recipients from Belgium, Germany, Finland, Iceland, Italy, and the Netherlands were studied. Overall, the highest prevalence rates of almost all impairments were found in Italy, whereas older people from the Netherlands were least impaired compared to the other European countries. Chapter 3 showed that despite being confronted with impairments, most older people preferred to live independently at home for as long as possible. Their needs and preferences for remaining in their homes and communities were prevalent in all domains of health and functioning, and were often related to each other. They considered it essential to maintain their mobility, have healthy cognitive functioning, live in appropriate housing, and have a supporting network, as well as to remain self-sufficient and autonomous. Based on the studies presented in Chapters 2 and 3, it was concluded that an integrated approach to care and support, in which all domains of health and functioning are being addressed, is deemed necessary. To address the second research aim, data from the European research project \"SUSTAIN\" were used. In the SUSTAIN project, fourteen integrated care initiatives in Europe undertook efforts to improve integrated care for older people with complex care needs. These improvement processes were evaluated and monitored by SUSTAIN's research partners (Chapter 4). Based on the data from the SUSTAIN project, overarching analyses were conducted to describe and compare the participating initiatives' current ways of working, as well as their perceived limitations and ambitions for improving integrated care (Chapter 5). The participating integrated care initiatives varied, in their national legislation and funding, or their region's readiness for integrated care. The initiatives also differed in the settings within which they operated, their target populations, and the types of care and support services they provided. In general terms, the participating initiatives included proactive primary care for frail older people, home nursing and rehabilitative care, care, dementia care, and palliative care. Despite the variation in initiatives, they experienced quite similar challenges in their ways of working. Challenges were related to: 1. coordination and collaboration; 2. competences, motivation, and workload of professionals; 3. communication and information; 4. person-centred working, and 5. resources and support. The ambitions of the initiatives for improving integrated care delivery showed one of two different emphases: 1. enhancing or expanding inter-professional coordination, collaboration and communication among care and support organisations (e.g. building a multidisciplinary team), or 2. improving the actual care delivery process, including more attention to person-centred working (e.g. development of tools for conducting comprehensive geriatric assessments [CGAs] or changing the location of health and social care delivery). In response to the third research aim, improving person-centred working was further explored in this thesis. The integrated care initiatives participating in the SUSTAIN project were reviewed to identify improvement activities that aimed to promote person-centred working (Chapter 6). Four clusters of activities were identified: 1. Activities related to the design of health and social care delivery process (e.g. conducting CGAs); 2. Staff training (e.g. providing training on shared decision-making); 3. Activities related to communication and information exchange between professionals, older people, and informal caregivers (e.g. giving older people and informal caregivers access to care plans); and 4. Activities related to facilitating the involvement of older people and informal caregivers in care and support (e.g. discussing needs, preferences, goals, and priorities). Analyses of the experiences with these activities showed that these differed between managers and professionals from health and social care organisations, older people, and informal caregivers. Overall, managers and professionals felt that their actions and activities had positively influenced person-centredness. This was not confirmed by some older people and their informal caregivers. In addition to exploring the broad range of improvement activities to promote person- centredness, more in-depth information on one of these activities was provided: the CGA. For this, a scoping review of the scientific literature on CGAs in integrated care initiatives was conducted (Chapter 7). Across integrated care initiatives, many different CGA instruments and procedures for conducting them were found. The identified CGAs all had their specific ways of identifying and discussing older people's care preferences. The CGAs also varied in how they gave shape to a person-centred, comprehensive, and multidisciplinary approach to assessing older people's care needs. Reflections Across Europe, it has been found challenging to address the consequences of the aging population, and more specifically, to organise care and support for older people in line with their needs [11-13]. European countries increasingly recognise that it is imperative to collaborate since they face similar challenges. Therefore, in addition to national research projects, several collaborative European research projects have been initiated to contribute to potential solutions for societal challenges that require an international approach [14, 15]. To acknowledge the cross-border character of challenges regarding older people's care and support and advance knowledge exchange on the European level, this thesis studied the improvement of integrated care from a European perspective. It drew from data from two European research projects: SUSTAIN and IBenC. In these projects, research partners from across Europe collaborated to obtain comprehensive insights on improving care for older people, which would add on to the knowledge on national scales. Furthermore, these projects wanted to contribute to the dissemination of knowledge and experiences and support countries and regions across Europe undertaking similar efforts. Through sharing lessons learned across national borders, both projects aimed to prevent European countries from unnecessarily reinventing the wheel.

The first section will address the multidimensional perspective on health and functioning. The following section will reflect on the commonalities and differences in improving integrated care across Europe, and the final section will reflect on the challenges in achieving person-centred care. A multidimensional perspective to address impairments and care needs Traditionally, care and support for older people tended to primarily focus on physiological changes in the aging person and their clinical implications. Also research has mostly concentrated on the physical and cognitive limitations of older people and how to tackle these to maintain their independence. Previous European studies that explored the health and functioning of older people receiving community care in different countries 8 RightTimePlaceCare [17], and SHARE [18-20]), particularly (but not exclusively) focused on the physical and cognitive health dimensions. However, more recent approaches to the concept of health stress the multidimensional character of the concept, and include the physical, cognitive, psychological, and social domains. In contrast to previous studies, the IBenC study (Chapter 2) adopted this broad approach to health and functioning, and this showed that impairments are not limited to the physical and cognitive domains. Older people themselves have also indicated that such a multidimensional perspective reflects what is important to them, and in particular, the attention to their mental and social health [21-26]. In line with the broad approach to health and functioning as adopted in Chapter 2, an increasing number of new definitions of health have been formulated over the years [27-29]. In these definitions, the concept of health is also broadening towards empowerment and shifting focus from people's disabilities to their abilities, even with the presence of limitations [30, 31]. These broader concepts of health include dimensions such as meaningfulness, resilience, and the ability to adapt to changes in one's situation [27]. In line with previous studies, also the qualitative study presented in this thesis (Chapter 3) showed that having a meaningful life and a sense of purpose, and maintaining independence are essential to people when they get older [21, 32]. Notwithstanding the importance of broader concepts of health, it turns out to be challenging to translate such broader concepts of health to interventions and activities that can be implemented in practice. Understanding of how to best apply them in care and support is still lacking [29]. Furthermore, these concepts' strong focus on empowerment and ability to adapt have been criticised. These dimensions may not always fit with the needs of the frailest population, for whom taking control of their lives cannot be taken for granted. They may not be willing or able to do so, for instance, due to severe cognitive disabilities or limited health literacy [29, 33]. In light of the variety of broader definitions of health and functioning, the findings of this thesis show that in adopting a multidimensional approach to care and support, it is important to ensure this approach actually addresses what is relevant to older people with complex care needs. Different contexts, common themes in improving integrated care across Europe Findings from the IBenC study showed cross-country differences in characteristics (including health and functioning) of older community care recipients. These findings discussion are in line with results from previous European studies (e.g. AdHOC, RightTimePlace, and SHARE), which showed similar patterns, although the countries that were studied were not precisely the same. Cross-country variation is most likely to be explained by differences in legislation, financing, and accessibility of community care across Europe [34-36]. These differences imply that in some countries, only older people with severe impairments are eligible to receive community care, while in other countries also those with milder impairments receive such services. Furthermore, cultural factors, such as the availability of informal caregivers, may play a role in the observed variation [16, 37]. For example, in some countries, older people with very severe impairments can still live at home with the help of family members in addition to formal care, while in other countries, people with similar levels of impairment would have to move to residential or nursing homes. It seems that differences in the characteristics of older people receiving care and support in different European countries are closely related to the diversity of contexts in which these care and support services are embedded. This thesis showed that the characteristics of integrated care initiatives, and the contexts within which integrated care initiatives operate are very diverse. At the same time, findings from the SUSTAIN project showed that the challenges that impede the integrated care initiatives from further development are quite generic, as are their ambitions for improving their current practice (Chapters 4 and 5). While the SUSTAIN project enabled consistent comparison between different countries and contexts, due to its consistent and uniform approach, other recent studies on integrated care taking a national or regional perspective showed similar patterns to those of the SUSTAIN project [38-41]. In line with the findings from SUSTAIN, also these national and regional evaluations showed for instance that difficulties with communication and information exchange between care providers were an important barrier to the integration of care, independently of the characteristics of the initiative or the local context in which they operated [38, 39, 42]. These findings imply that despite the diversity of contexts in which integrated care for older people was provided, main themes that were key to (un)successful implementing and improving integrated care were common across Europe. Bringing perspectives and experiences from different contexts and settings together reveals commonalities, and may support countries to exchange knowledge and experiences, and learn from each other. 8 challenges of achieving person-centred care In addition to learning how to improve integrated care in general, the SUSTAIN project showed that also concerning specific care delivery processes, commitment to learn and to improve current practices has been observed across different countries. As in earlier studies [3, 43, 44], also in SUSTAIN, integrated care initiatives identified room for improving person-centred care, which therefore became the focus of several initiatives' improvement processes. Chapter 6 shows that different types of activities were undertaken to promote person- centredness. Overall, professionals and managers were positive about these activities, whereas the perceptions of older people and their informal caregivers were mixed. A l t h o u g h e a r l i e r st u d i e s a l s o s h o w e d d i ff e r e n c e s b e tw e e n st a k e h o l d e rs i n w h a t i s important for them [45-47], this is the first study that unveiled discrepancies between perspectives of service users and service providers on person-centred approaches in the context of integrated care. Whereas the literature stresses that person-centredness is one of the main aspects of integrated care, these findings imply that, in practice, integrated care initiatives experience difficulties in placing older people at the centre of their care and support. In person-centred care, relationships and communication between older people, their informal caregivers, and service providers are central to align care and support with individual needs and preferences [48, 49]. However, an equal and active role for the older person in their care and support often appears to be lacking, for different reasons. On the one hand, as also found in previous studies, older people (or their informal caregivers) can be unwilling or feel incapable (e.g. due to cognitive impairments) to be involved in their care and support [50, 51]. One the other hand, staff can experience difficulties to shape care plans and provide care and support in such a way that it is guided by the interest of the older person, rather than their own expertise and good intent. Care providers often lack awareness and necessary skills and competencies to empower older people [52, 53]. As a result, staff can overestimate the extent to which they adopt a person-centred approach or involve older people in decision-making. Furthermore, staff can be reluctant or feel uncertain to involve older people in decisions about their care and support, for instance, if older people's needs and preferences contradict clinical practice guidelines and recommendations. As a result, older people's needs and preferences are often not decisive in care and support they receive balance between respecting older people's own choices and professionals' expertise and commitment to promoting older people's health and wellbeing is one of the most important topics of discussion in contemporary medical ethics [55]. As such, although many efforts are undertaken to promote person-centredness, it remains challenging to improve services in which older people are seen as \"the focal point around which services are integrated\" [3]. Methodological considerations European research projects Several methodological choices left their mark on this doctoral thesis. First, four studies described in this thesis were conducted within two European research projects. As described above, European research projects are important for enabling international comparisons and dissemination of knowledge across different countries and contexts. At the same time, however, conducting European projects such as SUSTAIN and IBenC also involved challenges regarding the adoption of a uniform and consistent methodological approach. A first challenge that was faced in the SUSTAIN and IBenC projects was that, in addition to the diversity in participating countries and their (political, economic and cultural) contexts, the projects also involved a diverse group of European project partners. Project partners had a wide range of professional and cultural backgrounds, and different areas of expertise (e.g. in research, dissemination, or knowledge transfer). Although these broad areas of expertise helped to achieve the comprehensive and ambitious objectives of the projects, this diversity also complicated uniform and standardised measurement and comparison across the participating countries. A second challenge was that both projects involved European countries where different languages are spoken. Some countries even have multiple (official) languages, such as Estonia, where both the Estonian and Russian languages are spoken. Particularly in qualitative research, this made the consistency of approach even more challenging. A third challenge, which was also particularly relevant in qualitative research, was that some related themes could not be explored and compared in-depth. International comparisons require comparable and consistent data, but the amount and the richness of available data differed between involved countries. Therefore compromises had to be 8 8 made, and some themes could not be included in content analyses. These compromises resulted in a loss of information. In order to address these challenges, a lot of effort was put into achieving harmonisation and alignment between research partners throughout both projects. Regular and structured discussions among the project partners enabled the development and use of standardised tools and procedures for data collection, analyses, and reporting to support cross-country comparisons. These discussions were a time-consuming process, especially given the vast diversity in project partners and countries involved. Furthermore, the IBenC project used the internationally recognised interRAI HC to support standardised data collection among older people receiving community care services [56, 57]. Validated language versions of the interRAI HC were available in all languages required for the IBenC project, which contributed to the consistent measurement of health and functioning across countries [58]. The methodological consistency of the approaches of both the SUSTAIN and IBenC projects enabled the generation of knowledge on care and support for older people in Europe that can be compared and shared across European regions and countries. As such, these European research projects showed that when methodological challenges are carefully tackled, they offer great opportunities for different countries and regions to exchange and learn from each other's experiences and good practices. Mixed research methods A second methodological point to be addressed is that different types of research methods, spanning both qualitative and quantitative approaches, were used. On the one hand, studies were conducted that used more traditional research designs, such as an interview study or a quantitative cross-sectional study. On the other hand, also more innovative methodological approaches were used, including a scoping review of the scientific literature and a multiple embedded case study design. A scoping review was conducted to explore, map, and synthesise information on the use of CGAs in integrated care contexts [59]. Where systematic reviews address more precise questions and synthesise the literature on the effectiveness of interventions, scoping reviews help to determine the scope or coverage of a body of literature on a given topic [60]. Although its name suggests otherwise, scoping reviews do not compensate for their methodological rigor, which is systematic, reproducible, and accountable. Given the aim of the discussion study in this thesis (i.e. to map existing literature on CGAs in integrated care for older people), conducting a scoping review was considered an appropriate approach. A multiple embedded case study design was used to conduct the studies that were part of the SUSTAIN project. Each integrated care initiative in the SUSTAIN project was treated as one case study [61]. Individual case studies were built on the combination of both qualitative and quantitative data gathered from the sites, using different data sources (e.g. interviews, focus groups, and structured questionnaires). This multiple case study design was adopted to overcome the challenges that were expected from more traditional types of study designs, such as an experimental or observational designs. As mentioned previously, the SUSTAIN project involved many different project partners working in a wide range of contexts, and the project methodology had to allow for this variation. The variation as in SUSTAIN did not allow for characteristics commonly required in more traditional designs, such as the use of controls (i.e. treatment and control groups), randomisation, and standardised interventions. The multiple case study design in the SUSTAIN project enabled exploration and comparison of complex community-based integrated care interventions that were known to be context-bound and noted for their differences in application and implementation [61]. Multiple points of view The third methodological point is that throughout this thesis, perspectives of different involved stakeholders were considered equally important for building evidence on improving integrated and person-centred care for older people. Therefore, both the views of service providers (i.e. managers and professionals from health and social care organisations) and those of service users (i.e. older people and their informal caregivers) were examined in the different studies. In two studies (Chapters 3 and 6), perspectives of service providers and service users on receiving care and support were compared and contrasted to reveal potential discrepancies. These comparisons showed that what matters to older people regarding their care and support is different from what service providers think. The inclusion of diverse viewpoints supported a comprehensive picture of the topic under study in this thesis. Capturing perspectives of older people Lastly, although we aimed to capture the experiences of older people, at the same time, we experienced difficulties in doing so [62]. In the SUSTAIN project, aspects were evaluated that were thought to be relevant for older people, such as their needs and 8 8 preferences for receiving care, their experiences with coordination of care, and their perceived control in care and support. However, it appeared difficult to assess older people's perceptions of these aspects because of minor conceptual differences between items in a questionnaire or an interview schedule that were difficult to understand for older people. Moreover, SUSTAIN's research partners and local care staff expressed their doubts about the ability of structured questionnaires and lengthy interviews to retrieve the experiences and perspectives of older people with complex care needs. During the project, it appeared that these types of data collection were not appropriate for the frailest people. This group was, therefore, not always invited to participate, resulting in potential selection bias. In addition, aspects that older people consider important, such as meaningful living and sense of autonomy, were not addressed in the SUSTAIN and IBenC studies. For instance, the interRAI HC, which was used in the IBenC study, does not include such items [57]. Capturing the values and beliefs of older people turned out to be complicated. Recommendations for policy and practice Look beyond national borders On the European and national levels, governments are looking for how to best implement and improve integrated care for older people in practice. For instance, in the Netherlands, several (national and regional) programmes have been initiated. The Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport recently started the programme 'Living at home longer' (in Dutch: 'Programma Langer Thuis') [63], in which they focus, amongst others, on collaboration and coordination between service providers. In other European countries, such as Norway and Spain (Catalonia), similar policy developments are taking place [38, 40, 41, 64]. Policy officers that are involved in national or regional programmes to promote integrated care are recommended to take full advantage of the knowledge and experiences that have been obtained in European research projects, such as IBenC and SUSTAIN. These European research projects have shown the potential benefit of looking beyond national borders for knowledge and experiences on organising care for older people. In the SUSTAIN project, for example, it appeared that despite their diversity, the main themes in improving integrated care were similar across different European countries and contexts. Also, European research projects provide methodological insights that can be useful on a national or regional level. Not only between countries, but also within the local settings and contexts in which care and support are provided vary. The SUSTAIN project, for instance, provided insight into how to compare very diverse integrated care initiatives across different contexts in a consistent and uniform way. In addition to European research projects, also other types of activities that bring together researchers, policy-makers, and service providers from different countries and contexts, are recommended. Such activities include, for instance, webinars, international conferences, and field trips (so-called learning expeditions), and could support cross-border collaboration and stimulate an exchange of good practices (e.g. how to organise person-centred care and support, how to overcome barriers in communication and information exchange between professionals?). Within these resource-constrained times, one should make the best use of existing knowledge and experiences to further advance integrated care for older people. Facilitate a comprehensive approach towards care needs This thesis also suggested that older people's impairments and care needs in different domains of health were often interrelated. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to care and support is necessary to address impairments and meet care needs in conjunction with one another. One such approach is the use of a CGA by health and social care professionals who are involved in older people's care and support. To this end, CGA instruments have been designed and tested over the years, which address problems and care needs in a comprehensive way, as shown in this thesis (Chapter 7). Although the CGAs could still benefit from more research to optimise their efficacy, it is recommended to use existing ones in practice to address the complex care needs of older people [65, 66]. Moreover, to ensure care needs across different domains of health are adequately addressed, it is also important to facilitate an integrated approach that involves collaboration and communication between multiple service providers. It is essential to understand which disciplines and sectors must be involved at the local level (e.g. health care, social care, housing, transportation, and community groups such as voluntary organisations and churches). Organisations and professionals from these different disciplines and sectors have to seek common ground and create a shared vision, so that they can work together to better align care and support services with older people's needs and preferences [67]. Regular meetings that bring stakeholders from all types of organisations together can facilitate multidisciplinary 8 collaboration. Such meetings contribute to establishing mutual understanding and trust, which are prerequisites of collaboration [67, 68]. Furthermore, activities in daily care delivery processes, such as information exchange about older people's situations, needs, and goals across different organisational and professional boundaries, are necessary building blocks for further improving collaboration between different organisations and professionals. Make sure older people are placed at the centre of their own care and support This thesis showed that service providers' experiences with person-centred approaches differed from those of older people receiving care and support. The experiences of service providers were often more favorable than those of older people. This finding suggests that service providers are not able to focus exclusively on what is important for older people. Their care needs and preferences should, however, always be the starting point of improving integrated care. Trusting relationships and regular conversations between older people, their informal caregivers, and professionals are important to discuss older people's preferences regarding the amount and types of care and support they would like to receive. To support staff in having such conversations, training and education opportunities are necessary. Training should focus on how staff can involve older people in decision-making or the application of conversation techniques that help older people express their preferences and priorities. Also older people can be supported to take control of their care and support. Expressing priorities and wishes, setting goals, and participating in decisions are important to ensure their needs and preferences are understood and met. In one of the integrated care initiatives involved in the SUSTAIN project, workshops for older people on empowerment and shared-decision making were undertaken in local community centres. Older people who participated in these workshops felt supported, and they appreciated it. However, not every older person wishes to or can play a role in their care process. Although the involved staff is recommended to keep searching for new ways to involve older people that suit individual preferences or capabilities, it is, above all, important that they respect each older person's choice [69]. Continuous communication and trusting relationships between older people, their families, and professionals are therefore necessary. discussion In addition to being important actors in their care processes (e.g. expressing needs, setting goals), the perspectives of older people should also be paramount in the broader processes of shaping and improving care and support services. The results in this thesis demonstrated that older people's perspectives remained underrepresented in the improvement projects in integrated care since only few initiatives involved representatives of (patient) advocacy organisations. Community engagement (of older people) is vital to improving care and support in a way that is tailored to the needs of whom it concerns and to put unheard voices and unseen perspectives forward [70, 71]. However, the literature highlights a power imbalance between organisations' views of citizen participation and citizens' perspectives on their involvement [70]. Usually, not citizens but service providers are the ones that keep holding key positions in decision-making and governance. However, to achieve meaningful participation and tailored care and support services, it is important that service providers are willing to address power imbalances and consider citizens (i.e. older people) as legitimate and equal partners. Future research directions Seek close alignment across European research projects Aside from SUSTAIN, several other European research projects have been initiated to gain new insights on how to bring integrated care a step further, such as SELFIE projects followed their specific course, adopted their own methodological approach, and had their particular target group. Nevertheless, they all focused on promising integrated care initiatives and aimed to obtain knowledge on what to learn from them, and how to stimulate dissemination and upscaling of good practices across Europe [77]. Since these research projects have worked on different pieces of the puzzle of integrated care, it appears difficult to connect knowledge and experiences from different projects and embed them coherently into practice. Although aforementioned projects have looked for opportunities to achieve synergy, it is recommended that future European research projects that are similar set close collaboration and alignment as one of their main goals. This way, it becomes possible to provide meaningful and joint recommendations on how to bring integrated care a step further, underpinned by findings from different European-wide projects. 8 Explore the value of alternative study designs A wide range of methods of monitoring and evaluation can be used to evaluate integrated care in local contexts. In this doctoral thesis, for instance, a case study design was adopted. So far, such a research design has hardly been used in evaluation studies on integrated care [78]. Researchers are recommended to consider innovative study designs, such as the case study design and realist evaluation methodology [61, 79], in addition to more traditional study designs. These methodologies can answer other types of questions, focusing on what works for whom, in which circumstances, and why? Furthermore, it is considered necessary that researchers exchange experiences and learn from each other about methodological issues in integrated care (e.g. how to adopt new research designs?). Develop and implement new methods to capture older people's experiences Although much effort was put into assessing what is considered relevant to older people in the evaluation of integrated care, it was found challenging. In the studies in this thesis, a broad definition of health was used, but other dimensions such as living a meaningful life and having a sense of purpose were rarely addressed. To meet the needs that are essential for older people, more attention should be paid to these dimensions of health. Up until now, a lack of consensus on how to measure these dimensions has challenged their use in evaluations [29]. These measurement issues need to be addressed in future research to accelerate the application of a broader definition of health. Subsequently, new insights on measuring broader concepts of health can be used in future evaluations of integrated care for older people in Europe. In turn, this may contribute to the development of care and support approaches that focus on enabling older people to live a meaningful life and preserve their autonomy and independence. Furthermore, it remains challenging to adequately measure the impact of integrated care from the perspective of the older person. A reason for this is that older people might be invited to participate in a study and are expected to share their experiences with integrated care, while they are often not aware they are receiving care within an integrated care initiative. This unawareness needs to be taken into account in evaluations and the ways older people's experiences are measured. In addition, qualitative research methods are becoming increasingly important in evaluations of integrated care for older people. It is, however, questionable whether traditional qualitative research methods such as focus groups and (lengthy) interviews can generate stories that communicate the experiences and perspectives of older people [80]. It is recommended that discussion more traditional methods, also innovative qualitative methods are used, such as narrative interview techniques, shadowing, or photovoice [81-83]. Future research, in which (representatives of) older people, researchers, and service providers closely collaborate, might provide insight into how to capture older people's stories and experiences in evaluating integrated care. Overall conclusion This doctoral thesis shows that the implementation of integrated care into practice takes many different shapes and forms. Integrated care initiatives nevertheless experience similar challenges. It is therefore important that countries combine their efforts and learn from each other to bring integrated care a step further together. Although person-centredness is considered essential to advance the development of integrated care, it remains challenging to implement improvements that reflect older people's values and beliefs and address their broad range of care needs in different domains. It is recommended that disciplines involved in care for older people invest in interprofessional collaboration and, above all, in trusting relationships with older people to place them at the heart of integrated care. 8 Dickinson H, Peck E.

Medicine, Health the photovoice method to enrich phenomenological inquiry Summary Across Europe, the majority of people live in their homes and communities until old age. As people age, they often suffer from (multiple) chronic conditions and disabilities, which result in complex care needs. Care and support for older people with complex care needs lack continuity and coordination. Furthermore, care and support are insufficiently tailored to older people's care needs and preferences. Numerous integrated care initiatives have been initiated to address these challenges. These initiatives proactively seek to structure and coordinate care and support around older people's needs and preferences. Although integrated care is increasingly being promoted as a promising approach, several knowledge gaps remain. In order to address these knowledge gaps and advance the development of integrated care, this doctoral thesis posed the following research aims: 1. To describe the characteristics of older people living at home in Europe in terms of their health and functioning, and their needs and preferences to keep living independently at home [Chapter 2 and 3]. 2. To explore what integrated care for older people with complex care needs looks like across different countries and care settings in Europe, and to gain insight into the ambitions of integrated care initiatives for improving integrated care delivery [Chapter 4 and 5]. 3. To provide insight into activities undertaken that aimed to promote person-centredness in the context of integrated care for older people with complex care needs, and to explore experiences with these activities [Chapter 6 and 7]. In order to address these research aims, this doctoral thesis drew primarily from data from two European research projects. In addition, a scoping review and an interview study among Dutch older people were performed. Perspectives of multiple actors (i.e. managers, health and social care professionals, older people and their informal caregivers) were incorporated, and different types of research methods were used to support a comprehensive picture of improving integrated care for older people. In response to the first research aim, the health and functioning of older people living at home in Europe, and their needs and preferences for care and support were explored. Chapter 2 describes the findings of a cross-sectional study on the health and functioning of older community care recipients across Europe. This study was conducted within a European research project called \"IBenC\". Older community care recipients from Germany, Finland, Iceland, Italy, and the Netherlands were studied. A broad definition of health was adopted, including the physical, cognitive, mental, and social domains of health and functioning. Findings show that the majority of older people who receive community care experienced multiple impairments, and in different domains of health and functioning simultaneously. Impairments in the physical and social domains were most prevalent. Impairments in health and functioning differed substantially across older people in Europe. Overall, the highest prevalence rates of almost all impairments were found in Italy. In contrast, older people from the Netherlands were least impaired compared to older people from other European countries. Chapter 3 describes the results of a qualitative study in which older people's care needs and preferences in relation to receiving care and support were explored. This study showed that despite being confronted with impairments across multiple domains of health and functioning, most older people preferred to live independently at home for as long as possible. Their needs and preferences for remaining in their homes and communities occurred in all domains of health and functioning. Older people considered it essential to maintain their mobility, have healthy cognitive functioning, live in appropriate housing, and have a supporting network. Additionally, they found it important to remain self-sufficient and autonomous. Together, the findings from Chapters 2 and 3 suggest that an integrated approach to care and support, in which all domains of health and functioning are being addressed, is essential to fulfill older people's needs and preferences. To address the second research aim, the next two chapters focuses on what improving integrated care for older people with complex care needs means across different countries and care settings in Europe. To do so, data from the European research project \"SUSTAIN\" were used. In Chapter 4 , the overall structure and approach of the SUSTAIN project are presented. In the SUSTAIN project, fourteen integrated care initiatives in Europe undertook efforts to improve integrated care for older people living at home with complex care needs. Initiatives from seven countries participated in the project: Austria, Estonia, Germany, Norway, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. SUSTAIN's research partners collaborated with these fourteen initiatives to support improvement processes, and evaluate implementation progress and outcomes per initiative. In Chapter 5 , data from the SUSTAIN project were used to describe and compare the participating initiatives' current ways of working, as well as their perceived limitations and ambitions for improving integrated care. In general terms, the participating initiatives included proactive primary care for frail older people, home nursing and rehabilitative care, transitional care, dementia care, and palliative care. The participating integrated care initiatives varied in terms of their national legislation and funding structures and their region's readiness for integrated care. The initiatives also differed in the settings within which they operated, their target populations, and the types of care and support services they provided. Despite the variation in initiatives, they experienced quite similar challenges in their ways of working. Challenges were related to: 1. coordination and collaboration; 2. competences, motivation, and workload of professionals; 3. communication and information; 4. person-centred working, and 5. resources and support. The ambitions of the initiatives for improving integrated care delivery showed two different emphases. In the first place, enhancing or expanding inter-professional coordination, collaboration and communication among care and support organisations (e.g. building a multidisciplinary team). Secondly, improving the actual care delivery process, including more attention to person-centred working (e.g. development of tools for conducting comprehensive geriatric assessments or changing the location of health and social care delivery). In response to the third research aim, one of the central themes in improving integrated care for older people, which is to promote person-centredness, is further explored. Chapter 6 studied improvement activities that aimed to person-centred working that were undertaken by the integrated care initiatives participating in the SUSTAIN project. Four clusters of activities were identified: 1. Activities related to the design of health and social care delivery process (e.g. conducting comprehensive geriatric assessments); 2. Staff training (e.g. providing training on shared decision-making); 3. Activities related to communication and information exchange between professionals, older people, and informal caregivers (e.g. giving older people and informal caregivers access to care plans); and 4. Activities related to facilitating the involvement of older people and informal caregivers in care and support (e.g. discussing needs, preferences, goals, and priorities). Analyses of the experiences with these activities showed that managers and health and social care professionals felt that their actions and activities had positively influenced person-centredness. However, the experiences of older people and informal caregivers were mixed, and did not correspond to service providers' positive experiences. In addition to exploring the broad range of improvement activities to promote person-centredness, one of these activities was explored in depth in this thesis: the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Chapter 7 reviewed scoping review of the scientific literature showed that many different CGA instruments and procedures for conducting them were used across integrated care initiatives. The identified CGAs all had their specific ways of identifying and discussing older people's care needs and preferences. The CGAs also varied in how they gave shape to a person-centred, comprehensive, and multidisciplinary approach to assessing older people's care needs. Finally, Chapter 8 provides a general discussion of the findings of this doctoral thesis studying the improvement of integrated care for older people from a European perspective. Based on the issues that were addressed in the general discussion, three key recommendations will be mentioned here. First, the findings from this thesis were primarily based on two European research projects. Several methodological challenges needed to be overcome, such as differences in language and culture across the participating countries, to ensure a uniform and consistent approach. Notwithstanding such challenges, these projects demonstrated that they offer great opportunities to countries and regions to exchange and learn from each other's experiences and good practices on organising care for older people. The SUSTAIN project showed, for example, that despite the diversity of contexts and countries in which care and support services are provided to older people, the main themes in improving integrated care were common across Europe. Within these resource-constrained times, countries and regions across Europe are recommended to look beyond their local borders and make the best use of existing knowledge and experiences to further improve care for older people. Second, in order to address older people's complex care needs and support them to live in their homes and communities until old age, a broad range of care and support services is involved. However, the studies in this thesis revealed that coordination and collaboration between different care and support organisations remains challenging. In order to bring the expertise of different disciplines and sectors in health and social care together, service providers are recommended to invest in interdisciplinary and interprofessional collaboration and communication. For instance, regular meetings that bring professionals from all types of organisations together can facilitate this. Such meetings contribute to establishing mutual understanding and trust, which are prerequisites of collaboration. Further improvement of coordination and collaboration at the local level is not an optional but a vital step to better align care and support services with older people's needs and preferences. Third, it is recommended that professionals from different disciplines invest in continuous communication and trusting relationships with older people and their families. It seemed challenging for service providers to focus exclusively on what is meaningful and important to older people. Critical ingredients to improve care for older people not only include involving older people in their own care and support, but also making older people's perspectives paramount in the broader processes of shaping and improving care and support services. Only by considering older people as equal partners and as the focal point of care and support services, integrated care can be further improved. To conclude, it appeared to be challenging to advance the development of integrated care. Many steps still have to be taken. This thesis shows the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach towards care and support that reflects older people's values and beliefs, and addresses their broad range of care needs. In addition, this thesis emphasized that through European collaboration, insights into experiences and good practices from different countries and regions across Europe can be gained and shared. This way, we work towards improving integrated care and, in particular, person-centred care for older de van thuiswonende ouderen in Europa [Hoofdstuk 2 en 3].
