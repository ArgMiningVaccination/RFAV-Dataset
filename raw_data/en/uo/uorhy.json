Samples of the HPs related to those ADRs were purchased for their pharmacobotanical identification. The ADRs reported were evaluated based on specialized literature and were analyzed according to causality into probable (PR), possible (PO), unrelated (UR) or unclassifiable (UC); according to expectance into unexpected adverse reaction (UNEX) and expected adverse reaction (EX); seriousness into serious adverse event or reaction (S) and non-serious (NS); and severity into mild (MI), moderate (MO) and severe (SE). Among 100 interviews, five complaints of ADRs were reported in relation to HPs: Senna alexandrina, with NS); Bauhinia sp., a strong allergic to hospitalization (UC; MO; UNEX; S); UNEX; S); and 21-herb tea, related to an allergic reaction (UC; MI; EX; NS). The strategies used in this study allowed us to carry out an analysis of ADRs attributed to HPs. This analysis could serve as a model in the study of similar cases. Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 2010 Abstract Respiratory tract infections continue to be a major health challenge worldwide especially due to the increasingly fast development of resistance to the drugs currently in use. Many plant species are traditionally used for respiratory illness treatment, and some have been investigated for their efficacy with positive results. A total of 91 plant species belonging to 82 genera and 48 families were documented and identified as respiratory system herbal remedies in Northern Peru. Northern Peru represents the center of the Andean \"health axis,\" with roots going back to traditional practices of Cupisnique culture (1000 BC). For more than a decade of research, semistructured interviews were conducted with healers, collectors, and sellers of medicinal plants. In addition, bioassays were carried out to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of plants found. Most of the 510 species encountered were native to Peru (83%). Fifty percent of the plants used in colonial times have disappeared from the pharmacopoeia. Market vendors specialized either on common and exotic plants, plants for common ailments, and plants only used by healers or on plants with magical purposes. Over 974 preparations with up to 29 different ingredients were used to treat 164 health conditions. Almost 65% of the medicinal plants were applied in these mixtures. Antibacterial activity was confirmed in most plants used for infections. Twenty-four percent of the aqueous extracts and 76% of the ethanolic extracts showed toxicity. Traditional preparation methods take this into account when choosing the appropriate solvent for the preparation of a remedy. The increasing demand for medicinal species did not increase the cultivation of medicinal plants. Most species are wild collected, causing doubts about the sustainability of trade. 2011 The majority of the herbal preparations were prepared from the leaves of plants (35%), while the whole plant (21.25%), and stems (17.5%) were used less frequently. In 60% of the cases fresh plant material was used to prepare remedies. Only about 55% of the remedies were applied orally, while the remaining ones were applied topically. Over half of all remedies were prepared as mixtures of multiple ingredients. 2008 Preventive Veterinary Medicine 1998 Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety 2008 Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
