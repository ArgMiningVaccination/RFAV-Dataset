An individual who is a beneficiary under a long-term care insurance policy that meets the requirements of a \"qualified State long-term care insurance partnership\" policy (partnership policy) as set forth below, is given a resource disregard as described in this amendment. The amount of the disregard is equal to the amount of the insurance benefit payments made to or on behalf of the individual. The term \"long-term care insurance policy\" includes a certificate issued under a group insurance contract. The State Medicaid Agency (Agency) stipulates that the following requirements will be satisfied in order for a long-term care policy to qualify for a disregard. Where appropriate, the Agency relies on attestations by the State Insurance Commissioner (Commissioner) or other State official charged with regulation and oversight of insurance policies sold in the state, regarding information within the expertise of the State's lnsurance Department. STATE Arl+ar\\ gA TO ATTACHMENT 2.6-A Page2 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: Arkansas STATE LONG.TERM CARE INSURANCE PARTNERSHIP o The policy is a qualified long-term care insurance policy as defined in section 77028(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. o The policy meets the requirements of the long-term care insurance model regulation and long-teffn care insurance model Act promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (as adopted as of October 2000) as those requirements are set forth in section l917(bX5)(A) of the Social Security Act. The policy was issued no earlier than the effective date of this State plan amendment. The insured individual was a resident of a Partnership State when coverage first became effective under the policy. If the policy is later exchanged for a different long-term care policy, the individual was a resident of a Partnership State when coverage under the earliest policy became effective. The policy meets the inflation'protection requirements set fonh in section l9l7(bXl)(CXiii)QV) of the Social Security Act. The Commissioner requires the issuer of the policy to make regular reports to the Secretary that include notification regarding when benefits provided under the policy have been paid and the amount of such benefits paid, notification regarding when the policy otherwise terminates, and such other information as the Secretary determines may be appropriate to the administration of such partnerships. The State does not impose any requirement affecting the terms or benefits of a partnership policy that the state does not also impose on non-partnership policies. The State Insurance Department assures that any individual who sells a partnership policy receives training, and demonstrates evidence of an understanding of such policies and how they relate to other public and private coverage of long-term care. The Agency provides information and technical assistance to the Insurance Department regarding the training described above.

The state will be negotiating supplemental rebates in the Medicaid program in addition to the Federal rebates provided for in Title XIX. Rebate agreements between the state and pharmaceutical manufacturer(s) will be separate from the Federal rebates. Effective May 1, 2022, CMS has authorized the state of Arkansas to enter into a multi -state supplemental rebate pool, using a Preferred Drug List (PDL) to maximize state supplemental rebates. The state will continue to select products participating in the federal rebate program that will be in its Preferred Drug List Program and will only receive state supplemental rebates for manufacturer's supplemental covered products included on the PDL. A rebate agreement between the state and a participating drug manufacturer for drugs provided to the Medicaid program, submitted to CMS on May 24, 2016, and entitled, State of Arkansas Supplemental Rebate Agreement, has been authorized by CMS. Any additional versions of rebate agreements negotiated between the state and manufacturer(s) after May 24, 2016, will be submitted to CMS for authorization.

All drugs covered by the program, irrespective of a supplemental rebate agreement, will comply with the provisions of the national drug rebate agreement. The supplemental rebate program does not establish a drug formulary within the meaning of 1927(d)(4) of the Social Security Act. Effective May 1, 2022, CMS has authorized the state of Arkansas to enter into value/outcomes - based contracts with manufacturers on a voluntary basis. The conditions of the value/outcomes - based contract would be agreed upon by both the state and manufacturer.

The historical fee -for-service population data is extracted for claims and eligibility for a PACE eligible populations for more than one fiscal period. Data for recipient aged, blind a nd disabled aid categories for those 55 or greater is used in the UPL and rate calculations. The level of care codes are limited to nursing facility level of care eligible or ARChoices Waiver level of care eligible. The data includes both those that are eligible only for Medicaid and those that are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. In addition, this data includes only QMB -Plus and SLMB -Plus populations. The claims data includes all categories of service. The UPL and base rate information is also inclusive of patient liability. The base rates are calculated using calendar year base data. The base year data is trended forward using the historical claims and eligibility information extracted for the fee -for-service population. The recent trend rates are compared to linear regression model trend rates to determine comparability, and to de termine if any adjustments are necessary. The trend rates for future periods are expected to be consistent with historical rate changes rather than the more recent experience. The following rate category groupings were developed for Arkansas: Pre -65 M edicaid Only, Pre -65 Dual Eligible, Post- 65, and QMB Only. The UPL for QMB Only is based on actual expenditures for co -payments and deductibles for the base year period trended forward for inflation, and adjusted for investment income and administration e xpense. Due to the limited size population in the post -65 age group that was not Medicare eligible, it was determined that a Medicare eligibility rate for those over 65 would not improve predictability. The data did not reflect a necessity for a rate gr ouping for either geographic region or gender. Claims completion factors are developed from the fee -for-service paid claims experience with the most recently available paid dates. Claims completion factors were developed for fourteen (14) primary group ings with comparable categories of service grouped for improved predictability. The completion factors were adjusted to exclude low and high outliers for each specific lag month. The following adjustments are necessary in the development of the rates: Prescription Drug (PD) Rebate - Reduce PD expenditure data to reflect the rebate received by Arkansas. Investment Income - Reduce expenditure data by 0.2% for all Categories of Services (COS) to reflect an average payment lag of 2.49 months. Administration Expense - Increase expenditure data for all COS by 0.3% to reflect the cost of administration of the fee -for-service program.

PCCM Fees - Decrease the base expenditures to exclude the PCCM fees. ' Non-emergency Transportation - Currently under waiver, Arkansas contracts for non-emergency transportation services for all Medicaid recipients eligible for the benefit (nursing facility residents are not eligible). A composite rate is developed with adjustments to reflect the PACE population morbidity. The UPL amounts are reduced by a percentage amount to establish the PACE capitation rate. The Percentage (yo) amount will be based on the anticipated reductions in health care service costs due to the implementation of the managed care PACE program. Reductions in costs are anticipated to be realized through a reduction in nursing facility and in-patient hospital costs. The Upper Payment Limits (UPL$ will be rebased/recalculated every two years and the rebasing calculations will be completed for two State Fiscal Years (SFYs). Since the first UPLs and rates were calculated for SFYs 2005 and 2006, the lirst rebasing process will be completed for Snlfs 2007 and 2008, which begin July 1,2006 and July !,2007, respectively.

B. The State elect s not to disburse cash prospectively to participants self -directing personal assistance services. v.Volu ntary Disenrollment The S tate will provide the following safeguards to ensure continuity of services and assure participant health and welfare during the period of transition between self -directed and traditional service delivery models. Whe n the participant voluntarily elects to discontinue participation in IndependentChoices, DHS professional staff will discuss with the individual the reason for disenr ollment and assist the individual in resolving any barriers or problems that may exist in preventing continuation. If the participant wishes to continue with the option to disenroll, DHS professional staff will assist by informing the participant of tradi tional agency personal care providers in the participant's area. DHS professional staff will assist with the coordination of agency services to the degree requested by the participant. Ind ependentChoices can continue until agency services are established or the participant may elect to use informal supports until agency services are established. The timeframes discussed under involuntary disenrollment do not apply to voluntary disenrollment. The request of the participant will be honored whether they ask to be disenrolled immediately or at anytime in the future. DHS professional staff will coordinate the participant's wishes to the degree requested by the participant. This may include self -advocation by the participant and asking DHS professional st aff to coordinate agency services with the participant's preferred provider. In some instances the participant may wish to forego agency personal assistance services and choose to rely on family or friends. If the participant requests that DHS professional staff coordinate the agency services , DHS staff will ascertain when services can be started. DHS staff will then close the IndependentChoices case the day before agency services begin. Regardless of the situation, the State will assure that there will not be an interruption in delivering necessary services unless it is the preference of the participant to depend on informal supports Attachment 3.1 -A Page 3 Revised: January 1, 2019 OMB Approved 0938 -1024 STATE PLAN UNDE R TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: ARKANSAS 1915(j) Self -Directed Personal Assistance Services (Continued) vi.Invo luntary Disenrollment A.The circumstances under which a participant may be involuntarily disenrolled from self -directing personal assistance services, and returned to traditional service delivery model are noted below. Par ticipants may be disenrolled for the following reasons: 1.Health and Welfare: Any time DPSQA feels the health and welfare of the participant is compromised by con tinued participation in the IndependentChoices Program, the participant may be returned to the traditional personal care program. Prior to this point counseling entity's support coordinator has worked with the participant offering suggestions, identifying or changing representatives or employees to better meet the needs of the consumer, making in -home visits as needed by APS or HCBS RNs, and working to resolve these concerns. If no resolution is available, meeting the participant's health and well-being needs is of most importance; including referral back to the traditional model. 2.Change in Condition : Should the participant's cognitive ability to direct his/her own care diminish to a point where the participant can no longer self- direct and there is no r esponsible representative available to direct the care the counseling entity's support coordinator will seek out sources of support. If no resources are available, the IndependentChoices case will be closed. The participant will be informed ofthe pendin g closure by letter. The letter will include a list of traditional personal care agencies serving the participant's area. If the participant is also a 1915(c) waiver recipient, an e -mail will be auto generated to the HCBS RN or targeted case manager. The e- mail to the HCBS RN or targeted case manager is auto generated and populated with the appropriate names once a closure date is entered in thedatabase. The e- mail will inform the HCBS RN or targeted case manager of the pending closure of the IndependentChoices case necessitating a change in the HCBS service plan. Within five days of sendingthe letter the counseling entity's support coordinator will follow up with the participant to determine which agency the participant may wish to choose. The counseling entity's support coordinator will coordinate the referral with the agency provider. However, if the participant declines agency services,the counseling entity's support coordinator will respect the choice made by the participant. The participant may choos e to have their needs met by informal caregivers. 3.Misuse of Allowance: A notice will be issued should the participant or the representative who manages their cash allowance: 1) fail to pay related state and federal payroll taxes; 2) use the allowance to purchase items unrelated to personal care needs; 3) fail to pay the salary of a personal assistant; or 4)misrepresent payment of a personal assistant's salary. The counseling entity's support coordinatorwill discuss the violations with the participant and allow the participant to take corrective action including restitution if applicable. The participant will be permitted to remain in the program, but will be assigned to the fiscal intermediary, who will provide maximum bookkeeping support and service s. The participant or representative will be notified that further failure to follow the expenditure plan will result in disenrollment and a report filed with Office of Medicaid Inspector General when applicable. Attachment 3.1 -A Page 4 Revised: January 1, 2019 OMB Approved 0938-1024 STAT E PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: ARKANSAS 1915(j) Self- Directed Personal Assistance Services (Continued) vi.In voluntary Disenrollment (Continued) Should a n una pproved expenditure or oversight occur a second time, the participant/ representative will be notified that their IndependentChoices case is being closed and the participant is being returned to traditional personal care. Office of Medicaid Inspector Gen eral is informed of situations as required. The State will assure interruption of services will not occur while the participant is transitioning from IndependentChoices to traditional services. 4. Under utilization of Allowance : The fiscal intermediary is responsible for monitoring the use of Medicaid funds received on behalf of the participant. If the participant is underutilizing the allowance and not using the allowance according to their cash expenditure plan, the fiscal intermediary will inform the co unseling entities through quarterly reports and monthly reports upon request. The counseling entity's support coordinator will discuss problems that areoccurring with the participant and their support network. Together the parties will resolve theunder utilization. The counseling entity's support coordinator will continue to monitor the participant's use of their allowance through both reviewing of reports and personal contactwith the participant. If a pattern of underutilization continues to occur, f uture discussions will focus on what is in the best interest of the participant in meeting their ADLs even if the bestsolution is a return to agency services. Unused funds are returned to the Arkansas Medicaidprogram within 45 days upon disenrollment. Funds accrued in the absence of a savings plan will be returned to the Arkansas Medicaid program within a twelve month filing deadline. Exceptions to involuntary disenrollment may be considered if the participant has been hospitalized for an extended peri od of time or has had a brief visit out of state with approval by the participant's physician. Person-centered planning allows the flexibility of decision makingbased on individual needs that best meet the needs of the participant. 5.Fai lure to Assum e Employer Authority: Failure to Assume Employer Authority occurs when a participant fails to fulfill the role of employer and does not respond to counseling support. Participants who fail in their employer responsibilities but do not have a representativ e will be given the opportunity to select a representative who can assume employer responsibilities onbehalf of the participant. Disenrollment will not occur without guidance and counseling by thecounseling entity's support coordinator or by the fiscal intermediary. When this occurs, the counseling entity's support coordinator will coordinate agency personal care services to the degree requested by the participant. The participant may wish to self- advocate from a list provided by the counseling entity's support coordinator , ask the counseling entity's support coordinator to coordinate, or may simply wish to receive personal assistance services informally. The participant's wishes will be respected. B. The S tate will provide the following safeguards to ensure continuity of services and assure participant health, safety and welfare during the period of transition between self -directed and traditional service delivery Attachment 3.1 -A Page 5 Revised: January 1, 2019 OMB Approved 0938-1024 STAT E PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: ARKANSAS 1915(j) Self- Directed Personal Assistance Services (Continued) vi.In voluntary Disenrollment (Continued) When a participant is involuntarily disenrolled, a notice of intent to close the IndependentChoices case will be mailed to the participant. The notice will allow a minimum of 10 days but no more than 30 days before IndependentChoices enrollment will be discontinued, depending on the situation. During the transition period, the counseling entity's support coordinator will work with the participant/representative to assure services are provided to help the individual transition to the most appropriate personal care services available. vii. Par ticipant Living Arrangement Any additional restrictions on participant living arrangements, other than homes or property owned, operated or controlled by a provider of services, not related by blood or marriage to the participant are noted below. Ther e are no addi tional restrictions on living arrangements. viii. G eographic Limitations and Comparability A.

Not applicable. The state will not allow entities who provide other Medicaid State Plan services to be responsible for developing the self- directed service plan. xi.Qu ality Assurance and Improvement Plan The S tate's quality assurance and improvement plan is described below, including: i.How it will conduct activities of discovery, remediation and quality improvement in order to ascertain whether the program meets assurances, corrects shortcomings, and pursues opportunities for improvement; and i.The system performance measures, outcome measures and satisfaction measures that the Statewill monitor and evaluate. Many act ivities evaluate the overall performance of the IndependentChoices program such as: The IndependentChoices program uses a database to track a wide array of data, and uses all of the data it stores. Data entry drives end user functionality through form and e- mail generation, field calculation, data cross-referencing, and notices and reports. The reporting capabilities can help to monitor every element of operations such as: caseparticulars, work reports and management and operational tools. Use of the database supports discovery, remediation, and quality improvements. Using a DHS -approved assessment tool to determine the resources in time required to provide care in the home. Reports received from Financial Management Services provider received on a quarterlybasis used by DHS Independent Choices QA staff to determine why underutilization of the Cash Expenditure Plan occurs and how underutilization can be Attachment 3.1 -A Page 9 Revised: January 1, 2019 OMB Approved 0938-1024 STAT E PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: ARKANSAS 1915(j) Self- Directed Personal Assistance Services (Continued) xi. Qua lity Assurance and Improvement Plan (Continued) All individual facets of the program work in a continuum to identify, remediate and improve the quality of services and the satisfaction of program participants while improving the overall performance of the p rogram. Each phase of the program is described, detailing how assurances are met through the Arkansas Quality Assurance and Improvement Plan described below. Monitoring and Oversight The Division of Medical Services (DMS) retains responsibility for th e administration and oversight of all Medicaid programs. The Division of Provider Services and Quality Assurance (DPSQA) is the operating agency for the IndependentChoices program and responsible for the day -to-day operations. Both Divisions are part of the Arkansas Department of Human Services. DPSQA will be responsible for executing the Quality Assurance and Improvement Plan with monitoring and oversight by DMS. DPSQA will provide DMS with a monthly report comparing status of current data to previous year data. Examples included in the report may include but are not limited to the following: Enr ollment activities Status of pending applications Status of active case load Participants who also receive home and community based services (HCBS) Medicaid Cost for IndependentChoices including participant-directed cost for HCBS services Detailed information for cost data for the most current month including cost of participant's budget and support services. Year in Progress, count of participants, contact notes, home visits, new enrollments for thecurrent month, year to date and accumulative prior year experiences. Line s of communication between the two Divisions are established and utilized to discuss additional needs and concerns that either Division may have. Attachment 3.1 -A Page 10 Revised: January 1, 2019 OMB Approved 0938-1024 STAT E PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: ARKANSAS 1915(j) Self- Directed Personal Assistance Services (Contin ued) xi. Q uality Assurance and Improvement Plan (Continued) The I ndependentChoices database is designed in such a way that discovery and remediation go hand in hand; not only for the DHS Independent Choices QA staff , nurses and contractors, but also for mana gement staff. By design, the efficiency of the database enhances the DHS Independent Choices QA staff's ability to monitor the program without being overly burdened by paperwork. Examples on the following pages may include but are not limited to: The da t abase quantifies: referrals received during the month, persons disenrolling, The database identifies: reasons for disenrolling from the program, IndependentChoices participants who also receive HCBS waiver services, the HCBS RN assigned to the partici pant, the participant's physician, physician's fax number, date of next reassessment due. The database tracks and creates exception reports when standards are not met and quantifies results. Some examples of the reports are: time between the date of referral, the nurse's home visit, and receipt of the assessmentfrom the DHS Independent Assessment Contractor, time between the referral and the actual enrollment number of home visits made by HCBS RN's achment Page 11 Revised: January 1, 2019 OMB Approved 0938-1024 STAT E PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: ARKANSAS 1915(j) Self- Directed Personal Assistance Services (Continued) xi. Qu ality Assurance and Improvement Plan (Continued) Each ac tive and pending record contained within the database only includes data fields that are used in reporting. Each participant record may include the following: representative information, if applicable, participant's employee, participant's back -up worker, directions to the participant's home, nurse tracking, Independent Choices QA tracking, contact notes, HCBS ARChoices service plan for persons receiving both ARChoices and IndependentChoices. The se data elements will assist the DHS Independent Choices QA staff and nurses in performing their duties by allowing timely management and monitoring of each participant's case. The database allows nurses, DHS Independent Choices QA staff or contractors to set health risk indicato rs identifying program participants who may require more frequent monitoring. The d ata allow s nurses and DHS Independent Choices QA staff to run reports from their case load. Automated highlights on specific data elements draw the nurse or DHS Independent Choices QA staff attention to areas that require special attention. Highlighted data fields represent the following: assessment performed by the DHS Independent Assessment Contractor but not received by DPSQA , date enrollment forms sent to a potential enrollee Attachment 3.1 -A Page 12 Revised: January 1, 2019 OMB Approved 0938-1024 STAT E PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: ARKANSAS 1915(j) Self- Directed Personal Assistance Services (Continued) xi. Q uality Assurance and Improvement Plan (Continued) Repor ts are available to management to monitor quality of services provided to program participants and performance of staff. The reports identify program strengths and weaknesses or individual areas of concern. Reports compare data elements over periods of time to measure progress of corrective actions. As issues are identified they are addressed with appropriate staff to determine a new course of action through issuing new policy, enacting new procedures, clarifying an existing policy or procedure, or developing additional training. Identified issues continue to be monitored to determine if the corrective action is resolving the concern and is achieving the expected outcomes. The se reports allow flexibility to generate data based on any specified period of time, by a nurse, DHS Independent Choices QA staff , contractor or by management. Reporting frequencies range from daily, monthly, or annually. Policy dictates a maximum period of time for completion of specific tasks with the focus on completing necessary tasks that allow the program participant to direct and meet their own health care needs. Repor ting is used to identify and remediate problems, improve program operation and to evaluate staff performance. The da tabase stores contact notes documenting IndependentChoices QA staff and contractors' communication with program participants. Policy requires each contact note to be entered into the participant's record to enhance the ability of management to address concerns expressed by the participant, a legislator, the Governor's Office, etc., with a quick review of the contact notes. Exam ples of data elements found in the nurse tracking database portion may include, but is not limited to these data elements describing some of the following characteristics: Level of care tier category principal diagnosis, secondary diagnoses, participant well cared for, strong informal supports, no concerns noted, need for frequent counseling entity's support coordinator Attachment 3.1 -A Page 13 Revised: January 1, 2019 OMB Approved 0938-1024 STAT E PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: ARKANSAS 1915(j) Self- Directed Personal Assistance Services (Continued) xi. Q uality Assurance and Improvement Plan (Continued) Conta ct notes may include the following: person initiating the call, person receiving the call, date and time of call, subject of contact description of communicati on, complaint indicator whom complaint is directed toward date of complaint resolution Nur ses are supported by the Nurse Case Load Report that quantifies the active and pending caseload for each nurse by describing the following: by county, the number of active and pending clients with or without home and community- based services, data is also displayed in the aggregate by nurse per assigned counties. The D HS Independent Assessment Contractor uses a DHS -approved assessment tool to define the participant's medical needs relative to the amount of resources required to care for the person in the home. The DHS -approved assessment tool is similar to the MDS assessment performed in nursing homes but is specifically designed for the community environment. The assessment results in a level of care tier defining the degree of functional impairment. These results help define the population served in addition to using a scientifically scaled and validated assessment instrument. The use of this assessment helps to more clearly describe the medical complexities of program participants as they strive to remain in the community and avoid institutionalization. Moni toring occurs in various other ways such as: Underutilization of the allowance could be the first indica tion that a participant may be experiencing difficulty directing their own care. It could indicate the beginning of a decline in cognitive function, impairing the participant's ability to direct their care, a need for a representative or decision making partner; a loss of worker; or it may be nothing more than not submitting the timesheets in a timely manner. Each counseling entity's support coordinator works with his or her participants to determine the cause of the underutilization. The counseling ent ity's support coordinator and participant work together to resolve the problem with the counseling entity's support coordinator providing further assistance, as needed, or by the participant meeting his or her responsibilities as an employer. The counseli ng entity's support coordinator follows- up with additional calls to the participant and monitors future underutilization reports Attachment 3.1 -A Page 14 Revised: January 1, 2019 OMB A pproved 0938-1024 STAT E PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: ARKANSAS 1915(j) Self- Directed Personal Assistance Services (Continued) xi. Q uality Assurance and Improvement Plan (Continued) Sit e visits to the contractors are made at a minimum b i-annually and more often if needed. The purpose of the site visit may be to provide an in- service, address concerns, or to evaluate performance. If during an evaluation deficiencies are noted, DPSQA may provide additional in- services, require an acceptable corrective action plan, monitor the corrective action plan, withhold payment or terminate the contract. Participant Feedback The DPSQA and its counseling and fiscal contractors support and encourage participant communication by provision of a toll-free number . Participants may pose questions and voice concerns using the toll- free number. Incoming calls from participants and outgoing calls from counseling entity's support coordinators or contractors are entered into the participant's individual elect ronic record. If the communication is an expressed complaint the counseling entity's support coordinator follows DPSQA required reporting procedures for documenting and resolving the complaint. Resolutions may include policy or procedural changes. Monitoring will continue to determine if the change has any impact or if the problem needs additional review. A DH S appeal process is available for decisions made concerning Medicaid eligibility. An internal appeal process is available for participants when they are in disagreement with the number of hours recommended by the HCBS RN, involuntary disenrollment or if they have disagreements with their counseling entity's support coordinator or fiscal agent. The purpose of the internal appeal is to allow the participant a voice in the decision and a way to mediate any misunderstandings between the participant and the IndependentChoices program. Additional supporting information may be shared during this time. DPSQA will issue a letter to the participant within five days from the date the internal appeal is conducted. Most disagreements are resolved prior to a participant initiating a request for a fair hearing and appeal. A formal Medicaid Fair Hearing is available when services are reduced, suspended, eliminated, or upon loss of Medicaid eligibility.

Q uality Assurance and Improvement Plan (Continued) Part icipants may also receive in -home visits, newsletters, questionnaires, and contact by phone to support participants wishing to direct their own care. Part icipants can speak with their counseling entity's support coordinator or the fiscal intermediary from 8:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except for legal holidays or during inclement weather. After hours the participa nt may leave a message; the counseling entity's support coordinator will return the call within one working day. Complaints are entered by the receiving party whether that is the counseling entity's support coordinator or the fiscal intermediary. A pac k et of communication forms is provided to each participant to report a change, to revoke and/or change disclosure of information and to appeal adverse decisions. The counseling entity's support coordinator may also verbally take information related to changes in address or phone number. Health and Welfare Eac h participant must have an individual back-up plan to handle situations when the participant's primary employee is unavailable. The participant identifies a person who is willing to assume the tasks of the primary employee. The participant determines the risk involved and how the risk is mitigated based on their own individual needs. Inquiry of the use of the back-up plan occurs during phone communication with the participant. Reports from the Inde pendentChoices database can identify any program participant without a back -up personal attendant and if there is a conflict regarding a representative serving as a paid back - up personal attendant. The counseling entity's support coordinator initiates communications with the participant to begin remediation. The counseling entity's support coordinator and fiscal entities will work closely together to provide information necessary for each entity to perform their duties. Frequent and thorough communication facilitates this good working relationship. The da tabase assists in addressing health and welfare concerns by allowing monitoring and management of each individual file by: iden tifying a participants representative, employee, physician, back -up worker, directions to the home, results of the Independent Assessment , and updates by the counseling entity's support coordinator assisting the participant in the IndependentChoices program, and; documenting all communications with the Attachment 3.1 -A Page 17 Revised: January 1, 2019 OMB Approved 0938-1024 STAT E PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: ARKANSAS 1915(j) Self- Directed Personal Assistance Services (Continued) xi. Qual ity Assurance and Improvement Plan (Continued) Financial Accountability DPSQ A assures that payments are made to Medicaid eligible participants by: acc essing Medicaid eligibility data prior to enrolling a person into IndependentChoices to assure eligibi lity for Medicaid and the IndependentChoices program; IndependentChoices program logic implemented by the Arkansas Medicaid fiscal intermediary, interfaces with the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) to edit against creation of an allowance for any participant who is no longer Medicaid eligible or is institutionalized; DPSQA maintains the MMIS eligibility file for IndependentChoices. The Arkansas fiscal intermediary reads the MMIS eligibility file to create claims for the IndependentChoices program. DPSQA queries on a weekly basis the Medicaid data warehouse to identify persons who are deceased, entered a nursing home, or have lost Medicaid eligibility.Once identified, the IndependentChoices eligibility segment is closed by DHSIndependent Cho ices QA staff on a weekly basis. Through contact with the participant or participant's family or representative this information is obtained prior to the update of theMMIS; DPSQA also queries the Medicaid data warehouse to identify IndependentChoices participants who have had an acute hospitalization. Once identified, DPSQA informs the program participant, FMS provider and the counseling entity by letter that the participant's allowance paid prospectively during the hospitalization must be returned to the Medicaid program. The day of admission and day of discharge are allowable days; preventing duplication of agency and consumer- directed services by informing agency provider by fax seven days in advance the date the participant will begin directing theirown personal care Attachment 3.1 -A Page 18 Revised: January 1, 2019 OMB Approved 0938-1024 STAT E PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: ARKANSAS 1915(j) Self- Directed Personal Assistance Services (Continued) xi.

Q uality Assurance and Improvement Plan (Continued) Qua lified Providers (continued) DPSQ A is responsible for the following activities: monit or the counseling and fiscal providers to ensure compliance with the spirit of participant-direction and that appropriate counseling, fiscal and programmatic procedures are maintained; serve as the liaison between counseling agency, fiscal provider, Medicaid ManagementInformation System (MMIS), and the Arkansas Medicaid fiscal intermediary; monitor the process to reimburse the counseling agency and fiscal provider for servicesprovided to program participants. Qual ity assurance measures previously discussed, assist DPSQA in discovery and remediation to assure high standards in the offering and management of the participant-directed personal care program. The IndependentChoices program establishes, as its foundation, a person-centered approach that guides not only DPSQA, but counseling and fiscal providers as well. xii R isk Management A. The risk assessment methods used to identify potential risks to participants are described below: The HCBS RN or the counseling entity's support coordinator is the cataly st for identifying potential risks. In -home visits by either party help to identify risks involved in the current home environment as well as potential risks involved with self -direction. The counseling entity's support coordinator or the HCBS RN can ide ntify risks that may be environmental in nature such as throw rugs, uneven floors, etc. or the DHS -approved assessment tool may identify potential risks such as not receiving a flu vaccine, etc. Based on the HCBS RN's observation and the DHS -approved assessment tool, the HCBS RN after receiving notification from the counseling entity's support coordinator will discuss the potential risks identified with the individual. If the HCBS RN determines that a representative is needed, the RN will inform the couns eling entity's support coordinator . When the HCBS RN determines that a person is in need of a representative, the nurse will inform the counseling entity's support coordinator and the counseling entity's support coordinator will work with the participant to determine if there is someone who knows the participant's likes, dislikes, and preferences and is willing to accept the responsibilities to represent the participant in the IndependentChoices Attachment 3.1 -A Page 20 Revised: January 1, 2019 OMB Approved 0938-1024 STAT E PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: ARKANSAS 1915(j) Self- Directed Personal Assistance Services (Continued) xii. Ri sk Management (Continued) The co unseling entity's support coordinator is responsible for working with the participant to determine who can serve as the representative. The counseling entity's support coordinator will then work with the representative to teach, educate and work with the proposed represent ative so that the representative is fully aware of the responsibilities they are accepting in representing a person in a participant- directed program. If t he HCBS RN arrives and the participant is experiencing cognitive impairment and no informal supports are present, the participant will be discouraged from enrolling unless an informal support system can be identified, including someone to act as a representative decision maker. Participation in IndependentChoices requires the participant or their repr esentative to be assertive in their role as employer and accept the risks, rights and responsibilities of directing their own care. If a representative is unavailable and the potential enrollee is incapable of performing these tasks without health and saf ety risks the person will not be enrolled. Blatant health and welfare concerns will not be compromised if solutions cannot be identified and enacted. In addi tion to the HCBS RN's involvement there is communication with other agency providers providing home and community based services, with all parties having a vested interest in the health and welfare of the participant. This communication assists the operating agency to respond to any voiced concern with self -directed care. The Participant Responsibilities and Agreement Form, which details all the requirements of self- direction, identifies areas where the individual may not be able to meet their responsibilities. B. The t ools or instruments used to mitigate identified risks are described below. Ever y opportunity is afforded a participant to direct their own care, but the participant must accept and assume employer responsibility. Counseling support is available to help the participant, butultimately it is the determination of the participant to suc ceed that determines whether participant direction will be a successful program for them. The IndependentChoices program requires a participant to make good decisions in order to assure that their personal assistance needs are met. Attachment 3.1-A Page 21 Revised: January 1, 2019 OMB Approved 0938-1024 STAT E PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: ARKANSAS 1915(j) Self- Directed Personal Assistance Services (Continued) xii. Ri sk Management (Conti nued) When a participant needs a representative, the program allows for appointment of a Decision -Making Partner (DMP) who is willing to act and assume the employer role for the participant. The counseling entity's support coordinator is the person r esponsible for working with the participant or the participant's family in the appointment of a Representative or decision -making partner. Each time a Representative or DMP is appointed the enrollment of the DMP is similar to a new participant enrollment. The Representative or DMP must be at least 18 years of age and able and willing to meet the following requirements: Posses s knowledge of the participant's preferences Be willing to meet and uphold all program requirements Be willing to sign tax fo rm and verify timesheets, Show a strong personal commitment to the participant Visit the participant at least weekly Uphold all duties without influence by the personal assistant or paid back-up worker Obtain approval from the participant and a consensus from other family members of the participant to serve as the DMP Be willing to submit to a criminal background check Be available to discuss the program hours Once the participant has appointed a Representative or DMP , there are specific forms that must be completed. If at any time DPSQA learns that the participant's personal attendant is not providing the care agreed upon, the counselor will contact the participant/representative to ascertain the ability of the participant/representative to fulfill the role of employer. This discussion is to seek what types of assistance or support the participant or representative may need. A review of recurring instances of noncompliance could be reason for involuntary disenrollment. When p ersons affiliated with the IndependentChoices program suspect abuse or neglect causing potential for health and safety risk to the participant by the representative, family members, personal attendant, or others, the participant will be referred to Adult Protective Services.

Ris k Management (Continued) C. The State's process for ensuring that each service plan reflects the risks that an individual is willing and able to assume, and the plan for how identified risks will be mitigated, is described below . The service plan is a resul t of the Independent Assessment and a form designated by DHS and will list the risks identified in the assessment . The service plan will also require the nurse to list any other risks identified through observation that were not identified through the Independent Assessment or form designated by DHS, or risks identified by the participant, representative or interested parties through a participant -centered approach. The service plan will identify the plan or actions needed to mitigate the risks and who is responsible for each action. The service plan requires the signature of the participant/representative , agreeing to the service plan and what the participant/representative is willing to do to mitigate risk . D. The State's process for ensuring that the ris k management plan is the result of discussion and negotiation among the persons designated by the State to develop the service plan, the participant, the participant's representative, if any, and others from whom the participant may seek guidance, is descr ibed below. Indep endentChoices nurses and counseling entity's support coordinator are trained to apply a participant- centered approach in developing all plans with the participant. Participants are always encouraged to invite friends and family members w ho have a personal commitment to the participant to be present in all meetings between the participant and nurse or counseling entity's support coordinator . Identified risks will be discussed with the participant/representative and interested parties to determine a plan to mitigate the risk. The nurse and counseling entity's supportcoordinator are there to facilitate and guide the discussion and identify concerns with any discussed approaches to mitigation of risk. 23 Revised: January 1, 2019 OMB Approved 0938-1024 STAT E PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State: ARKANSAS 1915(j) Self- Directed Personal Assistance Services (Continued) xiii.

The counseling staff will work with the participant to establish arepresentative, using all avenues to find one if necessary.

All drugs covered by the program, irrespective of a supplemental rebate agreement, will comply with the provisions of the national drug rebate agreement. The supplemental rebate program does not establish a drug formulary within the meaning of 1927(d)(4) of the Social Security Act. Effective May 1, 2022, CMS has authorized the state of Arkansas to enter into value/outcomes -based contracts with manufacturers on a voluntary basis. The conditions of the value/outcomes -based contract would be agreed upon by both the state and manufacturer. The unit rebate amount is confidential and cannot be disclosed for purposes other than rebate invoicing and verification, in accordance with Section 1927(b)(3)(D) of the Social Security Act.

Section 1932(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act. Arkansas Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program aims to improve efficiency, economy and quality of care by rewarding high-quality care and outcomes, encouraging clinical effectiveness, promoting early intervention and coordination to reduce complications and associated costs, and, when provider referrals are necessary, by encouraging referral to efficient and economic providers who deliver high-quality care. Initially, participation in the PCMH program is open to practices as described in the DMS PCMH Provider Manual that have physicians who are primary care case managers as defined by the DMS Primary Care Case Management (ConnectCare) program. In addition, practices must meet the eligibility requirements described in the DMS PCMH Provider Manual. Practices that participate in the Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative (CPC) are eligible to receive shared savings incentive payments. The State of Arkansas enrolls most Medicaid beneficiaries into mandatory primary care case management (PCCM) . This authority is granted under section 1932(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act). Under this authority, a state can amend its Medicaid state plan to require certain categories of Medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care entities without being out of compliance with provisions of section 1902 of the Act on statewideness (42 CFR 431.50), freedom of choice (42 CFR 431.51) or comparability (42 CFR 440.230).

A PCP must make available 24-hour , 7 days per week telephone access to a live voice ( an employee of the primary care physician or an answering service) Reasonable 24- hour availability and adequate hours of operation , referral and treatment with respect to medical emergencies. 2. Response to after-hours calls regarding non-emergencies must be within 30 minutes. PCPs must make the after-hours telephone number as widely available as possible to their patients. When employing an answering machine with recorded instructions for after-hours callers, PCPs should regularly check to ensure that the machine functions correctly and that the instructions are up to date. PCPs in underserved and sparsely populated areas may refer their patients to the nearest facility available, but enrollees must be able to obtain the necessary instructions by telephone. As regards access to services, PCPs are required to provide the same level of service for their PCMH enrollees as they provide for their insured and private-pay patients. Physicians and facilities treating a PCP's enrollees after hours must report diagnosis, treatment, significant findings, recommendations and any other pertinent information to the PCP for inclus ion in the patient's medical record. A PCP may not refer PCMH enrollees to an emergency department for non- emergency conditions during the PCP's regular office hours. 3.

(Please provide a description below). DMS offers two types of pa yments to Arkansas Patient Centered Medical Homes (PCMHs): (1) care coordination payments and (2) performance -based incentive payments. The care coordinati on payment may be used by participating practices for care coordination efforts, whether these are executed by a vendor on behalf of the practice or directly by the practice. Care coordination payments are risk adjusted to account for the varying levels of care coordination services needed for patients with different risk profiles. Performance-b a sed incentive payments are annual payments made to a PCMH for delivery of economic, efficient and quality care. Each year the PCMHs are a ssessed in cost utilization measures . Those PCMHs that fall into the negotiated threshold of cost utilization measure s will be eligible for performance- based incentive payments. Performance- based incentive payments will be risk and time adjusted. DMS will als o select a yearly focus measure to reward top performing PCMHs. The focus measure will focus on an area in which the state performance is significantly lower than national average.

(Specify: (a) the supports and information made available, and (b) the participant's authority to determine who is included in the process): From the ti me an individual makes contact with DHS Benef iciary Support regarding receiving HCBS state plan services, DHS informs the individual and their care givers of their right to make choices about many aspects of the services available to them and their right to advocate for themselves or have arepresenta tive advocate on their behalf. It is the responsibility of everyone at DHS, the PASSE who receives attribution and provides care coordination, and the services providers to make sure that thePASSE member is aware of and is able to exercise their rights and to ensure that the member and their caregivers are able to make choices regarding their services. Immediat ely following enrollment in a PASSE, the PASSE care coordinator must develop an interim service plan (ISP) for member. If the member was already enrolled in a program that required PCSPs,Person-Centered Planning & Service Delivery Arkansas 18-0017 03/01/2019 12/19/2018 NEW PAGEState: TN: State plan -i: Page 11 Approved: Supersedes: then that PCSP may be the ISP for the member. The ISP may be effective for up to 60 days, pending completion of the full PCSP. The PASSE 's care coordinator is responsible for scheduling and coordinating the PCSP development meeting. As part of this responsibility the care coordinator must ensure that anyone the member wishes to be present is invited. Typically, the development team will consist of the member and their caregivers, the care coordinator, service providers, professional s who have conducted assessments or evalu ations, and friends and persons who support the member . The care coordinator must ensure that the member does not object to the presence of any participants to the PCSP development meeting. If the member or the caregiver would like a party to be present, the care coordinator is responsible for inviting that individual to attend. During the P CSP development meeting, everyone in attendance is responsible for supporting and encouraging the member to express their wants and desires and to incorporate them into the PCSP when possible. The care coordinator is responsible for managing and resolving any disagreements which arise during the PCSP development meeting. After en rollment, and prior to the PCSP development meeting, the care coordinator must conduct a health questionnaire with t he member. The care coordinator must also secure any other information that may be needed to develop the PCSP, including, but not limited to: a) Results of an y evaluations that are specific to the needs of the member; b)The results of any psychological testin g; c) The results of any adaptive behavior assessments; d)Any social, medical, physical, and mental health histories; and e) A risk assessment. The PCSP development team must utilize the results of the independent assessment, the health questionnaire, and any other assessment information gathered. The PCSP must include the member's goals, needs (behavioral, developmental, and health needs), and preferences. All needed services must be noted in the PCSP and the care coordinator is responsible for coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the PCSP. The PCSP m ust be developed within 60 days of enrollment into the PASSE. At a minimum, the PCSP must be updated annually. 7.Informed C hoice of Providers. (Describe how participants are assisted in obtaining information about and selecting from among qualified providers of the 1915(i) services in the person- centered service plan): Before a memb er can access HCBS state plan services, they must be enrolled in a PASSE under the 1915(b) Provider Led Shared Saving s Entities Waiver. The PASSE is responsible for providing all needed services to all enrolled members and may limit a member's choice of providers based on its provider network. The provider network must meet minimum adequacy standards set forth in the 1915(b) Waiver, the PASSE Provider Manual, and the PASSE provider agreement. The member has 90 days after initial enrollment to change their assigned PASSE. Once a year, there is a 30-day open enrollment period, in which the member may change their PASSE for any reason. At any time during the year, a member may change their PASSE for cause, as defined in 42 CFR State plan Attachment 3.1 -i: Page 12 Approved: Supersedes: The State has a Beneficiary Support Office to assist the member in changing PASSE's, including informing the member of their rights reg arding choosing another PASSE and how to access information on each PASSE's provider network. The Beneficiary Support Office will begin reaching out to a beneficiary once it is determined he or she meets the qualifications to be enrolled in a PASSE. 8.Process for Making Person -Centered Service Plan Subject to the Approval of the Medicaid Agency. (Describe the process by which the person -centered service plan is made subject to the approval of the Medicaid agency): DMS or the Exte rnal Quality Review Organization (EQRO) arranges for a specified number of service plans to be reviewed annually, using the sampling guide, \"A Practical Guide for Quality Management in Home and Community- Based Waiver Programs,\" developed by Human Services Research Institute and the Medstat Group for CMS in 2006. A systematic random sampling of the active case population is drawn whereby every \"nth\" name in the population is selected for inclusion in the sample. The sample size is based on a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of +/- 8%. An online calculator is used to determine the appropriate sample size for the Waiver population. To determine the \"nth\" integer, the sample is divided by the population. Names are drawn until the sample size is reached. DMS or the E QRO then requires the PASSE to submit the PCSP for all individuals in the sample. DMS or the EQRO conducts a retrospective review of provided PCSPs based on identified program, financial, and administrative elements critical to quality assurance. DMS or the EQRO reviews the plans to ensure they have been developed in accordance with applicable policies and procedures, that plans ensure the health and welfare of the member , and for financial and utilization components. D MS or the EQRO communicates findings from the review to the PASSE for remediation. Systemic findings may necessitate a change in policy or procedures. A pattern of non- compliance from one PASSE may result in sanctions to that PASSE under the PASSE Provider Manual and Provider Agreement. 9.Maintenance of Person -Centered Service Plan Forms. Written copies or electronic facsimiles of service plans are maintained for a minimum period of 3 years as required by 45 CFR \u00a774.53.

Yes The state assures that it administers cost sharing in accordance with sections 1916 and 1916A of the Social Security Act and 42 CFR 447.50 through 447.57. General Provisions The cost sharing amounts established by the state for services are always less than the amount the agency pays for the service. No provider may deny services to an eligible individual on account of the individual's inability to pay cost sharing, except as elected by the state in accordance with 42 CFR 447.52(e)(1). The process used by the state to inform providers whether cost sharing for a specific item or service may be imposed on a beneficiary and whether the provider may require the beneficiary to pay the cost sharing charge, as a condition for receiving the item or service, is (check all that apply): The state includes an indicator in the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) The state includes an indicator in the Eligibility and Enrollment System The state includes an indicator in the Eligibility Verification System The state includes an indicator on the Medicaid card, which the beneficiary presents to the provider Other process Contracts with managed care organizations (MCOs) provide that any cost-sharing charges the MCO imposes on Medicaid enrollees are in accordance with the cost sharing specified in the state plan and the requirements set forth in 42 CFR 447.50 through 447.57. Cost Sharing for Non-Emergency Services Provided in a Hospital Emergency Department The state imposes cost sharing for non-emergency services provided in a hospital emergency department. Yes The state ensures that before providing non-emergency services and imposing cost sharing for such services, that the hospitals providing care: Conduct an appropriate medical screening under 42 CFR 489.24, subpart G to determine that the individual does not need emergency services; Inform the individual of the amount of his or her cost sharing obligation for non-emergency services provided in the emergency department; Provide the individual with the name and location of an available and accessible alternative non-emergency services Effective Date: January 1, 2023Page 2 of 3Medicaid Premiums and Cost Sharing Determine that the alternative provider can provide services to the individual in a timely manner with the imposition of a lesser cost sharing amount or no cost sharing if the individual is otherwise exempt from cost sharing; and Provide a referral to coordinate scheduling for treatment by the alternative provider. The state assures that it has a process in place to identify hospital emergency department services as non-emergency for purposes of imposing cost sharing. This process does not limit a hospital's obligations for screening and stabilizing treatment of an emergency medical condition under section 1867 of the Act; or modify any obligations under either state or federal standards relating to the application of a prudent-layperson standard for payment or coverage of emergency medical services by any managed care organization. The process for identifying emergency department services as non-emergency for purposes of imposing cost sharing is: The state relies on monographs developed by its designated utilization management contractor to assess whether a hospital's triage protocols are sufficiently effective to ensure the correct level of treatment is determined. Because emergency department services are part of the overall retrospective review process, if non-emergency services are billed at the higher emergency level incorrectly, the entire service would be recouped and the emergency department could bill Medicaid for the non-emergency level and be paid the amount minus the cost share. They would not be allowed to charge the beneficiary for the cost share because the hospital is responsible for the error in claims processing. Cost Sharing for Drugs The state charges cost sharing for drugs. Yes The state has established differential cost sharing for preferred and non-preferred drugs. Yes The state identifies which drugs are considered to be non-preferred. The state assures that it has a timely process in place to limit cost sharing to the amount imposed for a preferred drug in the case of a non-preferred drug within a therapeutically equivalent or similar class of drugs, if the individual's prescribing provider determines that a preferred drug for treatment of the same condition either will be less effective for the individual, will have adverse effects for the individual, or both. In such cases, reimbursement to the pharmacy is based on the appropriate cost sharing amount. Beneficiary and Public Notice Requirements Consistent with 42 CFR 447.57, the state makes available a public schedule describing current cost sharing requirements in a manner that ensures that affected applicants, beneficiaries and providers are likely to have access to the notice. Prior to submitting a SPA which establishes or substantially modifies existing cost sharing amounts or policies, the state provides the public with advance notice of the SPA, specifying the amount of cost sharing and who is subject to the charges, and provides reasonable opportunity for stakeholder comment. Documentation demonstrating that the notice requirements have been met are submitted with the SPA. The state also provides opportunity for additional public notice if cost sharing is substantially modified during the SPA approval process. Other Relevant Information Cost sharing requirements are published in the provider manuals and a hyperlink is used to send the provider to the coinciding table housing the amount of the cost share, which is also published on the Arkansas Medicaid Website. Division of Provider Services and Quality Assurance (DPSQA) maintains the Choices in Living Resource Center, where Arkansas citizens can call for assistance, including telephone information and brochures for the Workers with Disabilities program. Various brochures are available at the DHS website: https://humanservices.arkansas.gov/, and are distributed throughout the state in the county offices where the Transmittal Number: AR-22-0008 Supersedes Transmittal Number: NEW Effective Date: January 1, 2023Page 3 of 3Medicaid Premiums and Cost Sharing Division of County Operations are housed.

The adjustment shall result in total payments to the hospitals that are equal to but not in excess of the individual facility 's Medicare -related upper payment limit. The adjustment shall be calculated as follows: 1. Using the most current audited data, Arkansas shall determine each State Operated Teaching Hospital' s base Medicare per discharge rate and base Medicaid per discharge rate. 2. The base per discharge rates shall be trended forward to the current fiscal year using an annual Consumer Price Index inflation fact or. 3. Once the per discharge rates have been trended forward, the Medicare per discharge rate will be divided by the Medicare case mix index and the Medicaid per discharge rate will be divided by the Medicaid case mix index. The Medicare case mix index reflects the hospital 's average diagnosis related group (DRG) weight for Medicare patients. The Medicaid case mix index reflects the hospital 's average DRG weight for Medicaid patients using the Medicare DRGs. 4.

Effective October 1, 2014 for recipient s age 21 and older, all in -state and out -of-state rehabilitative hospitals will be reimbursed a $400 prospective per diem rate for hospital days beyond 24 during the State Fiscal Year. The prospective per diem rates are established using total reimbursable costs under Medicare principles of reasonable cost reimbursement, except that the gross receipts tax is not an allowable cost. The initial per diem rate is calculated from the hospital's most recent unaudited cost report submitted to Medicare prior to July 1, 1991, trended forward for inflation. Arkansas Medicaid will calculate a new per diem rate annually, based on the provider's most recent unaudited cost report, and adjust the per diem rate for inflation. The inflation factor used will be the C onsumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI -U), U.S. city average for all items. We will use the change in the CPI -U during the calendar year before the start of the rate year. For example, we will use the 12 -month change in the CPI -U as of December 31, 1991, to set the rates that will be effective July 1, 1992. The inflation adjustment will be made at the beginning of each rate year. The upper limit is set annually at the 70th percentile of all rehabilitative hospitals' inflation -adjusted Medicaid per diem rate. Arkansas Medicaid will negotiate with the Arkansas Hospital Association annually (State fiscal year July 1 through June 30) regarding adjustment of the 70th percentile upper limit.

Pprospective per diem rates are established using Medicare inciples of Reasonable ost Reimburseme nt fil CFR Part 413) to determine allowable costs. The ra.tes for inpatient psychiatric hospitals are calculated utilizing the lesser of the hospital=s per diem allowable cost inflated by the consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U), U.S. city average for all items, plus a $69 professional component or the maximum per diem limit. The $69 professional component is the average of the rates for the individual psychotherapy procedure codes as of August 8, 1991. Effective for claims with dates of service on or after February 1, 1994, the maximum per diem limit is established annually at the 60th percentile of all in-state inpatient psychiatric hospitals= inflation adjusted per diem costs plus the $69 professional component. The calculation of the maximum per diem limit is rounded up (0.5000 or greater) or down (0.4999 or less) if the 60th percentile is not a whole number. This is a prospective rate with no cost settlement. Rates are calculated annually and are effective for dates of service occurring during the next State Fiscal Year (July 1st through June 30th). Per diem costs and the maximum per diem limit are calculated from the most recent submitted hospital cost reports with ending dates occurring in the previous calendar year. Less than full year cost reports and out-of-state provider cost reports will not be included when calculating the 60th percentile. For hospitals with a cost report period of less than a full six months, the new State Fiscal Year per diem rate is calculated by inflating the previous State Fiscal Y ear=s per diem rate by the CPI-U. The maximum per diem limit will not be adjusted after being set should new providers enter the program or late cost reports be received. New providers are required to submit a full year=s annual budget for the current State Fiscal Year (July I st through June 30th) at the time of enrollment if no cost report is available. This annual budget is used to set their interim rate at the lesser of the budgeted allowable cost per day or the maximum per diem limit in effect as of the first day of their enrollment.

Effective November 1r2004 through June 30, 2005, Arkansas may provide a public inpatient rate adjustment to non-state government owned or operated acute care regional medical center hospitals located outside of Arkansas (that is, acute care hospitals outside of Arkansas that are neither owned nor operated by any state) that - a) provide level I trauma and burn care services; b) provide level 3 neonatal care services; c) are obligated to serve all patients, regardlss of State of origin; d) are located within a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) that includes at least 3 States, including Arkansas; e) serve as a tertiary care provider for patients residing within a 125 mile radius; and f) meet the criteria for disproportionate share hospital under Section 1923 of the Social Security Act in at least one State other than the one in which the hospital is located. The adjustnent shall result in total payments to each hospital that ae equal to but not in excess of the individual facility's Medicare- related upper payment limit, as prescribed in 42 C.F.R. S 447.272. The adjustment shall be calculated as follows: 1.Using data from the hospital's most recently audited cost report, Arkansas shall determine each eligible non-state public hospital's base Medicare per discharge rate and base Medicaid per discharge rate. Base Medicare and Medicaid per discharge rates will include respective Case Mi-r hdex (CMI) adjustments in order to neutralize the impact of the difFerential between Medicare and Medicaid case mixes. For hospitals who, for the most recently audited cost report year filed a partial year cost report, such partial year cost report data shall be mnualized to determine theirrate adjustment; provided that such hospital was licensed and providing services throughout the entire cost report year. Hospitals with partial year cost reports who were not licensed and providing services throughout the entire cost report year shall receive pro-rated adjustments based on the partial year data. The base Medicare per discharge rate shall be multiplied by the applicabie upper payment limit (percentage) specified in 42 C.F.R. 5 +47 .272 for non-state govemment owned or operated hospitals.

Effective April 1, 2009, Arkansas may provide a public inpatient rate adjustment to non -state government owned or operated acute care regional medical center hospitals located outside of Arkansas (that is, acute care hospitals outside of Arkansas that are neither owned nor operated by any state) that - a) provide level 1 trauma and burn care services; b) provide level 3 neonatal care services; c) are obligated to serve all patients, regardless of State of origin and a bility to pay ; d) are located within a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) that includes at least 3 States, including Arkansas; e) serve as a tertiary care provider for patients residing within a 125 mile radius; and f) meet the criteria for disp roportionate share hospital under Section 1923 of the Social Security Act in at least one State other than the one in which the hospital is located. The adjustment shall result in total payments to each hospital that are equal to but not in excess of the individual facility 's Medicare- related upper payment limit, as prescribed in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7447.272. The adjustment shall be calculated as follows: 1. Using data from the hospital' s most recently audited cost report, Arkansas shall determine each eligible non-state public hospital' s base Medicare per discharge rate and base Medicaid per discharge rate. Base Medicare and Medicaid per discharge rates will include respective Case Mix Index (CMI) adjustments in order to neutralize the impact of the differential between Medicare and Medicaid case mixes. For hospitals who, for the most recently audited cost report year filed a partial year cost report, such partial year cost report data shall be annualized to determine their rate adjustment; provided that such hospital was licensed and providing services throughout the entire cost report year. Hospitals with partial year cost reports who were not licensed and providing services throughout the entire cost report year shall receive pro -rated adjustments based on the partial year data. 2. The base Medicare per discharge rate shall be multiplied by the applicable upper payment limit (percentage) specified in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.272 for non -state government owned or operated hospitals. For example, to the extent that such federal regulation permits Medicaid payments up to 150 percent of the amount that would be paid under Medicare reimbursement principles, the base Medicare per discharge rate shall be multiplied by 150 percent.

The inpatient hospital ac cess payments are considered supplemental payments and do not replace any currently authorized Medicaid inpatient hospital payments. 1. For each rate year, the state shall determine for each hospital and in total the number of Medicaid inpatient discharges for private hospitals eligible for this supplemental payment. 2. For each rate year, the state shall identify, on the basis of paid inpatient discharge claims adjudicated through the State's MMIS, reimbursement for inpatient hospital services that were delivered by the private hospitals identified in step one. 3. The state shall estimate the amount that would have been paid for the services identified in step two using Medicare principles consistent with the upper payment limit (UPL) requirements set forth in 42 CFR 447.272. Respective Case Mix Indexes (CMI) shall be applied to both the base Medicare per discharge rates and base Medicaid per discharge rates for comparison to the Medicare- related UPL. 4. The maximum allowable aggregate Medicaid inpatient hospital access payment for private hospitals shall not exceed 97% of the difference between the results of step three (Medicare UPL) and results of step two (Medicaid based payment). 5. Using discharge data identified in step one, the state shall determine each e ligible hospital's pro rata percentage which shall be a fraction equal to the number of the hospital's Medicaid discharges divided by the total number of Medicaid discharges for all eligible hospitals.

The Program: 1. Establishes Pri nciple Accountable Providers (\"PAPs\") for defined episodes of care; 2. Uses episode -based data to evaluate the quality, efficiency and economy of care delivered in the course of the episode of care, and to apply i ncentive adjustme nts; 3. Incentivizes improved care quality, efficiency and economy by rewarding high -quality care and outcomes; 4. Encourages clinical effectiveness; 5. Promotes early intervention and coordination to reduce complications and associated costs; and 6. When pro vider ref errals are necessary, encourages referral to efficient and economic providers who furnish high- quality care.

Psychiatric hospitals, pediatric hospitals, rehabilitative hospitals and critical access hospitals are not eligible for an adjustment. Payment shall be made before the end of the State Fiscal Year (SFY). The adjustmentwill be calculated and based on each hospital's previous SFYoutpatient Medicarerelated upper payment limit (UPL as specified in 42 CFR 447.321) for Medicaid reimbursed outpatientservices. The adjustments will be calculated as follows: 1.For each qualifying hospital, Arkansas Medicaid will annually identify the total Medicaid outpatient expenditures during the most recent completed SFy. For each qualifying hospital, the total Medicaid expenditures,as determined in step 1, are divided by 80% to estimate the amount that would have been paid using Medicare reimbursement principles. The difference between step I identified Medicaid expenditures and step 2 estimated Medicare amounts is the UPL annual adjustment amount that will be reimbursed. Eligible hospitals that were not licensed and providing services throughout the most recent completed SFY shall receive a pro-rated adjustment based on the partial year data. Payment for SFY 2003 shall be prorated proportional to the number of days between April 1,2003 and June 30,2003 to the total number of days in SFY 2003. * Ce:/c- -2. 3.STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT ATTACHMENT 4.19-B MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM Page 1a STATE ARKANSAS METHODS AND STANDARDS FOR ESTABLISHING PAYMENT RATES - OTHER TYPES OF CARE Revised: August 1, 2015 ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 2.a. Outpatient Hospital Services (continued) Outpatient Hospital Access Payments Effective for services provided on or after July 1, 2009, all privately operated hospitals within the State of Arkansas except for rehabilitative hospitals and specialty hospitals as defined in Arkansas Code Ann. \u00a7 20 -77-1901 (7) (D) and (E) shall be eligible to receive outpatient hospital access payments. The outpatient hospital access payments are considered supplemental payments and do not replace any currently authorized Medicaid outpatient hospital payments. The outpatient hospital access payments shall be determined on the basis of cost and calculated as follows: 1. For each rate year the state shall identify, on the basis of paid claims adjudicated through the State's MMIS, reimbursement for outpatient hospital services that were delivered by the private hospitals eligible for this supplemental payment. 2. The state shall estimate the amount of cost for the same dates of service identified in step one using Medicare cost principles consistent with the upper payment limit (UPL) requirements set forth in 42 CFR 447.321. The State will utilize cost data in a manner approved by CMS. 3. The maximum allowable aggregate Medicaid outpatient hospital access payment for private hospitals shall not exceed the difference between the results of step one (Medicaid based payment) and results of step two (Medicaid outpatient hospital services cost). 4. The maximum allowable aggregate Medicaid outpatient hospital access payment for private hospitals identified in step three shall be divided by the total Medicaid outpatient hospital services base payment for eligible hospitals identified in step one to arrive at an adjustment percentage. This percentage will be calculated annually. 5. Each eligible hospital's outpatient hospital access payment shall be determined by multiplying the Medicaid outpatient hospital services payment identified in step one by the adju stment factor determined in step four. The current year's adjustment will be based on cost data from the most recently audited fiscal year for which there is complete data. In this manner, the State will make supplemental payment to eligible hospitals for current year Medicaid utilization. Outpatient hospital access payments shall be paid on a quarterly basis. For hospitals that, for the most recently audited cost report period filed a partial year cost report, such partial year cost report data shall be annualized to determine their outpatient access payment; provided that such hospital was licensed and providing services throughout the entire cost report period. Hospitals with partial year cost reports that were not licensed and providing services throughout the entire cost report period shall receive pro -rated adjustments based on the partial year data. Effective August 1, 2015, and forward, if an audited cost report is more than 2 years old, the State will elect to use the mo st recent cost report available as of June 30 for Outpatient Hospital Access Payments. Most recently submitted partial year cost report data will be annualized in the same matter as was used for audited cost report periods as described above. (2) Pediatric Hospitals Effecti ve for claims with dates of service on or after April 1, 1992, outpatient hospital facility services provided at a pediatric hospital will be reimbursed based on reasonable costs with interim payments and a year -end cost settlement. The State will utilize cost data in a manner approved by CMS consistent with the method used for identifying cost for the private hospital access payments. Arkansas Medicaid will use the lesser of the reasonable costs or customary charges to establish cost settlements. Except for graduate medical education costs, the cost settlements will be calculated using the methods and standards used by the Medicare Program. Graduate medical education costs are reimbursed based on Medicare cost rules in effect prior to the September 29, 1989, rule change.

Unless provided otherwise for a specific episode of care, incentive adjustments are made annually in the form of gain sharing (positive incentive adjustments) or provider risk sharing payments to Medicaid (negative incentive adjustm ents), and e qual fifty percent (50% ) of the d ifference between the average adjusted episode expenditures and the applicable threshold as described below. Incentive adjustments will occur no later than ninety (90) days after the end of the performance period. Because the incentiv e adjustments are based on aggregated and averaged claims data for a particular performance period, adjustments cannot be apportioned to specific provider claims. 1. Pos itive Incentive Adjustments : If the PAP's average adjust ed episode pa id claims are lower than the commendable threshold and the PAP meets the quality requirements established by Medicaid for each episode type, Medicaid will remit an incentive adjustment to the PAP equal to the difference between the average adj usted episode reimbursemen t and the commendab le threshold, multiplied by the number of episodes included in the calculation, multiplied by fifty percent ( 50%) or the gain sharing percentage specified for the episode of care. To avoid incentivizing underut ilization, M edicai d may es tablish a gain sharing limit. PAPs with average adjusted episode expenditures lower than the gain sharing limit will receive an incentive adjustment calculated as though the PAP's average adjusted episode of care paid claims equalthe gain s haring limit. 2.Negative Incentive Adjustments : If the average adjusted episode of care paid claims are higher than the acceptable threshold, the PAP will remit to Medicaid the difference between the acceptable threshold and theaverage adjust ed episode r eimbur sement, multiplied by the number of episode s included in the calculation, multiplied by fifty percent ( 50%) or the risk sharing percentage specified for the episode of care. Unless provided otherwise for a specific episode of care, a pro vider's net n egati ve incen tive adjustment (total positive adjustments minus total negative adjustments) for all episodes of care during any performance periodshall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the provider's gross Medicaid reimbursements during that performanceperiod. For Rura l Health Centers (RHCs), the negative incentive ad justment will not result in payment at less than the rate required under the PPS methodology, but Medicaid reserves the right to adjust total reimbursements to RHCs based on appropriate utilization under our u tilization control responsibility to safeguard against unnecessary or inappropriate use of Medicaid services and against excess payments consistent with regulations at 42 CFR Part 456.

Positive Incentive Adjustments : If the PAP's average adjusted episode paid claims are lower than the commendable threshold and the PAP meets the quality requirements established by Medicaid for each episode type, Medicaid will remit an ince ntive ad justment to the PAP equal to the difference between the average adjusted episode reimbursement and the commendable threshold, multiplied by the number of episodes included in the calculation, multiplied by fif ty percent ( 50%) or the gain sharing pe rcentage specifie d for the episode of care. To avoid incentivizing underutilization, Medicaid may establish a gain sharing limit. PAPs with average adjusted episode expenditures lower than the gain sharing limit will receive an incentive adjustment calculated as though t he PAP's average adjusted episode of care paid claims equal the gain sharing limit. 2. Nega tive Incentive Adjustments : If the average adjusted episode of care paid claims are higher than the acceptable threshold, the PAP will remit to Medicaid th e differe nce between the acceptable thr eshold and the average adjusted episode reimbursement, multiplied by the number of episodes included in the calculation, multiplied by fifty percent ( 50%) or the risk sharing percentage specified for the episo de of care. Unle ss provided otherwise for a specific episode of care, a provider's net negative incentive adjustment (total positive adjustments minus total negative adjustments) for all episode of care adjustments made during any calendar year shall not exceed ten percen t (10%) of the provider's gross Medicaid reimbursements received by the provider during that calendar year. 8/31/20TN: 20-0002 APPROVAL: EFFECTIVE: October 01, 2020 SUPERSEDES TN: 17-008 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT ATTACHMENT 4.19 -B MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM Page 1oooo STATE ARKANSAS MET HODS AND STANDARDS FOR ESTABLISHING PAYMENT RATES - OTHER TYPES OF CARE Revised: October 1, 2020 _____________ ___________________________________________________________________________________ The Episodes of Care program will gradually conclude over the two (2) state fiscal years 2020 and 2021.

If there is no applicable rate established by Medicare, the state uses the rate specified in a fee schedule established and announced by CMS. The rates reflec t all Medicare site of service and locality adjustments. The rates do not reflect site of service adjustments, but reimburse at the Medicare rate applicable to the office setting. The rates reflect all Medi care geographic/locality adjustments. Arkansas only has one Medicare rate list for the entire state. The rates are statewide and reflect t he mean value over all counties for each of the specified evaluation and management and vaccine billing codes. The following formula was used to determine the mean rate over all counties for each code:________________________________________________________________ Method of Payment The state has adjusted its fee schedule to make pay ment at the higher rate for each E&M and vaccine administration code. The state reimburses a supplemental amount equal to the difference between the Medicaid rate in effect on July 1, 2009 and the minimum payment required at 42 CFR 447.4 05. Supplemental payment is made: monthly quarterly This fee schedule is based on the November 2012 Deloitte fee schedule. The State does not plan to change rates throughout the year to reflect Medicare adjustments.

Physician Services - Vaccine Administration For calendar years (CYs) 2013 and 2014, the state reimburses vaccine administration services furnished by physicians meeting the requirements of 42 CFR 447.400(a) at the lesser of the state regional maximum administration fee set by the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program or the Medicare rate in effect in CYs 2013 and 2014 or, if higher, the rate using the CY 2009 conversion factor. Medicare Physician Fee Schedule rate State regional maximum administration fee set by the Vaccines for Children program Rate using the CY 2009 conversion factor Documentation of Vaccine Administration Rates in Effect 7/1/09 The state uses one of the following methodologies to impute the payment rate in effect at 7/1/09 for code 90460, which was introduced in 2011 as a successor billing code for billing codes 90465 and 90471. The imputed rate in effect at 7/1/09 for code 90460 equals the rate in effect at 7/1/09 for billing c odes 90465 and 90471 times their respective claims volume for a 12 month period which encompasses July 1, 2009. Using this methodology, the imputed rate in effect for code 90460 at 7/1/09 is:__________. A single rate was in effect on 7/1/09 for all vaccine administration services, regardless of billing code.

Physicians' Services Reimbursement is based on the lesser of the amount billed or the maximum Title XIX (Medica id) charge allowed . Reimbursement rates (payments) shall be as ordered by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas in the case of Arkansas Medical Society v. Reynolds. For dat es of service occurring July 1, 1994 through March 31, 2004, r eimbur sement rates are set at 66% of the Arkansas Physician's Blue CrossBlue Shield (BC BS) Fee Schedule dated October 1, 1993. For dat es of service occurring April 1, 2004 and after: A. Reimb ursement rates are increased by ten percent (10%) up to a ma ximum or benchmark rate of eighty percent (80%) of the 2003 Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield ( BCBS ) fee schedule. For rates that as of March 31, 2004, are equal to or greater than eighty percent (80%) of the 2003 BC BS fee schedule rate, no increase will be given. A minimum rate or floor amount of fo rty-five percent (45%) of the 2003 BC BS fee schedule rate will be reimbursed. For those rates that after the ten percent (10 % ) increase is applied are still less than the floor amount, an add itional increase w ill be given to bring these rates up to the floor amount. B. Reimbu rsement rates are capped at one hundred percent (100% ) of the 2003 BC BS rate. Rates that exceed the cap as of March 31, 2004, shall be reduced i n orde r to bring the rates in line with th e cap by making four equal annual reductions beginning July 1, 2005. C. Adjus tmen ts to payment rates that are comprised of two components, e.g., a professional component and a technical services component, shal l be c alculated based on a combined paym ent rate that includes both components. After determining the increase or decrease app licable to the combined rate, the payment rate adjustment for each rate component shall be apportioned as follows: (1) Incr eases: If one c omponent rate , either technical or professional, exceeds the cap, the entire increase shall be apportioned to the other c omponent. I f neither rate component exceeds the cap, the increase shall be applied in proportion to the component's ratio to the combi ned rate (i.e., if the technical component rate is thirty percent (30%) of the combined rate , then thirty pe rcent (30%) of the increase shall be applied to the technical component payment rate), up to the benchmark.Once a component rate is increased to t he benchmark, any remaining increa se shall be applied to the other component. (2) Decreas es: If one component rate, either technical or professional, is at th e floor, the entire decrease shall be apportioned to the other component. If one component ra te is a bove the cap, the entire decrease s hall be apportioned to that component. If both component rates are above the cap, each component shall be reduced to the cap. D. For date s of service beginning September 2 8, 2006, the maxi mum re imbursement rate for fi tting of spectacles (procedure code 92340) is fifty -one dollars and twenty -two cents ($51.22) .

Eligible professionals are: (i) Physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workeru, psychological examiners, speech therapists, advanced practice nurses, physician assistants, nurse anesthetists' occupational therapists, physical therapists, podiatrists, audiologists, opticians and nutritionists; (ii) Licensed by the State of Arkansas; and (iii) Employed by the UAMS College of Medicine. A supplemental payment will be made for sewices rendered by eligible professionals equal to the difference between the Medicaid payments otherwise made and payments at the Average Commercial Rate. This supplemental payment will, for the same dates of service, be reduced by any other supplemental payment for eligible professionals found elsewhere in the state plan. Payment will be made quarterly and will not be made prior to the delivery of senices. The supplemental payment to eligible professionals will be determined as follows: Compute the Average Commercial Fee Schedule: Determine the average commercial allowed amount paid per procedure code by the top five payeru with negotiated fee schedules. The State will develop separate Average Commercial Fee Schedules for services billed through UAMS, Area health Education Centers (AHECs) and Children's Hospital. Additionally, if there are any differences in payment on a per billing code basis for services rendered by different types of medical professionals, the State will calculate separate Average Commercial Fee Schedule(s) to reflect these differences. The data used to develop the Average Commercial Fee Schedule will be derived from the most recently completed state fiscal year. Calculate the Average Commercial Payment Ceiling: For each quarter of the current fiscal year multiply the Average Commercial Fee Schedule as determined in 5(c)(i) above by the number of times each procedure code was paid in the quarter to eligible professionals on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries as reported from the MMIS. The Average Commercial Payment Ceiling will be calculated separately for services billed through UAMS, Arkansas Children's Hospital and AHECs. If applicable, a separate payment ceiling wilt be set when payment for the same service differs according to the type of professional rendering the senice. The Supplemental Payment shall equal the difference between the Average Commercial Payment Ceiling for the quarter and the total Medicaid payments made for the quarter to eligible professionals for the procedure codes included in the calculation of the Average Commercial Fee Schedule in 5(c)(i) ahove, as reported from the MMIS.(d)STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACTMEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM STATE ARKANSAS METHODS AND STANDARDS FOR ESTABLISHING PAYIVIENT RATES -OTHER TypES OF CARE Revised:ATTACHMENT 5.Physic ians' Serv. ices (continued) Reimbursement for physicians' services for bone marrow transplants is included in the $ 150,000 marimum asdescribed in Attachment 4-19-A.

INCENTIVES TO IMPROVE CARE QUAL ITY, EFFICIENCY, AND ECONOMY I.PUR POSE: In order to assure that Medicaid funds are used to purchase medical assistance efficiently and economically (quality services of the right kind and mix), Medicaid has establ ished a payment improvement initiative (\"Payment Improvement Program,\" or \"Program\"). The Program: 1. Establishes Principle Accountable Providers (\"PAPs\") for defined episodes of care; 2. Uses episode -based data to evaluate the quality, efficiency and economy of care delivered in the course of the episode of care, and to apply incentive adjustments; 3. Incentivizes improved care quality, efficiency and economy by rewarding high -quality care and outcomes; 4. Encourages clinical effectiveness; 5. Promotes early interventio n and c oordinati on to reduce complications and associated costs; and 6. When provider referrals are necessary, encourages referral to efficient and economic providers who furnish high- quality care. Com plete details including technical information regarding specif ic quality a nd reporting metrics, performance thresholds and incentive adjustments are available in the Episodes of Care Medicaid Manual available at https://www. medicai d.state.a r.us/InternetSolution/Provider/docs/docs.aspx and also at the Arkansas Health Care Payment Improvement Initiative website at http://www.paymentinitiative.org/Pages/default.as px.

For registered nurses (RN) and licensed practicalnurses (LPN) the lrull Tirne Equivalent Employees (FTEs) listed on cost report worksheet S-1, Part ll, were used to allocate nursing costs and units of service (visits). lt was necessary to make these allocations because home health agencies are not required by Medicare to separate tlreir registered nurses and licensed practicalnurse costs or visits on the annual cost repoft. RN and LPN salaries and fringes were separated using an Office of Personnel Management Survey, which indicated that RNs, on an average, are paid 36oh nore than licensed practical nurses. Conversely, if RNs are paid 360/o noreth an LPNs, then LPNs are paid, on an average,73.5o/o of what RNs earn. Cost report salaries and fringes were allocated based on 100% of RN FTEs and 73.5% of LPN FTEs. Other costs and service units (visits) were allocated based on 100% of RN FTEs and 100% of LPN FTEs.

For all other DME claims not covered by S ection 1903(i) (27) of th e Social Security Act, rates w ill be set as f ollows. Purchase: The Title XIX maximum for new equip ment is based on Medicare's 1990 DME Fee Schedule. For those items which Medicare did not have a rate, the lowest man ufacturer cost plus 10% was use d. Arkansas Medicaid is following Medicare' s policy of purchasing any item that costs $150.00 or less. Rental or Capped Rental: Capped Rental equipment may not be rented for more than 455 conse cutive days. The r eimbursement rates for capped rental items wi ll be established by dividing the purchase price by 455 days to arrive at a daily rental rate. Once the 4 55 day rental maximum is reached, Arkansas Medicaid will cease to pay rent on the equi pment, however the equipment wil l remain in the recipient' s home as long as determined medically necessary by the recipient 's physician. The equipment will remain the pr operty of the DME company.A provider may bill for maintenance . However, this maintena nce fee may not b e billed until either 182 days have elapsed af ter the 455 day rental period or 182 days have elapsed from the end of the period the item is no longer cov ered under the suppliers or manufacturer 's warranty, whichever is later. Maintenance will continue to be paid at six -month intervals if equipment is determined to be medically necessary. Reimbursement of the maintenance is the lesser of the amount billed or the Title XIX maximum. The Title XIX maximum was established by arraying all the Title XIX monthly maximums for c apped rental items and utilizin g the 50 th percentile. For those items which are rental only , the Medicare 1990 DME Fee Schedule monthly re ntal rate was used to calculate the Medicaid daily rental rate. The Medicare monthly rental rate was multiplied by 12 to determine the one -year rental amount and divided by 365 to arrive at the Medicaid daily rental amount.

Clinic S ervices (1) Adult Developmental Day Treatment (ADDT) and Early Intervention Day Treatment (EIDT) Reimb ursement for comprehensive evalu ation services is based on the lesser of the amount billed or the maximum Title XIX (Medicaid) charge allowed. The Title XIX maximum was established based on a 1980 survey conducted by Developmental Disabilities Services (DDS) of 85 Arkansas Developmental Day Treatment providers of their operational costs excluding their therapy services. An average operational cos t and average number of units were derived for each service. The a verage operatio nal cost for each service was div ided by the average units for that particula r service to arrive at a maximum rate. For d ates of service occurring on or after January 1, 2020, the maximum per unit rate for Adult day habilitatio n services increased to$11.77 . These new rates were calculated based on analysis of the current 2019 -2020 costs to provide quality services in compliance with governing regulations. The rates have been demonstrated to be consistent with the Clinic Upper Payment Limit at 42 CFR 447.321. For ADDT day habilitation services , there is a maximum of 5 hours of services per day. For EID T, auditory, developmental and neuropsychological testing services listed in the 1990 Blue Cross/Blue Shield Fee Schedule that are not subject t o the other spe cifically identified reimbursement criteria are reimbursed based on 80% of the October 1990 Blue Cross/Blue Shield Fee Schedule am ounts. For those services that were not included on the October 1990 Blue Cross/Blue Shield Fe e Schedule, r ates are estab lished per the most current Blue Cross/Blue Shield Fee Schedule amount less 2. 5% and then multiplied by 66%.

Medicaid will follow Medicare procedure code updates. Effective July 1, 2015 Act 1236 as amended by the 2015 Ar kansas General Assembly adjusted reimbursement for Ambulatory Surgery Centers to 95% of the Medicare Ambulatory Surgery Center procedure codes reimbursement rates. Also in accordance with this amendment Medicaid may adopt and assign a CPT code for a compar able procedure (if the procedure code is not listed on the Medicare ASC procedure code listing) only if the code was approved by Medicaid before the procedure was performed. In accordance with the Act, Implantable Devices which are not bundled as part of the appropriate procedure code will be reimbursed at a pass- through cost; if the combined documented cost of the appropriate implantable devices is greater than 50% of the appropriate Medicaid maximum procedure code reimbursement rate. If multiple devices are included for one patient, then the total provided devices' cost is calculated and then compared to the appropriate procedure code. The implantable devices' reimbursement provision is also effective for dates of service beginning July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2015 .

The Medicaid maximum is based on the 50 th percentile of the Arkansas Medicare facility rates in effect March 1, 1988. Rates will be reviewed annu ally. After discussion with CMS , it was determined that the Arkansas Medicare 75th percentile is considered the norm for Arkansas Medicare reimbursement. Since the State reimburses at Arkansas Medicare's 50th percentile, the reimbursement rates will not exceed Arkansas Medicare on the aggregate. Effective for claims with dates of service on or after July 1, 1992, the Title XIX maximum rates were decreased by 20%. Effective for dates of service on and after October 1, 2004, the Arkansas Medicaid Program covers training in peritoneal self -dialysis for beneficiaries with end -stage renal disease. Reimbursement for peritoneal self -dialysis and training has been established as follows. The Arkansas Medicaid maximum allowable daily fee for training in con tinuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) equals the maximum allowable daily fee ($130) for a hemodialysis treatment plus $12.00 per day. This is the same methodology used by Medicare to calculate their CAPD training reimbursement rate. The Arkansas Medicaid maximum allowable daily fee for training in continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) equals the maximum allowable daily fee ($130) for a hemodialysis treatment plus $20.00 per day. This is the same methodology used by Medicare to calculate t heir CCPD training reimbursement rate. 10. Dental Services Refer to Attachment 4.19 -B, Item 4.b.(18).

INCENTIVES TO IMPROVE CA RE QUAL ITY, EFFI CIENCY, AND ECONOMY I.PUR POSE: In order to assure that Medicaid funds are used to purchase medical assistance efficiently and economically (quality services of the right kind and mix), Medicaid has established a payment improvement initiative ( \"Payment Improvement Program,\" or \"Program\"). The Program: 1. Establishes Principle Accountable Providers (\"PAPs\") for defined episodes of care; 2. Uses episode -based data to evaluate the quality, efficiency and economy of care delivered in the course of the ep isode of car e, and to apply incentive adjustments; 3. Incentivizes improved care quality, efficiency and economy by rewarding high -quality care and outcomes; 4. Encourages clinical effectiveness; 5. Promotes early intervention and coordination to reduce comp licatio ns and as sociated costs; and 6. When provider referrals are necessary, encourages referral to efficient and economic providers who furnish high- quality care. Complete details including technical information regarding specific quality and reporting me trics, performance thresholds and incentive adjustments are available in the Episodes of Care Medicaid Manual available at https://www.medicaid.state.ar.us/InternetSolution/Pro vider/doc s/docs.aspx and also at the Arkansas Health Care Payment Improvement Initiative website at http://www.paymentinitiative.org/Pages/default.aspx .

Pos itive Incentive Adjustments : If the PAP's average adjusted episode paid claims are lower than the commendable threshold and the PAP meets the quality requirements est ablished by Medicaid for each episode type, Medicaid will remit an incentive adjustment to the PAP equal to the difference between the average adjusted episode reimbursement and the commendable threshold, multiplied by the number of episodes included in th e calculation, multiplied by fifty percent ( 50%) or the gain sharing percentage specified for the episode of care. To avoid incentivizing underutilization, Medicaid may establish a gain sharing limit. PAPs with average adjusted episode e xpenditures lower than the gain sharing limit will receive an incentive adjustment calculated as though the PAP's average adjusted episode of care paid claims equal thegain sharing limit. 2. Nega tive Incentive Adjustments : If the average adjusted episode of care paid clai ms are higher than the acceptable threshold, the PAP will remit to Medicaid the difference between the acceptable threshold and the average adjusted episode reimbursement, multiplied by the number of episodes included in the calculation, multiplied by fif ty percent ( 50%) or the risk shar ing percentage specified for the episode of care. Unless provided otherwise for a specific episode of care, a provider's net negative incentive adjustment (total positive adjustments minus total negativeadjustments) for a ll episode of care adjustments made during any calendar year shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the provider's gross Medicaid reimbursements received by the providerduring that calendar year. 8/31/20TN: 20-0002 APPROVAL: EFFECTIVE: October SUPERSEDES TN: 17-008 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT ATTACHMENT 4.19 -B MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM Page 5(3) STATE ARKANSAS MET HODS AND STANDARDS FOR ESTABLISHING PAYMENT RATES - OTHER TYPES OF CARE Revised: October 1, 2020 ______________ _________________________________________________________________________________ The Episodes of Care program will gradually conclude over the two (2) state fiscal years 2020 and 2021.

For self-directed personal assistance services unde r 1915(j) (see Supplement 4 to Attachment 3.1- A for a full description) the rate will be determined as follows: Ark ansas's methodology for determining the participant's budget is based on the assessment of needs for the participant and the development of the service plan. The cost of providing the services included in the service plan is calculated based on the expected reimbursement for personal care under the state plan referenced in Supplement 4 to Attachment 3.1-A, Page 1, and are adjusted to account for the self -directed service delivery model. Based on historical utilization patterns and differences in set -up and oversight, the State will use an adjustment factor of 73.0% of the expected waiver/state plan service reimbursement to calculate the participant's service budget for self - directed personal assistance XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT ATTACHMENT 4.19 -B MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM Page 16 STATE ARKANSAS METHODS AND STANDARDS FOR ESTABLISHING PAYMENT RATES - OTHER TYPES OF CARE J anuary 1, 2014 ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 29.

Other Provider-Preventable Conditions The State identifies the following Other Provider-Preventable Conditions for non-payment under Section 4.19 (D) of this State plan. X Wrong surgical or other invasive procedure performed on a patient; surgical or other invasive procedure performed on the wrong body part; surgical or other invasive procedure performed on the wrong patient. _____ Additional Other Provider-Preventable Conditions identified below: No payment shall be made for services for the Other Preventable Conditions (OPPCs). OPPC is one category of Provider Preventable Conditions (PPC), as identified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid services, and applies broadly to any health care setting where an OPPC may occur. OPPCs include the three Medicare National Coverage Determinations; wrong surgical or other invasive procedure performed on a patient; surgical or other invasive procedure performed on the wrong body part; and surgical or other invasive procedure performed on the wrong patient. No reduction in payment for a provider-preventable condition will be imposed on a provider when the condition defined as a PPC for a particular patient existed prior to the initiation of treatment for that patient by that provider. Reductions in provider payment may be limited to the extent that the following apply: i. The identified provider-preventable conditions would otherwise result in an increase in payment. ii. The State can reasonably isolate for nonpayment the portion of the payment directly related to treatment for, and related to, the provider-preventable conditions. Non-payment of provider-preventable conditions shall not prevent access to services for Medicaid beneficiaries.

(A) An'6entity\" includes a goyernmental agency, organization, unit, corporation, partnershipr or other business arrangement (including any Medicaid managed care organization, irrespective of the form of business structure or arrangement by which it exists)' whether for- profit or not-for-profit, which receives or makes payments, under a State Plan approved under title XIX or under any waiver of such plan, totaling at least $5'0001000 annually. If an entity furnishes items or services at more than a single location or under more than one contractual or other payment arrangement, the provisions of section 1902(a)(68) apply if the aggregate payments to that entity meet the $5,000,000 annual threshold. This applies whether the entity submits claims for payments using one or more provider identification or tax identification numbers. A governmental component providing Medicaid health care items or services for which Medicaid payments are made would qualify as an ('entitytt (e.g., a state mental rrr - TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State/Territory: ABE$$!$ health facility or school district providing school-based health services). A government agency which merely administers the Medicaid program, in whole or part (e.g., managing the claims processing system or determining beneficiary eligibility), is not, for these purposes' considered to be an entity. An entity will have met the $5,0001000 annual threshold as of January 112007, if it received or made payments in that amount in Federal fiscal year 2006. Future determinations regarding an entity's responsibility stemming from the requirements of section 1902(a)(68) will be made by January I ofeach subsequentyear, based upon the amount of payments an entity either received or made under the State Plan during the preceding Federal fiscal year. (B) An \"employee\" includes any oflicer or employee of the entity. (C) A ttcontractort'or \"agent\" includes any contractor, subcontractor, agent, or other person which or who, on behalf of the entity, furnishes, or otherwise authorizes the furnishing of, Medicaid health care items or services, performs billing or coding functions, or is involved in the monitoring of health care provided by the entity. (2) The entity must establish and disseminate written policies which must also be adopted by its contractors or agents. Written policies may be on paper or in electronic form, but must be readily available to all employees' contractors, or agents. The entity need not create an employee handbook if none already exists. i DArE REC^*-kaL-Jr-- | ^ iDArgAppv'r,-5-:l-6;\u20ac--- Date: i- / -O'7Section 6032 State Plan Preprint Page 3 of3 STATE PLAN UNDER TITLE XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT State/Territorv: ARKANSAS (3) An entity shall establish written policies for all employees (including management), and of any contractor or agent of the entity, that include detailed information about the False Claims Act and the other provisions named in section 1902(a)(68XA).

The manual contains procedures to be used by each provider in accounting for its operations and in reporting the cost of care and services to the Department of Human Services. The Long Term Care Program is administered by the Division of Medical Services. The program herein adopted is in accordance with Federal Statute in the Social Security Act \u00a7 1902 (a) (13) (A) and Public Law 105- 33. The applicable Federal Regulations begin at 42 Code of Federal Regulations \u00a7 430. Each Long Term Care Facility which has contractually agreed to participatein the Title XIX Program will adopt the pro cedures set forth in this manual and must file the required cost reports. As interpretations and changes of this program are made, appropriate revisions of the manual will be furnished to each provider and interested party. Care should be taken to insure that revisions to the manual are promptly inserted. Ques tions relating to this program or relating to the interpretation of any of the provisions included in this manual should be addressed to: Depar tment of Human Services Division of Medical Services P.

Allowable costs are those costs necessary and reasonable for performance of covered services required by Medicaid recipients. A facility's direct and indirect allowable costs related to covered services will be considered in the findings and allocation of costs to the Medical Assistance Program for its eligible recipients. Total allowable, reasonable costs after removal of direct Me dicare ancillary cost of a facility shall be apportioned on a per resident day basis between third-party payers and other residents so that the share borne by Medicaid under Title XIX is based upon actual services and costs related to Medical Assistance recipients. Costs included in the per diem rate will be those necessary to be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities to comply with all requirements of participation in the Medicaid program. 1-2 Record Keeping Providers are required to maintain adequate financial records and statistical data for proper determination of costs payable under the program. The cost report is to be based on financial and statistical records maintained by the facility. Cost information must be current, accurate and in sufficient detail to support costs set forth in the report. This includes all ledgers, books, records, and original evidence of cost (purchase requisitions for supplies, invoices, paid checks, inventories, time cards, payrolls, bases for apportioning costs, etc.) which pertain to the determination of reasonable costs. A provider must make available (within the state) all financial and statistical records to the Department or its representatives for the purpose of determining compliance with the provisions of this program. Providers who find it difficult to provide home office records at the audit or review site can at their option, reimburse the Department for all costs associated with the travel of Department employees or their representatives in accordance with state laws and rules for the reimbursement of travel for state employees. The Financial and Statistical Report/Cost Report and Schedules sets forth information to be reported. The report must be prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with instructions for completion of the Cost Report. Government facilities have the option to use the cash basis of accounting for reporting. All financial and statistical records, including cost reports, must be retained for a period of five years after submission to the Department. Revised 01/01/17 1-2 1-3 Activities Not Related to Resident Care If the provider conducts activities not related to resident care, additional accounts must be added to accommodate those activities. 1-4 Accrual and Cash B asis of Accounting For non-governmental providers, the Financial and Statistical Report must be filed using information stated on the accrual method of accounting. The Chart of Accounts is designed to be used in a complete accrual accounting system. Financial information stated on an accrual basis is essential to insure that the proper reimbursement is made to providers. The measurement of the cost of services performed must include all supplies, salaries, services and other expenses incurred, regardles s of whether or not those items have been paid. Many providers will find that the accounting for all transactions on a pure accrual basis may create undue workloads. Also, many providers account for their activities on a strict cash basis and they are satisfied with the management information produced from their existing system. Therefore, in lieu of accounting for all transactions on an accrual basis, the provider may maintain his records on a cash basis during the year and convert to an accrual basis at the beginning and end of the year for reporting purposes. 1-5 Chart of Accounts The applicable Chart of Accounts shall be used by all Long Term Care Facilities participating in the Title XIX Program. Each Chart of Accounts provides for the basic classifications of all assets, liabilities, income and expense necessary for the preparation of the Cost Report. Providers may take some latitude in assigning account numbers but must maintain the basic Chart of Accounts. 1-6 Cost Reporting Requirements All providers in operation under a valid Medicaid agreement for long term care services must file a Financial and Statistical Report (commonly referred to as a Cost Report or FSR). In addition to the annual reporting requirement nursing facilities will be required to submit a limited cost report containing direct care cost information for the period January 12, 2001 to June 30, 2001, in order that the direct care per diem can be rebased after this initial period. Nursing facilities that have been newly constructed or a newly enrolled provider that did not previously participate in Medicaid, will be required to prepare and submit a cost report for the period beginning their first day of operation through the end of the month which includes their sixth month of operation. This report is essential in establishing rates for a new provider. If the facility was not certified for Medicaid participation at date of first Attachment 4.19 -D Revised 2, 2022 opening or acquisition, then the reporting period shall begin a t official certification d ate rather than the date of acquisition. Nursing Facilities that are newly purchased or leased shall submit a cost report for the period beginning with their first day of operation through the end the State Fiscal Year unless the cost reporting period would be less than three months of operation. Facilities that change ownership after April 1 of a State Fiscal Yea r would not submit a cost report from the date of initial operation to the end of the State Fiscal Year. Facilities ch anging ownership after Apr il 1 o f a State Fiscal Year will prepare and submit a cost report for the period beginning their first day of operation through the end of the month which includes the ir sixth month of operation. A. When To File Nursing facilities will report cost on a f iscal year ending June 30. Cost reports will be due within ninety ( 90) days after the end of the reporting period. Under sixteen ( 16) Bed ICF/IID providers will report cost on a calendar year basis. The cost report will be due within ninety ( 90) days of the end of the reporting period. The Arkansas Health Center Nursing Facility and the s ixteen ( 16) bed and ove r ICF/IID providers will report cost semi -annually (January 1 - June 30) and (July 1 - December 31) with the cost reports being due withi n sixty (60) days of the end of the reporting period . Should the due date fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or State of Arkansas holiday or federal holiday, the due date shall be t he following business day. Nursing Facility cost reports are to be electronical ly submitted through the LTC cost r eport web application on or before the applicable due date. ICF/IID reports are to b e delivered , postmarked or electronically uploaded , to the web portal on or before the appli cable due date. Providers who fail to submit cost reports and other required schedules and information by the due date or extended due date have committed a Class D Violation of Arkansas Code 20-10-205. Civil penalties associated with failure to timely s ubmit a cost report for L ong Term Care Facilities are detailed in Section 1 -11 of this Manual. B. Extensions for Filing If a written request for an extension is received by the Di vision of Medical Services in advance o f the report due date and a written extension is granted, a penalty will not be applied, provided the extended due date is met. Each request for extension will be considered on its merit. No extensi on will be granted unless the facility provid es written evidence of extenuating circumstances beyond its control, which causes a late report. In no instance will an extension be granted for more than thirty (30 ) days. C. What to Submit In additi on to the applicable cost report forms, providers must submi t the following: 1. Most recently completed Medicare Cost Report, 2. Working trial balance and related working papers identifying the cost report line each account is i ncluded on, 3. Detailed depreciat ion schedule, 4. Any work papers used to compute adju stments made on the cost report, Attachment 4.19-D 99 -009 5. A copy of any new or amended contracts for management services by a related party, home office or a third party which includes the basis used to allocate the costs to providers of the group and to non-provider activities,if applicable. 6. Copy of new or amended lease agreement if a leased facility. When it is determined, upon initial review for completeness by the Division of Medical Services , that a cost report has been submitted without all required information, providers will be allowed a specifiedamount of time to submit the requested information without incurring thepenalty for a delinquent cost report. For cost reports which are submittedby the due date, ten (10) working days from the date of the provider'sreceipt of therequest for additional information will be allowed for the provider tosubmit the additional information. For cost reports which are submittedby an extended due date, five (5) working days from the date of theprovider's receipt of the request for additional information will be allowedfor the provider to submit the additional information. If requestedadditional information has not been submitted by the specified date, thecost report will be subject to the penalty provisions for delinquentsubmission. An exception exists in the event that the due date (orextended due date when an extension has been granted) comes after thespecified number of days for submission of the requested information. Inthese cases, the provider will be allowed to submit the additional requestedinformation on or before the due date (or extended due date if an extensionhas been granted) of the cost report. D. Where to Submit Nursi ng facility cost reports and additional information should be submitted through the LTC cost report web application. ICF/IID cost reports andadditional information may be submitted to the address below or uploaded tothe contractor's web portal. Arkans as Department of Human Se rvices Division of Medical Services P. O. Box 1437 - Slot S535 Little Rock, AR 72203-1437 E. Amende d Cost Reports Provide rs can submit amended cost reports to the Department up to one hundred, eighty ( 180) days after the close of the cost reporting peri od. August 2, 2022 1-5 1-7 Desk Reviews The Department will review all cost reports to verify that all facilities have submitted reports properly and in compliance with this manual. Providers will be notified in writing of the results of the desk review. A provider's cost report can be adjusted for any errors or unallowable costs identified on a provider's cost report after the initial desk review has been completed up to the last day of the rate year for which rates are based on the adjusted cost report. Financial and Statistical Reports, financial records, statistical records, and any other pertinent documents will be analyzed to verify that: A. Cost reports are complete, accurate, and consistent with previous periods and in compliance with program policy. B. The allowable costs are necessary, allocable, and reasonable for the performance of covered services required by Medicaid recipients. C. The costs are authorized and are not prohibited under Federal and State laws and regulations. D. The costs are accorded consistent treatment through the application of accounting principles and practices appropriate to the circumstances. E. The costs are related to resident care. F. The costs and statistics included in the Financial and Statistical Report are accurate and applicable to the current period. G. The costs are net of all applicable credits. 1-8 Audits of Financial Records The Department will provide for periodic audits of some or all cost reports and supporting records. The Department may also conduct limited reviews of cost data and/or client statistics reported in the cost rep orts. The auditors will issue a report upon completion of each audit or review. The report will reflect cost and statistical information as submitted in the cost report and any adjustments the auditors recommend, such that the information complies with t he criteria listed above. All audit reports will state the auditor's opinion as to whether, in all material respects, the cost information reported on the Schedule of Expenses (DHS 750, Form 5 or DOM 400, Form 6) and total actual resident days reported on the Statistical Data Schedule (DHS 1-6 750, Form 2 or DOM 400, Form 3), with audit adjustments, is presented fairly and in compliance with program policy and regulations. 1-9 Unauditable Situations If a facility is unable or unwilling to provide necessary documentation to support the financial or statistical records contained in their cost report, the auditors will issue a \"disclaimer\" report signifying that the audit could not be accomplished. The Office of Long Term Care will advise the facility of the d isclaimer in writing. A period of 90 days from the date of the letter of notification will be allowed to permit the facility to accumulate necessary documentation. A follow -up audit will be attempted upon expiration of the 90 day period or sooner if requested by the facility. If the audit can not be completed on the second attempt, the facility will be advised, in writing, that their agreement to participate in the Medicaid program will be terminated effective immediately. A period of 30 days from the date of such notification will be allowed to permit the orderly relocation of Medicaid recipients. The appeals procedures specified in Section 1 -10 of this Manual are available to providers. 1-10 Appeal Procedures A. Time Limit for Appeals 1. Any Long Term Care Facility may appeal the facility's reimbursement rate, a recoupment, a cost disallowance, a fine, a sanction, the imposition of a civil money penalty or suspension or termination from the program, by submitting a written notice of appeal to the Director of the Department of Human Services within thirty calendar days following the date of the appealed action. The appeal must clearly state the basis for appeal and must be accompanied by supporting documentation. If the facility wishes to utilize the \"MEDIATION PROCESS\" as contained in this section, it must so state in its written Notice of Appeal. 2. If an appeal is filed the DHS Director or his designee will appoint an independent hearing officer to hear the appeal. The hearing officer will schedu le all appeals within 60 days of receipt of written notice of appeal by the Division and will notify the parties in writing of the hearing schedule. Provided that if the appealing facility states in its written Notice of Appeal that it wishes to utilize the \"MEDIATION PROCESSES\" and the department agrees, then the time for the DHS Director or his designee to appoint a Hearing Officer is waived. However, the appealing facility and the DHS Director or his designee shall implement the mediation process within the sixty days. Upon the termination of the mediation process, if any dispute stated in the notice of appeal remains unresolved, 1-7 the DHS Director or his designee will appoint the Independent Hearing Officer within sixty days of the termination. The hearing officer will set a discovery schedule if requested by either party. Either party may request a continuance for good cause. The hearing officer may grant a continuance for good cause upon motion of either party or on the hearing officer's own motion . The hearing officer will render a written decision within 30 days of the hearing and furnish a copy of the decision to the parties or their representatives. Any objection requesting disqualification of the hearing officer upon allegations of personal interest or bias must be made in writing, supported by good faith affidavit, and submitted to the DHS Director at least fifteen days before the scheduled hearing. The DHS Director will consider the objection promptly and rule on it in a timely manner. B. Administration of Appeal 1. The appellant may be present at the hearing, may be represented by counsel, and may call witnesses. DHS may appear by such officials as the Division may deem necessary, may be represented by counsel, and may call witnesses. 2. All testimony shall be under oath. Each party shall have the right to call and examine parties and witnesses; to introduce exhibits; to question opposing witnesses and parties on any matter relevant to the issue; and to rebut opposing evidence. The appellant shall have the burden of proving whatever facts it must establish to sustain its position by a preponderance of the evidence. 3. The Hearing Officer shall conduct himself in an impartial manner, and may question any party or witness at any time during the hearing. C. Decisions 1. All decisions rendered shall be submitted by the Hearing Officer in writing to the Director, DHS, for his review and final determination.

All decisions by the Hearing Officer and the Director shall contain findings of fact and law in accordance with applicable State and Federal laws and regulations. The final decision shall be rendered in writing to the appellant. 1-8 D. Mediation Process 1. If a long term care facility in its written Notice of Appeal states it desires to utilize the mediation process in attempt to resolve the dispute(s) between the facility and the DHS as stated in the notice of appeal, and the DHS agrees to the mediation process, then mediation shall be utilized to clarify, narrow or resolve the dispute(s). The DHS shall maintain a list of mediators supplied by the Arkansas Commission on Alternative Dispute Resolution Commission. The objective of the mediation process is to help each side in the dispute(s) understand the other's point of view, with a goal of narrowing, clarifying, or resolving issues in dispute. If the dispute(s) is/are resolved as a result of mediation, then a written statement signed by both parties will be filed with the DHS Director or his designee, shall substitute for a decision in the case, and shall not be appealable. 2. The Chief Counsel's Office of the Department of Human Services shall submit a list of available mediators from which a mediator agreed to by both parties will be selected. The mediator shall restrict his discussions to the designated representatives of the appealing facility and the designated representative of the Department. Designated representatives include each party's attorneys. The mediation shall not bind the parties. The mediation shall not add anything to the record except a final written agreement. The parties may add to the record, but only to the extent they both agree. The mediation shall not unduly delay the process of a case. Time limits for appointing a Hearing Officer and a decision shall be temporarily suspended during the mediation. The medi ator shall insure the parties are continuing to work towards resolution of the dispute. The negotiations shall be confidential and shall not be communicated to any decision makers who may serve as future Hearing Officers. If the mediation fails to produce and agreement, or if mediation is not proceeding toward resolving the dispute, then the mediator or either party may so notify the DHS Director or his designee. The DHS Director or his designee will terminate the mediationm whereupon the appeal will proceed as outlined in this Section. 3. The appealing facility and the Department of Human Services shall equally share the cost of the mediator's fee. 1-9 1-11 Penalties for Failure to Comply with the Medicaid Long Term Care Program A. By agreeing to partici pate in the Long Term Care program, providers must abide by these regulations. Participation in the program may be terminated should the provider: 1. Fail to keep and maintain auditable records. 2. Fail to disclose or make available to the Department, or its authorized agent, records concerning the operation of the facility, including home office records, if applicable. 3. Breach the terms of the Medicaid Provider Agreement or failure to comply with the terms of the provider's certifications set out on t he Medicaid claim form. 4. Charge or attempt to charge Medicaid recipients for Medicaid covered services over and above that paid by the Department. 5. Rebate or accept a fee or portion of a fee or charge for a Medicaid resident referral. 6. Present , or cause to be presented, false information. 7. Submit, or cause to be submitted, false information for the purpose of obtaining greater compensation to which the provider is legally entitled. In addition to the above listing of causes for terminat ion, State or Federal laws or rules may create requirements, the violation of which may cause adverse action. B. Arkansas Code 20-10- 205 classifies violations relating to the administration of Long Term Care Facilities. Administrative and reporting requ irements are classified as Class C and Class D Violations. A description of each follows: Class C Violations: Providers who fail to comply with administrative and reporting requirements that do not directly threaten the health, safety, or welfare of a re sident have committed a Class C Violation. Violations of this nature would include but are not limited to: 1. Failure to provide resident assessment instruments in accordance with the prescribed submission policy. The resident assessment instrument must be complete to be considered submitted. 2. Failure to maintain accurate census records in accordance with this Manual. 1-10 3. Failure to maintain accurate resident trust fund records in accordance with this Manual. 4. Submission on the facility's Cost Report as allowable, costs determined by the DHS audit staff to have been claimed under circumstances identical in all material respects to costs that have been disallowed by final desk review or audit. A desk review or audit is final if no timely appeal has been filed, or, if a timely appeal has been filed, there is a final appeal decision disallowing the cost. An appeal decision is final if no additional appeal is provided for by law, or if the time to file an additional appeal has expired. Any facility submitting as allowable costs, costs previously disallowed by a desk review or audit decision that is not final must identify each such cost and reference the pending appeal. Class C Violations are subject to a civil money penalty to be set by the DHS Dir ector or his designee, in an amount not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) for a single violation. A single erroneous administrative or reporting practice will be considered a single violation regardless of the number of resident records affected by the practice. Class D Violation: Failure to timely submit the Cost Report for Long Term Care Facilities. Cost Reports must be postmarked on or before the due date or the extended due date in order to avoid a penalty. The failure to timely submit a cost report shall be considered a separate Class D Violation during any month or part thereof of non-compliance. Class D Violations are subject to a civil money penalty to be set by the Director, DHS, or his designee, in an amount not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for each violation. In addition to any civil money penalty which may be imposed, the Director of the OLTC is authorized after the first month of a Class D Violation to withhold any further reimbursement to the Long Term Care Faci lity until the Cost Report is received by the Office of Long Term Care. Any violation repeated within six months subjects the facility to double civil money penalties up to a maximum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation. Assessment of civi l money penalties does not limit the right of the OLTC to take such other action as may be authorized by law or regulation. Providers violating this section may be referred to the Attorney General's office. 1-11 1-12 Overpayments and Underpayments Administr ative errors on the part of the Division or the Facilities may result in erroneous payments. These errors most commonly result from: failures to report a death, discharge, or transfer; system error in resident classification; and miscalculations of recip ient incomes. Overpayments/Underpayments resulting from these errors will be corrected when discovered. Overpayments will be recouped by the Division and underpayments will be reimbursed to the Facility. Revised 07/01/01 2- 1 Chapter 2 - Payment Method Federal law requires that states use published payment methodologies and justifications which specify comprehensively the methods and standards for making Medicaid provider payments to long term care facilities. 2-1 Assurance of Payment Certified Title XIX Long Term Care Facilities furnishing services in accordance with all state and federal Medicaid laws and rules will be paid in accordance with rates established under the state Medicaid plan. 2-2 Acceptance of Payment Participation in the Title XIX Program is limited to those Facilities which agree to accept the Medicaid payment as payment in full for all care services provided to Medicaid recipients. 2-3 Rate Limitations Based on Medicaid Rates The purpose of this provision is to assure that the Medicaid program is not charged unfairly high rates as compared to other payers. To that end, Medicaid reimbursement is limited by the weighted average per diem rates charged to other payers. Specifically if a long -term care facility charges other long -term care payers l ess than 80% of the Medicaid rate for long- term care services, (except for those public facilities rendering long- term care services free of charge or at a nominal charge) then the weighted average Medicaid reimbursement will be reduced to no more than 125% of the facility's weighted average reimbursement. For purposes of applying this rule: (1) Weighted average per diem rates for other payers will be compared to the weighted average Medicaid per diem rates by fiscal year; (2) The 60 consecutive days after a Medicaid rate increase shall not be considered; and (3) No facility shall be required to make a retroactive rate adjustment. 2-4 Facility Class The Department has established the following specific payment methods: Attachment 4.19-D Revised Reimb ursement rates for nursing facilities will be cost-based, facility -specific rates that will consist of four (4) major cost components and will be determined in the following way. Reimburseme nt rates will be determined by adding calculated per diem amounts for four (4) separate components of cost: Direct Care, Indirect, Administrative and Operating, Fair Market Rental, and the QualityAssurance Fee. This cost data for calculating these per di ems will be taken from desk reviewed cost reports submitted by providers inaccordance with these regulations. Only full- year cost reports will be used in establishing cost ceilings and class rates. Cost reports that are submitted because of changes of ownership, whether via purchase or lease,will be used for calculating the facility's individual rate components butwill not be used in calculating the direct care ceiling or the indirect,administrative , and operating class rate. The methodology for calc ulating the per diem amounts for each component of cost is provided below: A.Direct Care Direct care per diem cost shall be calculated from the facility's actual allo wable Medicaid cost as reported on the facility's cost report. The direct care per diem cost is subject to a ceiling. The cei ling shall be established at one hundred five percent ( 105% ) of the allowable Medicaid direct care cost per diem incurred by the facility at the ninetieth ( 90th) percentile of arrayed Medicaid direct care 2, 4.19-D 04 -016 The direct care component of the rate will rebase annually for the period July 1st to June 30th. An inflation index (see Section A. 6.) will be applied to the provider's direct care per diem cost to inflate cost from the cost reporting period to the rate period. B. Indir ect, Administrative, and Operating The per diem payment for this component will be set at one hundred ten percent ( 110% ) of the median indirect, administrative, and operating per diem cost adjusted for inflation using the inflation index (see Section A. 6.) and paid as a class rate to all facilities. This perdiem payment will be rebased annually . C.Fair Market Rental A fair rental system will be used to reimburse property costs. The fair rental system reduces the w ide disparity in the cost of property payments for basically the same service therefore making this paymentfairer to all participants in the program. The fair market rental systemwill be used in lieu of actual cost and/or lease payments on land,buildings, fixed equipment, and major movable equipment used inproviding resident care. The fair rental payment for facilities that areleased from a related party will be calculated from the costs associatedwith the related party in conformity with related party regulations. The pa yment for provider property cost will be calculated annually by adding the return on equity, facility rental factor, and the cost ofownership, and dividing the sum of these three components by thegreater of the actual resident days or resident days calculated at the following occupancy levels. The minimum occupancy percentage forthe SFY 2022 cost reporting period and applicable to the CY 2023 rate year shall be sixty percent (60%). Thereafter, the minimumoccupancy percentage shall increase as indicted in the followingtable , up to a maximum of seventy- five percent (75%). Cost Report Rate % Occupancy Period Period SFY 2022 SFY 2023 60% SFY 2023 SF Y 2024 SFY 2026 SFY 75% & after & 2, 4.19 2022 Resident days at the minimum occupancy leve l are calculated as: Total Licensed Beds x Number of Days in the Period x Minimum Occupancy Percentage. 1. Return on Equity The return on equity porti on of the fair market re ntal payment will be calculated by taking the Current Asset Value (CAV ) of a facility less the ending loan balance on any loans used to finance fixed assets or ma jor movable equipment, times the sum of the average Mo ody's Seasoned Baa Corporate Bond Yield for the month of June in t he appli cable cost reporting pe riod plus one and a half percent (1.5% ) as a risk premium. For purposes of calculatin g return on equ ity and determining allowable interest expense, allowa ble debt cannot exceed the facilities Curren t Asset Value. The maximu m rate used for calculating return on equity will be ten percent ( 10%). The Current Asset Value (CAV) of a f acility is calc ulated by multiplying the number of beds in a facility by the Per Bed Valuation (PBV) less an aging index of one percent ( 1%) for each year of age, not to exceed a fi fty percent ( 50%) reduction in PBV. A facil ity will be considered new the cost reporting period in which the facility is licensed . A facility will be considered one year ol d the following cost reporting period. The CAV of a facility will be recalculated and an appropriate adjustment to the per di em will be made when additional beds are placed in operation. Beginning wit h the CY 2 023 rate year and based on the Base PBV for the SFY cost reporting period , the PBV methodology shall differentially apply PBV amounts according to the class of resident room where a licensed bed is located . Attachment 4.19-D Revised TN: New Class A Resident Room Criteria for Class A Room PBV Applicable to Each Licensed Bed in a Class A Room A private, single occupancy resident bedroom. Maximum of one licensed bed per room. Each Class A private room shall have an attached private bathroom , or an attached private bathroom shared with one adjoining private resident room. A Class A room must meet minimum space and other standards for private rooms and attached private bathrooms as set in Department regulations for a licensed SNF. Base PBV (full PBV) for the SFY 2022 cost reporting period and applicable to the CY 2023 rate year is $ 196,977. Upd ated annually as Base PBV is updated for increases in the construction index. Class B Resident Room Criteria for Class B Room PBV Applicable to Each License d Bed in a Class B Room A semi -private, double occupancy resident bedroom. Maximum of two licensed beds per Class B room. Each Class B room shall have an attached private bathroom , or an attached private bathroom shared with one adjoining private or semi-private resident room. A Class B room must meet minimum space and other standards for semi - private rooms and attached private bathrooms as set in Department regulations for a licensed SNF. Base PBV (full PBV) for the SFY 2022 cost reporting period and applicable to the CY 2023 rate year is $ 140,594. Upd ated annually as Base PBV is updated for increases in the construction index. August 2, 2022Attachment 4.19-D Revised TN: New Class C Resident Room Criteria for Class C Room PBV Applicable to Each Licensed Bed in a Class C Room A Class C room is any resident room that does not meet the criteria for a Class A room or Class B room. Maximum of two licensed beds per Class C room. For example, a Class C room includes any private or semi- private room lacking an attached private bathroom or where the o ccupants otherwise must rely on a communal bathroom(s) for toileting. Fixed at the Per Bed Value in effect on June 30, 2022, with no annual update thereafter for the construction index. The P BV will be adjusted annually thereafter to reflect changes in construction costs as indicated per the Core Logic Marshall & Swift Valuation Service. A percentage increase will be calculated by dividing the difference between the Comparative Cost Multipliers construction index for Little Rock, Arkansas, for the quarter ending January of the cost reporting period and January of the previous year. The annual adjustment percentage will be the lessor of the percentage as calculated above for building classes:1) Masonry Bearing Walls, 2) Wood Frame, or five percent ( 5%). Every five (5) years, the Division shall analyze and compare the annual updates made using the construction cost index and the actual total cost (including physical plant, fixed equipment, land acquisitions and land improvements) of new SNF construction in Arkansas during the same period. The Division shall rebase the base PBV if actual construction costs increased more than estimated by the construction index. 2.Facility Rental Factor A facility rental factor will be paid for each facility. The rental factor is calculated by multiplying the CAV of the facility by twoand a half percent ( 16 -007 3. Cost of Ownership The cost of ownership component of the property payment will consist of interest, property taxes, and insurance premiums (includingprofessional liability and property) as identified on the facility's costreport. The limitation on allowable interest expense is addressed in thereturn on equity calculation described above. The limitation onallowable professional liability insurance is addressed in Section 3-2 J.9. 4. Minor Equipment Purchases The c ost of purchases of minor equipment is not covered in the Fair Market Rental Payment. Minor equipment for the purposes of reimbursement is any equipment that has a unit cost of less than twothousand five hundred dollars ( $2,500). Minor equipment purchases are to be expensed in the cost area in which the equipment is normallyused (i.e., direct care cost component or indirect, administrative, and operating component) . 5. Renova tions The cu rrent asset value of a facility will be adjusted as a result of major renovations made to an existing facility. A major renovation is defined as renovations made to a facility where the total per bed cost of therenovation equals or exceeds ten percent (10 %) of the facility's currentper bed value for the beds renovated or five (5%) for renovations tocommon areas. The actual cost of all additions or fundamentalalterations to a facility that are required by state or federal laws o r rules that take effect during the cost reporting period will be treated as anadjustment to the provider's aging index regardless of the percentage ofcurrent per bed value. The cost of renovation will be treated as anadjustment to the provider's aging index. A facility's aging index willbe reduced by one percent (1%) for each percent of the current per bedvalue expended for renovations on a per bed basis. For facilities thathave beds that have been placed in operation at different times or whenrenovations include only a portion of the beds in a facility, thedetermination that the renovation meets the criteria of major renovationand the reduction of the aging index will relate to only those beds thatwere included in the renovation. For renovations to common areas, thedetermination that the renovation meets the criteria of major renovationand the reduction of the aging index will be applied proportionally toall beds. August 2, 2022 Revised 12/01/02 2-2d Adjustments to the aging index will be rounded to a whole percentage. Percentages greater than or equal to .5 will be rounded up. Percentages less than .5 will be rounded down. A facility wishing to do major renovation to their facility must submit a plan for renovation to the Department of Human Services for review and approval to facil itate an adjustment to the provider's aging index. The duration of the renovation plan cannot exceed a three-year period. The plan shall include a detailed description of the renovation to be done along with the cost of the renovation. The Department will determine if the proposed renovation meets the requirements for major renovation. The Department will approve or disapprove the renovation project within thirty days of receipt. The provider will then submit a detailed description of the actual work performed and a statement of the actual cost of the renovation upon completion of the project. Renovations that were not completed in compliance with the plan for renovation will not be considered. The Department will notify the provider of the adjust ment to the facility aging index as a result of the major renovation. Under no circumstances will the aging index be reduced to less than zero. 6. Aging Index Age of provider beds for purposes of calculating the aging index were taken from surveys provided by the Arkansas Health Care Association as prepared by providers. The provider is responsible for the accuracy of the information provided. The provider may at any time be required to provide records validating this information. The aging index is subject to adjustment based upon review or audit. D. Quality Assurance Fee Act 635 of 2001 established the levy of a quality assurance fee on nursing facilities. The reimbursement rate paid nursing facilities will include a Quality Assurance Fee componen t. The Quality Assurance Fee component will be reimbursed at the amount established as the multiplier as defined in Act 635 for the date of service billed. E. Emergency Generators Act 1602 of 2001 requires nursing facilities to own and maintain emergency generators. This establishes an add -on payment for installing emergency generators applicable only to first time emergency generators installed in order to comply with act 1602 of 2001. Facilities that do not meet the requirement of existing facility as defined in Act 1602 will not receive any add-on payment Revised 12/01/02 2-2dd in addition to the facility's fair market rental payment. Add -on payments shall be made only for the periods that depreciation or lease expense for the cost of first time generator installations is allowable. Facilities will be required to submit copies of invoices indicating generator cost and a copy of the financing arrangement if any for the emergency generator installation or a copy of the generator operating lease if any. Facilities that f ail to provide this information by December 1, 2002 will not be paid the add-on for thirty days past the date of submission. Should the financing arrangement on the emergency generator change during the add -on period; the facility must provide revised financing information that will be used to calculate the add -on for the following calendar year. Facilities will be paid an add -on to their per diems for installing emergency generators. The add -on payment will begin January 1, 2003 and will be adjusted each January 1 for the period the add-on is applicable. Using cost information supplied by the facility, the add-on will be calculated by dividing the sum of projected yearly depreciation and projected yearly interest expense or projected yearly lease expense by the greater of the actual resident days from the previous cost reporting period or resident days calculated at the minimum occupancy levels identified in section 2 -4 A. 1. C. Fair Market Rental. Depreciation will be calculated using the straight- line method assuming a useful life of ten years. Interest expense will be allowable and included in the add-on for emergency generators for a maximum period of five years. Interest expense and the associated debt instrument reimbursed under this provision will not be included in the fair market rental payment or any other component of the rate. Lease expense on emergency generator systems will only be allowable for a maximum period of ten years. Change of ownership does not affect add-on payments. Facil ities that change ownership while receiving a generator add -on payment will continue to receive the add -on for the remainder of the allowable period identified above using the original owner's projected expense. 2. Facility Payments - Interim Rates An interim rate will be established at the beginning of each state fiscal year for each facility. The interim rate will be established by applying the inflation index to the actual per diem rate from the previous rate period. (For the period January 12, 2001 to June 30, 2001, an actual rate will be Revised 01/01/17 2-2e calculated from cost reports submitted for the period July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2000. No initial interim rate is necessary because the methodology has been implemented the second half of the rate period and there fore actual rates have been calculated.) The interim rate is necessary to allow time for providers to complete cost reports and allow the Department adequate time to review the cost reports and calculate rates. After the actual per diem calculations occu r providers will be paid a weighted per diem rate for the portion of the rate year remaining. The weighted per diem rate will provide for an average payment approximating providers actual per diem. The following formula will be used to calculate the w eighted per diem rate. {(Actual Per Diem Rate x 12) - (Interim Rate x Months Used)}/ Months Remaining. 3. Provisional Rate A provisional rate will be paid to a provider who: A. Constructs a new facility; or B. Enrolls as a Medicaid provider and has not previously participated in the Medicaid program. The provisional rate will be established as follows. A. The Direct Care per diem rate will be established at the inflation adjusted ceiling for that rate period. B. The Indirect, Administrative, and Operating per diem will be the class rate as established for that rate period. C. The Fair Market Rental Payment will consist of a return on equity payment assuming no debt, a facility rental factor, and property taxes and insurance at the industry average. The industry average for property taxes and insurance will be calculated by dividing the total Revised 01/01/17 2-2f cost for all full year facilities as identified on facility cost reports by total resident days for the cost reporting period. The per diem payment will be calculate d by dividing the sum of the components above by the required minimum occupancy. New facilities that have been constructed will use an occupancy rate of fifty percent when calculating the per diem for this component. Facilities that want to establish the ir provisional rate assuming a higher percent of occupancy can do so by supplying projected occupancy figures to the Department. Facilities have the option of providing documents indicating the actual cost of property taxes and insurance to be used for cost of ownership figures. Actual cost of ownership information can be supplied any time during the initial six -month period. The Division will adjust the facility's provisional rate prospectively based on the information provided. Facilities who are pla ced on a provisional rate as detailed above must submit a six month cost report as required in section 1-6 of this manual. The provisional rate will be retroactively adjusted to the per diem calculated in the following manner. A. The provider's direct care per diem rate will be calculated from the six month cost report using the inflation index adjusted ceiling for the applicable rate period. For cost reports that span two rate periods the applicable rate period will be considered the one that contains the majority of the days included in the six month report. B. The Indirect, Administrative, and Operating per diem will continue to be the class rate as established in the provisional rate. C. The amount identified as the sum of the components used in the origi nal calculation (as adjusted for actual cost data if applicable) for the Fair Market Rental Payment will remain as established in the provisional rate. The actual per diem amount will be adjusted to reflect the greater of actual occupancy, or the minimum required occupancy for facilities that enroll as a Medicaid provider who have not previously participated or fifty percent occupancy for new facilities. After the initial six -month reporting period the Fair Market Rental payment will be calculated using a minimum occupancy factor as required in 2-4 A.1. C., for both new facilities and facilities that were not previously enrolled. If either the provisional rate or the actual rate calculated from the six month cost report extend from one rate period to another, appropriate adjustments will be made to the vendor payment. The inflation index will be applied to the direct care per diem. The administrative and operating per diem will be changed to the class rate for the latest rate period. The fair market rental per diem will be adjusted to reflect any change in the PBV for the latest rate period.Attachment 4.19-D -007 4.Rates for Facilities that Change of Ownership Facilities that have a change in licensure due to purchase or lease of an existing facility participating in the Medicaid program will be reimbursed the previousoperator's rate as of the date of the change of ownership. When this rate extends from one rate period to another, an inf lation index will be applied to the per diem rate to establish the rate for the new rate period. The inflation factor to be used is addressed in Section 2-4 A. 6. August 2, 2022Attachment 4.19-D minating Facilities Facilities that withdraw from the Medicaid program either voluntarily or involuntarily will not be required to submit a final cost report. Allpayments made to a facility as interim or provisional will be consideredas final. This provision does not apply to any fines or penalties that havebeen imposed on a facility. 6. Inf lation Index For all inflation adjustments (unless stated otherwise in the specific area ofthe plan) the Department will use the Skilled Nursing Facility Market Basket Index as published by the Centers for Medicare and MedicaidServices. The Department will use the Four Quarter Moving Average Percent Change identified for the final quarter of the rate period. 7. Adjus tments to Provider Cost Reports Adjus tments to an individual provider's per diem may be necessary as a result of amend ed cost reports, desk review, or audit. Should a provider's per diem be adjusted for any reason a retroactive adjustment will be made for all resident days paid back to the beginning of the rate period. Adjustments to a provider's perdiem resulting from any source other than August 2, 4.19 -D 2, 2022 an inquiry for additional information as a result of a desk review for which provided within required deadlines wil l only affect the per diem for that particular provid er. Cost component ceilin gs for applicable cost components and the floor established for direct care will not be adjusted under these circumstances. 8. Cost Components: For rate setting, facility allowable costs from desk reviewed facil ity cost report s for an annual period ending June 30, will be identified and grouped as: Direct Care; I ndirect, Administrative, & Operating ; Property Costs (Identified for informa tional purposes, the reimbur sement rate for property costs will be deter mined by the Fair Market R ental meth od as outlined above in Item A. 1. C.); and Quality Assurance Fee. a. Direct Care Expenses The following expenses are classified as Direct Care. Salaries -Aides Salar ies-Medicat ion Assistants Salaries -LPN's Salaries -RNs Salaries -Physical Therapists Salaries -Speech Th erapists Salaries -Other Therapists Salaries -Rehabilitation Nurse Aide Salaries -Assista nt Director of Nu rsing Salaries -Director o f Nursing FICA -Direct Care Group Health- Direct Care Pensions- Direct Care Unemployment Taxes- Direct Care Uniform Allowance -Direct Care Worker's Compensation- Direct Care Other Fringe Benefits- Direct Contract -Aides Contract -Med ication As sistants Contract -LPN 's Contract -RN's Training- Direct Care Drugs, Over -the-Counter Oxygen Medical Supplies -Direct Care Contract -Occupational Ther Therapists Revised 2-2h Contract -Other Therapists Therapy Supplies Consultant Fees -Nursing Raw Food Food Supplements Incontinence Supplies b.

Quality Assurance Fee Revised 1/1/04 2-2j 8. Non-State Public Nursing Facility Adjustment Effective February 21, 2002, a non- state public nursing facility (that is, a public nursing facility that is not owned or operated by the State of Arkansas ) shall qualify for a monthly reimbursement adjustment. The adjustment shall result in total payments to the public nursing facilities that are equal to but not in excess of the total of each individual facility's Medicare -related upper payment limit. Th e public nursing facility with the greatest number of Medicaid days by date of service from the previous state fiscal year will receive the adjustment. The adjustment shall be calculated as follows: Once a year: All Minimum Data Set (MDS) submissions for the previous state fiscal year for Medicaid residents by public nursing facility will be processed through the Medicare 44 -group RUG classification system to attain the RUG score. A report will be generated by facility identifying all prescription drugs, lab and x- ray paid by Medicaid for Medicaid residents. Total cost will be divided by twelve to derive a monthly amount. A report will be generated by facility identifying Medicaid resident days for the previous fiscal year. Total days will be divided by twelve to derive a monthly amount. 1. Monthly: 2. The current Medicare rate associated with each RUG score will be assigned as if the resident were Medicare. 3. An average rate will be calculated by facility from all rates determined above. 4. The difference in a facility's average Medicare rate and the facility's Medicaid rate is calculated. 5. This difference is multiplied by the number of monthly Medicaid resident days. 6. The monthly amount of prescription drugs, lab and x- ray charges will be subtracted from the product calculated in step 4 by facility. 7. The total UPL amount is the sum of the amounts calculated in step 5. 8. Payment shall be made on a monthly basis by the fifteenth of the month. Effective January 1, 2004, the Non- State Public Nursing Facility Adjustment is eliminated.Attachment 4.19-D Rental Payment Mi nimum occupancy rules ( as defined in Section 2 -4 A. 1. C.) for calculating the facility fair market rental payment will be calculated and applied separately for beds certified as Home Style. All other policy described in this Cost Manual regarding the calculation of a facility's fair market rentalpayment is applicable to Home Style Facility beds. All cos ts associated with renovating or constructing beds for initial certification as Home Style shall not be considered a renovation as detailed insection 2 -4, A. 1. C. 5. of this Cost Manual. Thereafter, Home Style beds are eligible for renovation adjustment as detailed in the Cost Manual. A nu rsing facility participating in this program may certify less than one hundred percent ( 100% ) of its beds as Home Style Facility beds. A facility may have a combination of traditional style nursing facility beds and HomeStyle Facility beds within a single licensed facility. B.Cost Reporting A faci lity or any part thereof, certified by the Office of Long Term Care as Home Style shall prepare and submit a Financial and Statistical Report/CostReport. The cost report for Home Style beds will be identified as such by including the words Home Style at the end of the facility name wherever used. The cost report must be prepared in accordance with all reimbursement rules and reporting requirements detailed in the \"Manual of Cost Reimbursement Rules.\" Co mbination facilities will be required to complete a separate cost report for both the traditional beds and beds certified as Home Style Facility beds. Whenever possible, costs that can be directly identified toeither the traditional or Home Style beds mus t be included on the appropriate cost report. The department recognizes that certain costs cannot be directly identified and benefit both reporting entities. These shared costs August 2, 2022 Revised 01/01/17 2-2l must be allocated between each of the benefiting entities. Any shared cost included in the calculation of the facility's fair market rental payment must be allocated based on the Current Asset Value (CAV). All other shared cost must be allocated based on resident days. The cost report for the Home Style portion of a combination facility will include forms 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 16. The cost report for the traditional beds in a combination facility must include all forms. The cost report for traditional beds in a combination facility will include aggregate information (includes both traditional and Home Style) on forms 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. These forms relate to the overall operation of the facility and cannot be allocated between traditional and Home Style. The Cost Report for Home Style Beds will be used for the purpose of establishing a per diem rate for the facili ty's Home Style beds. Full year cost reports for facilities certified entirely as Home Style Facilities will be included when calculating the direct care ceiling and the median for the indirect, administrative and operating component of the rate during the overall rate setting process. Full year cost reports for combination facilities will be combined into an aggregate per diem cost for both direct care and indirect, administrative and operating, and will be included in the overall rate setting process as well. C. Staffing Certified Nurse Assistant's (CNA) utilized in staffing Home Style beds are designated as universal workers within the Home Style concept. The universal worker performs CNA duties, and performs dietary, laundry, housekeeping and other services to meet the needs of residents. CNA duties are considered primary to other duties performed by the CNA, therefore the cost of salaries and fringe benefits for CNA's are considered direct care costs and are appropriately reported in Section 1 of Form 6 on the facility cost report. D. Rate Setting With the exceptions detailed above, the per diem rate for beds certified as Home Style beds will be established in the same manner as traditional beds. Revised 07/31/09 2-4 B. Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals w ith Intellectual Disabilities 1. 16 Bed & Over - State -Operated Facilities: a. Effective January 1, 1994, the method of reimbursement for ICF/IID state -operated facilities certified as having more than 15 beds will be based on actual cost with provisions for retrospective adjustment semi-annually to ensure reimbursement of actual allowable, reasonable costs. Each facility will have an interim per diem rate established based on the most recent semi - annual cost report. This interim per diem rate will be adjusted retrospectively as a result of actual costs for that semi - annual cost reporting period. Rates established for this facility type shall be changed due to adjustments to the semi-annual cost reports resulting from provider corrections, desk reviews, or audits and will be retrospectively adjusted to the first day of the applicable cost report period. The reimbursement methodology for this type facility will be adjusted by submission of a State Plan amendment as warranted. b. Provider Fee Act 433 of 2009 established the levy of a provider fee on Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Developmental Disabilities. The reimbursement rate paid 16 Bed & Over - State - Operated Facilities will include a Provider Fee component. The Provider Fee component will be reimbursed at the amount established as the multiplier for the date of service billed. 2-5 B. Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities - Continued 2. 16 Bed & Over - Private Facilities: a. Reimbursement Methodology Effective with d ates of service on or after Jan uary 1, 1999, ICF/IID 16 bed and over facilities will be paid a prospective rate based on a combination of actual allowable cost for Direct Care & Care Related costs and a class rate up to a ceiling for Administrative and Operating costs. Effective the beginning of each state fiscal year, rates will be rebased or adjusted for inflation. The Department will in its sole discretion determine whether to rebase the rate or apply an inflationary a djustment. b. Cost Categories For rate setting, facility allowable costs from desk reviewed facility cost reports for an annual period determined by the Department, will be identified and grouped as Direct Care & Care Related or Administrative and Operating. Direct Care & Care Related include those expenses the facility incurs in providing care directly to the resident. Because these costs most directly affect the quality of care given a resident, the methodology includes as a component the actual allowable cost incurred for Direct Care & Care Related costs. Administrative and Operating constitute the remainder of facility costs. Costs associated with Administrative and Operating are more directly controllable by the facility. The methodology include s as a component a class rate up to a ceiling to cover the costs for Administrative and Operating. For rates effective January 1, 1999, desk reviewed facility cost reports for the period 1/1/97 through 6/30/97 and 71/97 through 12/31/97 were combined to establish the base year rates. Rebasing and cost reporting period for rebasing will be at the discretion of the Department. Should the Department decide to rebase, the most currently available desk reviewed cost reports will be used. c. Rate Setting Rates will be established in the following manner: An average per diem cost for Administrative and Operating will be calculated for the facility class. This will be accomplished by determining per diem cost for Administration & Operating for each facility by dividing the actual allowable cost for each facility by their total resident days, adding the individual facility per diem costs and dividing by the number of facilities within the facility class. A ceiling for Administrative and Operating will be se t at 105% of the average. A facility will be paid at the lesser of the ceiling or their actual per diem cost plus 10% of the amount calculated as 105% of the average. A per diem cost will be calculated for each facility for Direct Care and Care Related costs. The per diem cost will be calculated by dividing the actual allowable cost for each facility by their total resident days. A facility's per diem cost for Direct Care and Care Related cost and Administrative & Operating cost will be combined to get a facility's total per diem. Once the total per diem by facility has been established, these rates will be adjusted for inflation from the base year to the rate year. In years that the rates are not rebased, existing rates will be adjusted for projected inflation. The Department will use the HCFA Input Price Index (market basket) - Nursing Facilities published quarterly for determining appropriate inflation rates. Facility rates will be rebased periodically at the Department's discretion. d. Prov ider Fee Act 433 of 2009 established the levy of a provider fee on Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Developmental Disabilities. The reimbursement rate paid 16 Bed & Over - Private facilities will include a Provider Fee component. The Pr ovider Fee component will be reimbursed at the amount established as the multiplier for the date of service billed. e. Enhanced Care Add -On The Department recognizes that the current rate structure limits the providers' ability to invest additional monies for the purpose of improving the quality of care. Additionally the recent increase in the minimum wage (an unfunded federal mandate) will make it difficult for providers to maintain current standards much less improve the quality of care. Therefore the Department will implement an enhanced care add -on in the amount of $10.54 per day. This enhanced payment will provide additional funds for Revised 11/01/09 2-6a wage adjustments in the base salaries for new hires and incumbent salaries to address the increase of the federal minimum wage in July 2009. This will also directly increase benefits related to these salary increases such as FICA, LTD, Life insurance, retirement, etc. This add -on will also provide funding for additional initiatives to improve the quality of care. T he following list of items identifies these additional initiatives. 1. Enhanced staff resources for staff development, nursing, psychological and other professional personnel 2. Enhanced maintenance cost due to the aging of the facilities 3. Enhanced direct care staff and increase in number of staff to meet increased needs of children with autism and other behavior needs in order to maintain a quality standard of care and insure the health and safety of all children being served 4. Enhanced Technology (Computers, tele conferencing, electronic files, electronic time keeping, etc. 5. Software for client programming, client data bases, billing etc. 6. Security cameras/lighting 7. Other items deemed appropriate in providing enhance care The Enhanced Care Add -on is paid in addition to the rate components identified in paragraph a. and b. above. f. Rate Justification Modeling of this methodology produced estimates that each facility identified as efficient and economic (providers operating at or below the median of arrayed non- direct care costs) would receive payment equaling 100% (plus or minus 5%) of that facility's actual allowable cost. Cost coverage in the aggregate is equal to or less than 100% for ICF/IID facilities. Revised 07/0 4/13 2-7 B. Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities - Continued 3. Under 16 Beds: a. Small ICF/IID facilities certified as having 15 beds or fewer will be reimbursed on a prospective uniform class rate system. An inflationary adjustment, determined by the Division to be reasonable and adequate, will be applied to the existing rates and will be implemented by State Plan amendment as warranted by analysis of cost report data. Cost reports will be submitted annually for the preceding calendar year (January 1 - December 31) and will be reviewed prior to establishing new rates. The Division has established the per diem rate of $195.43 for dates of service beginning July 4, 2013. b. Provider Fee Act 433 of 2009 established the levy of a provider fee on Intermediate Care Facilitie s for Individuals with Developmental Disabilities. The reimbursement rate paid Under 16 Beds facilities will include a Provider Fee component. The Provider Fee component will be reimbursed at the amount established as the multiplier for the date of service billed. The Provider Fee component is paid in addition to the rate identified in paragraph a. above. c. Enhanced Care Add -On The Department recognizes that the current class rate structure limits the providers' ability to invest additional monies for the purpose of improving the quality of care. Additionally the recent increase in the minimum wage (an unfunded federal mandate) will make it difficult for providers to maintain current standards much less improve the quality of care. Therefore the Department will implement an enhanced care add -on in the amount of $7.02 per day. This enhanced payment will provide additional funds for wage adjustments in the base salaries for new hires and incumbent salaries to address the increase of the federal minimum wage in July 2009. This will also directly increase benefits related to these salary increases such as FICA, LTD, Life insurance, retirement, etc. This add -on will also provide funding for additional initiatives Revised 11/01/09 2-7a to improve the quality of care. The fol lowing list of items identifies these additional initiatives. 8. Enhanced staff resources for staff development, nursing, psychological and other professional personnel. 9. Enhanced therapy services to meet increasing behavior needs of the aging population being served 10. Enhanced maintenance, housekeeping staff 11. Enhanced direct care staff 12. Generators 13. Enhanced Technology (Computers, teleconferencing, electronic files, electronic time keeping, etc. 14. Software for client programming, client data bases, billing etc. 15. Secur ity cameras/lighting 16. Other items deemed appropriate in providing enhanced care The Enhanced Care Add -on is paid in addition to the rate components identified in paragraph a. and b. above. d. Overpayment/Underpayments Overpayment/underpayments resulting from Section 1-12 administrative errors shall be handled through the vendor payment by recouping overpayments and reimbursing underpayments. Revised 07/01/02 2-8 C. SNF & ICF - Special Class - Arkansas Health Center Nursing Facility 1. Reimbursement Methodology The Ar kansas Health Center Nursing Facility will be reimbursed on an actual cost reimbursement system with provisions for retrospective adjustments to ensure reimbursement of actual allowable and reasonable costs. The facility will have an interim per diem rate established based on the most recent semi -annual cost report. This interim per diem rate will be adjusted retrospectively as a result of actual costs for that semi -annual cost reporting period. The per diem will be calculated by dividing actual allowabl e cost by resident days for the cost reporting period. The per diem rate shall be changed as a result of adjustments to the semi -annual cost reports resulting from provider corrections, desk reviews, or audits, and will be retrospectively adjusted to the f irst day of the applicable cost report period. 2. Overpayments/Underpayments Overpayments/underpayments resulting from Section 1- 12 administrative errors shall be handled through the vendor payment by recouping overpayments and reimbursing underpayments. 2-9 2-5 Mandatory Changes The Department of Human Services acknowledges that State laws passed by the Arkansas General Assembly and administrative rules promulgated by the Division of Medical Services occasionally require the state's long term care facilities t o incur costs which were not incurred prior to the adoption of the law or rule. DHS will assess the impact of newly required costs and, when warranted, seek additional reimbursement through the state and federal executive and legislative agencies. The Division of Medical Services will implement any available additional reimbursement, including appropriate retroactive payments, within the quarter following all necessary approvals, appropriation, and funding. DHS will inform state and federal agencies pr oposing new nursing facility mandates of the projected costs, if any, of such mandates. If a proposed mandate would substantially increase costs without attendant state and federal funding, DHS will object to implementing the mandate without corresponding state and federal funding. 3-1 Chapter 3 - Allowable Costs 3-1 General Information A. This chapter sets forth principles for determining the allowable costs for the facilities which: 1. Meet the definition of a Nursing Facility (NF) under 42 CFR Part 483, Subpart B, if licensed and certified as a NF. 2. Meet the definition of an Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID ) under 42 CFR Part 483, Subpart I, if licensed and certified as an ICF/IID . 3. Meet certification requirements to participate in the Medicaid program as a NF or ICF/IID . 4. Are primarily engaged in providing to residents: a) skilled nursing care and related services for residents who require medical or nursing care, b) rehabilitation services for the re habilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or c) on a regular basis, health -related care and services to individuals who because of their mental or physical condition require care and services (above the level of room and board) which can be made available to them only through institutional facilities. B. The Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual (HCFA Publication 15-1) and the Federal regulations appropriate to the recognition of costs for facilities under the Medicare program are a supplement to this chapter. A facility shall use the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual and Federal regulations for the sole purpose of determining the allowability of a specific cost not determinable by reference to this manual. A facility may not use the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual or Federal regulations for a cost that is determined to be unallowable in this chapter. A facility may not use the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual or Federal regulations to alter the treatment of a cost provided for in this chapter. 3-2 C. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as interpreted in the opinions of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and in the statements by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) are a supple ment to this chapter. A facility shall use GAAP for cost issues which are not specifically addressed in this chapter, the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual, or Federal regulations. A facility may not use GAAP for a cost that is determined to be unal lowable in either this chapter, the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual, or Federal regulations. A facility may not use GAAP to alter the treatment of a cost provided for in this chapter, the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual, or Federal regulatio ns. D. Allowable costs must be reported on a full accrual basis of accounting. If a facility maintains its internal records on a basis other than the accrual method, it will be necessary to convert to the accrual basis for cost reporting purposes. This does not apply to State owned facilities. E. The Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS) defines allowable and unallowable costs to identify expenses which are reasonable and necessary to provide recipient care to Medicaid recipients by an economical and efficient provider. The primary objective of the cost reporting process is to provide adequate data for the determination of fair and reasonable reimbursement rates to providers. To achieve that objective, DHS compiles a rate base consisting, if possible, only of allowable cost information. If DHS classifies a particular type of expense as unallowable for purposes of compiling a rate base, it does not mean that individual providers may not make expenditures of this type. F. Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this subchapter, shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 1. Allowable costs \u2014 Those expenses that are reasonable and necessary in the normal conduct of operations to provide recipie nt care in a facility. a) Reasonable refers to the amount expended. The test of reasonableness is that the amount expended does not exceed the cost which would be incurred by a prudent business operator seeking to contain costs. b) Necessary costs are those costs essential: (1) to operate a long term care facility and deliver long term care in conformity with applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, ordinances, and codes; and Attachment 4.19 -D 2022 (2) to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosoc ial well being of each resident. c) Normal conduct of operations re lating to recipien t care refers to otherwise allowable costs that include, but are not limite d to, the following: (1) expenses for facilities, materials, supplies, or services used by a faci lity solely for providing longterm recipient care. Whenever otherwise allowable cost s are attributable partially to personal or other business interests and pa rtially to facility re cipient care, the latter portion may be allowed on a pro rata basis if the basis for allocation of expense for recipient care purposes is wel l-documented. Thi s documentation includes the allocation methodology and appropriate logs necessary to support amount attr ibuted to recipient care; (2) allowable costs which result from arms- length transactions involving unrelated parties. In transactions involving related organizations, the allowable cost to the facility is the cost to the relate d party. Allowable costs in this regard are limited to the lesser of the actual purchase price to the related party, or usual and customary charges for comparable goods or services. d) Allowable cost s must be reported net of any applicable returns, allow ances, discounts, and refunds. 2. Costs of Related Organizations \u2014 Costs for services or supplies furnished to the facility by related organizations are allowable at t he cost to the related party to the extent that they are reasonable and necessary in the norm al conduct of operations r elating to recipient care in a facility and do not exceed those costs i ncurred by a prudent buyer. Providers should treat the cost incurred by the related party as if they were incurred by the provider itself . Providers must supply a detail income statement from the related pa rty entity so the proper cost report classificati on can be determined. If the cost to the related party wo uld be classified as a direct care cost by the nursing facility, then the rel ated cost must be claimed on a direct care lin e on the cost report. I f the cost to related party would be classified as an indirect, admin istrative , and operating cost by the nurs ing facility, then the related party cost must be claimed on an indirect, ad ministrative, an d operating cost report line. I f the cost to related party would be classified as a property cost by the nursing facility, t hen the related party cost must be claim ed on a property cos t report line. Expenses for transactions with relatedAttachment 4.19-D Revised should not exceed expenses for like items in arms' length transactions with other non-related organizations. a) Related Organization \u2014 A related organization (includes individuals, partnerships, corporations, etc.) is one where the provider is associated or affiliated with, has common ownership,control, or common board members, or has control of or iscontrolled by the organization furnishing the services, facilities, orsupplies. August 2, 2022 3-4 b) Common ownership \u2014 Common ownership exists when an entity, individual or individuals possess 5% or more ownership or equity in the provider and the institution or organization serving the provider. c) Control \u2014 Control exists where an individual or an organization has the power, directly or indirectly, significantly to influence or direct the actions or policies of an organization or institution. d) Immediate Family Relationship - Immediate family members are related parties. Immediate family members include husband/wife, natural parent, child, sibling, adoptive child and and grandchild. e) Exception - An exception to the general rule applicable to related organizations exists where large quantities of goods and services are furnished to the general public by the related organization and sales to the facility represent no more than five percent of the gross receipts of the related organization. The facility must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that all of the following criteria are met: (1) The supplying organization is a bona fide separate organization; (2) A substantial part of the supplying organization's business activity with the facility is transacted with other organizations not related to the facility and the supplier by common ownership and there is an open, competitive market for the type of services, supplies or facil ities furnished by the organization; (3) The services, supplies, or facilities are those commonly obtained by facilities from other organizations and are a necessary element of resident care. (4) The charge to the facility is no more than the charge for such services, supplies, or facilities in the open, competitive market, and no more than the charge made by the organization, under comparable circumstances, to other customers for such ser vices, supplies, or facilities.Attachment 4. 19-D 2, 2022 f) The facility must furnish to the Department ad equate documentation to support the costs incurred by the related organization, inc luding access to t he related organiz ation's books and records co ncerning supplies, services, or facilities furnished to the facility. Such documentation must include an ide ntification of the organization's total costs, and the basis for allocating dir ect and indirec t costs to the facility a nd to other entiti es served. g) Limitations on cost for related party transactions will not apply t o the sale of one or more nursing fac ilities by a person to that person's child or children for money equal to the f air market value o f the facility or facilit ies. All other regu lations relating to the sale of a facility will apply. 3. Unallowable C osts \u2014 Those expenses that are not reasonable or necessary for the provision of recipient care in a facility, according to the crit eria as specified in paragraph (1) of the subsection. U nallowab le costs are not included in the rate base used for determining reimbursement rates. 4. Prudent Buyer Concept - Allowable costs may not exceed the cost that a prudent buyer would pay in the ope n market to obtain products or servi ces. 5. Arms -Length Tr ansactio n - A voluntary transaction between a knowledgeable and willing buyer unrelated to the seller, with each a cting for his or her own independent self-interest. 3-2 List of Allowable Cos ts The following l ist of allowable costs is not all inclu sive but serves a s a gener al guide and clarifies certain key expense areas. The a bsence of a particular cost does not necessarily mean that it is not an allowable cost. As discussed further in Section 3-4, certain income items will r educe allowable costs an d be offset against the appropriate line items for salaries and wages or other service expenses. Except where specific exceptions are noted, the allowability of all costs is subject to the amounts being reasona ble and to the other g eneral principles specif ied in sectio n 3-1 of this chapter. A. Compensation of facility employe es. This includes compensation for only those employees who provide services directly to the recipients or staff of individual facilities in the normal conduc t of operations relating to rec ipient car e: certified nurse aides; nurse aides in training; ation licensed practical ses; graduate practical nurses; registered nurses; graduate nurse nursing; personnel; other administrative staff; accounting staff; and data processing 3-6 personnel. Compensation for employees related to the owners, partners, or stockholders of the facility are subject to the limitation established in Section 3 -2 B. following. Compensation includes: 1. wages and salaries; 2. the employer's portion of payroll taxes and other mandatory insurance payments. Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA or Social Security), Unemployment Compensation Insurance, Workers' Compensation Insurance premiums and other payments mandated by Workers' Compensation laws, including self insurance payments, and payments direct to hospitals or physicians for treating minor injuries. 3. employee benefits. Employer-paid health, life, accident, and disability insurance for employees; uniform allowance and meals provided to employees as part of an employment contract; contributions to an employee retirement fund; and deferred compensation. The allowable portion of deferred compensation is limited to the dollar amount that an employer contributes during a cost reporting period. The expenses: a) must represent a clearly enumerated liability of the employer to individual employees; b) must be incurred as a benefit to employees who provide services to the recipients or staff of an individual facility; and c) must be offered to all full- time non -probationary employees on a equal basis in accordance with an employee benefit policy established in writing. Employers may offer different fringe benefits to different employee classes. Fringe benefits offered to only certain employees within the same employee class of the facility are considered discriminatory fringe benefits and are not allowable. Employee classes must be reasonably related to employee job duties and may not distinguish between persons similarly situated. Reasonable uniform allowances, and life insurance policies on key personnel as required to obtain a loan from an unrelated party, are exempt from this rule. B. Compensation of owners, partners, or stockholders. NOTE: These provisions do not apply to corporations whose stock is publicly traded. Compensation will be included as an allowable cost to the extent that it represents reasonable remuneration for managerial, professional, and administrative services related to the operation of the facility and rendered in connection with resident care. Services rendered in connection with resident care include both direct and indirect activities in the provision and supervision of resident care, such as administration, 3-7 management, and supervision of the overall institution. To be included as allowable cost, the compensation shall not exceed 150% of the median wage (excluding non-wage compensation) for comparable positions in facilities that do not have owner operators. Cost Reports from the previous reporting period will be used for setting the ceiling. The HCFA Market Basket projection of inflation will be used to adjust ceilings calculated from the cost reporting period to the rate setting period. Three peer groups will be established for this purpose: 1) Less than 75 licensed beds; 2) 75 to 149 licensed beds; and 3) 150 licensed beds or more. This ceiling is established based on a 40-hour workweek. Owner administrators working less than 40 hours per week must adjust allowable compensation accordingly. C. Cost of contracted services. This means costs of ser vices defined in 3-1.F.1. procured by contract. D. Management fees paid to unrelated parties. The department considers management fees paid to unrelated parties as allowable only to the extent that such fees are reasonable and are in accordance with the other general requirements of section 3-1 of this chapter. E. Management fees paid to related party organizations and other home office overhead expenses. These fees and expenses paid to a related organization may not exceed the actual cost of materials, su pplies, or services provided to an individual facility. A facility that is owned, operated, or controlled by other individual(s) or organization(s) may report the allowable portion of costs for materials, supplies, and services provided to that facility. The allowable portion of such costs to a given facility is limited to those expenses that can be attributed to the individual establishment. 1. In multi- facility organizations where the clear separation of costs to individual facilities is not always possible, the allowable portion of actual costs for materials, supplies, and services may be allocated to individual facilities on a pro rata basis. The required allocation method for these costs is a bed day's basis. Providers who wish to use an alternative allocation methodology may do so by obtaining prior written approval from the Director of the Department of Human Services, or the Director's designee, before implementation. Once a provider has chosen an alternative allocation method, and it has been approved, it must be consistently used in preparing subsequent cost reports. 2. In organizations with multiple levels of management, costs incurred at levels above the individual facility in Arkansas are allowable only if the costs were incurred in the provision of materials, supplies or services used by the facility staff in the conduct of normal operations relating to Revised 10/01/04 3-8 recipient care. In addition, the facility will make available immediately upon request adequate documentation to demonstrate that the costs satisfy the following criteria: a) The expense does not duplicate other expenses. b) The expense is not incurred for personal or other activities not specifically related to the provision of long term care. c) The expense does not exceed the amount that a prudent business operator seeking to contain costs would incur. If at the time of the request, records are in active use or are located in a place which makes immediate access impossible or impractical, the facility must certify that fact in writing and deliver the records within 72 hours of the request. 3. Adequate documentation consists of all materials necessary to demonstrate the relationship of personnel, supplies, and services to the provision of recipient care. These materials may include, but are not l imited to, accounting records, invoices, organizational charts, functional job descriptions, other written statements, and direct interviews with staff, as deemed necessary by DHS auditors to perform required tests of allowability. 4. A ceiling is establishe d for compensation of owners, partners or stockholders or employees related to owners, partners, or stockholders, employed by a company managing multiple facilities. That ceiling is calculated as follows: For the first two nursing facilities, the ceiling is set at 150 percent of the median wage for non- related administrators for nursing facilities having 150 or more certified beds as provided in Section 3-2 B. For the third facility, the allowable cost is raised by 20 percent of the ceiling for two facilities. For each of the fourth and fifth facilities, the allowable cost is raised by 10 percent of the ceiling for two facilities. Thereafter, for each additional facility, the allowable cost is raised by 5 percent of the ceiling for two facilities. The total allowable cost for an employee must not exceed 200 percent of the ceiling for two facilities. F. Cost to Provide routine services. Includes cost that will be incurred in all cost reporting categories. This section of the manual identifies items tha t are generally considered allowable cost and therefore must by furnished by the facility and does not address the proper category for cost reporting purposes. Please refer to the instructions for completing cost reports and the chart of accounts to assis t in determining the classification of these items. (Items appearing in this listing that are required to be capitalized and depreciated as described in other sections of this Cost Manual should be treated accordingly. The cost of items that are rented or Revised 10/01/04 3-9 leased must be reported on the cost report as equipment rental). Cost includes but is not limited to: 1. Urological, ostomy, and gastrostomy supplies not billable under Medicare Part B. 2. Intravenous (I.V.) or subcutaneous tray, connecting tubing and needl es. 3.

This includes ele ctricity, natural gas, fuel oil, water, wastewater, garbage collection and telephone. The costs of staff personal calls and individualized resident telephone services including long distance are not allowable. J. Property and Equipment Expenses. Note: Effective January 12, 2001 the reimbursement methodology for nursing facilities changed to a cost based facility specific rate which included a fair market rental component to reimburse for property and equipment cost in lieu of actual cost and/or lease payments. Allowability (or unallowability) of costs as described below will not affect nursing facility reimbursement rates. Nevertheless, nursing facilities must continue to report costs in the manner described below in order to continue to maintain histo ric cost records. Actual reimbursement to providers will be made in accordance with the rules established in Section 2 -4 A. of this Manual of Cost Reimbursement Rules. 1. Amortization Expense - Costs associated with the origination of a loan allowable under this section will be allowable if amortized over the life of the loan. Costs associated with early retirement of a loan allowable under this section may be allowable. If the amount of the interest plus any unamortized origination fees or prepayment pena lties do not exceed the maximum amount of allowable capital interest that would have been allowed had the debt not been paid off, then all of the interest and unamortized costs and other prepayment penalties can be claimed as part of the interest expense f or the year. If the unamortized fees and prepayment penalties plus interest exceed the amount that would have been allowed then any excess can be carried forward and claimed for a period of up to five years so long as total interest expense and unamortized fees and prepayment penalties do not exceed the interest amount that would have been allowable under the previous financing arrangement. 2. Depreciation Expense - Depreciation on the facility's buildings, furniture, equipment, leasehold improvements and land improvements. Depreciation on capital assets, including assets for normal standby or emergency use in which the facility is the record title holder and which assets are used to provide covered services to Medical Assistance Recipients, will be allowa ble subject to the following conditions: Attachment 4.19-D -0014 a) Generally accepted accounting principles incorporating the straight-line method of depreciation must be used. Accelerated methods of depreciation are not acceptable. Facilities must followAmerican Hospital Association Guidelines for Depreciation as thebasis for calculation of straight- line depreciation . Capitalization is not required for minor equipment costing less than two thousand five hundred dol lars ($2,500) per item . Minor equipment purchases are to be expensed in the cost area in which the equipment is normally used (i.e., direct care costcomponent or indirect, administrative, and operatingcompone nt). It is not required to deduct salvage val ue from the cost of the asset for the purpose of calculating depreciation.Component depreciation for physical structures is not acceptable. Depreciation expense for the year of acquisition and the year of disposal can be computed by using: (1) the half-year method; or(2) the actual time method. b) The method and procedure for computing depreciation must be applied from year -to-year on a consistent basis. c) The assets shall be recorded at cost. Cost during the construction ofan asset, such as architectu ral, consulting, and legal fees, interest, etc., must be capitalized as a part of the cost of the assets. Whenan asset is acquired by trade in, the cost of the new asset is the sumof the book value of the old asset and any cash or issuance of debt August 2, 2022 3-12 as consideration paid. d) Leasehold improvements may be depreciated over the asset's useful life or the remaining life of the lease, whichever is less. e) Losses realized from the reasonable disposal or transfer of depreciable assets are a reported cost. Gains realized from the disposal or transfer of depreciable assets are revenue adjustments to be deducted from depreciation costs. f) As a basis for reporting depreciation on capital building construction or renovation costs exceeding $500,000, prior approval of the Arkansas Health Services Agency must be secured to meet the requirements of Section 1122 of Federal Social Security Act. If the prio r approval is not obtained, no depreciation cost will be allowed for expenditures for such capital building construction or renovation, unless such approval is subsequently received, although operational costs will be considered as a regular expense. g) Whe re purchase of a facility or improvements thereto are financed by tax exempt bonds, the acquired property, plant or equipment must be capitalized and depreciated over the life of the asset. The depreciation and not the installment payment is considered an allowable cost. The amortization of interest in accordance with the terms of the bond issue is an allowable cost. Where the principal amount of the bond issue was expended in whole or in part on capital assets which fail to meet the requirements above r egarding eligibility for depreciation, the includable depreciation shall be proportionately reduced. h) Fixed asset records shall be maintained. The records shall include: The depreciation method, a description; the date acquired; cost; depreciable cost; estimated useful life; depreciation for the year and accumulated depreciation. Salvage value is not required to be maintained. i) A funded depreciation account for future replacement of assets must be maintained for depreciation allowed on assets obtained through federal or state funds or grants, e.g., legacy foundation grant, Hill-Burton grants, etc. 3. Interest expense includes interest paid or accrued on notes, mortgages and other loans, the proceeds of which were used to purchase the facility's land, buildings and/or furniture and equipment. Intra/Inter Company 3-13 transactions should be handled according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. a) To be allowable under the Medicaid Program, interest must be supported by evidence of an agreement that funds were borrowed and that payment of interest and repayment of funds are required, identifiable in the provider's accounting records, related to the reporting period in which costs are incurred, necessary to the operation, maintenance, or acquisition of the provider's facilities, and be incurred for a purpose related to resident care. b) Allowable interest expense on loans from a related party is limited to the maximum interest rate equal to the Prime Commercial Rate reported by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. c) Interest applying to mortgages on the property and plant of the facility will be included in allowable costs. Where a provider leases facilities from a related organization and the rental expense paid to the related organization is not allowable as cost, the mortgage interest paid by the related organization is allowable to the provider as cost, as are the other costs of ownership of the leased facility such as property insurance, depreciation, and real estate taxes. d) Interest incurred at a rat e not in excess of what a prudent borrower would have had to pay in the open market existing at the time the loan was made will be recognized. Allowable costs for interest may not exceed limitations set by any state or federal law or the law of the stat e in which the loan originated. Allowable costs for interest may not include penalties or late charges. 4. Cost of fire and casualty insurance on facility buildings and equipment. 5. Taxes levied on the facility's land, buildings, furniture and equipment. 6. Cost of leasing the facility's real property. The lease must classify as a true operating lease. (Any lease that transfers substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership should be accounted for as the acquisition of an asset and the inc urrence of an obligation by the lessee in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.) 7. Cost of leasing the facility's furniture and equipment. Revised 01/01/17 3-14 8. Sale and leaseback transactions will not be recognized for reimbursement purposes. Only those costs associated with the owner of record prior to the sale and leaseback transaction will be considered for reimbursement. 9. Cost of premiums for insuring the facility against injury and malpractice claims. The allowable insurance premium cost fo r nursing facilities (excluding Arkansas Health Center) is capped at $2,500 per licensed bed as of the end of the cost reporting period. K. Transportation costs. 1. The per mile deduction for business travel fixed by the Internal Revenue Service may be claimed for each facility vehicle mile traveled for resident transportation or business use related to resident care, as established by mileage records. The cost of a vehicle provided to a key staff person for his or her use shall be included in the compensation for that individual. 2. If the facility acquires and maintains one or more vehicles designed and equipped to carry more than seven passengers, one or more vehicles equipped to transport residents that require wheelchairs for mobility, or the cost of a vehicle used exclusively for maintenance of the facility for which it is claimed, the facility may opt not to claim the Internal Revenue Service's rate per mile and instead claim reimbursement of the actual vehicle costs to provide resident transportation in that vehicle or vehicles to the extent such costs conform to Internal Revenue Service rules for vehicle business use. 3. The per mile rate allowable by the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration to reimburse state employees for travel b y private aircraft. L. Business and professional association dues.
