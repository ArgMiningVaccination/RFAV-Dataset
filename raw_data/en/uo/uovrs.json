Anthroposophical doctors are fully qualified doctors and work together with therapists to address the person as an integrated threefold being of body, soul and spirit. In treatment, homeopathic and anthroposophic medicines are used in conjunction with conventional medicine. The approach was founded in the 1920s by Rudolf Steiner in conjunction with Ita Wegman. Dr. Ita Wegman opened the first anthroposophic medical clinic, now known as the Ita Wegman Clinic, in Arlesheim, Switzerland. Wegman was soon joined by a number of other doctors. They began to train the first anthroposophic nurses for the clinic. At Wegman's request, Steiner regularly visited the clinic and suggested treatment regimes for particular patients. Between 1921 and 1925, he also gave several series of lectures on medicine. In 1925, Wegman and Steiner wrote the first book on the anthroposophic approach to medicine, [Fundamentals of Therapy](http://wn.rsarchive.org/Medicine/GA027_index.html). Anthroposophical Medicine employs modern diagnostic and therapeutic methods and complements these with medicines, artistic therapies, counselling and physical therapies such as massage therapies and art therapy. It activates the individual's self-healing powers . Anthroposophical Medicine aims at maintaining and restoring health and not merely at the elimination of disease or its symptoms. One of the most prominent and well-researched anthroposophical treatments is a range of mistletoe extracts used to treat patients with cancer. It is marketed as Iscador and currently is undergoing clinical trials in the US. \" Our aim was to supplement the science already in existence by the illumination that can flow from a true knowledge of the Spirit, towards a living grasp of the processes of illness and of healing.\" - "}
