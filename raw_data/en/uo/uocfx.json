Having travel vaccinations can help prevent you from getting some of the serious diseases found in other parts of the world. At Boots, we have travel vaccinations to help protect you against serious diseases such as Yellow Fever, Rabies and Hepatitis A and can also provide a range of antimalarials.

Some travel vaccinations may be needed several weeks before departure. Ideally, you should see us six to eight weeks before travelling, but we may still be able to help if you're leaving sooner.

If you need antimalarials our pharmacists can offer you these as part of this service, if they're suitable. You don't have to book a separate appointment with the Malaria Prevention Service.

PRICES The childhood vaccination programme in the UK protects you from a number of diseases, but you may need extra vaccinations or antimalarials if you're planning on visiting certain parts of the world. Most women experience few or no health problems whilst travelling to a different county. However, travel can pose potential health risks to you if you are pregnant. Antenatal and neonatal care might be difficult to access in countries where adequate medical facilities are not readily available. Travel-related illnesses or diseases such as malaria, Zika virus, dengue fever or travellers' diarrhoea may affect you more severely if you are pregnant. It is strongly recommended that, where possible, you should speak to your midwife or GP well in advance of your trip (at least 6-8 weeks). They can help ensure that your health is stable enough for your trip and that you are fit to fly. Ask your midwife or GP for a medical certificate confirming your due date and 'fitness to fly'. Most airlines will request this after 28 weeks of being pregnant (gestation) before allowing you to board the plane. You may require some travel vaccinations for your trip. Most vaccinations can be given during pregnancy if the risk of disease is significant. However, live vaccinations are normally not recommended. Speak to your Boots Pharmacist at a travel appointment or with a GP before having any vaccinations if: you're pregnant you think you might be pregnant you're breastfeeding Some infections are especially important to avoid if you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, including malaria, Zika virus, dengue and chikungunya disease. There is no vaccine or chemoprophylaxis available for Zika, dengue and chikungunya. Scrupulous bite avoidance is required to protect against these. All can be caught from the bite of a mosquito. Different mosquitoes cause these diseases, some are daytime biting, some night-time biting. We can provide malaria prevention medicine, including access to prescription-only medicine, and advice before you travel. You can access our [Malaria Prevention Service](https://www.boots.com/vaccinations/malaria-prevention-service)1 or if you would prefer a face-to-face appointment you can book in-store or online. Further information Ask your Boots Pharmacist for advice or go to www.boots.com to see the range of [travel products](http://www.boots.com/en/Pharmacy-Health/Health-shop/Travel-health) available. NaTHNaC provides country specific advice on the risks of Zika and other health risks, and also has a factsheet on pregnancy and useful resources for travel during Covid-19: - [https://travelhealthpro.org.uk](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk) Good preparation can reduce the risk of travel-associated illnesses and health risks to those mothers who are breast or bottle-feeding and their infants. Before you go, it is recommended that if you are breast or bottle-feeding you should speak to a healthcare professional before travelling to discuss specific health issues. This should be done ideally at least 4-6 weeks before departure. Certain antimalarial medication can be taken by breastfeeding mothers and infants, and you should seek advice about whether antimalarial medication is recommended for your specific trip. You can find out more by accessing [Boots Malaria Prevention Service](https://www.boots.com/vaccinations/malaria-prevention-service)1. Infants will not be protected by antimalarial medication excreted in breast milk and they will require their own, age-appropriate supply of antimalarial medication. Doses are calculated using the baby's weight. Routine childhood vaccinations should also be up to date prior to departure. You and your baby may require travel vaccinations for your trip. Most vaccinations can be offered to those who are breastfeeding. Vaccination against yellow fever for breastfeeding mothers is not offered as part of the [Boots Travel Health and Vaccination Service](https://www.boots.com/vaccinations/travel-vaccination-health-advice-service)1 and those travelling to a country with a risk of yellow fever should be referred to a specialist clinic. Vaccinations for infants and children under the age of 2 years will also need to be administered by an alternative healthcare professional or travel clinic. The Boots Malaria Prevention service is available from age 2. If your child is under 2 years old, please seek guidance from your GP or another travel clinic. If you plan to express your milk either during your journey or while abroad, you may wish to consider carrying a [hand breast pump](https://www.boots.com/baby-child/babyfeeding/breastfeeding-pumps) with you, as electricity supplies may be intermittent or unavailable when required. When using a breast pump, make sure you wash it well with soap and clean water and dry it in a fly-free environment. All travellers should pack a [first aid kit](https://www.boots.com/boots-travel-first-aid-kit-10258543) appropriate for the travellers. Useful items when travelling with an infant include [sunscreen](https://www.boots.com/holidays/suncare), oral and [barrier cream](https://www.boots.com/baby-child/bathing-changing/changing-bag-essentials) for those using nappies. Travelling with children can be a valuable experience for the whole family, and with preparation, you can reduce your risks of travel-related injury or illness and have a happy and healthy trip. Before you go, ensure your child is up to date with all childhood vaccines as some childhood illnesses not seen in the UK still occur in many countries. Any additional vaccines necessary for travel-related illness should be considered and discussed with your Boots Pharmacist. If you are travelling to an area where there is a risk of malaria, antimalarial medication may be required and your [Boots Pharmacist can provide advice](https://www.boots.com/vaccinations/malaria-prevention-service). Tablets can be crushed and mixed with jam, or similar, to make it easier to swallow. You may like to consider taking a small mosquito net which can be used to cover a pushchair to help protect against mosquito bites. Motion sickness can occur at any age but is more common in children between 3-12 years old. Your Boots Pharmacist can advise on appropriate medication that can help with this. Encourage your child to sit by the window, look out of it, if possible and avoid reading or using a screen if they are feeling unwell. Small, regular, non-greasy meals and [travel sickness bands](https://www.boots.com/health-pharmacy/travel-health/travel-sickness/boots-childrens-travel-bands-1-pair-2-12-years-10112484) can help too. Good hygiene should be practised, including sterilisation of bottles and dummies, cleaning toys and using bottled water for cleaning teeth. Microwaveable steriliser bags are a fuss-free way to sterilise while saving on baggage space. Alternatively, consider taking [sterilising equipment](https://www.boots.com/medela-quick-clean-micro-steam-bags-five-pack-10078075), it may also be worth taking a zip-lock bag with you just in case. For sterilising small items on the move (dummies and teething toys), keep sterilising tablets in a watertight, screw top container. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after using the toilet. An [alcohol-based cleansing gel](https://www.boots.com/milton-antibacterial-hand-gel-100ml-10137439p) is useful when running water is not available. Travellers' Diarrhoea in children can be more severe resulting in dehydration often more quickly than in adults. Watch out for dehydration symptoms which can include: - Increased thirst - Decreased urination - Dark coloured urine - Feeling weak/light-headed - Few or no tears when crying - Drowsiness Rehydrate with plenty of clear fluids and [rehydration salts](https://www.boots.com/dioralyte-blackcurrent-6-sachets-10020148) - little and often if vomiting. Do not avoid food; small amounts of starchy foods such as rice, bread, potatoes or fruit and vegetables will help. Always seek prompt medical attention if you are concerned. If breastfeeding, continue throughout any illness where possible. Loperamide (treatment for diarrhoea) is unsuitable for younger children - always check packaging for the directions before use. Children are at increased risk of short- and long-term damage to the skin from solar radiation. Always use [high factor sunscreen](https://www.boots.com/holidays/suncare) (at least SPF 30) with 4/5 stars. Apply this at least 30 minutes before going into the sun and reapply it regularly, especially after swimming. Avoid the sun when it's at its strongest, in the UK this is between 11 am and 3 pm. A UV suit with long sleeves could be a useful barrier and a hat should always be worn. For young children, a blackout sunshade can be a really useful way to protect your child whilst in a pushchair or pram and a pop-up beach tent can provide shade whilst on the beach. Children's eyes are vulnerable to the sun's glare and therefore [sunglasses](https://www.boots.com/holidays/sunglasses/kids-teens-sunglasses) or [goggles](https://www.boots.com/zoggs-little-bondi-goggles-aqua-pink-purple-up-to-6-years-10306077) with elasticated straps should be worn, where possible. All medication must be kept out of children's reach at the destination. Keep medicines in child-proof containers and store on top of a wardrobe or in a safe. With adequate preparation, travelling in your senior years can be an enjoyable and safe experience. Older travellers sometimes have long-term medical problems which can increase the risk of complications from travel health-related issues. Pre-travel health preparation is important to ensure a happy and healthy holiday. If you have any pre-existing medical conditions, check that you will have enough medication to cover you while abroad. If your condition isn't stable or you have any concerns about your health, you should speak to your GP in advance of your trip (at least 6-8 weeks). A \"Fitness to Fly\" assessment may be required by the airline. Ensure you have comprehensive travel insurance and declare all pre-existing medical conditions and trip details, or your policy may be invalid. Check the policy will cover the cost of medical treatment and repatriation should this be required. Organisations such as Diabetes UK, Age UK or Parkinson's Society provide specialist advice for these pre-existing medical problems. Keep a note of the emergency contact numbers for your insurance company, which should be contacted early if medical help is required. Ask your Boots Pharmacist about your destination as you may need vaccinations and advice regarding malaria risk at the destination. Older age can make you more at risk of malaria. The immune system changes with age; vaccines may not work as well, and the length of protection can be shorter. Older age is listed as a precaution for yellow fever vaccination; however, the vaccination can be offered after a careful risk assessment. This will be discussed in your travel health consultation. Make sure you have enough of your regular medicines for your whole trip plus 1-2 weeks more than you need in case some gets lost/stolen. It is advisable to take enough medication with you for your trip, as brands, strengths and qualities of drugs available abroad vary and fake (counterfeit) medicines are common in some countries and this could affect your medical condition. Know how to store your medicines in very hot and cold climates. Keep medicines in original packaging and carry a printed letter with a list of your prescribed medicines from your GP. Cruises are a popular way to travel and allow passengers to visit exotic and sometimes, remote destinations. Due to the nature of a cruise, you are likely to be in close proximity to large numbers of other travellers in an enclosed environment which can increase your risk of illness, including those spread via the respiratory route or via food/water. Before you go, it is recommended that you speak to a healthcare professional before travelling to discuss any health concerns and the suitability of your trip. This should be done, ideally, at least 4-6 weeks before departure. Domestic cruise operators departing and returning from the UK will have a vaccination policy and require that all passengers present a negative COVID-19 test before boarding. The Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) provide [further guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cruise-ship-travel#history). If you require any specialist assistance or have any special requirements, such as needing wheelchair use, oxygen cylinders, dietary restrictions, refrigeration for medicines (e.g., insulin), storage for a sharps container etc., you should inform your cruise operator prior to departure. If you have a pacemaker, you should carry an alert card and advise security staff if you are unable to pass through x-ray screening arches. It is likely that you will need to pass through security each time you board the boat. Depending on your destinations and the times you spend onshore, you may require antimalarial medication. There are several different antimalarials - your pharmacist will discuss which ones are suitable for your destinations and for you personally, when you book a [malaria prevention appointment](https://www.boots.com/vaccinations/malaria-prevention-service) with a Boots Pharmacist or via an online anti-malaria consultation. They can also provide you with details about the medications' side effects and how to take them. You will need to share your full itinerary with your pharmacist to enable them to provide you with accurate recommendations. It is important to protect yourself against mosquito bites and diseases such as malaria, Zika and dengue, especially while onshore or on deck. Your Boots pharmacist will give you advice. Vaccinations Depending on your destinations and activities, you may require vaccinations. You should ensure all routine vaccination are up to date, including those which are specifically recommended because of any existing medical conditions. Flu: outbreaks are common on cruise ships and therefore all passengers are recommended to consider a flu vaccination before they travel. Flu vaccinations are funded by the NHS for people with certain medical conditions or depending on your age. If you are not entitled to a FREE NHS vaccination, they are available for a small fee. Your Boots pharmacist can advise you on all your vaccination requirements. For more information on the Boots Flu Jab service click [here](http://www.boots.com/flu). Yellow fever: some destinations may be considered a risk for yellow fever and some countries request proof of vaccination at the border to gain entry. Your full itinerary should be shared with your Boots pharmacist who can advise you. It is important that the itinerary is provided in the correct order of destinations to be visited as this could affect the yellow fever vaccination requirements. Covid-19: you may also be asked for proof of your Covid-19 vaccinations by your cruise operator and the individual countries you plan to visit. You should check the country requirements for each country you plan to visit via the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office [page](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice). You should also research their requirements for mask wearing and social distancing. It is also worth remembering the following when considering going on a cruise: Pack a [first aid kit](https://www.boots.com/boots-travel-first-aid-kit-10258543) which should include: [dressings](https://www.boots.com/health-pharmacy/medicines-treatments/first-aid/bandages-dressings-and-plasters), and antiseptic wipes for wound care, medicines and oral [rehydration sachets](https://www.boots.com/boots-rehydration-treatment-6-sachets-10074961) for treating travellers' diarrhoea, pain relief medication, and [antihistamine tablets](https://www.boots.com/health-pharmacy/medicines-treatments/allergy-hayfever); your Boots pharmacist can help you with these items. You may experience seasickness on board the ship, even if you have not experienced it before. You can ask your Boots pharmacist for suitable medications and products including [travel sickness bands](https://www.boots.com/boots-adult-travel-bands-1-pair-12-years-10112488) to help alleviate this. You might want to consider adding these to your first aid kit just in case.
