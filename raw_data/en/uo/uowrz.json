Estimated coverage was highest among Asian children and lowest among Black children. Vaccination coverage declined for children living below the federal poverty level or in rural areas during the pandemic. Substantial variation in coverage by sociodemographic characteristics persists. 1920 CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | January 12th, 2023CDC Let's RISE ( Routine Immunizations on Schedule for Everyone) Campaign 21 CDC Let's RISE (Routine Immunizations on Schedule for Everyone) Campaign22 CDC COVID -19 Child Age Transition Guide |CDC Appendix D.

Beyond Use Dates/Times (BUD) The last day/time that the COVID -19 vaccine can be safely used after it has been transitioned between storage states (thawed, refrigerated, etc.), or altered (diluted, drawn up for administration, etc.) for patient use. The BUD replaces the manufacturer's expiration date but never extends it. Dispose of the vaccine on whichever date/time comes first! 28 Reminder: Record Vaccine Waste in myCAvax A large amount of COVID -19 vaccine is expiring right now. Remember to report all expired, wasted, and spoiled vaccine to myCAvax . Properly dispose of any expired vaccine so that it is not accidentally administered to patients.

Order Review and Approval Reminders 34Moderna and Pfizer Infant / Toddler Bivalent Vaccine supply is expected to continue to belimited. This is primarily due to very low vaccination administration and a significant number of on -hand inventory levels within the state, as well as overall low vaccination rates for this age group, nationally. No additional threshold increases are expected for these products. Providers may still submit orders for these product as needed. However, they are advised to place Small Orders for this product if doses are available for local fulfillment or redirect orders for Third Party Redistributor (TPR) fulfillment; or LHJs may reduce their request to place new Small Orders for Providers through the TPR. Providers may also utilize the Vaccine Marketplace to post excess inventory of these products or determine if excess doses are available from neighboring Providers in your community. When possible, schedule infants and toddlers on the same day to maximize vaccinations and reduce waste.35Novavax Final Standard Orders The current USG supply of Novavax will expire on February 28, 2023, and willNOT receive shelf -life extensions. CDC will be turning off ordering for Novavax on January 30, 2023. Shipment for this product will stop in early February. In order to ensure orders are placed prior to CDC discontinuing standard CDPH will be doing an off -cycle ordering schedule for Novavax orders. oFinal provider orders are due on Friday, January 27. oApproved orders will be processed and transmitted to CDC on Monday January 30th, in the afternoon. Small orders for Novavax will still be available until vaccine expiry, as local supply allows.Order Review and Approval Reminders 36APPENDIXSlide Icon Key 37 Icon Meaning This is to label slides that are referencing upcoming or existing functionality and how to use it in the system.

My Turn Best Practices (A 2023 House Cleaning Guide) 38 Best Practice How To 1.Set clinic duration for three months to avoid having defunct clinics listed on the public site.You can create clinics before making them visible to the public using the 'Clinic Visibility' settings. Set an appropriate \"Available Date\" that you'd like the public to begin booking appointments. 2.Create one clinic per location that supports multiple vaccines and brands to simplify management and updates.If you have multiple clinics at the same location offering different vaccine products, combine all clinics into one. You can combine clinics by: Ending all existing clinics and use the 'Clinic Set Up Wizard' to create a new clinic with all vaccine brands. Adding the appropriate Vaccine Inventory and Supply to an existing clinic and ending all other clinics. Export Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) data within 4 weeks.

We are currently investigating an issue in which some accounts that have been recently re- activated (from 'Order Hold' > 'Active') might bemissing 'Provider Inventories' for new products added while they were inactive. This may lead to issues with transfers not being created or unable to be accepted / rejected. Workaround/Next Steps Estimated Fix: 2/09/2023 CDPH has temporary workarounds to prevent this while a permanent solution is worked. My Turn -Known Issues -Updated 01/19 40 Known Issues Username / Login Issues Some My Turn users that had both My Turn and myCAvax accounts but used different versions of their name for each system are currently experiencing issues when logging into My Turn using login credentials ending in '. mycavax '. Creating Clinics with Multiple Vaccines If you attempt to create a clinic using the 'Clinic Setup Wizard' with more than two vaccine products, you'll receive an error preventing clinic creation. Clinic Inventory Creation Users were unable to create new Clinic Inventory due to missing required fields. Workaround/Next Steps Estimated Fix: TBD Workaround: Users experiencing this issue should log into My Turn using '.mycavax1' instead of '. mycavax ' until this issue is resolved. For additional login support contact the My Turn Help Desk at MyTurn.Clinic.HD@cdph.ca.gov Estimated Fix: TBD Workaround: Use the 'Clinic Setup Wizard' to create a clinic with two or fewer vaccine products (e.g., Pfizer and flu). After clinic creation, add Vaccine Inventory and Vaccine Supply for additional vaccine products.

BPC section 688( i) also states pharmacists may continue to dispense medications from legally valid written, oral, or faxed prescriptions pursuant to law. This is also addressed in Question 3 of the California Board of Pharmacy's Electronic Data Transmission Prescriptions -Frequently Asked Questions -California State Board of Pharmacy When deciding whether to refuse to dispense an otherwise legally valid written, oral, or faxed prescription solely because it was not transmitted electronically, a pharmacist should consider the impact on the patient and continuity of care.
