While there are changes in public settings, there is NO change while in a healthcare setting; therefore, everyone in the clinic is still required to wear a mask per WA State Department of Health. Per the CDC recommendation that was also adopted by Gov Inslee on May 13, 2021 and as provided in Order of the Secretary of Health, fully vaccinated individuals are not required to wear a face covering inside or outside except when in health care settings, correctional facilities, homeless shelters, schools, and public transportation (collectively called \"CDC exemption locations\"). COVID protocols at Schoeb Chiropractic are in place and our clinic is OPEN as we are considered ESSENTIAL HEALTHCARE. We are accepting both new and established patients. We continue to monitor and comply with all COVID related protocols and requirements from the State of Washington and the Department of Health. Here are the protocols we have in place: Providers and Staff Wear masks at all times within the clinic Wash/sanitize hands in between all patient contact Clean door handles, card reader (contactless payment available), adjusting tables, bathrooms, and pens in between patients Commercial cleaning to fully sanitize all surfaces Appointments are spaced out to allow for cleaning in between each patient visit Patients Sanitize hands immediately upon entering the clinic (sanitizer and soap provided at entry) Temperature scans prior to treatment If a patient has COVID symptoms such as loss of smell, exposure, and recent travel, they are not allowed in the clinic and will be asked to reschedule. If contact with COVID person has been made current guidelines on quarantine located here: [COVID-19: When to Quarantine | CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html) Masks required unless one of few exemptions (if unable to wear a mask for medical reasons you must notify us prior to your appointment as additional procedures must be followed) Limit family members in office to those getting treatment Online paperwork is available for new patients to limit contact with pens and clipboards, however, pens and clipboards will be sanitized in between each use if needed Please arrive on time to your appointment. Patients are spaced out accordingly to limit the number of people in the clinic at one time. If you are early or late, do not walk in to the clinic. Please call to see if capacity is suitable for you to enter. As always, our commitment is to create the best possible environment for our staff and patients, while continuing to support our community by offering chiropractic care as an essential healthcare provider. Over the last few months, CDC recommendations have changed. We are committed to updating our protocols based on CDC guidelines. "}
