To qualify for admission to a skilled nursing unit in Denver, a person must be deemed to have a medical condition that requires round-the-clock medical care. This could be due to a chronic medical condition, rehabilitative care after an illness or surgery, or the need for hospice. Skilled nursing facilities in Denver have amenities and services for both short-term and long-term stays. Skilled nursing in Denver is the most expensive type of care due to the high level of 24/7 medical care provided. However, many seniors in Denver do not require this level of care and instead opt for assisted living communities. Assisted living in Denver has options Assisted living communities provide help with activities of daily living (ADLs), daily food service, personalized care, and a variety of other amenities and activities. In Denver, assisted living facilities can range from resort-style luxury communities to budget-friendly, homelike complexes. The majority of assisted living in Denver is focused on the outskirts of the city and in the broader suburban area. This is partially due to the fact that the downtown area tends to be more expensive and partially because it is difficult to access \u2014 and loved ones prefer to be able to reach their senior loved ones easily and quickly, if possible. Memory care options in Denver are plentiful For seniors experiencing dementia, Alzheimer's, or other forms of cognitive decline, they have the choice of entering a standalone memory care facility or an assisted living facility with memory care on-site. Within a 25-mile radius of downtown, there are 106 facilities that have dedicated memory care services. These communities include amenities and services typical to assisted living facilities but also provide specialized dementia care, such as 24/7 oversight, secured entrances, and person-centered therapies designed to reduce agitation and confusion.
