TRANSFER POLICIES Evaluation of Transfer Credit Once a student is admitted to UTEP as a transfer student, the Office of Admissions and Recruitment will provide a generic evaluation of courses that are transferable to the University. Credits transfer into the University in several ways, including as elective credits. Acceptance of transfer credit by UTEP does not constitute approval of the credit for use toward a particular degree program. The applicability of transfer courses toward a degree is determined by the academic dean or the advisor in one's major or his or her designate. Students should request a degree plan from their academic department or dean's office by the time 60 semester hours have been earned. Transfer credits are awarded according to the following policies: 1 . Transfer credit is generally awarded for academic courses completed at regionally accredited or nationally recognized institutions, or from institutions that are candidates for regional accreditation if the credit was earned during the candidacy period. 2 . In general, only academic courses that are comparable in content to those offered at UTEP are transferable, and transfer credit carries the same value as work completed at UTEP. Whenever possible, equivalent course numbers are given; if there are no numerical equivalents, elective (TR) credit is given. 3 . Only courses with grades of A, B, C, D, Credit, or Pass are evaluated, and quarter hours are converted to semester hours by multiplying the quarter hours by two-thirds. 4 . Courses classified below freshman level by sending previous institution are not transferable. 5 . Courses from two-year lower-division institutions transfer as lower division credit 6 . Undergraduate courses from four-year institutions transfer at the same level (lower-to-lower and upper-to-upper division). 7 . Graduate-level coursework is not transferable as undergraduate credit. 8 . There is no limit on the total number of hours that can be transferred from other institutions. However, a maximum of 66 semester hours of credit from two-year lower-division institutions is applicable toward a degree at UTEP. 9 . Grades earned at other institutions are not averaged into the UTEP grade point average. A transfer grade point average is not computed, and only credit hours transfer to UTEP. 10 . Equivalent transfer credit for engineering courses is granted only for work completed at ABET-accredited institutions. 11 . Equivalent transfer credit for upper-division business courses is granted only for work completed at AACSB-accredited institutions. 12 . Completion of the core curriculum, or blocks within the core, at another Texas institution is considered as completion of the core, or appropriate blocks within the core, at UTEP. 13 . Individual core courses completed at another Texas institution will be designated as core courses at UTEP. 14 . UTEP does not award university credit for professional certificates or life experience. Awarding Credit for Military Service In accordance with Texas Education Code, Section 51.3042; eligible former members of the armed forces admitted to UTEP as an undergraduate or readmitted as an undergraduate (after having withdrawn to perform military service) will be given course credit for all physical education courses the institution requires for an undergraduate degree and for additional semester credit hours, not to exceed 12, to satisfy any elective course requirements for the student's degree program for courses outside the student's major or minor. The University of Texas at El Paso does not have any degree programs that require physical education courses and so will not award any physical education credit under Texas Education Code, Section 51.3042. Incoming students who meet the requirements will, however, be eligible to receive up to 12 semester hours of credit for elective coursework that will be applied toward their degree. To be eligible, a veteran must have graduated from an accredited public or private high school or a high school operated by the US Department of Defense, and be honorably discharged from the US armed forces after completing at least two years of service or discharged because of disability. To have the credit awarded, students must complete a Military Service Credit Request form and must provide proof of eligibility (i.e., DD214 or disability discharge documentation. The form can be found at www.utep.edu/admit under \"Online Forms\" or can be requested by calling the Office of Admissions and Recruitment at 915-747-5890. Once processed (and approved), the appropriate amount of elective credit will be added to the student's official academic record; effective the date of approval. Please note, this process (including the awarding of credit) is irrevocable. Therefore, carefully consideration should be given to the total effect of the additional course credit to degree progress and other institutional rules. Credit earned under this policy does not prohibit UTEP from awarding additional military educational experience credit based on American Council of Education (ACE) Guide recommendations. Resolution of Transfer Disputes If the University refuses to accept lower-division credit earned at another Texas public institution of higher education, students and the institution where the credit was earned will be given written notice that the transfer credit was denied. If the denial of transfer credit is contested, UTEP will attempt to resolve the issue with the student and the sending institution according to applicable rules and guidelines of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. If the dispute is not resolved to the student's satisfaction or to the satisfaction of the sending institution within 45 days of the initial notification, the University will notify the Coordinating Board of the denial of the transfer credit and the reason for the denial. The Coordinating Board will resolve the dispute and notify all involved parties of its findings. Questions concerning the evaluation of transfer credit should be referred to the Office of Admissions and Recruitment. UTEP students who have difficulty having UTEP credit accepted at other Texas public institutions should contact the Director of Admissions and Recruitment at UTEP for initiation of the transfer dispute resolution process. Individual Review Applicants who do not meet the requirements for transfer admission described above or whose individual circumstances are highly unusual with respect to their academic credentials can apply to be reviewed on an individual basis. This review gives consideration to the applicant's high school and college record, the strength of academic preparation, types of courses taken, and grades earned in specific courses. Performance on standardized tests is also considered. Applicants can submit additional material or an essay for consideration in evaluating their potential for success at UTEP. Such material can document, for example, the applicant's work experience; achievements, honors, and awards; responsibilities while attending school, including child or elder care or other major responsibilities; bilingual proficiency; socioeconomic background; residency status; involvement in community and extra-curricular activities; status as a first-generation college student; commitment to a particular field of study; strengths and talents that might not be apparent from the academic record: and experiences in surmounting obstacles in pursuit of higher education.

International Student Test Score Requirements All international students who have not earned a baccalaureate degree from a college or university in the United States must submit entrance examination scores. All test scores must be official and submitted directly from the testing agency to the Office of Admissions and Recruitment. The UTEP school codes are 6829 for the SAT, 4223 for the ACT, and 6829 for the TOEFL. Students who have successfully completed the University's English Language Institute meet the English proficiency requirement for regular admission. High school instruction in a language other than English. Students whose high school instruction was not in English are required to take the TOEFL; a minimum score of 500 is required on the paper-based exam, 73 on the computer-based exam, and 61 on the Internet exam. High school instruction in Spanish. The Prueba de Aptitud Academica (PAA) should be taken if the student's primary language is Spanish and she or he does not pass the TOEFL; a total score of 1000 is required on the PAA. If the student is admitted on the basis of the PAA, he or she will enroll in the bilingual Programa Interamericano Estudiantil (PIE) program. PIE students must enroll in ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) courses. Once ESOL 1610 has been completed with a grade of C or better, the student can change to a major of choice. The Student Assessment and Testing Web site at www.utep.edu/testing contains information about test dates and registration. If your academic background is unusual or is not described above, you should contact the Office of Admissions and Recruitment to determine which test is appropriate. International Student Financial Aid Financial assistance for our international students is limited. After admission and before an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility for Non-Immigrant Student Status (CFR) can be issued, international students must furnish a Certification of Financial Responsibility (CFR) documenting the source and amount of funding available to cover the cost of attendance while enrolled at UTEP. Citizens of Mexico who meet the requirements of the Programa de Asistencia Estudiantil (PASE) might qualify to pay Texas resident tuition. For additional information, contact the Office of International Programs at 915.747.5664. To learn more about financial assistance, contact the Office of Financial Aid at 915.747.5204. Insurance is required of international students holding non-immigrant visas and living in the United States. The amount assessed will match the University of Texas System Student Insurance Plan premium. SPECIAL ADMISSIONS PROGRAMS Programa Interamericano Estudiantil (PIE) Programa Interamericano Estudiantil is a bilingual instruction program designed for students from Spanish-speaking countries who wish to attend UTEP and who need to improve their English. We welcome your application if you scored 1000 or higher on the PAA. The PIE coordinates first-level content courses taught in Spanish (for example, U.S. History) that students can take while enrolling in ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) courses to increase your English language proficiency. Once ESOL 1610 has been completed with a grade of C or better, students can change into a their major of choice and use the courses taken toward their graduation requirements. For further assistance, academic advising is required every semester in the Academic Advising Center. Summer Guest Program Students currently pursuing degrees at other institutions and wishing to continue studies at UTEP during the summer can be admitted as Summer Guest (transient) Students. To be considered for admission as a Summer Guest, a student must submit the following: Summer Guest application Official transcripts showing a minimum of 12 semester hours of college level work with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0. Official transcripts are needed to verify prerequisite requirements for the summer courses the student intends to take at UTEP. A new application must be submitted for every subsequent summer enrollment along with updated official transcripts. If a student wishes to be admitted to UTEP as a regular student, she or he must apply for admission as a transfer student. For transfer admission information, please contact the Office of Admission & Recruitment at 915.747.5890 Junior Scholars Program The Junior Scholars Program is a cooperative effort between The University of Texas at El Paso and El Paso-area public and private schools, allowing qualified students to enroll in regular University courses while attending high school. Hours earned will count as University credit and some courses can also be approved to apply toward high school graduation requirements. For more information on this program, contact Student Success Programs at 915.747.5858. Early Admission Program UTEP's Early Admission Program allows students to enroll concurrently in high school and University courses if they are in their last semester of high school and meet the requirements for first-year admission. Students interested in early admission must also submit a letter of recommendation from their high school counselor or principal. Continued high school enrollment is a condition of the Early Admission Program. For more information, contact the Office of Admissions and Recruitment at 915.747.5890. Flexible Admission Program (FLEX) Flexible Admission Program (FLEX) The Flexible Admission Program is designed for our first-time, non-traditional students who have never attended a college or university and who do not intend to pursue a degree at the time of admission. FLEX students can take selected basic courses to meet their personal educational objectives or to complete courses in a particular field for professional reasons. FLEX Program applicants must meet the following criteria: Be at least 23 years of age Be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States Have had no previous college or university experience Complete the undergraduate application for admission. Once admitted under this option, students are subject to the same tuition, fees, and regulations as degree-seeking students. A maximum of 30 semester hours can be accumulated while in the FLEX Program, and the Director of Admissions must approve any FLEX enrollment beyond 30 hours. Students who choose to change from FLEX to degree-seeking status are required to meet all the requirements for regular admission. The late application fee does not apply to you as a FLEX applicant. Admission into a non-degree program such as FLEX excludes you from participation in federally funded financial aid programs. German Abitur Program German NATO forces stationed at Fort Bliss often have children whose high school education has been interrupted by their family's move to the United States. UTEP has developed a 60-hour academic curriculum that the German Ministry of Education considers to be equivalent to completion of the diploma required for admission to higher education in Germany ( Abitur ). Students who complete this curriculum at UTEP can be considered for admission to German universities when they return to their home country. To participate in the Abitur program, students must apply for admission, submit documents showing completion of a United States high school diploma or its equivalent, provide a statement of financial support, and submit satisfactory TOEFL, SAT, or ACT scores as determined by the Admissions Office. Abitur students will be advised by the Academic Advising Center for the duration of their enrollment at UTEP. Academic Fresh Start Program An applicant for undergraduate admission who is a Texas resident can choose to enter UTEP under the Academic Fresh Start statute, Texas Education Code \u00a751.931 by submitting the Academic Fresh Start Acknowledgement Form to the Office of Admissions and Recruitment. Once the request has been processed, UTEP will not consider in its admission decision any credit or grades taken 10 or more years prior to enrollment. Courses excluded for Academic Fresh Start purposes are not: Considered as transfer credit. Counted toward a degree. Counted in the cumulative GPA calculation. Used to remove any existing high school deficiencies. Used to meet prerequisite requirements. For returning students, these courses and grades will remain part of their official UTEP academic record, and notation will be made on the transcript indicating the portion of the record that is to be included in computing requirements for graduation. READMISSION Students who meet the criteria listed below must apply for readmission to the University: Former students who last attended UTEP prior to January 1, 1984. Students who were previously admitted to UTEP but never enrolled in courses. Junior Scholars who have graduated from high school and wish to continue at UTEP as regular students. Summer Guest students who want to transfer to UTEP. Students seeking a second bachelor's degree. Students who have attended other colleges or universities since last attending UTEP must submit complete, official transcripts in order to evaluate any course work completed and make it part of the complete undergraduate academic record. Readmission of Student Who Withdraws to Perform Active Military Service This section applies to students who withdraw from the University to perform active military service as a member of the United States armed forces or the Texas National Guard. Students requesting readmission within one year after being released from active military service will be readmitted to the University if they are eligible to register for classes. Upon readmission, the University shall: Provide any financial assistance previously provided before the students' withdrawal, if students meet current eligibility requirements for the assistance, other than any requirement directly affected by their service, such as continuous enrollment or another similar timing requirement; and Allow students the same academic status that they had before the withdrawal, including any course credit awarded The University might adopt rules requiring reasonable proof from students regarding the fact and duration of their military service. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION We recognize academic achievement acquired outside the classroom and are pleased to offer UTEP credit for the courses listed below based on successful performance on the International Baccalaureate (IB), College Entrance Examination Board's Advanced Placement (AP) Examinations, College Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests, SAT II Subject Tests, DSST (DANTES Subject Standardized Tests), and departmental examinations. These tests, cut-off scores, and testing policies have been approved by the academic colleges and departments teaching the respective courses. There might be other areas in which departmental examinations can be given for credit; please contact the appropriate academic departments for the availability of such examinations. Credit by Examination Policies 1 . Credit by examination is available to our currently and formerly enrolled UTEP students unless credit has been earned for a higher level course in that subject area or a grade other than W has been received in the course. 2 . Official score reports must be sent directly from the testing agency to the Admissions Office. 3 . Departmental test results and recommendations, with the approval of the department chair and the academic dean, must be sent directly to the Records Office. 4 . If a student has received credit by examination at another institution and have completed more advanced work in that subject area with a grade of C or better, credit will be allowed based on the basis of the other institution's transcript. Otherwise, official score reports must be submitted directly from the testing agency to the Admissions Office. 5 . Credit earned by examination satisfies degree requirements in the same way as credit earned by classroom instruction. There is no limit to the amount of credit that can be earned by examination, and credit by examination can be used to meet prerequisites for higher-level courses. 6 . Credit earned by examination does not fulfill the UTEP degree requirement for completion of 30 semester hours in residence. 7 . Credit earned by examination is recorded as a grade of CR. It is included in hours earned, but not in the grade point average calculation. 8 . Credit by examination is recorded on the official UTEP academic record after your first enrollment at the University. 9 . Changes in credit by examination policies, tests, and cut-off scores become effective the semester after the changes are approved.

Credit for Non-Traditional Educational Experiences Credit for non-traditional educational experiences is awarded based on American Council on Education (ACE) recommendations published in the National Guide to Educational Credit for Training Programs and the Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services when such recommendations are similar to courses offered at UTEP. Direct course equivalents are given for lower division ACE recommendations where applicable. Lower-division or advanced elective credit will be given for other ACE recommendations where appropriate. The academic dean or department will determine the applicability of elective credit to a student's degree plan. Official records verifying course completion from the appropriate agency or from the ACE Registry of Credit Recommendations must be submitted to the Admissions Office. If an Army/American Council on Education Registry Transcript System (AARTS) or Navy Sailor/Marine American Council on Education Registry Transcript (SMART) transcript is not available to verify military experience, official copies of the certificates of completion must be submitted. Go Centers Go Centers are a Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board initiative to increase postsecondary admission and enrollment among prospective college. The purpose of the Go Centers is to raise awareness among students and their families about the benefits of higher education and how to be academically and financially prepared, and they serve as one of the points of coordination between the College for Texans efforts and local schools. Go Centers are located in local high schools and staffed by UTEP students with the assistance of high school counselors. The Centers have information regarding admission to colleges and universities, financial aid, scholarships, and other materials to help foster the affordability and attainability of higher education.

Lerma The Office of Student Financial Aid assists qualified students in meeting the costs of college education. No person is excluded from participating on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, veteran status, disability, or sexual orientation. We welcome inquiries by mail, e-mail, telephone and personal visits. Appropriate forms are available at El Paso-area high schools in the counselors' offices and at our office. FINANCIAL AID POLICY The amount and type of financial assistance provided through educational loans, grants, and college work-study programs follow existing federal, state, and local regulations and policies governing financial aid programs. Priority is given to UTEP undergraduate students with documented need, who meet academic eligibility criteria, who are enrolled on a full- time basis (12 hours or more), and whose applications are received by the priority date of March 15 each year for the upcoming academic year. Financial aid awards are based on financial need and academic merit. To apply, a student must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to determine financial need for the aid period. The cost of attending the University is the student budget. The student's financial resources, combined with those of the student's parents if the student depends on them, compromise the student/family contribution. Financial assistance includes all non-Title IV scholarships, grants, loans, or other assistance, such as Veterans Educational Benefits. The difference among the student budget, family contribution, and financial assistance determines the student's financial need. For a detailed breakdown of direct and indirect educational costs, students should contact the Financial Aid Office. APPLICATION PROCESS March 15 is the application submission priority date for each school year. All forms and required documents are due and must be completely processed by the Office of Student Financial Aid by this date for one to be considered for the maximum aid available. The processing of financial aid documents can take at least four weeks. Late applications will be considered on the basis of available funds. Information that UTEP obtains from a student's need analysis is used to determine financial need and the types of awards for which one is qualified. Awards fall into two categories: (1) gift aid, which includes grants and (2) self-help funds, which include the College Work-Study Program and long-term educational loans. The amount of aid awarded, combined with the student's resources (student/family contribution), cannot exceed the student budget. Once the documented need is established, the Office of Student Financial Aid will make every effort to meet that need. The financial aid award will be packaged from a variety of sources and will be based on the financial need, program eligibility, and availability of funds. In some instances, the total award might be less than the documented need because of fund limitations, program eligibility requirements, or other factors. If a student wishes to apply for financial assistance for the spring semester, he or she will be considered based on the availability of funds after UTEP receives the financial aid documents. Students should refer to the Tuition and Fees Emergency Loan section of this catalog for non-need emergency loan fund programs. If a student is subject to Selective Service registration, she or he must file a statement indicating whether one has registered for or is exempt from service registration, in order to be eligible to apply for federal or state financial aid. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS (SAP) CRITERIA The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is mandated by the Department of Education (DOE) to establish minimum Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standards for students receiving financial aid. UTEP's SAP policy encourages a student to progress, in a successful and timely manner, toward completion of their program of study (degree) for which the student is receiving financial aid. At UTEP, SAP is comprised of both a qualitative standard and a quantitative standard ( see below for explanations ). These standards apply to the student's entire academic history, whether financial aid was received or not, and to all types of aid awarded (federal and state grants, loans and work-study). UTEP's Office of Student Financial Aid will update a student's SAP status at the end of every semester. A student may check their current SAP status by going to mystatus.utep.edu in the Check Status tool/portal at after all course grades are posted. A student will receive notification via a letter if they are not meeting any of the following SAP requirements: low GPA and/or failing to complete 75% of attempted hours * and/or exceeding the \"maximum timeframe\" ( see below for further explanation of these items ). * NOTE: Attempted hours include transferable hours that count only toward a student's degree plan at UTEP as well as all hours attempted at UTEP ( see \" measureable progress \" section II. b. for more information on \" attempted hours \" ). Students are responsible for determining into what courses they should enroll, in order to comply with this requirement, by following their degree plan. Degree plans can be found in the \"Degree Evaluation\" link, in student's Goldmine account, under the \"Student Records\" link. Qualitative and Quantitative Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards Qualitative Standard--Grade Point Average (GPA) Grade point average (GPA) is the qualitative cumulative measurement used to track the quality of the student's academic performance at UTEP. To remain eligible to benefit from Financial Aid, a student must maintain at least a 2.00 GPA if pursuing an undergraduate degree, and a 3.00 GPA if pursuing a graduate degree. Students pursuing certification programs must meet the GPA requirements of the certification to remain eligible. Certain financial aid programs (ACG, SMART, TEACH Grant, TEXAS Grant, and the UTEP Promise) may require a higher GPA standard for those students pursuing an undergraduate degree. The table below illustrates the financial aid programs and the applicable GPA requirement by academic level. Academic Level Financial Aid Program GPA Requirement Undergraduate ACG 3.00 SMART 3.00 TEACH Grant 3.25 TEXAS Grant 2.0 Initial 2.5 to renew UTEP Promise 2.00 All other aid 2.00 Graduate All Aid 3 Alternative Certification All Aid 2.5Quantitative Standard: Maximum Timeframe and Progression Toward A Degree or Certificate The \"quantitative standard,\" as defined by the DOE, tracks the amount of credit hours attempted toward completion of an eligible degree program and whether the appropriate proportion of those hours are completed without surpassing the maximum number of hours allowed for such degree. ( The DOE provides a glossary of terms at www.studentaid.ed.gov ). Maximum Timeframe Undergraduate and graduate students, receiving financial aid, cannot attempt more than 150% of the published length of the degree program as measured by credit hours. (Students may view their \"Degree Evaluation\" online, in their Goldmine account, under the \"Student Records\" link). For example: If the length of a student's undergraduate academic program (degree plan) is 120 total credit hours, then the \"maximum timeframe\" would equal150% of 120 credit hours for a total of 180 credit hours. To calculate \"maximum timeframe\" simple multiply 1.5 by the length of the degree program in credit hours to arrive at the maximum attempted credit hours allowed before financial aid eligibility runs out. Completed Degree or Change of Major Credit hours obtained in a completed degree (i.e. a certificate, associates, bachelors, masters, etc.) will not affect a student's \"maximum timeframe\" by beginning a new degree. In addition, students who change their major will not have the attempted credit hours count against them. Measurable Progress--Progression Toward A Degree or Certificate The DOE calls progress toward a degree or certificate \"measurable progress.\" \"Measurable progress\" is determined by the cumulative completion of at least 75% of all attempted hours toward a student's degree plan in an academic year. For UTEP this determination is made only during the summer session. For example, If a freshmen student has attempted 12 total credit hours in the fall, plus 12 total hours in the spring, plus 6 total hours in the summer, he/she has attempted 30 total credit hours for the academic year. Assuming the student has earned/passed 21 of the 30 total credit hours attempted, the student would be making satisfactory academic progress; or To calculate this it would be 30 (total attempted hours during an academic year) x .75 = 21 earned/passed hours, the minimum required to meet \"measurable progress,\" as defined by the DOE. Certain financial aid programs (ACG, SMART, TEACH Grant, TEXAS Grant, and the UTEP Promise) may require a specific number of completed/earned hours to remain eligible within an academic year (fall, spring, summer). For example, the TEXAS Grant requires the completion of 24 completed/earned hours. See the financial aid web site for details on each program at www.utep.edu/financialaid . All programs, however, fall under the \"measurable progress\" DOE rule of 75% completion of attempted hours. The chart below is a guide to determine if the \"measurable progress\" standard is being met. To find out the number of attempted credit hours that a student must earned to remain in good standing for satisfactory academic progress, find the total number of hours attempted at UTEP in column A.

At the end of any term, if a student has reached their \"maximum timeframe\" they will receive a \"termination\" of financial aid letter. Otherwise, at the end of the academic year, if a student is not meeting SAP they will receive notification, via a letter, that they are not meeting any of the SAP requirements: low GPA and/or failing to complete 75% of attempted hours and/or exceeding the \"maximum timeframe.\" Students who have not completed the conditions stipulated in their appeal approval notification are subject to termination. Probation Probation is grace period during which a student receives financial aid. It is available to students, who for the first time in their academic career at UTEP fail to meet either their qualitative and/or the quantitative standard(s) noted above. Students are placed on probation for an academic year. Probation requirements consist of: Meeting all SAP requirements (qualitative and quantitative standards) during the academic year on probation to continue receiving financial aid; otherwise, they will not be eligible and receive a letter of termination. Proof of attendance in one of the Office of Student Financial Aid's Information Sessions on financial literacy the first semester after being placed on probation. The student is expected to follow the instructions on the probation letter. Termination Termination of financial aid may occur for the following reasons: Students who do not meet the requirements of their probation, will not receive financial aid and receive a letter of termination. Students who do not complete the conditions stipulated in their appeal approval notification, will not receive financial aid and receive a letter of termination.Students who do not complete the conditions stipulated in their appeal approval notification, will not receive financial aid and receive a letter of termination. Students who have reached their \"maximum timeframe\" will not receive financial aid and receive a letter of termination. Students who are not meeting any of the SAP requirements (low GPA and/or failing to complete 75% of attempted hours and/or exceeding the \"maximum timeframe\") will not receive financial aid and receive a letter to that effect. At this point, in order to be reinstated, a student will need to complete a \"good semester\" or reestablish financial aid eligibility. Good Semester A \"good semester\" is required prior to the term for which a student wishes to receive financial aid. A \"good semester\" is achieved when a student improves their academic performance. A student must: Register for at least 6 credit hours for which the student must pay ( see number 7 under the appeals process chart ). Payment options are available at loans.utep.edu. Complete 75% of all attempted hours; and Have a 2.00 GPA for their \"good semester.\" Reestablishing Financial Aid Eligibility A student may regain federal student aid eligibility after: The student improves their academic performance to meet the school's SAP standards noted above; or The student successfully appeals their Financial Aid termination. Appeal Process An appeal process is available to any student who is ineligible for financial aid but has extenuating circumstances that prevented him or her from making satisfactory progress. If a student has grounds for an appeal, the student needs to come to the Office of Student Financial Aid (Academic Services Building, room 204) to obtain an appeal form. Below are some examples of extenuating circumstances. ( There may be other extenuating circumstances not listed ). Extenuating Circumstance Documentation Type 1. Death in the immediate family Death Certificate or News Paper Clip 2. Accidents Insurance Claim/Police report 3. Employment changes Unexpected loss of job or attaining a job due to sudden events beyond their control. (Also, having to work because the parent suddenly lost their job.) 4. Legal matters such as divorce/separation Court Order, Letter from Attorney 5. Military deployment Orders 6. Medical Bills, memo from Dr. Dr's Notes; hospital statement 7. Academic performance improvement Grades for one \"Good Semester\"* 8. Extenuating circumstances not listed in 1-7 Varied\u2014check with the Office of Student Financial Aid ** *Students whose appeal is granted must ensure there are no prior balances. Students can view prior term balances in their Goldmine account by clicking on \"Student Records\" then \"Account Summary by Term.\" Questions on prior balances should be directed to Student Business Services (Academic Services Building 118). ** All extenuating circumstances must be documented. If there are grounds for an appeal, the Office of Student Financial Aid will require the following documentation: 1 . An appeal form obtained from Office of Student Financial Aid (Academic Services Building 204); 2 . Supporting documentation relevant to the semester(s) in question; and 3 . A typed personal statement with an explanation of the circumstances which brought about the ineligibility and what has been done to remedy the situation. Appeals are reviewed throughout the year for clearly defined extenuating circumstances (see chart above numbers 1-7). For extenuating circumstances ( see chart above number 8 ) the student's appeal will go through a Financial Aid Internal Review (FAIR) process. The Financial Aid Internal Review (FAIR) will review the provided documentation and make a final decision. Any student anticipating the necessity of requesting an appeal should be prepared to make payment arrangements for his or her own tuition and related fees, in the event the appeal result is unknown by the tuition deadline. ( Payment options are available at loans.utep.edu ). The result of the student's appeal request will be known within a week. Student's whose appeal is denied, will not receive financial aid. If the appeal is denied the student will need to complete a \"good semester\" ( see number IV above ). Special Considerations: Academic Fresh Start, Certifications, Non-degree, and Transfer Students 1 . Academic Fresh Start: Students who return to UTEP under the Academic Fresh Start ( see Academic Fresh Start section in the catalog for details ) and apply for financial aid will be placed on probation ( see probation requirements above ) immediately after being granted an Academic Fresh Start. Academic Fresh Start students will be eligible for financial aid during their probation period. Students, however, who have been taking classes after being granted an Academic Fresh Start and then apply for financial aid, must be making satisfactory academic progress. Students should note that DOE requires an institution to count courses applicable to a student's major (whenever taken) in evaluating a student's satisfactory academic progress. 2 . Certifications : A few certificate programs are eligible for financial aid. To see the updated list of eligible certificate programs go to www.utep.edu/financialaid 3 . Non-degree : Non-Degree seeking students are not eligible for financial aid. To be considered for financial aid, a student must be enrolled in a degree granting program at UTEP. 4 . Transfer Students : Undergraduate students, who begin their academic career at another postsecondary institution and subsequently transfer to UTEP, must have their transcript evaluated by this institution's Undergraduate Admissions and Recruitment Office. Only transferred courses that apply to a student's degree plan at UTEP will be counted toward their \"maximum timeframe\" of attempted hours. For these students, financial aid eligibility is identical to that of UTEP students with comparable credit hours.

Loans The Office of Student Financial Aid offers assistance through various long-term loan programs. If the student is a first-time recipient of a long-term loan, she or he must attend Pre- Loan Counseling or Review Sessions prior to receiving the loan funds. The long-term educational loans available through the Financial Aid Office have many repayment benefits. All of these loans defer payment while one is enrolled in a course of study at least half-time. Loans cannot be released and remaining loan amounts will be canceled if one drops below half-time status. Repayment is made on a monthly basis, not to exceed ten (10) years. Students should refer to the Financial Aid Web site for repayment information. Specific descriptions of the various loan programs are listed below. Loan repayment begins at the end of a grace period or after one ceases to enroll half-time. If one fails to make a payment after the grace period, the loan is in default. The lending agency can then take necessary action to obtain payment, including the use of a collection agency or court action. If this type of action is taken, the student is required to repay the entire loan plus costs of collection. Federal Perkins Loan. This loan requires evidence of financial need. The interest is 5% and does not accrue while you are enrolled at least half-time. There are provisions for partial cancellation and deferral for designated public service. The Perkins Loan is dependent upon the availability of funds. Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan. Starting the fall 2010, UTEP will participate in the Direct Student Loan Program. The Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan is a loan from the U.S. Department of Education made on the basis of the student's financial need and other specific eligibility requirements. The Federal government does not charge interest on these loans while the borrowers are enrolled at least half-time, during a six-month grace period, or during authorized periods of deferment. Federal Subsidized Stafford Student Loan. This loan requires evidence of financial need and is offered through participating lending institutions. The federal government will pay the interest as long as one is enrolled at least half-time. Under this plan, the recipient is responsible for selecting a bank or lending institution that participates in the Federal Family Education Loan Program. This loan is available for both undergraduate and graduate students. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan. Starting the fall of 2010, UTEP will participate in the Direct Student Loan Program. The Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan is a federally financed loan made to students meeting specific eligibility requirements. Interest is charged throughout the life of the loan. The borrower may choose to pay the interest charged on the loan or allow the interest to be capitalized (added to the loan principal) when the loan enters repayment. Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Student Loan . Unlike the Stafford Loan, this loan does not require evidence of financial need. In addition, the student is responsible for the interest on the loan while in school. Tuition and Fees Loans. These loans are available for those who need assistance in meeting the costs of tuition and fees. They are available to resident, non-resident, and international students, and documentation of need as described elsewhere in this section is not required for these loans. The loan must be repaid during the semester in which it is obtained. An annual interest rate of 5% is charged. Please refer to the current Class Schedule for availability dates. Applications for these loans are available at: https://loans.utep.edu . Emergency Book Loans. Emergency book loan funds are available for students who are temporarily in need of funds for books. Regularly enrolled students are eligible if they do not have an outstanding emergency loan or previous semester balance. The loan must be repaid during the semester in which it is obtained. There is a $250.00 limit for book loans. A $10.00 service charge is added to each loan. One can apply for this loan at https://loans.utep.edu . The funds are deposited into the Miner Gold Card to be used at the Campus Bookstore. Hazlewood Act Exemption The Hazlewood Act exempts eligible Texas veterans and their children from the payment of tuition and fees, other than property deposit and student services fees, subject to the following provisions. This exemption does not apply to fees for services or items that are not required for general enrollment or for specific courses that one might take. Eligible veterans or children who are entitled to receive both federal and state veterans' educational benefits for the same semester can do so only if the value of the federal benefit is less than the value of your tuition and fees, less property deposit and student services fees. To be eligible to receive the Hazlewood Act Exemption as a veteran, one must demonstrate Texas residency at the time of entering military service; one must have classified as a Texas resident for tuition purposes for the semester for which the exemption was requested; one must have been honorably discharged from the service; have no federal veterans' educational benefits, or if so, the value of the benefits is less than the value of tuition and fees, less property deposit and student services fees, for the relevant term; one must not be in default on an educational loan made or guaranteed by the State of Texas and one must not be in default on a federal loan if that default is the reason that one cannot use federal veterans' benefits; one must have attempted fewer than 150 hours of college work, and must have followed the application procedures required by these provisions. In addition, one must have served in the Armed Forces or in certain auxiliary services during World War I, World War II (except those who were discharged because they were over the age of 38 or because of a personal request), the Korean War, or served at least 181 days during the Cold War, Viet Nam, Grenada and Lebanon, Panama, Persian Gulf War, the National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks, and any future national emergency declared by law. As a child of a veteran, one is eligible for the Hazlewood Act Exemption if you are classified as a resident of Texas for the semester for which the exemption is requested and one must demonstrate that he or she is a dependent of a member of the U.S. Armed Forces who was a resident of Texas upon entry into the service and who died while in the service, is missing in action, whose death was caused by service-connected injuries, or who became totally disabled for purposes of employability as a result of a service-related injury, and have no federal veterans' educational benefits based on the death or disability of a veteran parent. To obtain this exemption as a veteran, a student must complete the Hazlewood Act Exemption Application, available in the Financial Aid Office. A copy of the Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD-214) and proof of current status regarding eligibility for federal veterans' educational benefits must be submitted. As a child of a veteran applying for the exemption, the student must submit the application, along with proof regarding eligibility for federal benefits on the basis of the parent's service-related death or disability, and documentation that the parent was a resident of Texas when he or she entered the service. It is highly recommended that the student complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to determine federal grant eligibility to obtain student loan history, and to expedite the awarding process.

TUITION REBATES FOR CERTAIN BACCALAUREATE RECIPIENTS The Texas Legislature has authorized a $1,000 tuition rebate for students who complete baccalaureate degrees with no more than three credits in excess of those required for their degrees. The purpose of the program is to provide a financial incentive for students to prepare for university studies while completing their high school work, to avail themselves of academic counseling, make early career decisions, and complete their baccalaureate studies with as few courses outside the degree plan as possible. Minimizing the number of courses taken by a student results in financial savings to students, parents, and the state. The Texas Education Code, Section \u00a754.0065, authorizes UTEP to provide a tuition rebate to students who: Enrolled at UTEP for the first time in the fall semester of 1997or later. Have requested a rebate for semester credit hours achieved toward their first baccalaureate degree. Have been a Texas resident at all times while pursuing the baccalaureate degree; If enrolled for the first time in fall 2005 or later, graduate within four calendar years with a four-year degree or within five calendar years with a five-year degree (if the degree is in architecture, engineering, or any other program determined by the Board to require more than four years to complete). Have attempted no more than three hours in excess of the minimum number of semester credit hours required to complete the degree in the catalog under which they graduated. Hours attempted include transfer credits, course credit earned exclusively by examination (except that, for the purposes of this program, only the number of semester credit hours earned exclusively by examination in excess of nine semester credit hours is treated as hours attempted), courses dropped after the official census date, for-credit developmental courses, optional internship and cooperative education courses, and repeated courses. Courses dropped for reasons that are determined by UTEP to be totally beyond the control of the student shall not be counted. Have applied for rebates prior to receiving their baccalaureate degrees. Teaching Certificates For purposes of the $1,000 tuition rebate, regarding students concurrently earning a baccalaureate degree and a Texas teaching certificate. Required teacher-education courses shall not be counted to the extent that they are over and above the free electives allowed in the baccalaureate degree program. Tuition Rebates Tuition rebates shall be reduced by the amount of any outstanding student loan, including an emergency loan, owed to or guaranteed by the state, including the Texas Guaranteed Student Loan Corporation. For more details about the Tuition Rebate Program, eligibility, and responsibilities, students should contact the Registration and Records Office, Academic Services Building, Room 123 915.747.5544. Further information on the Tuition Rebate Program can be found at ww.thecb.state.tx.us/rules/13/13F.htm and www.capitol.state.tx.us . TUITION LIMIT IN CASES OF CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT When a student registers at more than one public institution of higher education at the same time, tuition charges shall be determined in the following manner: 1 . The student shall pay the full tuition charge to the first institution at which he or she is registered; and in any event shall pay an amount at least equal to the minimum tuition specified in this code. 2 . If the minimum tuition specified in this code for the first institution at which the student is registered is equal to or greater than the minimum tuition specified in this code for the second institution at which the student is registered concurrently, the student shall not be required to pay the specified minimum tuition charge to the second institution in addition to the tuition charge paid to the first institution, but shall pay only the hourly rates, as provided in this code, to the second institution. 3 . If the minimum tuition specified in this code for the first institution at which the student is registered is less than the specified minimum tuition charge at the second institution (that is, if the second institution has a higher minimum tuition charge specified in this code), then the student shall first register at the institution having the lower minimum tuition and shall pay to the second institution only the amount equal to the difference between his total tuition charge at the second institution and his or her total tuition charge at the first institution, but in no case shall the student pay to the second institution less than the hourly rates as provided in this code. 4 . If a student is considered a Texas resident and therefore qualified to pay Texas resident tuition rates by one institution at which she or he is registered, that student shall be considered a Texas resident at each of the institutions at which he is concurrently registered for the purposes of determining the proper tuition charges. Nothing in this subsection shall be so construed as to allow a nonresident to pay resident tuition except at institutions covered by Section 54.060 of this code. GENERAL DEBTS OF STUDENTS OR ORGANIZATIONS The University is not responsible for any debts contracted by individual students or by student organizations. The University will not assume the role of collection agency for any organization, firm, or individual to which students owe money, nor will the University adjudicate disputes between students and creditors over the existence or amounts of debts. DEBTS OWED TO THE UNIVERSITY In the event of non-payment of debts owed to the University, one or more of the following actions may be taken by the University: The student can be barred from registration. The student's grades and official transcripts can be withheld. A degree to which the student might otherwise be entitled can be withheld. Delinquent accounts will be referred to a collection agency and credit bureau. Other penalties and actions authorized by law can be exercised. RETURNED CHECKS A student who pays the University a check, draft, or money order for services or goods which is not subsequently honored by the payer's bank and the fault is not that of the bank, and who does not pay the University the amount due within ten (10) class days after the receipt of written notice that the bank has refused payment, can be subject to disciplinary action. A student who pays tuition and fees with a check, draft, or money order which is not subsequently honored by payor's bank, the fault not being that of the bank, can be withdrawn from the University for non-payment of tuition and fees if the student fails to pay the University the check amount due plus a $30.00 returned check fee within ten (10) class days after receiving written notice and the student's check will be referred to the County Attorney for collection. All check writers whose check is returned will be assessed a $30.00 fee for each check not honored by payor's bank. This assessment is subject to change without notice.

The University of Texas at El Paso | Terms Of Use | Privacy StatementResidency for Tuition Purposes The Office of Admissions and Recruitment is responsible for determining residency status of students for tuition purposes. The Office is guided by the Texas Education Code , the Rules and Regulations for Determining Residence Status of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, and University regulations. Under the State of Texas statutes and regulations, a student or prospective student is classified as either a resident of Texas, a non-resident, or a foreign student. A resident student is an individual who is either a U.S. citizen, a national, permanent-resident alien, or an alien who has been permitted by Congress to adopt the United States as his or her domicile while in the United States and who has otherwise met the State of Texas requirements for establishing residency for tuition purposes. A non-resident student is a citizen, a national or permanent resident of the U.S., or an alien who has been permitted by Congress to adopt the U.S. as his or her domicile while in this country and who has not met the State of Texas requirement for establishing residency for tuition purposes. A foreign student is an alien who is not a permanent resident of the U.S. or has not been permitted by Congress to adopt the U.S. as his or her domicile. While these State of Texas requirements for establishing residency are complex and should be referred to in each particular circumstance, they generally require that an independent individual (18 years of age or older) establish a domicile in Texas and reside in Texas for a period of 12 months prior to the census date of the academic term in which she or he is enrolled. For minors and dependents, the parents or court-appointed legal guardian must have established a domicile and meet the residency requirements. The minor or dependent must be eligible to be claimed by the parent or court-appointed legal guardian on the parents' or legal guardian's federal income tax. In accordance with Texas Administrative Code \u00a721.25, to initially establish residency status students will be required to submit a completed set of Core Residency Questions or supporting documentation, as directed, to establish resident status. An individual can also be classified as a Texas resident if the individual (1) graduated from a public or private high school or received the equivalent of a high school diploma in Texas; (2) resided in Texas for at least three years after graduation from high school or receiving the equivalent of a high school diploma; and (3) continuously resided in Texas for one year prior to the census date of the academic term of enrollment at UTEP. An individual is classified as a Texas resident until he or she establishes a residence outside of the state of Texas. The following visa holders are eligible to establish a domicile in the United States and have the same privilege of qualifying for Texas residency as U.S. citizens: A-1, A-2, A-3, E-1, E- 2, G-1, G-2, R-1, R-2, V, OP-1, I-551, or I- 688/A/B visas that have not expired. For these cardholders to be eligible for resident tuition, residency must be established. An individual who is classified as a non-resident or foreign student can qualify, under certain exceptions, for resident tuition rates and other charges while continuing to be classified as a non-resident or a foreign student. Military Certain military personnel, their spouses, and their dependent children, are eligible to pay resident tuition rates as provided through the Texas Education Code, Section 54.058 (b)- (c). These provisions provide for nonresident members of the U.S. Armed Forces, members of Texas units of the Army or Air National Guard, or Commissioned Officers of the Public Health Service who are assigned to duty in Texas to pay the resident tuition rate for themselves, their spouses, and their dependent children. To qualify, the student must submit a statement once a year from an authorized officer in the services, certifying that he or she (or a parent or court-appointed legal guardian) will be assigned to duty in Texas at the time of the student's enrollment, and is not a member of the National Guard or Reserves who will be in Texas only to attend training with Texas units. In addition, Texas Education Code, Section 54.058 (d) also provides resident tuition rates for a spouse or dependent child of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States who is not assigned to duty in Texas but who has previously resided in Texas for a six-month period if the member has provided at least one year preceding the first day of the term or semester a document starting the applicable military service that is in effect on the first day of the semester. The document must indicate the member's permanent residence address in Texas must designate Texas as the member's place of legal residence for federal income-tax purposes. In addition, the member must provide documentation proving that he or she has been registered to vote in Texas for the entire year preceding the first day of the semester and satisfies at least one of the following requirements: (1) has owned real property in Texas for the entire year preceding the first day of the semester and (2) has had an automobile registered in Texas for the entire year preceding the first day of the semester, or at least one year preceding the first day of the semester executed a will that has not been revoked or superseded indicating that the member is a resident of Texas and deposited the will with the clerk of the county of the member's residence under Section 71, Texas Probate Code . Other Exceptions Other categories of non-residents who may be entitled to pay resident tuition are: Participants in the Academic Common Market. Residents of the eight New Mexico counties that border Texas. Recipients of competitive University scholarships of $1,000 or more. Students whose families transferred to Texas as part of the State's plan for economic development. U.S. Foreign Service Officers assigned to posts in Mexico. Mexican citizens with demonstrated financial need. Military stationed in Texas and their dependents. NATO forces stationed in Texas and their dependents. Teaching and research assistants and their dependents. Higher-education teachers and professors and their dependents. Registered nurses enrolled in postgraduate nursing degree programs. STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES Reclassification as a Non-Resident Students who have been classified as residents of Texas will be reclassified as non-resident students whenever they report, or there are found to exist, circumstances indicating a change in legal residence to another state. If students who have been classified as residents of Texas are found to have been erroneously classified as a result of an omission or falsification will be reclassified as non-residents and will be required to pay the difference between resident and non-resident fees for the semesters for which they were erroneously classified. Reclassification as a Resident Persons classified as non-residents upon first enrollment can request reclassification. To have residence status reconsidered, students must complete the Core Residency Questions and submit them along with the appropriate documentation regarding residency, to the Office of Admissions and Recruitment prior to the first day of class of the semester for which the change is sought. After the questions and documentation are reviewed, students are notified in writing of the residence decision. If students have been erroneously classified as non-residents and subsequently prove to the satisfaction of the University's residency official that they should have been classified as resident students, they will be reclassified as residents of Texas and will be entitled to a refund of the difference between the resident and non-resident fees for the semesters in which they were erroneously classified. All students are expected to pay the tuition assessed on or before the payment date for each semester as established by the University. All residence questionnaires and forms verifying non-resident tuition exemption status must be submitted prior to the first day of class of the term for which the change is sought. To prevent any delay in enrollment, students are encouraged to submit all forms at least two weeks before registration. Students should consult the Class Schedule for specific information concerning the submission of non-resident exemption forms. Non-Compliance With Institutional Rules and Regulations If students have obtained residency classification by virtue of deliberate concealment of facts or misrepresentation of facts, they can be required to repay the difference in tuition rates and can be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, in accordance with the rules and regulations of The University of Texas at El Paso. For questions on residency or to update residency status, please contact the Office of Admissions and Recruitment at 915.747.5890.

Interpretations or explanations contrary to the regulations stated below are not binding upon the University. STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES Students are responsible for being aware of 1 . The current academic regulations and calendar of the University. 2 . The general and specific degree requirements in their major fields. 3 . Policies that apply to registration. 4 . Their academic status, including eligibility to re-enroll. An ineligible student who enrolls will be dropped from all courses.

Degree requirements and those specific to a given major are located in the appropriate college and departmental sections. Additional information can be obtained from the academic deans, department chairpersons, and departmental academic advisors. Students are bound by the academic regulations in effect at the time of each registration, including those recent changes that appear in the on-line Class Schedule . CLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS Classification is based on the total number of UTEP and transfer semester hours earned: Classification Hours Freshman..................... 0-29 hours Sophomore.................. 30-59 hours Junior.......................... 60-89 hours Senior.......................... 90 or more hours REGISTRATION Registration is a process every student must successfully complete each semester. Although every effort is made to advise students academically, final responsibility for registration rests with the student. Students can attend only those classes for which they are officially enrolled. A student is not enrolled in a course and will not receive a grade unless the proper tuition and fees are paid by the deadlines published in the on-line Class Schedule or unless arrangements for deferral of payment have been made with the Student Business Services Office. If after census day, a student continues to attend classes even after their class schedule was cancelled due to no payment of tuition and fees, or a student attends a course(s) that they are not officially registered in, the student must obtain approval from the instructor(s) to enroll in the course(s). After the semester is closed the student must obtain approval from the instructor(s) and department chair(s) to enroll in the course(s) no later than 90 days after the end of the term for which the approval is being requested. All approvals must be forwarded to the Registration and Records Office. The student will be responsible to pay the proper tuition and fees, and any late fees associated to the late enrollment. After registration, enrollment can be verified by the Registration and Records Office. Late Registration Any student who, with proper permission, registers after the scheduled days for regular registration will be required to pay $20.00 for Web registration process, $30.00 for in- person late registration, and $50.00 on or after the first day of class. A new student will have the late registration fee waived as long as registration is made prior to the first day of class for the term. Late registrants are subject to the same regulations and course requirements as students who enroll on time. Each class missed because of late registration will be counted as an absence, and class or laboratory work missed will be counted as a zero (0) unless the instructor grants permission to make up the work. Any student who has been withdrawn and has his or her schedule reinstated after census day will be assessed a $200 reinstatement fee. Auditing Courses Courses can be audited under the following provisions: 1 . Students should complete an Audit Registration form for each course to be audited after classes begin and prior to Census Day of the long semester. This form must be signed by the instructor teaching the course and by the department chair and then taken to Student Business Services in the Academic Services Building for payment. 2 . No grades will be assigned and no credit will be awarded for audited courses. The extent of a student's class participation is at the discretion of the instructor. 3 . Credit by examination for audited courses will not be permitted unless tuition and all appropriate fees are paid before the exam is taken. 4 . The following courses cannot be audited: clinical, laboratory (organized laboratory classes); studio activity (such as art, piano, woodwinds, dance classes, etc.), any physical activity class (such as PE or Dance), individual instruction, private lessons, and courses specified in the degree plan. It is the student's responsibility to verify that the course being audited is not within the excluded categories. Audit Registration fees will not be refunded for a class in an excluded category. 5 . Audit-only students must purchase a library community user card and a parking decal in order to park on UTEP property. Other student benefits such as tickets to events, student health services, access to the Swimming and Fitness Center, and a Miner Gold Card are not available to audit-only students. Existing student IDs will not be activated for any semester in which a student is in an audit-only status. 6 . Audit fees: $10.00 per course for students concurrently enrolled at UTEP. $30.00 per course for students not concurrently enrolled at UTEP. No charge for students over 65 years of age. 7 . Students should not register for courses they plan to audit. Course registration does not guarantee a seat as an auditor. Registering for the course will result in assessment of regular tuition and fees, in addition to the audit fees noted above. Dropping Courses and Complete Withdrawals Students can drop individual courses or completely withdraw from the University as described below. Refer to the on-line Academic Calendar at www.utep.edu/calendar or to the on-line Class Schedule to identify the dates during which adds, drops, withdrawals, and pass/fail registration changes may occur. Student-Initiated Drops It is the student's responsibility to officially drop a course that she or he no longer wishes to take. Failure to do so might result in a grade of F on the student's academic record. Athletes must receive permission from the Miner Athletic Advising Center before dropping a course. International students with F or J visas must receive permission from the Office of International Programs before dropping a course. Administrative Drops During registration periods for upcoming semesters, students will be dropped from registered courses for failure to meet prerequisites or corequisites after final grades have been posted for the current semester and before the beginning of late registration for next semester. A student may petition the department chair of the course in question for a prerequisite or corequisite waiver. At the discretion of the instructor, a student can be dropped from a course because of excessive absences or lack of effort. A grade of \"W\" will be assigned before the course drop deadline and a grade of \"F\" after the course drop deadline. A grade of \"F\" received due to disciplinary action imposed by the University overrides a grade of \"W\" received through a student-initiated or faculty drop. Students will be notified of their drop through their UTEP e-mail account.through a student-initiated or faculty drop. Students will be notified of their drop through their UTEP e-mail account. Students may also be administratively withdrawn from a course during the semester for other reasons, with the concurrence of the instructor and department chair, or dean. Approved requests will be forwarded to the Registration and Records Office for processing. Students are responsible for checking their class schedules in Goldmine and for checking their official UTEP preferred e-mail accounts to determine if they have been dropped from a class. Six-Course Drop Limit Under section 51.907 of the Texas Education Code , beginning fall 2007, all first-year students enrolled for the first time at any Texas public college or university are limited to six (6) course drops during their academic career. This includes student-and faculty-initiated drops and courses dropped at other Texas public institutions. This policy does not apply to courses dropped prior to census day or to complete withdrawal from all courses for the semester. Students are encouraged to discuss options with their professors and advisors and to make use of campus resources before deciding to drop a course. Once the six-drop limit has been reached, subsequent course drops will be recorded with grades of WF. First-time, first-year students must meet with their academic advisor (or department chair of their major if they do not have an advisor) before dropping a course. The advisor will determine whether the drop will count toward the six-drop limit prior to the course drop deadline. After the course drop deadline, the faculty member will determine if the drop will count toward the six-drop limit. There are exemptions that may allow a student to drop a course without having it counted toward the six-drop limit, but it is the student's responsibility to demonstrate good cause. Exemptions for good cause may include and are not limited to: 1 . A severe illness or other debilitating condition that affects the student's ability to satisfactorily complete the course. 2 . The student's responsibility for the care of a sick, injured, or needy person if provision of that care affects the student's ability to satisfactorily complete the course. 3 . The death of a person who is considered to be a member of the student's family or who is otherwise considered to have a sufficiently close relationship to the student that the person's death is considered to be a showing of good cause*. 4 . Active duty service as a member of the Texas National Guard or armed forces of the United States of either the student or a person who is considered to be a member of the student's family or who is otherwise considered to have a sufficiently close relationship to the student that the person's active military service is considered to be a showing of good cause. 5 . A change in the student's work schedule that is beyond the student's control and that affects the student's ability to satisfactorily complete the course. 6 . Other good cause as determined by the University in consultation with the advisor; or 7 . Other reason as described by the student. *The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board has specified \"family member\" to include spouse, child, grandchild, father, mother, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece, first cousin, step-parent, step-child, or step-sibling. \"Sufficiently close relationship\" includes a relative within the third degree of consanguinity plus close friends including, but not limited to, roommates, housemates, classmates, or others identified by the student and approved by the institution. The importance of a relationship is both highly individual and highly subjective. The Course Drop Form contains the exemption request and should be submitted to the advisor no later than the last day of class for the semester in question. Appeals to the denial of exemption requests may be made to the student's academic dean. A UTEP drop that counts toward the six-course drop limit is noted on the academic transcript by a grade of WC. Transfer work that counts toward the limit is noted by a grade of TWC. The statement TEC 51.907 Undergraduate Course Drop Counter-(#) appears at the end of the UTEP transcript. This number reflects only UTEP drops. For further information, contact the Registration and Records Office, 123 Academic Services Building, or call 915.747.5544. Complete Withdrawal From All Courses for the Semester Students who withdraw from all courses for the semester must do so in person through the Registration and Records Office. Students who cannot drop in person can submit a fax with signature to 915.747.8764 or an e-mail using their UTEP e-mail account to registrar@utep.edu. Athletes must receive permission from the Miner Athletic Advising Center before dropping all classes. International students with F or J visas must receive permission from the Office of International Programs before dropping all classes. Students receiving financial aid or student loans must clear through the Financial Aid Office. Students who drop all courses for the semester and re-enroll the following semester are allowed to re-enroll based on their last academic standing as described in the Standards of Academic Performance section of this catalog. Students who were enrolled in professional programs such as Social Work, Clinical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, and Speech Language Pathology should check with their major department to determine their eligibility for re-enrollment in the program. Complete withdrawal from all courses for a semester does not count toward the six-drop limit for first-time, first-year students who enter fall 2007 or thereafter. A student who withdraws from all classes for the semester immediately loses access to services and privileges available to enrolled students. Financial information concerning drops and withdrawals can be found in the Refund of Tuition and Fees section of this catalog. Complete Withdrawal Due to Academic Performance After final grades have been posted for the current semester, and before late registration begins for the next semester, students whose academic standing makes them ineligible to re-enroll will be withdrawn from all their classes for the next semester. For further details, refer to the Standards of Academic Performance section in this catalog. Complete Withdrawal Due to Medical Reasons A student who must withdraw completely due to medical reasons must submit a letter to the Student Business Services Office from the attending physician, clinical psychologist, or licensed clinical practitioner on official letterhead with an original signature, stating the date(s) within the semester that the student was under medical care and that the student must withdraw because of the medical condition. This letter must be submitted within the semester (or no later than 90 days after the end of the term for which the withdrawal is being requested). If the student is unable to act on his or her own behalf, a representative can do this for the student. Complete Withdrawal Due to Medical Conditions of a Family Member A student who must withdraw completely because of a medical condition of an immediate family member must submit a letter to the Student Business Services Office from the family member's attending physician, clinical psychologist, or licensed clinical practitioner.

This letter must be submitted within the semester (or no later than 90 days after the end of the term for which the withdrawal is being requested). If the student is unable to act on his or her own behalf, a representative may do this for the student. \"Immediate family member\" can be defined as a husband, wife, parent, sibling, child, legal guardian, or grandparent; other relationships can be considered on a case-by-case basis. Complete Withdrawal Due to Death of a Family Member A student who must withdraw because of the death of an immediate family member must submit an official death certificate to the Student Business Services Office during the semester (or no later than 90 days after the end of the term for which the withdrawal is being requested). \"Immediate family member\" is defined as a husband, wife, parent, brother, sister, son, daughter, legal guardian, or grandparent. Once documentation has been received, the student will be withdrawn and grades assigned. Complete Withdrawal Due to Death of Student Upon the death of a student, the student's parent, spouse, or legal guardian must submit an official death certificate to the Student Business Services Office within the semester (or no later than 90 days after the end of the term) so that the student can be withdrawn from all classes and grades assigned. Complete Withdrawal Due to Active Military Service Students who have to withdraw because they have been called to active military service must provide a copy of their military orders covering the affected semester to the Student Business Services Offices. Grades will be assigned as described below. Military personnel can select one of the withdrawal options below according to the Texas Education Code , Sec. 54.006: 1 . Receive a refund of the tuition and fees paid for the withdrawn semester (see NOTE below); 2 . If eligible, receive grades of Incomplete (I) from instructors, with the notation \"Withdrawn - Military\" appearing on the academic transcript (see section on Incomplete or In-progress Work in this catalog); or 3 . Receive an appropriate final grade or credit if the instructor determines that a substantial amount of coursework has been satisfactorily completed and sufficient mastery of the course material has been demonstrated. With this option, the student will not be eligible for a full refund of tuition and fees. Requests for complete withdrawals, with the required documents, related to medical reasons, medical conditions of a family member, death of a family member, active military service, and death of a student, will only be accepted if received within 90 days of the end of the term for which the withdrawal is being requested. After 90 days, a full refund of tuition and fees will not be approved. Grade Assignment for Drops and Withdrawals and Complete Withdrawals Grades will be assigned as follows when a student drops a course or completely withdraws from the University: 1 . If a student drops a course or all courses before the official census date of a semester, neither the course nor a grade will appear on the student's academic record. 2 . If a student withdraws from a course or all courses after the census date, but before the student-initiated course drop deadline listed in the on-line Class Schedule , a grade of W will be assigned. 3 . If the student drops after the student-initiated course drop deadline, instructors will determine a grade of \"W\" or \"F\" for each course. A grade of W will be considered only under exceptional circumstances and must be approved by the instructor and department chair for the course. A student may need to petition the instructor for a grade of \"W\" in writing with the necessary supporting documentation. 4 .

To request amendment of the student's education records to ensure that they are not inaccurate or misleading. To be notified of the student's privacy rights under FERPA. To file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The University of Texas System and The University of Texas at El Paso have implemented a student records policy that adheres to these laws. Annual Notification The University will notify its students annually of their rights according to FERPA and of the procedures for exercising their rights. Definitions A student is an individual who is attending or has attended The University of Texas at El Paso. It does not include individuals who have been admitted but have not attended. Attendance includes attendance in person, by correspondence, online, and during periods when the student is working under a work-study program. Education records include records directly related to a student that are maintained by the University. Education records do not include: Records of instructional, administrative, and educational personnel that are in the sole possession of the maker (i.e. file notes of conversations), are used only as a personal memory aid, and are not accessible or revealed to any individual except a temporary substitute Records of the University campus police Student medical and counseling records created maintained, and used only in connection with provision of medical treatment or counseling to the student, that are not disclosed to anyone other than the individuals providing the treatment. (Although a student cannot inspect his or her medical records, these records can be reviewed by a physician of the student's choice) Employment records unrelated to the student's status as a student. Alumni records. Directory information means information in a student's education record that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. UTEP designates the following minimum information as directory information: student's name; local and permanent addresses; e-mail address; telephone number; date and place of birth; field of study; dates of attendance; enrollment status; student classification; degrees, certificates and awards (including scholarships) received; photographs; participation in officially recognized activities and sports; weight and height of members of athletic teams; and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended.

Disclosure of Education Records Disclosure Without Prior Consent of the Student The University will not disclose personally identifiable information from a student's education records without prior written consent of the student, except as authorized by FERPA. FERPA's authorizations for release without consent include the following: Directory Information. Directory information (as defined above) can appear in public documents and can otherwise be disclosed without student consent unless a student submits a written request to the registrar during the first 12 days of class of a long semester, the first day of the minimester, or the first four class days of a summer session, to withhold such information from disclosure. Requests to withhold directory information will be honored by the University until such time that the request is revoked by the student or at the time of death. University Officials . University officials with legitimate educational interests in the student's education records are allowed access to student education records. Inter-institutional disclosures can be made between institutions that administer or participate in joint programs or activities, in accordance with legitimate educational interest criteria. For example, if a student is concurrently enrolled in one component of the University of Texas and in another institution, or in two components of the University, or receives services from one component of the University and from another institution, or from two components of the University (or UT System), information from the student records of that individual can be disclosed by one University component to the other, or by the University component to the other institution, without obtaining the written consent of the student in accordance with legitimate educational interest criteria. This provision includes institutions participating in UT TeleCampus Programs. Other Institutions . The University can release a student's education records to officials of other educational institutions in which that student seeks or intends to enroll or is enrolled. Audit or Evaluation of Federal or State Education Programs. Authorized representatives of the Comptroller General of the United States, the Attorney General of the United States, the Secretary of Education, and state and local educational authorities can have access to student records in connection with the audit and evaluation of federal or state supported education programs, or in connection with the enforcement of federal law which relates to such programs. Financial Aid. The University can release a student's education records to persons or organizations in connection with that student's application for, or receipt of financial aid, but only to the extent necessary for such purposes as determining eligibility, amount, conditions, and enforcement of terms or conditions of such financial aid.

Organizations Conducting Studies . The University can release a student's education records to organizations conducting studies for, or on behalf of, educational agencies or institutions for the purpose of developing, validating, or administering predictive tests, administering student aid programs, and improving instruction, if such studies are conducted in a manner which will not permit the personal identification of students and/or their parents by individuals other than representatives of the organization, and the information will be destroyed when no longer needed for the purposes for which the study was conducted. The term organizations includes and is not limited to federal, state, and local agencies and independent organizations. Accrediting Organizations . The University can release a student's education records to accrediting organizations in order to carry out their accrediting functions. Parents of Dependents . Parents of a student who is a dependent for federal tax purposes, as defined by Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, can have access to that student's education records without prior consent of the student. Parents can demonstrate the tax dependency of a student only by submitting to the University a copy of their most recently filed federal income tax return. Alternatively, a student can demonstrate tax dependency, and thus allow parental access to the student's records without prior consent of the student, by submitting to the University a signed statement of his or her tax dependency. If a dependent student's parents are divorced, both parents can have access to the student's records, as long as at least one parent claims the student as a dependent. Judicial Order or Subpoena . Information concerning a student shall be released in response to a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. The University will make reasonable efforts to notify the student of an order or subpoena before complying with it.

Education records can be disclosed to the U. S. Attorney General or his or her designee in response to an ex parte order concerning an authorized investigation or prosecution of domestic or international terrorism, without prior notice to the student. Health and Safety. The University can disclose student information to persons in an emergency in order to protect the health and safety of the student or others in the University community. Disciplinary Hearing Results Disclosure to Victims: The University can disclose to an alleged victim of any crime of violence (as that term is defined in Chapter 1, Section 16 of Title 18, United States Code ), or a non-forcible sex offense, the final results of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by the University against the alleged perpetrator of such crime or offense, regardless of whether the alleged perpetrator was found responsible for violating the University's rules or policies with respect to such crime or offense. Disclosure to Third Parties: The University can disclose the final results of any disciplinary proceeding against a student who is an alleged perpetrator of any crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense (as those terms are defined in 34 C.F.R. 99.39), if the student is found responsible on or after October 7, 1998, for violating the University's rules ornon-forcible sex offense (as those terms are defined in 34 C.F.R. 99.39), if the student is found responsible on or after October 7, 1998, for violating the University's rules or policies with respect to such crime or offense. Such disclosure shall include only the name of the student, the violation committed, and any sanction imposed by the University on that student. Such disclosure can include the name of any other student, such as a victim or witness, only with the written consent of that other student. Alcohol and Drug Violations . The University can disclose to a parent or legal guardian of a student information regarding any violation of any federal, state, or local law, or of any rule or policy of the University, governing the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance, regardless of whether that information is contained in the student's education records, if the student is under the age of 21 at the time of disclosure to the parent, and the University determines that the student is responsible for a disciplinary violation with respect to such use or possession. Disclosure to the Student The student has the right, upon request to the appropriate University official, to review all materials that are in the student's education records, except: Financial information submitted by the student's parents. Confidential letters and recommendations associated with admissions, employment or job placement, or honors, to which the student has waived rights of inspection and review (the University is not required to permit students to inspect and review confidential letters and recommendations placed in their files prior to January 1, 1975, provided those letters were collected under established policies of confidentiality and were used only for the purposes for which they were collected.) Education records containing information about more than one student, in which case the University will permit access only to that part of the record that pertains to the inquiring student. The Vice President for Business Affairs is the official custodian of UTEP records, and that office maintains a list of those individuals responsible for education records, which are maintained at the campus locations listed below. Requests for access to specific student records should be made in writing to the University official responsible for the particular record.

Of directory information. Requests to Amend Records A student who believes that his or her education records are inaccurate or misleading, or that the records violate his or her privacy rights, can informally discuss amendment of the record with the University office concerned with the particular record. If agreement is reached with respect to the student's request, the appropriate records will be amended. [Note: The substantive judgment of a faculty member about a student's work, expressed in grades and/or evaluations, is not within the purview of this right to seek amendment of education records.] If the record is not amended pursuant to the student's request, the University will inform the student of its decision and of the student's right to request a formal hearing. The request must be made in writing to the UTEP Vice President for Business Affairs who, within a reasonable period of time after receiving such request, will inform the student of the date, place, and time of the hearing. A student may present evidence relevant to the issues raised and can be assisted or represented at the hearing by one or more persons of the student's choice, including attorneys, at the student's expense. The hearing officer who will adjudicate such challenges will be appointed by the President. The decision of the hearing officer will be final, will be based solely on the evidence presented at the hearing, will consist of a written statement summarizing the evidence and stating the reasons for the decision, and will be delivered to all parties concerned. If the decision is in favor of the student, the education records will be corrected or amended in accordance with the decision of the hearing officer.

The University of Texas at El Paso | Terms Of Use | Privacy StatementRegister | Login Welcome Enrollment Services Financial Information Academic Regulations Student Services Colleges and Degree Programs Miscellaneous Curriculum and Classroom Policies COURSE INFORMATION Texas Common Course Numbering (TCCN) System The University of Texas at El Paso participates in the Texas Common Course Numbering (TCCN) System, which was developed to facilitate the transfer of general academic courses among Texas colleges and universities. Common courses are freshman- and sophomore-level courses taught throughout Texas which correspond with the general description of courses or category of courses included in the Lower-Division Academic Course Guide Manual . A UTEP course determined to be equivalent to a course listed in the Guide has the common course number listed below the UTEP course title in the individual course description of this catalog and a Texas state symbol is to the left of the course prefix and number. Students interested in transferring can refer to the common course number in each college or university catalog to determine course transferability among institutions. Course Numbering System Each course offered by The University of Texas at El Paso is identified by a four-digit course number. The first number indicates the level: 0 = developmental, 1 = freshman, 2 = sophomore, 3 = junior, 4 = senior, and 5 or 6 = graduate. The second number indicates the semester credit hour value of the course. The last two numbers identify the course within its particular department. Lower-Division Courses are designated by a 1 or 2 as the first digit of the course number. Upper-Division and Advanced Courses are designated by a 3 or 4 as the first digit of the course number. The student should refer to the departmental and college requirements for specific conditions, if any, imposed on registration in advanced courses. Graduate Courses are designated by a 5 or 6 as the first digit of the course number. Maximum Course Load A student is permitted to register each term for the maximum number of semester credit hours listed below. Written permission from the academic dean must be obtained to take more than the maximum load. Students must have a grade point average above 2.0 to request permission. Term Maximum Hours Fall = 21 Spring (Wintermester) = 24 (combined terms), or 21 for Spring, or 6 for Wintermester Summer (Maymester) = 15 (combined terms), or 9 for Summer, or 6 for Maymester Enrollment Status Fall and Spring Hours per Semester/Term Full-time = 12 or more Part-time = Fewer than 12 Maymester and Wintermester Full-time = 3 or more Part-time = Fewer than 3 Summer Sessions Full-time = 6 or more, or 3 in Summer I and 3 in 8-week, or 3 in Summer II and 3 in 8-week, or 3 in Summer I and 3 in Summer II Part-time = Fewer than 6 Students who are not eligible to enroll without conditions, who are on academic probation or academic suspension/dismissal, who have been readmitted or reinstated from such conditions, or who are in the START Program will have course load conditions imposed by their advisor or dean. Students should see the section of this catalog entitled Standards of Academic Performance . Enrollment Verification For enrollment verification to financial aid, scholarships, loan agencies, insurance companies, etc., the following categories will be followed. Students are encouraged to enroll in the appropriate number of credit hours as required/specified by the agencies. Veteran students are recommended to consult with the campus Veterans Affairs Office. Fall and Spring: Hours per Semester/Term Full-time = 12 or more 3/4 time = 9 - 11 1/2 time = 6 - 8 Less than 1/2 time = fewer than 6 Maymester and Wintermester: Full time = 3 or more 1/2 time = 2 Less than 1/2 time = 1 Summer Sessions: Full-time = 6 or more, or 3 in Summer I and 3 in 8-week, or 3 in Summer II and 3 in 8-week, or 3 in Summer I and 3 in Summer II 3/4 time = 4 - 5 1/2 time = 3 Less than 1/2 time = fewer than 3 Students participating in the Career and Professional Development Services Cooperative Education Program and are only enrolled in a co-op course will be classified as full-time for the semester/term. Limits on Undergraduate Course Enrollment In most instances, a student can enroll in an undergraduate class a maximum of three (3) times; further enrollment requires PERMISSION OF THE STUDENT'S ACADEMIC DEAN . This includes enrollments that result in a grade of W, F, D, or P. It does not apply to courses taken prior to a student's re-enrolling under \"Option 2\" as described under the Reinstatement After Extended Absence or Academic Fresh Start portions of this catalog. Individual colleges might have more restrictive policies. A student can enroll more than three times in a variable-topic, studio, performance, workshop, or other course that is identified as \"can be repeated for credit.\" A student can enroll in a course in which a grade of \"C\" or higher has been previously earned, with department approval. However, a student cannot enroll in a course in which he or she has an unresolved grade of I (Incomplete). Courses Taken on a Pass/Fail Basis Some courses are graded only on a Pass/Fail basis (grade of S or U). Check with the appropriate academic department for a listing of these courses. These courses can be used to fulfill degree requirements if so specified on the student's degree plan. In addition, an undergraduate student whose cumulative grade point average is 2.0 or higher can take courses on a Pass/Fail basis with the following conditions: 1 . A maximum of four courses attempted on a Pass/Fail basis can be used to fulfill degree requirements, as free electives only. 2 . Such courses cannot be reserved for graduate credit. 3 . Not more than two such courses can be taken in a long semester or one in a summer session.3 . Not more than two such courses can be taken in a long semester or one in a summer session. 4 . Courses taken on a Pass/Fail basis cannot be counted toward the minimum residency requirements. 5 . To obtain credit for the course, the student must meet the minimum standard and do all assigned work required for the grade of A, B, C, or D. 6 . No course graded Pass/Fail can be used to fulfill any degree requirement in the College of Engineering. 7 . Business majors cannot take any course offered by the College of Business Administration on a Pass/Fail basis. To enroll on a Pass/Fail basis in courses that are not normally graded Pass/Fail, a student must: 1 . Obtain a Pass/Fail form and approved signature from the academic dean of his or her college. 2 . Submit the approved form to the Records Office by the submission deadline listed in the on-line Class Schedule at www.utep.edu/register . Election of the Pass/Fail option is irrevocable after the submission deadline. Pass/Fail courses are not included in the grade point average calculation. There is no assurance that Pass/Fail courses will be accepted as transfer credit by another institution. Reservation of Work by Undergraduates for Graduate Credit Ordinarily, undergraduates are not eligible to take graduate courses. A student who already has a baccalaureate degree is not eligible to reserve courses for graduate credit, but it is possible for seniors to register in graduate courses in their last semester under the following conditions: 1 . The undergraduate must need no more than 12 semester hours (or six semester hours in summer session) of work to complete all requirements for the first baccalaureate degree and must have a grade point average of at least 3.0 in junior- and senior-level courses. 2 . These 12 hours (or less) must all be completed in the same semester or summer session in which the graduate courses are taken. 3 . Total registration for all work must not exceed 15 semester hours (or 9 hours in a summer session). 4 . Enrollment in graduate courses must be approved prior to registration by the graduate advisor of the department, the undergraduate dean, and the Dean of the Graduate School. 5 . This option is limited to one term. An undergraduate cannot count credit for graduate courses toward the baccalaureate degree. It will be reserved for credit toward a graduate degree. A form for reserving courses is available in the Graduate School. Approval to reserve work for graduate credit neither constitutes nor implies admission to any graduate program. Repetition of Courses Students can repeat courses at UTEP under either of the following conditions: 1 . Repetition of UTEP freshman level courses (1XXX) for the first time: Only grades of \"D\" or \"F\" earned the first attempt are eligible for repetition. The previously earned grade is automatically excluded from the GPA calculation. Both grades earned remain on the academic record and the record will be annotated with the symbol (E- Excluded) next to the first grade. The last grade earned is the official grade for a course. Exceptional circumstances may be reviewed by the student's academic dean in consultation with the appropriate faculty member. Grade replacement and GPA recalculation may not occur after graduation. 2 . Repetition of UTEP freshman level courses (1XXX) after the first time and repetition of non-freshman level courses (2XXX, 3XXX, 4XXX): All grades earned remain on the academic record and are included in the GPA calculation. A student may enroll in a course in which a grade of \"C\" or higher has been previously earned for a variable-topic, studio, performance, workshop, or other course that is identified as \"may be repeated for credit . \" Exceptional circumstances can be reviewed by the student's academic dean in consultation with the appropriate faculty member. Grade replacement and GPA recalculation cannot occur after graduation. A grade received as a result of disciplinary action is not eligible for grade replacement for GPA recalculation. The record will be annotated with the symbol (D) next to the grade. Note : Students are cautioned that courses taken at UTEP and repeated at another college or university are not eligible for GPA recalculation, even if it is the first-time repetition of freshman-level courses (1XXX). Transfer courses are not calculated in a student's UTEP GPA. Class Attendance The student is expected to attend all classes and laboratory sessions. It is the responsibility of the student to inform each instructor of extended absences. When, in the judgment of the instructor, a student has been absent to such a degree as to impair his or her status relative to credit for the course, the instructor can drop the student from the class with a grade of W before the course drop deadline and with a grade of F after the course drop deadline. Excused Absences for University-Recognized Activities Students who will be absent while representing the University in officially recognized University activities (sports, band, professional conferences, etc.) must notify the Dean of Students not less than ten (10) days prior to the absence. The Dean of Students will provide the student with a letter of excuse for the professors. It is the student's responsibility to give the letter to the professors prior to the official recognized activity. Students following these procedures will be permitted to make up both assignments and examinations in consultation with faculty. Absence for Religious Holy Days Religious holy day means a day observed by a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property taxation under Section 11.20, Tax Code . Section 51.9111 of the Texas Education Code and 19 Texas Administrative Code 4.4 related to absences by students for observance of religious holy days states that the institution shall excuse a student from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection cannot be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence. The student must provide written notice to the instructor of each course that he or she will be absent for a religious holy day not less than 10 days prior to the absence . If a student and an instructor disagree about the nature of the absence being for the observance of a religious holy day as defined therein, or if there is similar disagreement about whether the student has been given a reasonable time to complete any missed assignments or examinations, either the student or the instructor can request a ruling from the Provost or the Provost's designee. The student and the instructor shall abide by the decision of the Provost or designee. Military Leave Section 51.9111, Texas Education Code , and 19 Texas Administrative Code 4.9 provides that students be excused from scheduled classes or other required activities if the student is called to and participates in active military service for a reasonably brief period and that the student shall be allowed to complete an assignment or exam within a reasonable time after the absence. The excused absence is permitted only if the student will not miss more than 25% of the total number of class meetings or the contact-hour equivalent (not including the final examination period) for the specific course or courses in which the student is enrolled at the beginning of the period of active military service. Students called to active military service must provide a copy of their military orders to the instructor of each course. Further information is available under Complete Withdrawal Due to Active Military Service . Absence From Examinations A student absent from a test during the semester is graded zero (0) unless another policy is set by the instructor. Dead Day This specific day will be scheduled one day after the last day of classes during the fall and spring semesters. The following policy will be observed: 1 . No classes will be held on this day, except classes which meet once a week on that day. 2 . Make-up exams should be left to the discretion of each individual instructor. 3 . All student work (e.g., research papers, lab reports, term paper, etc.) should be due prior to this day. 4 . If a comprehensive final is given, no new material, quizzes, or exams should be given two calendar days prior to Dead Day, and attention should be given to review of semester material. Implementation of this recommendation is to be left to the discretion of the individual instructor. Final Examinations Exemption from final examinations cannot be given. Final examinations are scheduled to be two hours, forty-five (45) minutes in length and take place during the final examination period. It is the policy of the University not to administer a second final examination in a course. It is also University policy that students shall not have more than two final examinations in a single day. In the unlikely event that the examination schedule results in a student having three final examinations on a single day, the faculty member upon the request of the student shall reschedule the second of that student's three examinations. Academic Integrity The University of Texas at El Paso prides itself on its standards of academic excellence. In all matters of intellectual pursuit, UTEP faculty and students must strive to achieve excellence based on the quality of work produced by the individual. In the classroom and in all other academic activities, students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity. Any form of academic dishonesty is an affront to the pursuit of knowledge and jeopardizes the quality of the degree awarded to all graduates of UTEP. It is imperative, therefore, that the members of this academic community understand the regulations pertaining to academic integrity and that all faculty insist on adherence to these standards. Any student who commits an act of academic dishonesty is subject to discipline. Academic dishonesty includes, and is not limited to cheating, plagiarism, collusion, the submission for credit of any work or materials that are attributable in whole or in part to another person, taking an examination for another person, and any act designed to give unfair advantage to a student or the attempt to commit such acts. Proven violations of the detailed regulations, as printed in the Handbook of Operating Procedures (HOP) , and available in the Office of Student Life and on the homepage of the Office of Student Life at www.utep.edu/dos, can result in sanctions ranging from disciplinary probation, to a failing grade on the work in question, to a failing grade in the course, to suspension or dismissal, among others. GRADES AND GRADE POINT AVERAGESGrade Meaning Grade Point Value per Semester Hour A Excellent 4 B Good 3 C Average 2 D Below Average but Passing 1 F Failure 0 WF Assigned to a dropped course that exceeds the Six-Course Drop Limit 0 Courses in which the above grades were earned are included in the grade point average (GPA), which is calculated as follows: (1) determine grade points by multiplying the number of semester hours each course is worth by the grade point value of the grade received; (2) divide the total number of grade points earned by the total number of semester hours attempted in which the above grades were earned. (Total Grade Points/Total Attempted Hours = GPA) The following grades are not included in grade point average calculations: Grade Meaning I Incomplete S Satisfactory, in a Pass/Fail course U Unsatisfactory, in a Pass/Fail course P In Progress W Withdrawal CR Transfer credit or credit by examination A* Satisfactory B* Satisfactory Unsatisfactory N A temporary administrative grading notation often meaning not reported by the faculty or some other administrative problem WC Assigned to a dropped course that will count toward the Six-Course Drop Limit TWC Assigned to a dropped undergraduate transfer course taken at another Texas public college or university; counts toward the Six Course Drop Limit. Midterm Grades for Freshmen At mid-semester, all students with fewer than 30 cumulative semester hours will receive midterm grades. The midterm grade report is designed to give beginning students an early indication of their academic progress. Midterm grades are not recorded on the student's academic record, computed in the cumulative grade point average, or calculated in the academic standing. Incomplete or In-Progress Work Assignment of the grade I is made only in exceptional circumstances and requires the instructor to file with the academic dean an outline of the work to be completed and the time span (not to exceed one calendar year) allowable for completion with the academic dean. In no case can repetition of the course be assigned as work to be completed. If the work has not been completed at the end of the specified time, the I will be changed to an F. A student cannot enroll in a course in which he or she has an unresolved grade of I. The grade of P (in progress) is limited to specific courses in which re-enrollment is required. This includes all thesis courses (5398-5399, 6320-6321), graduate internships, and certain undergraduate courses. Grade Changes All student-initiated grade reviews and grade appeals shall be made no later than one year after the official grade has been released to the student; for a student who has graduated , the deadline is three months following the semester in which the degree was awarded. Exceptions to the grade change policy will be at the discretion of the faculty member, department chair, and final approval from the academic dean. Any student can request that the faculty member review and re-evaluate a grade previously given. The student can then seek assistance from the department chair or the academic dean in obtaining a grade review. After a grade review, a formal grade appeal process is available for cases in which a student wishes to appeal a grade assigned by the instructor. The formal appeal shall be officially filed with the Student Welfare and Grievance Committee no later than one year after the official grade has been released to the student; for a student who has graduated, the filing deadline is three months following the semester in which the degree was awarded. See the Student Life Policies and Procedures section- Student Grievance Procedures in this catalog for additional information. Grades can be changed as a result of (1) initiation by the instructor and approval by the appropriate department chair; (2) initiation by the department chair for cases in which the instructor is no longer affiliated with the University and cannot be contacted and there exists clear and convincing reason for a grade change; (3) disciplinary action imposed by the Dean of Students or Hearing Officer for violation of University rules; or (4) action taken by the Student Welfare and Grievance Committee in grade-appeal procedures. Grades determined as a result of actions taken in items (3) or (4) above are final and not subject to change. No other grade change shall occur without the consent of the instructor. The Registrar shall notify the student and the instructor of any change of grade. College/Major Academic Standing Selected colleges or majors can also require students to maintain a 2.0 GPA for courses taken within the college or within the major. A student whose college or major GPA falls below a 2.0 after completing a specified minimum number of hours of the designated course work in the college/major will be placed on probation within the college/major. This minimum shall be nine (9) hours unless specified differently in the degree requirements for the college/major. If the student's college/major GPA remains below a 2.0 after completing nine additional hours of course work in the college/major (or the designated college/major probationary period: students should refer to the individual degree requirements to determine the applicable probationary period), the student will be placed on suspension from the college/major for a minimum of one semester. A student who is on suspension from a college/major can continue to enroll in the University if the student changes majors and meets the GPA requirements of the new college/major. A change to a new major in the same college will require permission from the dean. A student who wishes to re-enroll in the same major after a suspension must submit to the student's academic dean a Petition for Reinstatement to the College/Major. If the petition is approved, the student will be permitted to re-enroll under academic probation, plus any special conditions which might be imposed by the academic dean. It is recommended that students who are suspended from the college/major receive career counseling through the University Counseling Center. Students who have been suspended for a period of one semester and have been allowed to re-enroll in that college/major must attain a GPA of 2.0 in the college/major after the completion of nine additional hours of course work in the college/major (or the designated college/major probationary period: students should refer to the individual degree requirements to determine the applicable probationary period); failure to do so will result in suspension from the college/major for a minimum of one year. A student who is allowed to re-enroll after this suspension and does not achieve a 2.0 GPA in the college/major (or the designated college/major probationary period: students should refer to the individual degree requirements to determine the applicable probationary period) will be dismissed from the college/major. A change of major will be required if the student wishes to continue to enroll in the University. Any appeal from the regulations governing academic performance shall be directed to the dean of the college in which the student is a major. The dean is empowered to grant relief in unusual cases if the circumstances warrant such action. This is in addition to the policies concerning academic standing within the University. Any penalties concerning eligibility to re-enroll arising from the University's academic standing policy shall take precedence over any provisions within this policy. Standards of Academic Performance Undergraduate students are expected to maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.0 (C average) for all work attempted at UTEP, and a GPA of at least 2.0 for all course work required in the major field of study. These are University-wide minimum requirements for the conferral of any bachelor's degree; higher minimum standards of performance are required in some programs. When final grades of each term are posted to the student's academic record, both term GPA (for the semester or session just ended) and cumulative GPA (for all work attempted at UTEP) are included. In addition, designations appropriate to the student's past academic performance and eligibility to re-enroll at the University are included. These designations are as follows: Eligible to Re-enroll A student whose cumulative GPA is 2.0 or higher is eligible to re-enroll. Academic Probation A student whose cumulative GPA falls below 2.0 will be placed on academic probation. A student on academic probation must have permission to re-enroll. Students in an entering student program should seek this permission from their entering student advisor. Other students should seek this permission from their academic dean. A student will remain on academic probation as long as the term GPA is at least 2.0 and the cumulative GPA is below 2.0.academic probation as long as the term GPA is at least 2.0 and the cumulative GPA is below 2.0. Academic Suspension for One Semester A student on academic probation whose term GPA is below 2.0 will be placed on academic suspension for one semester. A student thus suspended cannot re-enroll at the University until one long semester or a full summer session has elapsed. Academic Suspension for One Year A student on academic probation who has already been placed on academic suspension for one semester, and whose term GPA is less than 2.0, will be placed on academic suspension for one year. A student thus suspended cannot re-enroll at the University until one full calendar year has elapsed. Academic Suspension for Two Years A student who has been placed on academic suspension for one year and whose semester and cumulative GPA is below 2.0 will be placed on academic suspension for two years. A student thus suspended MAY NOT re-enroll at the University until two full calendar years have elapsed. Re-enrollment Following Academic Suspension A student wishing to re-enroll after his/her academic suspension period is over must submit a Petition for Reinstatement with the academic dean of the previous major or, if the student is selecting a new major, with the dean of the intended new major. If reinstated, the student will be permitted to re-enroll under academic probation, plus any special conditions of the Petition for Reinstatement . Any appeal from the regulations governing academic performance shall be directed to the dean of the college in which the student is a major. The dean is empowered to grant relief in unusual cases if the circumstances warrant such action. Any student who attempts to circumvent the academic performance regulations is subject to disciplinary action. Reinstatement of Students After Extended Absence At the time of reinstatement to the University after an absence of at least two academic years, a student has the option of: Continuing with the academic record and GPA as they stand, and completing all remaining requirements for graduation; or Beginning anew, with no courses attempted earlier at UTEP counted toward the degree, nor counted in the cumulative GPA calculations. This option can be elected only once. If Option 1 is chosen, the GPA will be computed according to rules in force at the time of re-entry. If Option 2 is chosen, notation will be made in the student's record indicating that portion of the record which is to be involved in computing requirements for graduation. There is no assurance that courses attempted prior to this option will be accepted as transfer credit by another institution. In either case, all courses taken and grades earned will remain on the official academic record. Pursuit of the degree under either option does not exempt the student from the provisions of the \"seven-year rule\" (Students should refer to this catalog's Requirements section). If the student was not eligible to re-enroll at the end of the last period of enrollment at the University, submission of a Petition for Reinstatement with the academic dean of either the previous or intended major is required at the time of reinstatement. The petition will specify which of the two aforementioned options has been chosen. TEXTBOOKS A student of this institution is not under any obligation to purchase a textbook from a university-affiliated bookstore. The same textbook may be available from an independent retailer, including an online retailer, per Texas Education Code, sec. 51.9705. The University of Texas at El Paso | Terms Of Use | Privacy StatementRegister | Login Welcome Enrollment Services Financial Information Academic Regulations Student Services Colleges and Degree Programs Miscellaneous General Requirements for Undergraduate Degrees General academic regulations can be changed at any time. All students, regardless of when originally enrolled, are required to abide by current academic regulations. RESIDENCE Work counting toward the degree must be completed in residence at the University as follows: 1 . A total of at least 25% of the semester hours (a minimum of 30 semester hours) 2 . Twenty-four (24) of the last 30 semester hours 3 . Twelve (12) semester hours of advanced courses in the major subject must have been completed not more than three years prior to the date of graduation CATALOG GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS To graduate, a student must fulfill the specific course and degree requirements of the catalog in effect at the time of his or her admission, or of any subsequent catalog in effect during his or her enrollment with the approval of the academic dean, provided that the required courses are still being offered. A student must complete all requirements within seven (7) years or be subject to the degree requirements of a subsequent catalog. The seven-year period begins with the year the catalog was issued, regardless of the student's first semester of enrollment. Students entering the University for the first time during a summer session are subject to the requirements of the catalog for the next fall term, or of a later catalog. A student transferring from a Texas two-year institution can select a catalog that was in effect prior to the first semester of enrollment at UTEP, as long as the student was following UTEP's degree plan while enrolled at the community college. DEGREE PLAN Students are advised to obtain and follow their major's degree plan when they first enroll at the University. Students are required to select a major and file a degree plan with the academic dean of that major by the time they complete 60 semester hours. CHANGE OF MAJOR A student who wishes to change majors must obtain permission of the dean of the college of the new major. CONCENTRATIONS AND MINORS Students interested in pursuing a concentration or minor in an area of study should refer to the college curriculum in the catalog or consult with their major advisor for further details. COMPLETION OF FRESHMAN-LEVEL COURSES All freshman-level courses that are required by specific course number must be completed before the student has completed 90 hours toward the degree. No credit for these freshman-level courses will be granted toward fulfilling the minimum credit-hour requirements for the degree, even though the courses must be completed. ONE-HOUR COURSES No more than six (6) one-hour courses can be counted toward completion of the minimum total hours required for a degree (unless degree requirements specify otherwise), except with specific approval of the academic dean. MAJOR EXAMINATIONS At the discretion of the department concerned, a comprehensive examination can be required in the major subject under the following conditions: 1 . Four hours written, or three hours written and one hour oral. 2 . The department fixes the time and place, and supervises the examination. 3 . In case of failure, the student can take another examination on a date determined by the department. GRADE POINT AVERAGE REQUIRED FOR GRADUATION A minimum grade point average of 2.0 must be achieved in all course work at The University of Texas at El Paso and in all transfer work counted toward the degree. The UTEP cumulative grade point average consists of all grades earned at this institution regardless of their applicability toward a degree. Transfer credits can be counted toward meeting degree requirements, but transfer grades and grade points do not enter into UTEP grade point average calculations. A minimum grade point average of 2.0 is required in the major. This is intended as a University-wide minimum and does not prevent a college from requiring a higher GPA in specific majors or programs, provided appropriate approvals have been obtained. GRADUATION Degrees are conferred at the end of each long semester (December and May) and at the end of the second summer session (August). Formal commencement ceremonies are held in May for all candidates who complete degree requirements during the spring semester and in December for fall candidates. Summer candidates can participate in the May commencement ceremony if no more than six (6) hours are needed to complete the degree during the summer session. Summer candidates names will not appear in the May program. Summer candidates who do not participate in May commencement can participate in December commencement. Summer graduates' names will appear only in the December program. Students must apply for graduation and pay the appropriate fee in order to be considered candidates for graduation. The application process begins with the academic dean and should be initiated during the next-to-last semester or session and completed no later than the deadline published in the on-line Class Schedule at www.utep.edu/register. Summer candidates participating in May commencement must complete the application process by the published deadline for May graduation. The paid graduation application form will be collected by the Student Business Services Office for processing by the Registration and Records Office. SECOND BACHELOR'S DEGREE Applicants for a second baccalaureate degree must complete at least 24 semester hours at The University of Texas at El Paso, in addition to those counted toward the baccalaureate degree requiring the higher number of semester hours of credit. These additional hours must include at least six (6) advanced hours in the major subject of the second degree. A student working toward a second bachelor's degree will register as an undergraduate senior. A student who earned the first bachelor's degree at another institution must complete at least 30 hours at UTEP, including completion of the legislative requirements of six (6) hours of American History and six (6) hours of Political Science covering the Constitutions of the United States and Texas. POSTHUMOUS DEGREEA posthumous degree can be awarded only if the student was enrolled in courses that would have allowed the student to complete all work for the degree, and if the student had the appropriate grade point average in the required areas. For further information, individuals should contact the appropriate dean's office. INSTITUTIONAL ACADEMIC HONORS Departmental Honors Program A student who wishes to earn departmental Honors must complete a senior thesis, senior project, or other special requirement, depending on the department. A departmental faculty member directs the project or thesis. The director, along with a departmental honors committee, judge the student's work, and outside referees may be consulted if deemed appropriate. Students may include departmental honors credits with University honors credits, upon consultation with the University Honors Program Director, in order to earn Honors at both levels. The following offer Departmental Honors: Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Geological Sciences, History, Physics, Political Science, and Psychology.. Dean's List At the end of each fall and spring semester, the Registration and Records Office prepares a Dean's List for each undergraduate college of all full-time undergraduate students who have completed at least 12 collegiate hours and have earned a minimum semester grade point average of 3.5. This honor is noted on the student's academic record. Academic Honors The University of Texas at El Paso offers three opportunities for students to achieve special recognition for academic performance at graduation. Graduation with any of these honors adds a special distinction to academic records and diplomas and may enhance the prospects for graduating seniors to enter graduate and professional schools or the job market. To be eligible for the following recognitions and/or programs, candidates must be among the most able and intellectually curious of students and must meet minimum GPA requirements. Upon graduation, honors in the following categories will be automatically awarded for each baccalaureate degree conferred upon students who have completed at least sixty (60) of the total required credit hours for their degrees at The University of Texas at El Paso: 1. Summa Cum Laude (Highest Honors) will be awarded to students who attain a minimum UTEP grade point average of 3.90. 2. Magna Cum Laude (High Honors) will be awarded to students who attain a minimum UTEP grade point average of 3.80, but who do not qualify for Highest Honors. 3. Cum Laude (Honors) will be awarded to students who attain a minimum UTEP grade point average of 3.50, but who do not qualify for High or Highest Honors. Those students who are graduating from UTEP but who have not completed at least sixty (60) of the total required credit hours fro their degrees will be considered for award of honors under the following conditions: 1. Their academic performance at UTEP reflects a level of academic achievement meeting the standards above; and 2. Their level of academic achievement at prior institutions is congruent with their performance at UTEP. In such instances, the Registrar's Office will identify eligible students and review their academic records from their prior institutions. If a student's aggregate GPA from all institutions attended is commensurate with the standards stated above, the student will be eligible for honors appropriate to that aggregate GPA. In no case, however, will the student be eligible for honors beyond the level achieved in the GPA earned at UTEP. Requirements for honors for a second degree include the above requirements with the additional stipulation that the student completes thirty (30) hours beyond the original baccalaureate requirements.

The handbook supplements the rules and regulations of the Board of Regents and covers student conduct and discipline, use of University facilities, student organizations, educational records, and student publications. The Rules and Regulations of the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System are at http://www.utsystem.edu/bor/rules . The administration of student discipline (academic dishonesty and general misconduct is the responsibility of the Assistant Dean of Students who is located in the Office of Student Life. STUDENT CONDUCT While enrolled at the University, a student neither loses the rights nor escapes the responsibilities of citizenship. Any student who engages in conduct that is prohibited by the Board of Regents' Rules and Regulations or University rules or by federal, state, or local law is subject to discipline whether such conduct takes place on or off campus or whether civil or criminal penalties are also imposed for such conduct. All students are expected and required to obey the law, to show respect for properly constituted authority, and to observe correct standards of conduct. The University of Texas at El Paso administers student discipline according to established procedures of due process. Procedures are defined and described in the Rules and Regulations of the Board of Regents, Rule 50101, and in the Handbook of Operating Procedures (HOP) . Students should check with appropriate departments whose policy or regulation is of concern. If necessary, students need to refer to the rules in the Regents' Rules and Regulations ( http://www.utsystem.edu/bor/rules ) and the HOP . The Office of Student Life can assist on this matter. This set of rules is available at http://hoop.utep.edu . OTHER PROHIBITED CONDUCT Computer usage violations, use of alcoholic beverages, dishonesty, gambling, defacing of property, endangering the health or safety of others, use of obscene and threatening language, altering of records, possession or use of firearms, failure to respond promptly to official notices and other infractions will subject the student to disciplinary action. Penalties, which can be imposed in conjunction with the approved disciplinary procedures, include the following: written warning, disciplinary probation, withholding of grades, withholding of official transcript or degree, restitution, failing grade, denial of degree, suspension and expulsion, revocation of degree and withdrawal of diploma, or other penalty as deemed appropriate under the circumstances. In addition, certain privileges can be withdrawn consistent with the severity of the offense and the rehabilitation of the student. These penalties can be imposed singularly or in any combination upon individuals, groups, or organizations. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material, including unauthorized peer-to-peer file sharing, may subject students to civil and criminal liabilities. UTEP's policy on Peer-to-Peer Sharing can be found at https://admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?tabid=63689 . Penalties for copyrighted violations may be found at: http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html . Additionally, students may be subjected to disciplinary action as described in this section. GANG-FREE ZONE Premises owned, rented or leased by The University of Texas at El Paso and areas within 1,000 feet of the premises are \"gang-free\" zones. Certain criminal offenses, including those involving gang-related crimes, will be enhanced to the next highest category of offense if committed in a gang-free zone by an individual 17 years or older. See Texas Penal Code, Section 71.028. ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES POLICY The use, possession, or sale of any illegal drugs or narcotics, including any amount of marijuana on the campus of the University, is a violation of Regents' Rules and Regulations and of University policies governing student conduct, as well as a violation of state law. In addition to possible criminal prosecution, student offenders will be subject to disciplinary action by the University. The minimum disciplinary penalty that will be imposed is suspension from the University for a specified period of time and/or suspension of rights and privileges. DISRUPTIVE ACTS POLICY The obstruction or disruption of any teaching, research, administrative, disciplinary, public service, or other authorized activity on campus or under the authority of the University or on property owned or controlled by the University is prohibited and will subject the student or group of students to disciplinary action. HAZING POLICY Hazing in state educational institutions is prohibited by both state law (Sections 51.936 and 37.151 et seq., Texas Education Code ) and by the Regents' Rules and Regulations (Rule 50101). Individuals or organizations engaging in hazing could be subject to fines and charged with criminal offenses. Additionally, the law does not affect or in any way restrict the right of the University to enforce its own rules against hazing. The law defines hazing as any intentional, knowing, or reckless act, occurring on or off the campus of an educational institution, by one person alone or acting with others, directed against a student, that endangers the mental or physical health or safety of a student for the purpose of pledging, being initiated into, affiliating with, holding office in, or maintaining membership in any organization whose members are or include students at an educational institution. Hazing includes but is not limited to: Any type of physical brutality, such as whipping, beating, striking, branding, electronic shocking, placing of a harmful substance on the body, or similar activity; Any type of physical activity, such as sleep deprivation, exposure to the elements, confinement in a small space, calisthenics, or other activity that subjects the student to an unreasonable risk or harm or that adversely affects the mental or physical health or safety of the student; Any activity involving consumption of food, liquid, alcoholic beverage, liquor, drug, or other substance which subjects the student to an unreasonable risk or harm or which adversely affects the mental or physical health of the student; Any activity that intimidates or threatens the student with ostracism; that subjects the student to extreme mental stress, shame, or humiliation; or that adversely affects the mental health or dignity of the student or discourages the student from entering or remaining registered in an educational institution; or that may reasonably be expected to cause a student to leave the organization or the institution rather than submit to acts described in this subsection; Any activity that induces, causes, or requires the student to perform a duty or task which involves a violation of the Penal Code . Activities which under certain conditions constitute acts that are dangerous, harmful, or degrading, in violation of rules include but are not limited to: calisthenics, such as sit-ups, push-ups, or any other form of physical exercise; total or partial nudity at any time; the eating or ingesting of unwanted substance; the wearing or carrying of any obscene or physically burdensome article; paddle swats, including the trading of swats; pushing, shoving, tackling, or any other physical contact;pushing, shoving, tackling, or any other physical contact; throwing oil; syrup, flour, or any other harmful substance on a person; rat court, kangaroo court, or other individual interrogation; forced consumption of alcoholic beverages either by threats or peer pressure; lineups intended to demean or intimidate; transportation and abandonment (road trips, kidnaps, walks, rides, drops); confining individuals in an area that is uncomfortable or dangerous (hot box effect, high temperature, too small); any type of personal servitude that is demeaning or of personal benefit to the individual members; wearing of embarrassing or uncomfortable clothing; assigning pranks such as stealing, painting objects, harassing other organizations; intentionally messing up the house or room for clean up; demeaning names; yelling and screaming; and requiring boxing matches or fights for entertainment. The University regards any form of hazing as a major violation, and any individual and/or registered student organization participating in such activities will be held responsible for those actions. According to the law, a person can commit a hazing offense both by engaging in a hazing activity and by soliciting, directing, encouraging, aiding, or attempting to aid another engaging in hazing; by intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly allowing hazing to occur; or by failing to report in writing to the Dean of Students or other appropriate university officials first-hand knowledge that a hazing incident is planned or has occurred. The fact that a person consented to or acquiesced in a hazing activity is not a defense to prosecution for hazing under this law. An organization can commit a hazing offense if the organization condones or encourages hazing or if an officer or any combination of members, pledges, or alumni of the organization commits or assists in the commission of hazing. In an effort to encourage reporting of hazing incidents, the law grants immunity from civil or criminal liability to any person who reports a specific hazing event in good faith and without malice to the Office of Student Life or other appropriate university officials, and it immunizes a person from participation in any judicial proceeding resulting from that report. SOLICITATION In general, solicitation is prohibited in any building, structure, or facility of the UTEP campus. Certain university activities are permitted as defined in the Handbook of Operating Procedures . This handbook is available for review in the Office of Student Life and on the homepage of the Office of Student Life at https://studentaffairs.utep.edu/dos. STUDENT TRAVEL POLICY Purpose The University of Texas at El Paso promotes safe travel by students who participate in certain university-organized and sponsored activities or events. Policy and Procedure 1 .

BACTERIAL MENINGITIS Bacterial meningitis is a serious, potentially deadly disease that can progress rapidly. Students are urged to take utmost caution. This is an inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. The bacterium that causes meningitis can also infect the blood. This disease strikes about 3,000 Americans each year, including 100-125 on college campuses, leading to five to 15 deaths among college students every year. There is a treatment, but those who survive might develop severe health problems or disabilities. What are the symptoms ? High fever Rash or purple patches on skin Sensitivity to light Confusion and sleepiness Lethargy Severe headache Vomiting Stiff neck Nausea Seizures There might be a rash of tiny, red-purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin. These can occur anywhere on the body. The more symptoms, the higher the risk, so when these symptoms appear, seek immediate medical attention. How is Bacterial Meningitis diagnosed ? Diagnosis is made by a medical provider and is usually based on a combination of clinical symptoms and laboratory results from spinal fluid and blood tests. Early diagnosis and treatment can greatly improve the likelihood of recovery. How is the disease transmitted? The disease is transmitted when people exchange saliva (such as by kissing, or by sharing drinking containers, utensils, cigarettes, toothbrushes, etc.) or come in contact with respiratory or throat secretions. How does one increase the risk of getting bacterial meningitis? Exposure to saliva by sharing cigarettes, water bottles, eating utensils, food, kissing, etc. Living in close conditions (such as sharing a room or suite in a dorm or group home). What are the possible consequences of the disease? Death ( in 8 to 24 hours from perfectly well to dead ) Permanent brain damage Kidney failure Learning disability Hearing loss or blindness Limb damage (fingers, toes, arms, legs) requiring amputation Gangrene Coma Convulsions Can the disease be treated? Antibiotic treatment, if received early, can save lives and chances of recovery are increased. However, permanent disability or death can still occur. Vaccinations are available and should be considered for: Those living in close quarters College students 25 years old or younger Vaccinations are effective against -four of the -five most common bacterial types that cause 70% of the disease in the U.S. but do not protect against all types of meningitis. Vaccinations take seven to10 days to become effective, with protections lasting a minimum of eight years. The cost of the vaccine varies; health care providers have more information. Vaccination is very safe. The most common side effects are redness and minor pain at the injection site for up to two days. Vaccination is available at the UTEP Student Health Center, on a walk-in basis.

Additional Certification Levels, Fields, and Supplemental Texas-certified teachers who wish to add another level of certification and/or a new field of specialization or endorsement must submit a copy of their state certificate(s) and have a new plan prepared at the COE Advising, Recruitment and Career (ARC) Center, Education 412. Teachers who are already certified can add any level of certification or field of specialization available to early childhood, middle, secondary, and all-levels UTEP students. The state provides certified teachers an opportunity to add new certification levels and specialization fields by challenging the TExES tests in those areas (H.B. 2185). There are also supplementary certificates offered in Bilingual Education and English as a Second Language (ESOL). Out-of-State Teachers Teachers with valid out-of-state teaching credentials who are seeking a Texas certificate must contact the Texas State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC) directly in order to have their credentials evaluated. Information is available on the SBEC website ( http://www.sbec.state.tx.us ). To update their certificate, teachers with expired out-of-statehave their credentials evaluated. Information is available on the SBEC website ( http://www.sbec.state.tx.us ). To update their certificate, teachers with expired out-of-state teaching certificates must either contact the state in which they were certified before contacting SBEC, or follow the procedure established for candidates who have a bachelor's degree and desire an initial Texas certification. Admission to Teacher Education Undergraduate students who wish to become elementary grades, middle grades, secondary, or all-levels teachers in Texas should have an unofficial degree and certification plan prepared as soon as possible. Pre-education students begin the advising process during the New Student Orientation (NSO) session the summer proceeding the first semester of freshmen classes. Advising continues for pre-education students (individuals who have 0-45 hours of course credits) at the UTEP Academic Advising Office, located on Hawthorne Street. After completing 45 hours, the student is advised at the COE Advising, Recruitment, and Career (ARC) Center, located in the Education Building, Room412. Once the student has completed 45 hours, a copy of the degree plan must be filed in the ARC Center. The degree plan will become official once the student has fulfilled all the requirements for admission to teacher education. To be admitted to teacher education, students must fulfill the following criteria: 1 . Complete ENGL 1311 and 1312 and COMM 1301 with a grade of C or better in each course. 2 . Complete STAT 1380 or MATH 2303 or a higher-level math course with a grade of \"C\" or better. 3 . Provide required passing scores on the Texas Higher Education Assessment (THEA) examination: 220 in writing, 230 in math and 230 in reading. To register for the test, contact the Student Assessment and Testing Office in the Academic Advising Building. 4 . Complete 60 semester hours of college work with a cumulative GPA of 2.50 or better. 5 . Provide an unofficial degree and/or certification plan filed in the ARC Center. 6 . Meet with advisor and apply for admission to the Teacher Education Program, Education 412. Note : To receive initial Texas teacher certification, students must be free of felony convictions. Until admitted to teacher education, students indicating an intention to become teachers will be classified as pre-education students. According to University policy, students must remain in good standing to progress toward the completion of a degree program (See the appropriate catalog section under Academic Standards ). In addition, students can be barred from enrolling in professional education courses if their suitability for the teaching profession is found to be unacceptable. Field-Based Teacher Preparation Requirements Teacher preparation students are expected to spend a significant amount of time in specially selected schools (partner schools and professional development schools) while they complete their professional development courses. Admission to teacher education is required to participate in the field-based teacher preparation program. The Texas State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC) regulates the certification of educators to teach Texas public-school children. Before an individual can be certified, SBEC must conduct a criminal history background check to ensure an applicant's suitability to interact with children. Working with the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the agency conducts statewide criminal history background checks on all applicants for educator certification. Students pursuing educator preparation should be aware that some criminal histories can lead to the denial of certification as a teacher. Students can obtain additional information from SBEC, http://www.sbec.state.tx.us/SBECOnline/ . Texas public school districts require applicants for student-teaching or field experiences to undergo a criminal history background check prior to placement in the school district. School districts can deny placement of students with a criminal background. If a school district denies a placement or other field experiences for this reason, the UTEP College of Education can attempt to assist the student in obtaining a placement in an alternate district. Students should be aware, however, that if they are unable to obtain a placement they will not meet UTEP's requirements for a teaching degree or teacher certification. Description of the Elementary Grades, Middle Grades, and Special Education Field-Based Programs The elementary grades, middle grades and special education field-based programs consist of two semesters in which students take site-based University courses in partner or professional development schools and complete Internship I and Internship II. A description of the two semesters follows. Elementary Grades , Middle Grades, and Special Education Internship I . Education students are grouped in cohorts of approximately 35 interns and assigned to elementary or middle-grades professional development schools or partner schools where they spend three half-days per week engaged in student teaching. During Internship I, interns also take education courses that require practice in school classrooms. Many of these education courses are taught on site in elementary or middle grades professional development schools. In this semester, the major concepts and skills required in the field-based program are introduced and interns become familiar with the pupils, the teams of teachers, and the community of the partner schools to which they are assigned. The semester has an emphasis on role induction. Internship I takes place in the fall or spring semesters. Interns are usually assigned to their student teaching classrooms one week prior to the start of UTEP classes. They normally begin the internship on the first day of teacher in-service or soon afterward and attend for 15 weeks. Elementary Grades, Middle Grades, and Special Education Internship II . During Internship II, interns spend at least three full days per week throughout the semester student teaching in professional development schools or partner schools and one day per week taking education courses that require classroom practice. Many of these education courses are taught on site in elementary or middle-grades professional development schools. The emphasis on role induction continues during Internship II while interns work with pupils and educators. Interns assist teachers mainly through small-group work and begin to experience whole-class instruction. Interns demonstrate that they can synthesize the knowledge, values, and experiences of earlier semesters in developing an effective teaching style. Proficiency in all program competencies is assessed during this time. Internship II takes place in the fall or spring semesters. Interns are usually assigned to their practice teaching classrooms one week prior to UTEP classes starting, normally on or soon after the first day of teacher in-service and attend three full days per week for 15 weeks. Description of the Secondary and All-Levels Field-Based Program The goal of the secondary and all-levels teacher preparation program is to assist preservice teachers in acquiring the essential competencies required to assume the role of practitioners. The secondary and all-levels programs have one internship semester that is offered in the fall or spring semester. Faculty from the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Science, and the College of Health Sciences participate actively with Education faculty in the preparation of secondary and all-levels teachers, by teaching some of the methods courses in their respective disciplines. SCED 3311 - Curriculum Planning in the Secondary School is taught on site at various professional development school campuses and requires intensive field experiences that help secondary and all-levels students apply their theoretical understandings to actual practice in schools. This course should precede the internship semester. In the internship semester, secondary and all-levels interns assist classroom teachers at a partner school with small-group work and begin to experience whole class instruction. Interns demonstrate that they can synthesize the knowledge, values, and experiences of earlier semesters in developing an effective teaching style. Proficiency in all program competencies is assessed. Interns practice teaching at schools four and a half (4 \u00bd) days a week throughout the 15-week semester and spend the remaining half-day of the week taking an education course that requires classroom practice. The secondary and all-levels internship takes place in the fall or spring semesters. Interns are usually assigned to their practice teaching classrooms one week before UTEP classes start, normally on or soon after the first day of teacher in-service, and attend all day. Application for Graduation and Certification Students must apply for graduation during the first month of the semester in which they intend to complete all degree requirements. A graduation fee is required. Students who are seeking certification must register for and pass the appropriate state certification examinations (TExES). Students apply for certification once they complete all the requirements, including the appropriate TExES tests. A fee is required for the Texas certificate. In order to be recommended for degree and/or certification, a student must: Complete the courses listed in the degree and certification plan with an overall GPA of at least 2.0. Have a 2.5 GPA or better in the teaching field specialization. Have a 2.75 GPA or better in professional education courses. Note : To receive initial Texas teacher cert ification, individuals must be free of felony convictions. Secondary School Teacher Preparation Programs Students who intend to become secondary school teachers and receive an initial Texas teacher certificate will complete a bachelor's degree outside the College of Education. These students major in the subject area they desire to teach and complete a minor in Secondary Education. For example, a student who intends to teach high school Spanish would seek a Bachelor of Arts degree in the College of Liberal Arts with a major in Spanish and a minor in Secondary Education. Students desiring to become secondary school teachers must have a degree plan and copy of their certificate plan filed in the College of Education Advising, Recruitment, and Career (ARC) Center located in Education 412. The ARC Center verifies that students have fulfilled the required scores in the state-mandated test of basic skills (THEA) and have completed all the requirements to be admitted to teacher education. Enrollment in EDPC 3300 requires admission to Teacher Education. The application process for admission to Teacher Education can be initiated as soon as the student completes 60 hours and a copy of the student's degree and certification plan is submitted to the ARC Center. (Students should refer to the Admission to Teacher Education section above.) Students who wish to enroll in the fall internship semester must apply in February of the prior semester in the ARC Center. Students who wish to enroll in the spring internship semester must apply in September of the prior semester.

They can point to tangible evidence of their efforts. Every modern structure, computer, jet aircraft, power- generating plant, or new automobile design is a lasting testimonial to the engineers responsible for it. Thus, to a great extent, current standards of living and high levels of technology are results of the diligent and innovative efforts of engineers. Future accomplishments could help increase energy and food supplies, develop more contamination-free power plants, aid in medical science's fight against disease, and expand humans' computational and design skills beyond imagination. A noted researcher once summarized the engineer's career satisfaction by pointing out that while scientists \"explore what is,\" engineers \"create what never has been.\" The future for engineering graduates remains very bright. The rapid pace of technological and industrial developments has established an ever-increasing need for highly talented and qualified professional engineers. In addition, the increasing demand for goods and services has imposed new challenges to present and future engineers. To provide these things and, at the same time, conserve resources and minimize environmental impact, engineers must recognize that solutions to long-standing societal problems are found only by thorough planning and study. With a capacity for problem solving, engineers might be the best-qualified persons to address society's problems. The complexities of today's economy and environment are such that all resources must be used in an optimal manner. Thus, the College of Engineering, through its curricula, strives to educate and train engineers who have the desire to learn and the breadth of vision to formulate and solve the problems of today and tomorrow. It is expected that a student who applies himself or herself and successfully completes one of the engineering or computer science programs will be both technically prepared and broadly educated, and thus ready to make significant contributions. The College offers many programs of study that should be selected on the basis of personal ambitions, interests, and abilities. The student can choose the traditional bachelor's degree and also consider advanced research-oriented graduate programs leading to the master's and Ph.D. degrees. Within the College, the undergraduate programs in civil, electrical, industrial, mechanical, and metallurgical and materials engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, Maryland 21202-4012; telephone: 410.347.7700. The breadth of modern computer technology is covered by BS and MS degrees in Computer Science and a computer engineering concentration in Electrical and Computer Engineering. The program leading to the BS in Computer Science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, Maryland 21202-4012; telephone: 410.347.7700. To recognize outstanding achievement and to encourage professional activities, each program has one or more active student sections of the appropriate professional and honor societies. Additionally, there are campus chapters of professional societies that cover all fields of engineering. Participation in these groups provides a valuable educational and professional experience and students are encouraged to participate to the extent of their eligibility.

Pre-Engineering Program The Entering Students Program for Engineering and Science Circles of Learning for Entering Students (CircLES) Program Description Circles of Learning for Entering Students (CircLES) is a comprehensive retention program targeting first-time freshman and first-time transfer students in the sciences, engineering and mathematics (SEM). The goals of CircLES are to increase retention to improve academic performance, and to add value to a student's education through the creation of an environment in which students make connections with the university, the colleges, faculty, upper-division students, and their peers. A learning environment is emphasized in the first year so that entering students can be successful and begin to develop lifelong learning habits. There are four major foci within the CircLES Program, all coordinated by the Director of the Entering Student Program: (1) a mandatory college-specific orientation program in the summer prior to matriculation;(2) mandatory placement in learningDirector of the Entering Student Program: (1) a mandatory college-specific orientation program in the summer prior to matriculation;(2) mandatory placement in learning communities (clusters) in the first year; (3) strong developmental advising and early intervention and (4) leadership development. Since its inception, the CircLES program has become recognized as a model on campus and elsewhere for creating a strong foundation for entering students to springboard them toward a successful college and (eventually) professional career. Students wishing to major in engineering or computer science will be classified as pre-engineering students for not less than one semester after admission to the University. Students must fulfill all pre-engineering requirements and must: 1 . Complete the specified orientation program. 2 . Meet with a pre-engineering advisor each semester. 3 . Complete an approved program of study that can include one or more of the following courses: UNIV the pre-engineering program, some of these courses do not meet departmental degree requirements. Check with your CircLES advisor. 4 . Maintain a minimum overall GPA of 2.0 in all designated courses. 5 . Complete certain specified courses with a C or better. 6 . Make satisfactory progress toward completion of the pre-engineering program. Upon completion of the pre-engineering program requirements, students will petition for a change of major into a selected engineering program. Limit on Engineering Course Enrollments The maximum number of times an Engineering or Computer Science course can be taken is three (3). All enrollments in a course that result in a grade of A, B, C, D, F, or W will be counted. Once a student has reached the maximum of three enrollments, he or she will not be allowed to enroll in the course a fourth time. If the course is required in the student's degree plan, the student will not be able to complete the requirements for that degree. Once a student has obtained a C or better in an Engineering or Computer Science course, that course cannot be repeated for credit. Enrollment in Engineering/Computer Science Courses by Non-Majors Enrollment in nearly all Engineering and Computer Science courses is restricted to students with the appropriate majors. Students from outside the engineering college wishing to take engineering/computer science courses should request permission from the head of the program offering the course. Double Majors Students in the College of Engineering can pursue more than one undergraduate degree. However, all requirements for each degree must be completed before the degree can be awarded. Cooperative Education Cooperative education is a program which integrates a student's formal academic study with special periods of practical work experience in business, industry, government, or professional or service organizations. These work experiences are an integral part of the student's education, supplementing academic knowledge and promoting and encouraging personal development and professional preparation. The academic value of work completed under the cooperative education program is recognized by allowing credit to be earned for completion of three work periods and submission of required reports. Contact the Dean of Engineering for information on the availability of co-op work assignments. Five-Year Bachelor/Master of Science Program The College of Engineering provides an opportunity for qualified students to participate in a five-year bachelor/master of science degree program.

Speech-Language Pathology 1101 North Campbell Street, Room 107 915.747.7250 scphlang@utep.edu DIRECTOR: Anthony P. Salvatore PROFESSORS EMERITI: The Program in Speech-Language Pathology offers an innovative five-year plan that culminates with the Master of Science Degree. Students who complete the plan fulfill academic course work and clinical practicum requirements for the Texas license, as well as the Certificate of Clinical Competence in Speech-Language Pathology. The plan includes 97 semester credit hours of undergraduate course work and 33 required semester hours, in addition to registering for five semesters of clinical practicum (15 semester hours), all of which can be completed in five years. Undergraduate students selecting this program will be designated as pre-Speech-Language Pathology majors. Students with a BS or BA in Speech-Language Pathology from another university are encouraged to apply for admission to the graduate program. Since the plan of study culminates with the Master of Science Degree, undergraduates should be aware of the following: 1 . A GPA minimum of 3.0 in upper-division preparatory SPLP undergraduate courses and acceptable GRE scores on the Verbal, Quantitative and Written section are required for acceptance into the Graduate School. A GPA higher than 3.0 can offset low GRE scores; high GRE scores can enhance consideration. A description of the Master of Science program is in the Graduate Catalog . Admission is competitive. The number of students admitted each year is depends on available program resources. 2 . Undergraduate students must take the GRE and apply to the Graduate School prior to the completion of the prescribed 97 undergraduate hours. 3 . Students whose grades in SPLP courses do not appear to demonstrate the potential for success in Graduate School should discuss with their advisor the advisability of continuing in the Speech-Language Pathology Program prior to beginning the third year. 4 . In order to engage in clinical rotations, which are a crucial element in the curriculum, Speech Language Pathology students must pass a background check. Therefore, applicants accepted to the Master of Science in Speech Language Pathology program will be required to undergo and pass a background check prior to matriculation. Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Science in Speech-Language Pathology is not offered. Students interested in pursuing a Master of Science in Speech Language Pathology will be designated as Pre-Speech Language Pathology (PSHL).

The purpose of professional social work education is to enable students to integrate the knowledge, values, and skills of the social work profession into competent practice. Fully accredited by the Council on Social Work Education, the Department of Social Work baccalaureate program prepares students for generalist social work practice. Social Work Department Mission The mission of the Department of Social Work is to educate culturally competent social work practitioners to provide services and promote social and economic justice in partnership with the unique multicultural, international population of the Paso Del Norte region and beyond. The Department of Social Work is dedicated to student success. Bachelor of Social Work Degree The BSW degree plan is designated to assure coverage of Council of Social Work Education-mandated curriculum content. The degree plan is based on a building-block analogy of Social Work education. The freshman and sophomore years are considered the liberal arts foundation. The junior year is the foundation professional year. The senior year is the concluding professional year. Social Work classes are offered sequentially and include content on values, ethics, diversity, social and economic justice, populations at risk, human behavior and the social environment, social welfare policy and services, social work practice, research, and field practicum. The Department of Social Work places a strong value on community involvement, and students begin early in their course of study to gain practical experience through volunteer hours in approved agencies. In the foundation professional (junior) year, a pre-internship experience of 60 hours is incorporated into the course SOWK 3355 Introduction to Generalist Practice I. Professional social work advising allows for early and periodic evaluation of each student's performance and guides students in selecting courses required to fulfill degree-plan requirements. Advising during the freshman and sophomore years can be provided by the Student Support Center at the College of Health Sciences, with Social Work majors also attending Social Work Orientation and receiving advising as needed from Social Work faculty members. When Social Work majors are nearing completion of university core and pre- professional course requirements as described on the Social Work Degree Plan, advising will be provided by UTEP Social Work faculty members.

The program offers courses studying a range of issues that cross disciplines courses that deal with the impact of gender within individual disciplines, such as History, Political Science, and Sociology, to name a few. Although the Women's Studies Program was created in 1981, UTEP has offered individual courses in Women's Studies since the early 1970s. The program's primary goal is to foster gender equality in scholarship, in the workplace, and in society as a whole. Women's Studies courses offer students a rigorous education in theories of women's oppression, diverse gender roles and sexual identities, the history of gender relations, contemporary economic and social policies affecting women and men, and the creative work of women in the United States, Mexico, and around the globe. Women's Studies courses also demonstrate that knowledge is created both in and outside of the University; therefore, many courses integrate the knowledge and experience of community activists, community organizations, and women in theEl Paso-Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez region. A minor in Women's Studies complements any major at the University and will prepare students for a wide range of careers. Whether a student plans to be a lawyer, a journalist, a business executive, a social worker, an educator, or a political official, Women's Studies courses can help one learn about the specific challenges women face and develop solutions to gender inequity. If a student plans to attend graduate school, the minor in Women's Studies will prepare her or him for advanced study as a Women's Studies scholar.

Pre-Science Program Circles of Learning for Entering Students (CircLES) The Entering Students Program for Engineering and Science Engineering Bldg., Room E-229 Phone: (915) 747-6083 Fax: (915) 747-8878 Program Description Circles of Learning for Entering Students (CircLES) is a comprehensive retention program targeting first-time freshman and first-time transfer students in the sciences, engineering and mathematics (SEM). The goals of CircLES are to increase retention, improve academic performance, and add value to a student's education through the creation of an environment in which students make connections with the university, the colleges, faculty, upper-division students, and their peers. In the first year, a learning environment in which entering students can be successful and begin to develop lifelong learning habits is emphasized. There are four major foci within the CircLES Program, all coordinated by the Director of the Entering Student Program. (1) a mandatory college-specific orientation program in the summer prior to matriculation; (2) mandatory placement in learning communities (clusters) in the first year; (3) strong developmental advising and early intervention; and (4) leadership development. Since its inception, the CircLES program has become recognized as a model on campus and elsewhere for creating a strong foundation from which entering students can springboard toward a successful college and (eventually) professional career. Vision The CircLES Program wants to be a recognized model for creating a strong foundation from which entering students can springboard toward a successful college and professional career. Mission Statement The CircLES Program is dedicated to (1) providing pre-engineering and Pre-Science students the skills and knowledge to become successful college students; (2) developing leadership skills and self- awareness in entering and other students to foster their success; and (3) connecting entering students to the university, the Colleges of Engineering and Science faculty, and each other. Educational Objectives for the CircLES Program 1 . To provide pre-engineering and Pre-Science students the motivation, skills, and knowledge to become successful college students and to become successful engineering and science students. 2 . To introduce pre-engineering and Pre-Science students to team building and group-dynamic skills. 3 . To begin developing leadership skills in pre-engineering and Pre-Science students. 4 . To increase the awareness of pre-engineering and Pre-Science students of the opportunities available to engineering and science graduates. Students wishing to major in Science will be classified as Pre-Science students for not less than one semester after admission to the University. Students must fulfill all Pre-Science requirements and must: 1 . Complete the specified orientation program. 2 . Meet with a Pre-Science advisor each semester. 3 . Complete an approved program of study that can include one or more of the following courses: UNIV the Pre-Science program, some of these courses do not meet departmental degree requirements. Students should check with the CircLES advisor. 4 . Maintain a minimum overall GPA of 2.0 in all designated courses. 5 . Complete certain specified courses with a C or better. 6 . Make satisfactory progress toward completion of the Pre-Science Program. Upon completion of the Pre-Science program requirements, students will petition for a change of major into a selected science department. Advising All students enrolled in the College of Science must be advised prior to registration. Students should follow the directions for obtaining academic advice outlined in the Class Schedule under the Advising: College of Science section. Although the Department of Psychology might not require advising, it is strongly recommended that students seeking the BS in Psychology obtain degree plan advice from the Office of the Dean of Science. In particular, these students are advised to not postpone the required courses in Mathematics. Students planning a career in Clinical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Physical Therapy, Pharmacy, or other allied health fields are referred to the College of Health Sciences section of this catalog and should be advised in that College. Pre-professional Advice The Office of the Dean of Science sponsors a Medical Professions Institute, which houses the Pre-professional Advisor. Students should work closely with this advisor if they are interested in entering medical, dental, veterinary or physician assistant schools. These professions normally require a baccalaureate degree. No particular major is required for entrance, although a minimum of two years of Biology, two years of Chemistry (including a year of Organic Chemistry), a semester of Calculus, and one year of Physics are required for admission to most health professional schools. Thus, a major in Chemistry, Biological Sciences, Microbiology, or Physics might be appropriate. Secondary Teacher Certification (8-12) Secondary Teacher Certification The College of Science encourages students to consider teaching in the secondary schools as a career goal. The College realizes that better prepared mathematics and science teachers will result in better college freshmen. Certification for teaching in the secondary schools is available in the following BS degree fields: Mathematics Certification, Mathematics/Physics Certification, and Science 8-12 (formerly known as Composite Certification; Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, or Interdisciplinary Studies). All majors leading to high school teacher certification require a minor in Secondary Education. For degree requirements, please click here , select your major, and select a concentration area in education. Those who already hold a baccalaureate degree in mathematics or a science can obtain a post-baccalaureate or alternative secondary teacher certification in the College of Education. Students should refer to the College of Education section of this catalog for details on these programs. Students of mathematics and sciences considering teaching should inform themselves of these options and decide which is best for them. Admission to Secondary Teacher Education For Teacher Education admission requirements, please see the College of Education section of this catalog. Application for admission to the program is completed with the Secondary Education Advisor in the College of Science and filed in the College of Education Student Services Office, Education Building, Room 412. Additional requirements can be found in the College of Education section of this catalog. Secondary Teacher Preparation Programs: Internship Semester Students preparing to teach are advised to carefully plan their course work to allow for the completion of their major coursework before the Internship Semester. Students are interns in secondary schools for 4-four and one-half days a week and take SCED 3317 during the remaining half day. Because students are in the schools every day, it is almost impossible to complete upper-division major courses during this semester. Degree Plans Degree plans are the major tools by which students, their advisors, their departments, and the College of Science track academic progress. Generalized degree plans are available on-line via http://degreeplans.utep.edu. However, any student who has completed 60 credit hours and is Calculus-ready is required to file for an individualized degree plan that is specific to his or her personal academic history. The degree plan also lists the outstanding requirements for graduation, and must be obtained from the Office of the Dean of the College of Science. A copy of the degree plan will also be filed with the student's major department. The degree plan must be updated following the completion of 90 credit hours. Each student is required to obtain confirmation of his or her standing from the Office of the Dean of the College of Science prior to registering for the semester in which all course work for a degree is to be completed. The academic dean is therefore the final gatekeeper for determining whether all requirements for a degree have been met and the student can proceed to graduate. Lower-Division Courses The prerequisite structure in science programs requires careful attention to course sequences. These courses should be completed before the student reaches junior standing (60 semester credit hours). These and allfreshman courses specified as required for the degree must be completed before senior standing (90 semester credit hours) in order to count toward the minimum hours required for the degree. Enrollment in MATH 1411 or equivalent is required in order to declare a major. It is to the student's advantage to continue enrolling in the other required mathematics courses since success in these courses depends largely upon what was learned in the previous course, and delaying enrollment in higher-level courses often requires considerable review. Required Lower-Division Courses in the major and minor should be completed with a grade of C or better before enrollment in upper-division courses. These lower-division courses are listed below.Required Lower-Division Courses in the major and minor should be completed with a grade of C or better before enrollment in upper-division courses. These lower-division courses are listed below. Other lower-division College of Science courses required for the various degree plans are included in brackets. These courses should also be completed with a C or better before enrolling in upper-division courses if the discipline is the minor. For lower-division courses in your major, please click here and select your major. Upper-Division Courses A minimum of 37 semester hours of upper-division course work is required. The various majors have different requirements for upper-division course work in the major and minor. Students should consult those respective sections. Upper-division courses are often not offered each semester or during summer sessions. Students are cautioned to plan ahead in terms of when these courses are generally offered and what prerequisites are needed.

Fowler, Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Education 1101 North Campbell Street 915.747.8217 915.747.8266 son@utep.edu A baccalaureate nursing program (BSN) was established in El Paso in 1970 under the administration of The University of Texas System School of Nursing. In 1976, the School of Nursing became an integral part of The University of Texas at El Paso and was organized as a College of Nursing. The Health Science and Medical Technology Programs were transferred to the College in 1979, and shortly thereafter, the name was changed to the College of Nursing and Allied Health. In 1999, the School of Nursing became an integral part of the once-again renamed College of Health Sciences and the School of Nursing. On September 1, 2006, the School of Nursing again became its own independent unit and is now known as The University of Texas at El Paso School of Nursing. The School of Nursing is located approximately one mile from the main UTEP campus, at 1101 North Campbell Street, and is housed in a large, modern building which includes classrooms, laboratories, faculty offices, and lounges for both students and faculty. The School of Nursing provides undergraduate nursing programs leading to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree (traditional 4-four-year BSN; RN-to-BSN Option and a fast-track program for students with a previously earned degree) as well as the graduate program culminating in the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree. The nursing programs are fully accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) and approved by the Texas State Board of Nursing (BON).

Student Employment The School of Nursing assumes no responsibility for students employed in a health care agency. A student is personally responsible and liable for any activities conducted while employed. Professional liability insurance purchased by a student is valid in the student role, but not in the employment role. (Students should check their individual policies). An individual who practices nursing illegally can jeopardize his or her future as a licensed professional. A student employed in an agency has the responsibility, personally and professionally, to engage in only those activities which fall within the job description for non-professional workers, and has a responsibility to refuse to participate in activities which he or she has not been legally licensed to perform. Nursing Student Organization All enrolled students are eligible for membership in the Nursing Student Organization, an affiliate of the Texas Nursing Students' Association and the National Student Nurses' Association. The UTEP Chapter has goals consistent with those of the National Student Nurses' Association. Its purpose is to aid in the development of the individual student, the profession of nursing and the delivery of health care. Sigma Theta Tau Delta Kappa Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau was chartered at The University of Texas at El Paso in 1980. The purposes of Sigma Theta Tau are to recognize the achievement of scholarship of superior quality, to recognize the development of leadership qualities, to foster high professional standards, to encourage creative work, and to strengthen commitment on the part of individuals to the ideals and purposes of the profession of nursing. Each year invitations to membership are extended to selected students in either the undergraduate or graduate programs who are within the upper one-third of their graduating class and who have a minimum 3.00 GPA. Financial Aid Students enrolled in the School of Nursing are eligible to apply for all forms of financial assistance available to other majors. Specific information can be obtained from the Financial Aid Office at http://academics .utep.edu/Default.aspx?alias=academics.utep.edu/finaid. Armed Services The United States Armed Services view the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) is an exceptionally valuable source for officers who have an appreciation of nursing's contribution to the defense of the nation. ROTC offers programs whereby nursing students can earn a commission while they complete their nursing curriculum. Scholarships that provide for tuition, books, and supplies are available. Monthly stipends are offered to advanced students. In addition to financial assistance, ROTC offers leadership/management courses which are valuable assets in a nursing career. A six-week summer training program provides valuable experience for students in health care facilities between the academic years. Interested students should contact the Department of Military Science or the Department of Aerospace Studies on campus. Admission and Pre-Nursing Advising Students seeking admission to the University as freshmen or transfers should consult the Undergraduate Admission section in this Catalog. Students transferring from other nursing programs must submit to the School of Nursing Dean, a statement from the dean or department chair of the previous program stating that the student is eligible to return to that program. Students are classified as pre-Nursing majors until they are admitted into the Nursing Program. Applicants to the School of Nursing must be accepted to the University and official transcripts must be evaluated by the University prior to consideration for admission. All University Core and program prerequisite courses must be passed with a C or better. University policy states that courses cannot be repeated in which a student earned a grade of C or better. The minimum cumulative GPA (at UTEP) to apply is 2.0. The minimum prerequisite GPA to apply is 2.5. Historically, the minimum competitive prerequisite GPA is 3.0. The minimum Science GPA to apply is 2.5. Historically, the minimum competitive Science GPA is 3.0. All Science courses must be current and completed within four (4) years prior to eligibility to apply for the Nursing Program. Selections are based on the cumulative GPA, Prerequisite GPA, Science GPA, and Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS) scores. Additional information can be found at https://academics.utep.edu/nursingClinical Requirements Students accepted into the Nursing major and upper-division nursing courses or the Graduate Nursing Program must have in their record proofs of health clearance and other requirements for the practicum component of clinical courses. Note: Failure to comply with these requirements will result in students having holds placed on registration or being dropped from courses. 1. Health Clearance: Includes physical exam, lab work, and immunizations. Up-to-date health clearance must be documented prior to enrolling in any Nursing classes. Health clearance is done by the Student Health Center (SHC) . For ongoing students the physical exam, immunizations, and lab work can be done at SHC at reduced rates; check the fee schedule 915.747.5624. Students who have had their physical exam, lab work and/or immunizations done by a private physician or through their employers can submit copies to the SHC for review and clearance. The physical examination should be comprehensive and must include appropriate age and gender-specific screening tests. The name and address of the health care professional who completed the exam should be printed clearly or typed on whatever form is presented. Physical Exam Immunizations/Tests: Tetanus/Diphtheria (Td)-within 10 years MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) Vaccine (at least one dose since 1980, if born after 1956) Titers documenting immunity to: Hepatitis B Rubella Rubeola (Measles) Varicella If needed, based on titer, the following must be completed with a follow-up titer documenting immunity: Booster MMR Varicella series Urinalysis Tuberculosis Screening: PPD yearly (or biannually as required for clinical clearance). For positive PPD or BCG received in the past, the policy of the Center for Disease Control will be followed, which includes a yearly TB questionnaire, exam by a Health Care Provider, and, chest x-ray every five (5) years, or as indicated. Note: The Student Health Center (SHC) is the only repository for health clearance information. Clearances must be valid through the entire semester for which the student is registering and must be on file 10 to14 days PRIOR to the start of the semester.(See Compliance Web page for deadline dates). Students who are newly admitted and are to register for the first time should take documentation of the health items directly to the Student Health Center . The SHC will create a file for them so that they can have permission to register and pay fees. No other services can be provided until the student has paid appropriate SHC fees at the time of registration. 2. Clinical Clearance: The following items are required to be turned into the Compliance Office in the Student Support Center. Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) certification is required and must be current as indicated by the certifying body. The certification is required and must be current until the end of the semester for which the student is registering. It must be certified by the American Heart Association Healthcare Provider or its recognized equivalent. Students must submit a copy of both sides of the CPR card . If the CPR expires during a semester, students must renew immediately to avoid being dropped from clinical courses. Professional liability insurance must be purchased annually during fall registration. Students beginning in the spring or summer semesters must purchase prorated liability insurance. All upper division students enrolling in Nursing courses will be required to show evidence of professional liability insurance coverage of at least $1,000,000 limit each claim and $3,000,000 limit aggregate. All students are encouraged to maintain an acceptable health insurance policy since students are responsible for their own health care costs. A Student Accident and Sickness Insurance Plan is available upon request through the Dean of Students' Office, 102 West Union. Community-Wide Orientation : All nursing students must complete the on-line City-Wide Orientation once each year. The on-line Community-Wide Orientation is at http://www.epcc.edu/nursing/cwo/O/php . Certificate of completion must be submitted to the Compliance Office in the Student Support Center. 3. Background Check Students accepted to the School of Nursing are required to pass a background check prior to matriculation. This is required by the area agencies in which clinical rotations take place and is also a licensure requirement by the Texas Board of Nurse Examiners. Application forms are available through the College of Health Sciences Student Support Office. 4. Drug Screening Students accepted to the School of Nursing are required to pass a drug screen prior to matriculation. This is required by the area agencies in which clinical rotations take place. Application forms are available through the College of Health Sciences Student Support Office. Academic Progress A Nursing student must meet or exceed the following minimum requirements for each course in the Nursing curriculum in order to pass that course: 1 . Course grade must be equal to or greater than 75.0. The grading scale is 90-100 = A, 80-89 = B, 75-79 = C, 60-74 = D and Below 60=F. 2 . Pass both the didactic and the clinical components of a course. Failure in either component results in a failing grade for the entire course regardless of the specific grades received. 3 . Score at or above the minimum level (as decided by Nursing) on any national/standardized comprehensive exams associated with a course. Rigorous study is required to succeed in the Nursing Program. Multiple hours of preparation are required beyond the classroom periods and clinical experiences. Students must be willing to accept this as a condition of succeeding in the program. Course Repeat Policy Repeating a Nursing course because of failure or withdrawal is not automatic. The student must request permission from Undergraduate Nursing Administration to repeat a course by using the designated form found at https://academics.utep.edu/Portals/297/Repeat%20 course%20form.doc. The decision to give permission to repeat is based on the following: 1 . Space availability 2 . Nursing GPA 3 . Previous failures 4 . Previous withdrawals 5 . Course faculty recommendation (which takes into consideration attendance, following remediation plans within the course, etc.) Progression Students must successfully complete all prerequisite courses to progress through the curriculum sequence. Repeating a course disrupts the normal timeline of progression. Successful completion of a failed course does not guarantee automatic progression into succeeding courses . Students who vary from the normal timeline are placed in subsequent courses on a space-available basis each semester. Successful passing of the national standardized exams (given in each of the major clinical courses) at or above a level designated by the School of Nursing, is also linked with progression in the clinical courses. Course Withdrawal and Failure In accordance with University policy, a Nursing course can be attempted only twice. A withdrawal from a course that results in a W counts as an attempt. Students are not encouraged to withdraw from Nursing courses, as this impedes progress in the completion of the degree plan, but if a student chooses to withdraw from a course, this should be in writing (as described in the Student Handbook ). A School of Nursing student can repeat or withdraw from a nursing course only once. Recommendation of the faculty, the student's written request, space availability and approval by the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Education are needed for the student to repeat courses. Failure to successfully complete a Nursing course in two attempts results in dismissal from the School of Nursing. In addition to the two-attempt limit, any two failing grades in the Nursing curriculum and/or a faculty recommendation to not allow a student to repeat a course results in dismissal from the School of Nursing. Safe and Effective Nursing Practice Policy All nursing students must perform within the limits of safe practice. A faculty member can drop a student from a course with an F (regardless of grades received) if the student's nursing practice is deemed unsafe as defined in the Safe Practice Policy of the School of Nursing, of which a copy is posted on the Official Bulletin Board in the School of Nursing. Retention/Conferences Retention in the major is taken seriously. A retention action plan (RAP) is in place in the SON. Faculty and/or students can initiate the process. A retention action plan will help determine areas of difficulty and recommendations for the student to apply for improved potential success. Students are advised to discuss academic progress and/or situations first with the immediate faculty member, then with the faculty member with overall responsibility for theStudents are advised to discuss academic progress and/or situations first with the immediate faculty member, then with the faculty member with overall responsibility for the specific course (the course manager). Faculty members are available to confer with students outside of class according to posted office hours. The Director of the School of Nursing and the Undergraduate Program Director are prepared to confer with students as needed. Student Support staff are also available for referrals to appropriate UTEP student services. Student Grievances Related to grades and/or other student issues: A student can challenge his or her grade as determined by a member of the faculty of the University during or within one year after the end of any credit course or any qualifying or comprehensive examination, for which the student has been enrolled. A challenge to a grade can be pursued only on the basis of: malice, bias, arbitrary or capricious grade determination, or impermissible discrimination. In no event shall a challenge be pursued only on the basis of the standards employed in setting grades, so long as those standards are employed impartially. Grievances for other course-related issues can also be pursued. The student must attempt to resolve grievances concerning grades through the following steps: Submit a written account of the event/situation that describes the actions taken or omitted and provide substantiating data that describes the basis for the grievance to the following persons: First, the faculty member directly involved; Second, the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs; and Third, the Dean of the School of Nursing. Having failed to resolve the matter after consultation with the above persons, the student can consult with and/or file a challenge with the Chairperson of the Student Welfare and Grievance Committee. Contact the Dean of Students for specific information. Graduation Requirements 1 . To be eligible for graduation, a student must have attained a minimum 2.0 Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) in the baccalaureate degree plan and a minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.0 in the Nursing Major. 2 . A candidate must successfully complete the prescribed curriculum and must meet all other requirements of the University and the School of Nursing. Testing Program To assist faculty with academic advisement of students, and to provide a means of ongoing evaluation of the School of Nursing curriculum, Nursing students are required to participate in a testing and evaluation program in addition to course examinations. In most of the clinical courses, students are required to pass these exams at or above the national average in order to progress to the next clinical course. In the final semester, students are required to achieve on the Comprehensive Predictor Exam offered by Assessment Technologies Institute (ATI) at or above a score predictive at 90% or better that success on the NCLEX will be achieved on the first attempt. This is a course requirement in NURS 4612. (See NURS 4612 syllabus for further details). Licensure as a Professional Nurse Graduates seeking licensure must successfully complete the National Council of State Boards of Nursing-Registered Nurse Examination (NCLEX-RN) and the Texas Nursing Jurisprudence Exam which are administered by the Board of Nurse Examiners (BON) for the State of Texas. BSN graduates must complete the BSN licensure application, which includes criminal background check information. The SON Director will verify the eligibility status of applicants. All students are required to read and sign the Licensure Eligibility Notification Form prior to being admitted into the clinical courses. (This is usually completed during the 4th fourth semester). Students who have a reason to believe that they can be ineligible for licensure can petition the Board of Nurse Examiners for a Declaratory Order as to eligibility. The Declaratory Order Request Form can be downloaded from the Board of Nursing Web site. Students can review current rules and regulations at: www.bne.state.tx.us.

As an individualized program of study, the BMS emphasizes a wide-ranging learning experience and a more expanded perspective than that provided by traditional undergraduate majors. Students focus on an interdisciplinary theme, period, set of problems, specialization, or perception not currently available through established majors and minors. The BMS degree encourages students to select courses from the entire University course inventory, tailoring their study to their own personal and professional interests and needs. The degree provides students a fundamental knowledge of skills necessary to competently express themselves, think creatively, solve problems, and understand the nature and function of people and the environment. The multidisciplinary degree plans and areas of concentration developed by students and their advisors are reviewed by a program review committee composed of academic faculty and a University College representative. Admissions Requirements New, transfer, and returning students can declare their intention to work toward a BMS degree if they meet UTEP's admission requirements. All students admitted into the BMS program are required to meet each semester with a BMS advisor to select their concentrations and electives. Bachelor of Multidisciplinary Studies Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Multidisciplinary Studies degree requires a minimum of 120 semester hours, including at least 45 hours at the advanced or upper-division (junior and senior) level. In addition to completing the 42 semester hour University Core Curriculum, each student defines, in consultation with a BMS advisor, three areas of concentration totaling 45 semester hours, including a minimum of 27 hours of advanced work. Each area of concentration is composed of 15 hours, nine (9) hours of which must be advanced. The goal of the concentration is to give students an interdisciplinary foundation that satisfies individual educational and professional goals while maintaining academic rigor and integrity. Thirty- three hours of electives, 18 of which must be advanced, bring the degree total to a minimum 120 semester hours. In addition to completing organized courses, we recommend that students complete a capstone experience that integrates the multidisciplinary coursework: a course with a service-learning component, a professional internship experience related to their concentration, or an independent research project. This involvement combines academic classroom-based activities with practical and/or research experience.
