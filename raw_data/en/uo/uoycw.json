If exposure is via the parenteral route, antibiotics may be helpful in preventing secondary bacterial infection. Antibiotics, Other Class Summary With regard to ricin toxicity, the only possible indication for antibiotics is for the parenteral mechanism of exposure. Direct the choice of antibiotic to cover skin flora. Cefazolin Cefazolin Cefazolin is a first-generation semisynthetic cephalosporin that arrests cell wall synthesis, inhibiting bacterial growth. Alpha/Beta Adrenergic Agonists Class Summary Before or simultaneously with the use of vasopressors, perform adequate volume resuscitation of patients with isotonic fluids and packed red blood cells; do not use these agents in place of volume resuscitation. The choice of agent is usually determined by physician preference. There is no criterion standard vasopressor for treatment of hypotension caused by ricin toxicity. Dopamine Dopamine Dopamine is probably the best-known and most widely used pressor agent. A standard mixture of 200 mg in 250 mL produces a concentration of 800 \u00b5g/mL; administer intravenously (IV). can be used as a first-line agent. It can be given with dopamine. A standard mixture of 4 mg in 250 mL produces a concentration of 16 \u00b5g/mL; administer IV. Vaccine, Inactivated (Bacterial) Class Summary Toxoids are used to induce active immunity. Tetanus status should be updated if unknown. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoid (Tenivac) Diphtheria and tetanus toxoid (Tenivac) Diphtheria and tetanus toxoid is used to induce active immunity against tetanus in selected patients. Antidotes, Other Class Summary Antidotes are used to inhibit or reduce absorption of the toxin. Activated charcoal (CharcoCaps, EZ-Char, Actidose Aqua) Activated charcoal (CharcoCaps, EZ-Char, Actidose Aqua) Activated charcoal is employed as a component of emergency treatment in poisoning caused by drugs and chemicals. The network of pores present in activated charcoal adsorbs 100-1000 mg of drug per gram of charcoal. Charcoal does not dissolve in water. For maximum effect, it should be administered within 30 minutes after the ingestion of the poison. Tables What would you like to print? "}
