It blends centuries-old holistic medicine with modern medical science. Naturopathy covers all aspects of family health and provides effective treatments for many acute and chronic conditions. Naturopaths use natural remedies such as herbs, nutrition and foods rather than surgery or synthetic drugs, as well as many additional treatment modalities, with practitioners emphasizing an integrative approach to patient care. Naturopathic Medicine concentrates on whole-patient wellness - the medicine is tailored to the patient and emphasizes prevention and self-care. Naturopathic Medicine seeks to find the underlying cause of the patient's condition rather than focusing solely on symptomatic treatment. As a primary care provider and health professional, Naturopathic Physicians collaborate as needed with other medical professionals by providing complementary therapies or referring patients when appropriate. In the US, Naturopathic Medicine has been a distinct healthcare profession for over 100 years. Over the last three decades, more people than ever are seeking and benefiting from Naturopathic Medical Care, and the number of Naturopathic Doctors is growing at a record rate to accommodate this increased demand.
