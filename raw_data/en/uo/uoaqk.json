Is it for you? Acupuncture has been part of the medical mainstream in countries such as China and Japan for centuries. It is also one of the most widely utilized forms of alternative therapy in the Canada and the US. Third-party insurance reimbursement and managed care coverage for acupuncture are increasing. Acupuncture needles are most often inserted at specific locations on the skin called acupuncture points. These points are located on specific lines outlined by tradition, referred to as meridians or channels. According to Chinese medical theory, there are 14 major meridians that form an invisible network connecting the body surface with the internal organs. Meridians are to conduct Qi, the energy or vital force of the body. Burrard Physiotherapy one of the leading clinics in Vancouver and is home to 12 highly skilled physiotherapists, 2 massage therapists, kinesiologists, yoga instructor, pilates instructor and exercise therapists. Chronic pain or illness is said to result from imbalances or blockages in the flow of Qi through the meridians. Acupuncture is traditionally thought to remove such blockages, restore the normal circulation of Qi, and improve overall health by promoting the balance of energy in the system. Our team of certified Vancouver acupuncture practitioners continually research the latest data on acupuncture treatments. And we've found recent scientific evidence that acupuncture is effective in the relief of nausea and vomiting, morning sickness during pregnancy, tendonitis, osteoarthritis, headache and neck and back pain among others. At Burrard Physiotherapy, we offer a full range of acupuncture treatments in our Vancouver facility. The Physiotherapists at Burrard Physiotherapy with Acupuncture certification are Kevin Chen, Siobhan McEnnis, and Thomas Zhou. After a couple of failed visits to other clinics, Linda Warren gave me the confidence the physiotherapy does exist and is useful. Her genuine interest in my condition (bike accident), professional attitude and all the information she provided helped me understand what's wrong and how it will get better. Her therapy is also helping relieve the pain and the worry associated with it. I feel like she could be my regular physiotherapist going forward. Great location, and the hours are pretty good. Just minutes away from my boyfriends west end condo so I usually walk over. This clinic has helped me a lot. I used to go for massage therapy when I had a muscle injury (Erika is great) and then for another injury I tried IMS. I'm legit terrified of needles but a friend told me to try it, and it did wonders. Farhana (I hope I spelled that right!) is amazing, a few sessions fixed me right up, much less painful than massaging the muscles. I am very grateful to the staff - they've kept me on my feet (literally). I went for a bike fitting with Thomas, a couple of months ago. He was friendly, knowledgeable and provided a full report after the fitting. He took the time to listen and understand my history and approached the fitting in a thorough and careful way. Cheers Thomas I've been going to Burrard Physiotherapy for almost a month after a triceps tear lead to arm, shoulder, and neck pain, and have been working with Kevin Chen. He's incredibly knowledgeable, kind, and receptive, and the improvement with my pain and discomfort is noticeable. The environment is clean and comforting, and the receptionists always greet you in a warm way. Treatment always starts on time too. Burrard Physiotherapy is an amalgamation of two outstanding physiotherapy clinics in downtown Vancouver. Burrard Physiotherapy Associates was established in 1982 as was Burrard Physiotherapy Clinic each of these businesses operated out of separate locations one block apart. It wasn't until local Kerry Maxwell purchased both clinics in 2004 and 2005 that they merged to become Burrard Physiotherapy. The clinic is driven to provide an outstanding level of care and recovery for patients. Each of the therapists at Burrard Physiotherapy have multiple levels of training and education over and above their original degrees. In addition, everyone leads active lifestyles. This is essential to understanding the impact that an injury can have on your lifestyle. We believe physiotherapy carried out by a qualified team is the path to freedom of movement and mobility & we believe freedom of movement is essential to quality of life. Our reception area boasts a coffee and tea service and comfortable seating in a cozy setting filled with local art. Any of our three receptionists will be happy to settle you in to your treatment routine while you are here with us. "}
