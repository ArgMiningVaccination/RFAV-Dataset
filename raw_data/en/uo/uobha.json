Background: COVID-19 progresses to a chronic state, termed Long COVID, in about 30% of cases with estimates as high as 40% for prolonged illness. Symptoms are diverse and range over several body systems, including unrelenting fatigue, persistent malaise, chronic pain, and mood changes. Early clinical reports suggest acupuncture can effectively address both symptoms and the underlying causes of Long COVID. Evidence: Historically, acupuncture is well defined in Traditional Chinese Medicine writings to treat influenza-like febrile illnesses. Contemporary scientific literature and case studies support the value of acupuncture for symptoms associated with acute and chronic respiratory viral infections, such as influenza, including SARS and COVID-19. Recent reports provide early evidence of acupuncture's effectiveness in managing Long COVID symptoms and may also have disease-modifying benefits. Conclusion: Acupuncture is a viable adjunctive health care modality as part of a multidisciplinary approach for symptom control and disease management to improve quality of life in Long COVID patients. Since acupuncture may favorably modify the length and outcome of this condition, the model of acupuncture presented in this article warrants broader use in the integrative clinical setting and for further Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.
