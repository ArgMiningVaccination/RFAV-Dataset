The line's updated Crystal Clean+ health and safety protocols will continue to require all guests and crew to be fully inoculated with a COVID-19 vaccine (with both doses, if recommended by manufacturer) at least 14-days prior to their embarkation date. Guests will need to provide documented proof of vaccination at the time of check-in before boarding the ship. The vaccination requirement allows guests the freedom to explore ashore independently and facilitates hassle-free travel across multi-country itineraries. \"Protecting the health and safety of our guests and crew is paramount to everything we do and extending our vaccination requirements through 2022 is the next important step to continue to safeguard the health and wellness of our Crystal Family,\" said Jack Anderson, president of Crystal, in a press statement. \"Our guests have overwhelmingly told us that vaccinations are critical for them to feel comfortable traveling and announcing this extension now will give them the information and reassurance they require as they look to plan future voyages with us.\" [Crystal](https://recommend.com/?s=crystal) continues its proactive response to COVID-19 with protocols based on the latest data and recommendations by health experts. The vaccine requirement augments the company's comprehensive Crystal Clean+ measures, including COVID-19 tests at embarkation for both guests and crew, temperature checks when returning from ashore, a mask policy, social distancing guidelines, enhanced cleaning and disinfection measures and more. Additionally, Crystal River Cruises' crew are also currently wearing masks in all public areas to provide yet another layer of guest protection. \"The health and safety of our guests and crew is paramount to everything we do at Crystal River Cruises, and as such, we will require full vaccination through 2022 so that our guests can continue to explore the world in great comfort and safety,\" said Walter Littlejohn, Crystal River Cruises' senior vice president and managing director, in a press statement. \"After months of planning and preparation we welcomed guests back on board in late August and the feedback has been wonderful. Extending the vaccination requirement provides our guests with the health and safety information and assurances they need to plan future travels.\" Children 11 and under who are not currently eligible for vaccination must be pre-approved after initial waitlist, are subject to capacity control, and must provide proof of valid travel insurance. Guests traveling with unvaccinated children will be subject to unvaccinated protocols when with their children. Once vaccines are approved for age-eligible children, Crystal will require they be fully vaccinated. Additionally, Crystal's Ocean, River and Expedition ships feature 100 percent fresh, non-recirculated air in every single guest suite, stateroom and social space.
