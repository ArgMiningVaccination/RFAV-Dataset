Features associated to the 3D cell mod el are increased expression of matrix proteins and miRNA as well as stromal markers such as PPP1R1B and SNED1. This is supporting the concept of cell adhesion mediated drug resistance. Erlotinib prolongs survival in blocking gemcitabine si gnals http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23378339 Journal : Cancer Research Institution(s) : University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan and others Corresponding author(s) : Hideaki Ijichi Major finding : The authors found that gemcitabine induced MAPK signaling, which was dramatically inhibited by erlotinib even in the Kras -activated pancreatic cancer cells in the mouse model. Mechanistic investigations suggested that gemcitabine induces EGFR ligand expres sion and ERBB2 activation by increasing heterodimer formation with EGFR, thereby maintaining high levels of ERBB2 protein in PDAC cells. Overall, these findings suggest a significant role of ERBB in PDAC treatment. Heparin -binding epidermal growth factor -like growth factor eliminates constraints on activated Kras http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23376846 Journal : Oncogene Institution(s) : Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN Corresponding author(s) : Anna Means Major finding : The authors demonstrate that two oncogenic events, mutation of Kras and production of the growth factor heparin -binding epidermal growth factor -like growth factor (HB-EGF), are sufficient for rapid and compl ete neoplastic transformation of the exocrine pancreas. These findings establish the importance of oncogenic synergy in cancer initiation and promotion, and establ ish a molecular link between inflammation and the earliest stages of tumor induction. Inhibition of growth of Neoplasia Institution(s) : University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA and others Corresponding author(s) : Todd Bauer Major finding : These data indicate that inhibition of the EGFR family receptor signaling may contribute to the effectiveness of MEK1/2 inhibition o f tumor growth possibly through the inhibition of feedback activation of receptor tyrosine kinases in response to inhibition of the RAS-RAF-MEK -ERK pathway. These studies provide a rationale for assessing the co -inhibition of these pathways in the treatmen t of pancreatic cancer patients.

The implication is that a combination of approaches that suppress both A kt phosphorylation and mTOR could be effective in targeting pancreatic cancers with defective TGF-b signaling. Different patterns of Akt, ERK feedback activation response to rapamycin, mTOR inhibitor, m etformin http://ww w.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23437362 Journal : PLoS One Institution(s) : University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA Corresponding author(s) : Enrique Rozengurt Major finding : The effects of metformin on Akt and ERK activation are strikingly dif ferent from allosteric or active -site mTOR inhibitors ductal adenocarcinoma cells, though all these agents potently inhibited the mTORC1/S6K axis.
