Comprehensive Assessment and Treatment Plan After your free consultation we set up your intake appointment. Your intake appointment is primarily about gathering a comprehensive health history. In most cases, you'll also receive your first acupuncture treatment. At your first follow-up appointment \u2014 typically several days to 1wk later\u2014 we present our recommended treatment plan based on our findings from your intake. The plan will provide you with an estimated timeline for care and the specific steps we recommend to get you from where you are to where you say you want to be. It will include some combination of acupuncture visits, dietary and lifestyle adjustments, key supplements, individualized herbal medicines, and mind-body techniques to address the root cause of your specific issue. 3. Active Treatment for Symptom Resolution During the treatment phase, we're using regular acupuncture visits, herbal medicine, diet and lifestyle changes, key supplements, etc to build momentum toward your health goals and the lasting, stable change you seek. Frequency of office visits and duration of this portion of care varies depending on the severity and chronicity of your issue. We may begin with two visits per week for a couple of weeks to gain momentum, but most patients start with (or quickly transition to) once-weekly office visits. From there, we track symptoms to make sure your treatment plan is yielding the expected results in the expected time frame, and modify your plan, accordingly. 4. Stable Improvement and Transitional Care Once we see stable improvements, we begin to reduce the frequency of office visits. Your personal commitment to your plan of care outside of the clinic (i.e. taking your herbs and supplements regularly and embracing recommended dietary and lifestyle changes) is likely to expedite this transition. We'll reduce treatments incrementally until you no longer need regular visits. That said, most of our patients choose to continue with ongoing maintenance care because acupuncture makes them feel so good; many have standing monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly appointments. And of course we're always here if you need a \"tune-up\" or want to address other health concerns. 5. Taking Care Of Your Friends and Loved Ones We pride ourselves on the fact that 80% of our new patients are referred to us by other patients or people in the community who have witnessed their friends and loved ones receive life-changing benefits from our work. We look forward first to helping YOU, and then to helping your friends, family, and loved ones on THEIR journey to a more joyful, energetic, purposeful life. "}
