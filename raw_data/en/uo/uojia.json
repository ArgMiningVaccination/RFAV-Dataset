Eight versions of diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID-19 with Chinese characteristics were formulated by integrating TCM and Western medicine. A number of TCM such as \"three medicines and three formulas\" were successfully developed and proven effective in clinical practice. China has been sharing its experience of applying TCM in COVID-19 prevention and control without reservation. China is willing to work with all countries to continue to deepen cooperation in TCM basic theories, clinical efficacy and international standard, and to enable traditional and contemporary medicine to interact and draw upon each other's strength, so as to better serve the health and welfare of all humanity. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa said in his speech that the forum fully demonstrated China's active role in the global cause of public health. Zimbabwe and China have signed a memorandum of understanding on traditional medicine cooperation. Zimbabwe will continue to uphold the spirit of multilateralism and firmly carry out international cooperation, contributing to the building of a global community of health for all. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna said in her speech that since the establishment of the Ukraine-China strategic partnership, the two countries have witnessed sound cooperation in various areas including medicine. She expressed her gratitude for China's humanitarian assistance when Ukraine was caught in the pandemic, and said her country is willing to maintain fruitful cooperation with China and other participating countries. Participants highly commended the unique role of TCM in treating COVID-19 cases, which has laid a foundation for the application of traditional medicine in cooperative pandemic response. The Initiative on Supporting the Application of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Global Fight Against COVID-19 was adopted at the meeting. All parties agreed to continue to uphold multilateralism to jointly deal with the pandemic, take stock of and promote wider adoption of good practice, and continue to use traditional medicine to protect people's health, and enhance international cooperation for the development of traditional medicine.
