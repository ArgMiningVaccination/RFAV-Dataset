How much does sweating via sauna or exercise get rid of lead and mercury? We are constantly exposed to toxins\u2014in the air, in the water, in the soil, and in our food. In addition to stopping [smoking](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/smoking) and minimizing foods high on the food chain, how else can we protect ourselves against pollutants? Our body naturally has detoxifying enzymes in our liver and lining our airways. One way we can boost their activity is by increasing our intake of [cruciferous vegetables](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/cruciferous-vegetables/), known as potent inducers of our detoxifying enzymes. Increasing our consumption of [fiber](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fiber), which is only found in plants, is also recommended as fiber binds to toxins, such as [lead](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/lead) and [mercury](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/mercury), and flushes them away. Phytates, natural compounds found in the seeds of plants\u2014in other words, in all whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds\u2014have been shown to detoxify excess iron in the body, which otherwise can generate a particularly harmful kind of free radical. While we may all benefit from decreasing our exposure to toxins and increasing the effectiveness of our body's natural detoxifying enzymes, this may be particularly important for women as they may pass their accumulated pollutants onto their children through the placenta or breast. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most women's bodies in the United States are contaminated with heavy metals, toxic solvents, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, fire retardants, chemicals from plastics, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and banned pesticides. [Pregnant women](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pregnancy) were found to harbor, on average, up to 50 different chemicals, and researchers found detectable DDT residues in 95 percent of umbilical cord samples from women who had recently given birth\u2014and this is now decades after the pesticide was banned. Which foods seem to contribute the most heavy metals and other pollutants? The number-one identified source of arsenic was poultry among preschoolers and, for their parents, tuna. The top source for lead? Dairy. For mercury? Seafood. The information on this page has been compiled from Dr. Greger's research.

How much does sweating via sauna or exercise get rid of lead and mercury? There is a food that offers the best of both worlds\u2014significantly improving our ability to detox carcinogens like diesel fumes and decreasing inflammation in our airways\u2014all while improving our respiratory defenses against infections. Which foods are best at removing carcinogenic bile acids from the body: asparagus, beets, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, collards, eggplant, green beans, kale, mustard greens, okra, or peppers? And do they work better raw or cooked? Neurotoxins in chicken, such as the beta-carboline alkaloid harman, may explain the link between meat consumption and hand tremor, the most common movement disorder. How many months does it take to clear 99% of the mercury and other industrial toxins from one's body, and what role might our fat stores play in holding on to fat-soluble pollutants? Blueberry consumption may double the population of our cancer-fighting immune cells, and the spices cardamom and black pepper may boost their activity. Human beings lost the ability to detoxify uric acid millions of years ago. What implications does this have for our health today? Plant-based diets may help rheumatoid arthritis by decreasing exposure to an inflammatory compound found in animal products. For decades, studies on Gerson therapy for cancer have questioned its safety and efficacy. But, what does the latest head-to-head trial of a Gerson-style regime, versus chemotherapy, show in terms of survival and quality of life for pancreatic cancer ? Gerson Therapy is a largely diet-based alternative treatment for cancer. What have 65 years of medical research concluded about its efficacy and safety? The reason birth order is a predictor of pollutant levels in the bodies of children is that women can pass along as much as half of their PCB burden to their fetus during pregnancy. Based on the half-life of industrial pollutants children may be exposed to in the womb or at the breast, how many years does it take for them to detoxify their bodies (assuming they're brought up on a healthy diet)? Chlorophyll, the most ubiquitous plant pigment in the world, may protect our DNA against mutation by intercepting carcinogens. The trillions of good bacteria in our gut can be thought of as an additional organ\u2014metabolizing, detoxifying, and activating many crucial components of our diet. The formation of lignans from phytonutrient precursors found predominantly in flax seeds is one such example. The most powerful natural inducer of our liver's detoxifying enzyme system is sulforaphane, a phytonutrient produced by broccoli. Eating broccoli appears to make DNA more resistant to damage. The insecticide and fungicide compound found naturally in avocados (persin) may damage the DNA of normal cells, as well as cancer cells. "}
