Here to design and test the in vivo efcacy of a mucoadhesive nasal formulation of this adjuvant. To determine the physical proper- ties of the formulation, the effect of addition of each individual component was characterised by gel elec-trophoresis and (egg PC) DOPE (40:50:10 mol:mol:mol) were prepared by the thin-lm extrusion method. The liposomes and TriAdj were combined by simple mixing. The formed complex (L-TriAdj) was characterized by dynamic light scattering, zeta potential, and mucin interactions. We found that IDR-1002 peptide, polyphosphazene and RAW267.4 cells cationic liposomes were prepared at several molar ratios to determine optimal size, stability and desired positive charge. Transmission electron microscopy showed rearrange-ment of lipid structures on binding of liposomes to TriAdj and to mucin. Stable particles (<200 nm over 24 h) showed mucin binding of DDAB/DOPE + TriAdj was greater than DDAB/EPC/DOPE + TriAdj. To verify in vivo efcacy, mice were administered the DDAB/DOPE + TriAdj complex intranasally with ovalbuminas the antigen, and the immunogenic response was measured by ELISpot assays Mice administered adjuvant showed a signicantly greater immune response with L-TriAdj than TriAdj alone, with a dose-response proportionate to the triple adju-vant content, and an overall balanced Th1/Th2 immune response representing both systemic and muco-sal immunity. /C2112019 Published by Elsevier Ltd. 1. Introduction Adjuvants are crucial components of vaccines that improve immunogenicity, direct the response to facilitate long-term protec-tion, enhance the efcacy of vaccines in newborns, elderly or immunocompromised persons, and reduce the amount of antigen or the number of doses required to elicit effective immunity. Recently, a combination adjuvant platform has been developed comprised of three components (a triple adjuvant - ''TriAdj\"),namely (1) poly(I:C) (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, PCEP (''polyphosphazene\"), a cationic polymer adjuvant. This triple adju-vant forms a stable complex and has been demonstrated to be highly effective in a wide range of animal and human vaccine can- didates [5]. The ratio of components that produces an immune response following intramuscular or subcutaneous administration has been optimized through extensive in vivo testing, demonstrat- ing that TriAdj administered with various vaccine antigens induces effective long-term humoral and cellular immunity. This adjuvant offers an excellent opportunity for use in present and future gener- ations of vaccines against multiple infectious agents. However, the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.01.058 0264-410X/ /C2112019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.Corresponding author at: College of Pharmacy and Nutrition, 107 Wiggins Rd., Health Sciences 3D01-17, University of journal homepage: www.else vier.com/locate/vaccine efcacy by the nasal and other mucosal routes to maximize muco- sal immunity still requires enhancement. The purpose of the pre- sent study was to devise and evaluate a mucoadhesive lipidic carrier for this triple adjuvant combination in order to improve its efcacy as nasal vaccine adjuvant. The combination adjuvant TriAdj proved highly effective in a number of species and for a number of diseases in prior work. For example, an earlier onset of immunity, higher humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were found in mice and pigs after immunization with Bordetella pertussis antigen pertussis toxoid (PTd), lamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (prn) [6,7] adjuvant also proved highly effective with an RSV vaccine consisting of the RSV F protein formulated with the combi- nation adjuvant and tested in mice, cotton rats and lambs [5,8,9] . This includes intranasal administration of the vaccine. Further-more, both experimental vaccines for pertussis and RSV were highly effective in the presence of maternal antibodies [6,10] . The adjuvant also enhanced both humoral and cell-mediated immunity to the chlamydia outer membrane protein in mice, koa- las and sheep [11-13] . Other examples include antigens from influenza, parainfluenza, bovine virus diarrhea virus, to name a few. These were highlighted in a review by Garg et al. [14]. It is now widely recognized that especially for respiratory dis- eases, the induction of both local and systemic immunity can sub- stantially improve the level of protection [15-17] . The advantage of intranasal administration lies in the ability to induce both local and systemic immunity, in addition to its ease of administration. Indeed, vaccines are increasingly being administered mucosally, both in humans and in animals. An intranasally administered vac- cine can, for example, be delivered in a carrier that is adherent to the nasal mucous and may penetrate to the mucosa itself. The car- rier may provide a depot effect or have its own immunostimula- tory effects as an adjuvant. Various positively-charged mucoadhesive particulate carriers are currently under investiga- tion to generate mucosal immunity with nasally administered vac- cines such as those used for hepatitis B or HIV [18-23] . The mucoadhesive lipidic carrier described in the present study was hypothesized to enhance the adjuvant effect due to the inclusion of cationic lipid. This nasal formulation was thus a positively charged lipid nanocarrier comprised of cationic lipids and phos- pholipids at a dened ratio relative to TriAdj. The particle size and charge of the lipidic carrier described here were by design ideal for attracting dendritic cells in the mucosal tissues [24-26] . Secondary objectives of this study were to determine if the compo- sition of the carrier and the dose of the triple adjuvant, TriAdj, would influence its efcacy. The tolerability in macrophages was assessed and its ability to activate an immune response in mice fol- lowing nasal administration with ovalbumin antigen wasdetermined. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials and chemicals Poly(I:C) double-stranded RNA adjuvant was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Canada). Polydi(p-oxyphenylpropionate) phosp- hazene, also known as PCEP (''polyphosphazene\"), sodium salt (average molecular weight /C241800/C210 3) was synthesized and puried to 100% by Idaho National Laboratory (INL, Idaho Falls, ID USA). The polyphosphazene tested endotoxin free. IDR-1002 cationic peptide n-Arg-Trp-Leu-Ile-Val-Trp-Arg-Ile-Arg-Lyz-NH 2and provided in powder form as the trifluoroacetate salt at 94.1% purity and used as provided. Rhodamine labeled poly(I:C) was purchased fromInvivoGen (San Diego, USA), agarose was purchased from Invitro- gen, gel loading dye 6x from New England Biolabs Inc. (Ipswich, MA, USA), and sterile syringe lters dioleoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Egg (St. Lipids 1,2-dioleoyl- sn- from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, USA) and cholesterol was from J.T Baker. Cell line RAW 264.7 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection Promega (USA). Tissue culture medium Dulbecco's modied Eagle'- s medium (DMEM high glucose, GE Health Care, Canada) and 1%penicillin-streptomycin were from Gibco, Canada. General chemi- Sigma-Aldrich Canada. Porcine gastric mucin (Type II) and ovalbumin (Ova) from chicken egg white were pur- chased from Sigma Aldrich Canada. 2.2. Preparation of TriAdj TriAdj was prepared mixing 150 mg of Poly(I:C), 300 mg of IDR- 1002 peptide and 150 mg polyphosphazene in 1:2:1 (w/w/w) ratio in a volume of 1 mL [5]. diluent was sterile-ltered (0.2 mm) dextrose (5% (w/v) (D5W) and the preparation was carried out on ice and stored at 4 /C176C for use within 3 days [8]. The formation of a nondissociable complex was conrmed by agarose gel quenching that occurs upon interac- tion of the components (See Supplementary Data ). 2.3. Preparation of liposomes Pre-formed liposomes were used for preparing a lipidic com- plex with TriAdj, in order to readily control the proportions of lipid components as well as the homogeneity of the mixture of lipids while in the aqueous environment required for TriAdj. The lipo- somes were prepared by the thin-lm extrusion method. Lipids at the appropriate molar ratios DDAB/DOPE 75:25, DOPE 50/50, DDAB/Egg (90/10) were dissolved in chloroform. The preparation was dried under a stream of ltered air to form a thin lm in a glass tube; the thin lm was dried under vacuum in a lyophilizer 6 h to remove the organic solvent. The dried lipid lms were rehydrated using D5W. After hydration of the lipid lms, the lipid suspensions were subjected to freeze-thaw 10 times resulting in formation ofmultilamellar vesicles (MLVs). The resulting preparation was extruded /C176C through polycarbonate lters (0.1mm (Lipex Extruder), forming liposomes of approximately 100 nm. The mean diameter of the liposomes was determined by dynamic light scattering and zeta potential was measured in the D5W diluent, both at 23 /C176C (Malvern, described below. 2.4. Phosphorous assay modied version of the Fiske and Subbarow phosphorus assay was [27]. Phos- phorus standard mM solution, SigmaAldrich Canada) was ali- quoted in triplicate into six separate standards tubes: (0ml) and 0.228 E.K. Wasan et al. / Vaccine 37 (2019) 1503-1515(350 ml). Separately, samples representing approximately 0.1mmoles phosphorus were placed into the bottoms of each sam- ple tube in triplicate. To all tubes 450 ml of 8.9 N H 2SO4(Mallinck- rodt) were added followed by heating in an aluminum block in a chemical fume hood at 200-215 /C176C for 25 min, then allowed to cool 5 min before adding 150 mlH2O2(Fisher). All tubes were heated for an additional 30 min to a colorless state, then cooled to ambient temperature. Then 3.9 mL deionized water followed by 500 mlo f ammonium molybdate(VI) tetrahydrate solution (2.5% w/v) were added to all tubes with vortexing. Next, 500 ml ascorbic acid solu- tion (10% w/v) were added to all tubes, which were vortex-mixed thoroughly. Tubes were covered with a glass marble to prevent evaporation and to avoid pressure buildup during heating at 100/C176C for 7 min. After cooling the tubes to ambient temperature, a spectrophotometer was used to measure absorbance at 820 nm.Phosphorus in the samples was quantied by comparison to the standard curve prepared by linear regression analysis of the absor- bance values ( = 820 nm) of the standard samples (linear range of 0-0.23 mmoles/mL (r 2> 0.99). 2.5. Preparation of TriAdj formulations for nasal administration2.5.1. Preparation of L-TriAdj The phosphorus (P) concentration was determined as described above. The molar ratio of P from the liposomes to P from TriAdj was set as 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 to span a range of molar charge ratios (negative to positive), in order to determine empirically the composition necessary to achieve a cationic supramolecular assem- bly, i.e. positively charged lipidic nanoparticles. The goal was to establish component ratios that would facilitate favorable polyva- lent polymer interactions between the cationic liposomes and the anionic TriAdj resulting in condensation into discrete complexes [28] rather than gross aggregation. The total P content was deter- mined for the various liposome preparations and for TriAdj. This information was used to devise molar ratios required to approxi- mate the desired charge ratios of lipidic complex of liposomes plus TriAdj (L-TriAdj). The molar ratio of P from the liposomes to P from TriAdj was set as 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 (ratios 1, 2, 3, 4). Liposomes and TriAdj were separately diluted in D5W and subsequently, con- sistent volume ratios of the two components were mixed to achieve different P molar ratios. The combination of lipids and TriAdj to form L-TriAdj was performed by vortex mixing cationic liposomes with TriAdj for 2 min followed by a 30 min incubation at ambient temperature. 2.5.2. Preparation of CaCl 2microparticle vaccine for in vivo studies As a point of comparison, the triple adjuvant was prepared as microparticles as previously described by Garlapati et al. withoutfurther physical also known as PCEP (''polyphosphazene\") was obtained by custom synthesis at Idaho National Laboratory. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] [30] (99% purity) was purchased from Sigma 1002 (VQRWLIVWRIRK) [29] was obtained from Genscript. Microparticles were prepared by a coacervation method, with poly(I:C) rst mixed with IDR-1002 peptide at 37 /C176C for 30 min, and the PCEP and Ova antigen separately combined. The poly(I:C)- peptide mixture was then combined with the polyphosphazene and antigen mixture, followed by dropwise addition of 6.2%NaCl at a ratio of 1.95 mL of NaCl to 1 mL of 0.2% PCEP. The weight ratio of poly(I:C), IDR-1002 peptide and PECP was 10:20:10 mg. After 20 min at RT, 8% CaCl 2solution was added to achieve a 1:200 dilu- tion followed by 10 min incubation at RT on a rocker. To collect the microparticles, the suspension was centrifuged at 1390 gfor 10 phosphate- buffered saline. The pooled supernatants from these nal steps havebeen used to estimate Ova antigen lost during formation of the microparticles. After ltering through a 0.2 lm low protein binding syringe lters, typical encapsulation efciency is approximately 70%. 2.6. Particle size and zeta potential analysis The average particle size (nm) and polydispersity index (PDI) of liposomes and TriAdj and L-TriAdj were determined by dynamic light scattering. Surface charge was estimated by zeta potential measurements (Malvern, Nano ZS) in D5W at 23 /C176C. Samples were measured in triplicate. Particle size and features were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine Imaging Centre (See Supplementary Data ). SEM was performed on dried samples mounted on copper 200 mesh grids and sputter-coated with 5 nm chromium where indicated to avoid electrostatic charge dissipation. Imaging was performed using a Hitachi SU8010 electron microscope with a voltage of 10-80 kV. TEM was performed on dried samples mounted on copper 200 mesh grids and stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid and observed at 80 kV power using a Hitachi HT7700 electron microscope. 2.7. Mucin interaction assessment Mucin in deionized water (5 mg/mL) was mixed with L-TriAdj or liposomes and incubated for 30 min prior to particle sizing and zeta potential analysis, performed at 23 /C176C (Malvern, Nano ZS). Samples were measured in triplicate. Multimodal analysis with number weighting was used for the particle sizing. Interac- tions were also observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as described above. 2.8. Cytotoxicity assay Cytotoxicity of TriAdj vs. L-TriAdj was assessed by macrophage cell line, RAW CO 2and plated at 5000 cells/well 24 hrs before treatment. Cells were treated with TriAdj or L- TriAdj comprised of DDAB/DOPE (50/50) or DDAB/EPC/DOPE (40/50/10) as the lipid component, containing the equivalent of 0.5mg poly(I:C), 1 mg IDR-1002 peptide and 0.5 mg polyphosp- hazene/well in a volume 100 ml/well and 37 /C176C. CellTiter 96/C210Aqueous One and absorbance read (k= 490 nm). Signicant differences were determined by one- way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test (n = 4, p< 0.05). 2.9. Intranasal vaccination in mice Two in vivo studies were conducted with intranasal administra- tion of an Ova vaccine in mice. Animal studies were conducted upon peer-reviewed protocol approval of the University of Sas- katchewan Animal Research Ethics review board. First, two differ- ent lipid compositions of L-TriAdj as well as 2 different doses of TriAdj with a constant weight ratio of polyphosphazene:peptide: poly(I:C), i.e. 1:2:1 or 5:10:5 ( mg:mg:mg). Female Balb/c mice, 5- 6 weeks old, were randomly divided into 7 groups (n = 8/group). All groups except PBS control and Ova control received 1 mg Ova antigen mixed with the adjuvant (20 ml in one nostril). Groups: A: PBS control; B: Ova control (1 mg) (antigen only, no adjuvant); Groups C-G received Ova antigen along with the indicated adju-E.K. Wasan et al. / Vaccine 37 comparison of L-TriAdj coformulated with the Ova antigen versus a calcium microparticle formulation of TriAdj [29] was performed in a similar way as described above with 20 ml vac- cine administered intranasally. Controls received Ova alone (1 mg or 10 mg/dose) The remaining groups received triple adjuvant as the 5:10:5 ratio of poly(I:C): IDR-1002 peptide: polyphosphazene, where the L- TriAdj DDAB/DOPE (50/50 mol/mol) or ''soluble\" TriAdj, and the dose of Ova was 1 or 10 mg/dose for each formulation.In both studies, the mice were vaccinated at day 0 and boosted on day 28. Serum was collected on days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70 for individual plasma IgG1 and IgG2a ELISAs. IgA levels were mea- sured in the second study at day 70. Mice were euthanized and spleens were collected on day 70. Each spleen was used for lym- phocyte activation assays by the ELISpot method. 2.10. ELISA assays ELISAs were performed on the sera as previously described [10]. Plates were coated with Ova and incubated at 4 /C176C overnight with sera diluted 1:4. added (IgG1: Invitrogen Cat 1.

To detect IgA, the starting dilu- tion of the serum was 1 in 100 and the antibody used was goat anti-mouse IgA Biotin Conjugate (Invitrogen Cat # M31115). Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (AP) was added next as 100 ml of a 1:5000 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., 016-050-084). A colorimetric reaction was developed by adding 100ml of 1 mg/mL of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, N3254) as the AP substrate. Plates were read with a Biorad iMark Microplate Reader. Data are expressed as titres, which represent the dilution factor required to generate an absorbance reading two standard deviations above the mean of the negative control. 2.11. Elispot assays Spleens were harvested from the mice at day 70 post- vaccination, placing them in 10 mL Minimal Essential Medium (MEM, Gibco) on ice. The splenocytes were sieved through a 40mm strainer (BD Falcon) and the cells pelleted at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 /C176C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 mL Gey solu- tion and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. To this sus- pension 9 mL MEM was subsequently added followed by twice centrifugation as described above. The nal pellet was resus- pended in 5 mL AIM V media (Gibco) and the cells counted with trypan blue staining. ELISpot assays were performed . Briefly, ELISpot plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) were overnight with IL5 or IFN- cat 2 mg/mL (BD Biosciences cat # 551,216 and 554393). Spleen samples were then added in triplicate at a concentration of 1 /C2107cells/mL and incubated overnight.

For the ELISA results, the data were homoscedastic based on anal- ysis of variance of the residuals but not normally distributed. Therefore, comparison between treatment groups was performed on rank order-transformed data with the Kruskall-Wallis test (Statistics, STATEXT) and post-hoc Tukey test. Quartile analysis on rank order data was also used to illustrate comparative maxi- mal response values from the ELISA data.

Particle size and zeta potential analysis of L-TriAdj The mean diameter of all the liposome formulations was <200 nm and for those containing DDAB, the zeta potential was highly positive. P ratios of 0.5:1 and 1:1 (liposomes:TriAdj) consis- tently resulted in gross visible aggregation and were not used fur- ther, likely representing samples with a net neutral surface charge. For L-TriAdj containing DDAB/DOPE (75/25 mol/mol) at a 3:1 P ratio, aggregation was also observed and this composition was also eliminated from further consideration. As L-TriAdj, DDAB/DOPE (50/50 mol/mol) produced particles that were smaller and more homogeneous than DDAB/DOPE (75/25). ( Supplementary ), DDAB/DOPE (50/50) L-TriAdj was used for the in vivo studies. The zeta potential values of DDAB/DOPE (50/50) and DDAB/DOPE (75/25) liposomes were 62.5 and 78.6, respectively. For L-TriAdj the corresponding zeta potential values were reduced (by the addition of negatively charged Tri-Adj) to 49.7 and 56.4, which were stable over 24 h. A similar zeta potential was measured for DDAB/DOPE (50/50 or 75/25) prepared as L- TriAdj at 2:1 or 3:1 phosphorus molar ratio (ratio 3 and 4, respec- tively), over 24 h, in the range of 45-55 mV. (See Supplementary Data Fig. S3 ) The TriAdj composition at weight ratios mg:mg:mg) of poly(I:C):IDR-1002-p eptide:polyphosphazene did not signicantly influence the particle size or zeta potential of L-TriAdj using these lipid formulations (data not shown). Both the size analysis and zeta potential of L-TriAdj over 24 hr was found to be consistently stable. Whole vac- cine, comprised of L-TriAdj with Ova, was stable for 24 h ( Supple- mentary Data ). 3.2. Structure and mucin interaction studies To assess the potential for mucoadhesion, the zeta potentials of liposomes, TriAdj and L-TriAdj was measured before and after theaddition of mucin (5 mg/mL). Zeta potential is a measurement of the electrical potential difference between the particle surface and the bulk liquid phase. Here, a change in zeta potential was used as a surrogate measure of mucin binding because the zeta potential value would be expected to change if mucin adsorbed or bound to the particle surface. It does not reflect the afnity or the specicity of binding, which would require more elaborate testing. Fig. 1 shows that cationic liposomes alone including DDAB/DOPE 50/50 ( Fig. 1 ( Fig. 1 B) and DDAB/EPC/DOPE 40/50/10 ( Fig. 1 C) showed initial zeta potential values of 62.5, 78.6 and 31 mV, respectively, and these decreased signicantly upon addition of TriAdj (to form L-TriAdj) consistent with complex formation. These results were similar for at 2:1 or 3:1 phosphorus molar ratio (liposomes: TriAdj), indicated in the gure as ratio 3 and 4, respectively). TriAdj alone had a modest negative potential ( /C05 mV). When mucin was added to L-TriAdj, the zeta potential further decreased, consistent with an interac- tion. As a control, EPC/Chol 90/10 ( Fig. 1 D) showed a slight changein the zeta potential of liposomes ( /C033 mV) when mixed with TriAdj and mucin, perhaps due to nonspecic interactions. Phos- phatidylcholine (PC) is a glycerophospholipid with a choline head- group, possessing a zwitterionic character but a net formal charge of 0. Fig. 2 indicates the ultrastructure of the liposomes, L-TriAdj and the association of L-TriAdj with mucin by scanning electron micro- scopy (SEM, Fig. 2 A) and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Fig. 2 B). Both DDAB/DOPE and DDAB/EPC/DOPE formula- tions were visualized. Samples had to be air-dried before micro- scopy which caused some degree of aggregation. Additional images of mucin alone, TriAdj alone and liposomes or TriAdj mixed with mucin are available in the Supplementary Data . The lipo- somes were seen to be on the order of 100-200 nm in agreement with the results of dynamic light scattering analysis of the lipo- A B Fig. 4.

L-TriAdj is seen on chromium-coated sam- ples to be irregularly globular by SEM and variably sized. The appearance is similar when mucin was present, with larger globu- lar structures noted. TEM analysis of liposomes alone showed vesi- cles with 1-3 lamellae, with a mean diameter of about 100 nm. L- TriAdj images clearly show deformation and reformation of lipid structures on the TriAdj particles, with the surface appearing to be covered with deformed liposomes or multilamellar nonvesicu- lar regions. Unincorporated liposomes were quite Lipo- somes alone also interacted with the mucin globules but did not deform/reform, unlike with L-TriAdj, rather covering the mucinsurface ( Supplementary Data ).

Cytotoxicity assay assay was performed using RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cells after 24 h exposure to the lipid adjuvant (Fig. 3 ), whereby TriAdj content was kept constant at either 0.5mg:1mg:0.5 mg/well ( Fig. 2 A) and 0.25 mg: 0.5 mg: 0.25 mg/well (Fig. 2 B).

In vivo studies The results obtained from the rst in vivo study in mice are illustrated in Fig. 4 and showed a signicantly greater immune response following intranasal administration of the lipid-based adjuvant complexed with the lower dose of ovalbumin antigen (Ova), compared to the non-lipidic TriAdj complex. At a higher dose of Ova both groups performed equally well. To assess humoral (Th2 type) vs. cellular (Th1 type) immune responses to vaccination, serum levels of IgG1 (typical of Th2 responses) and IgG2a (Th1)were measured at 0, 6 and 10 weeks by ELISA ( Fig. 4 A and B). L- TriAdj comprised of DDAB/DOPE with TriAdj TriAdj alone ( p< 0.01), but this was not the case for DDAB/EPC/DOPE-TriAdj. Rank-order transformation of the IgG1 titre values revealed that groups receiv- ing L-TriAdj based on DDAB/DOPE at both doses of TriAdj (1:2:1 and 5:10:5), or DDAB/EPC/DOPE formulated with TriAdj produced statistically signicantly higher 0.01) IgG1 the groups receiving non-lipidic TriAdj at a 5:10:5 wt ratio. Comparison of the rank order data further showed a signicant difference in IgG1 responses between mice receiving L-TriAdj at a 1:2:1 vs. 5:10:5 wt ratio of TriAdj (p< 0.05). Furthermore, the median IgG2a responses of mice in groups receiving the lipid formulations were signicantly higher than those receiving TriAdj alone as the adjuvant ( Fig. 4 B). There were signicant differences between the rank-order transformed IgG2a values from groups receiving doses of TriAdj at a 1:2:1 vs. 5:10:5 ratio for both DDAB/DOPE and DDAB/EPC/DOPE-based L- TriAdj ( 0.01). no statistically signicant dif- ference in IgG2a response when comparing the two lipid-based adjuvants at the 5:10:5 ratio at week 10.

A balanced Th1/Th2 response is considered desirable for a vaccine while a Th1 type response is essential for vaccines intended for viral infections. Secretion of IL-5 from lymphocytes obtained from the vaccinated mice was not signicantly different between the various treatment groups (Fig. 5 E-5H).

The spleen lymphocytes from the vaccinated mice were exposed in triplicate to 5 or 10 mg ovalbumin ex vivo and secretion of IL5 and IFN were measured. The ratio of these values reflects the balance of cellular (Th1) vshumoral (Th2) type response. *Signicantly different from L-TriAdj DDAB/DOPEwith ( p= 0.05).1510 E.K. Wasan et al. / 1503-1515the 5:10:5 wt ratio compared to TriAdj alone as the adjuvant. This dose-response to the triple adjuvant content within L-TriAdj, illus-trated in Fig. 6 , showed that lymphocytes from vaccinated mice stimulated with a recall dose of 5 or 10 mg Ova had a higher level of IFN release for those groups that received L-TriAdj at 5:10:5 wt ratio of the adjuvant. Fig. 7 demonstrates an analysis of the polarization of the T cell response relative to lipid composi- tion, adjuvant dose and Ova antigen dose, indicating that with both TriAdj and L-TriAdj, a desirable balanced response was obtained (N. B. a value < 1 would imply a relatively greater Th1 type response. while a value > 1 would imply a stronger Th2 response). A second in vivo study in mice compared the adjuvant ability of TriAdj formulated as calcium microparticles (MP) [29] vs. L-TriAdj or TriAdj alone ( Fig. 8 ). These studies assessed plasma IgG2a levels (Fig. 8 A), IgG1 levels ( Fig. 8 B) and IgA ( Fig. 8 C), as measured by ELISA assay, at 0, 6, and 10 weeks in mice receiving intranasal Ova vaccines (1 or 10 mg/dose with a booster dose administered intranasally at week 4) adjuvanted with TriAdj, TriAdj MP, or L- TriAdj. PBS and Ova without adjuvant served as controls. At 6 weeks, for MP and lipidic formulations of TriAdj, the IgG1 titres were similar for mice vaccinated with 1 vs. 10 mg Ova, and a similar trend could be observed for IgG2a titres. In contrast, soluble TriAdj required 10 mg Ova to enable the generation of IgG1 and IgG2a titres comparable to those achieved with 1 mg Ova with L-TriAdj as the adjuvant. At 6 weeks, TriAdj MP with 1 mg Ova generated lower IgG2a titres when compared to L-TriAdj with 1 mg Ova, whereas the IgG1 titres were similar at the same antigen dose (1 or 10 mg Ova). At the high dose of antigen (10 mg Ova), there was no signicant difference in IgG1 titres between groups receiving the vaccine adjuvanted with MP or L-TriAdj, how- ever, for IgG2a, TriAdj MP induced a lower titre than the other two adjuvant groups at 10 mg Ova/dose. Furthermore, L-TriAdj out- performed the other adjuvants at an Ova dose of 1 mg in terms of IgG2a response, demonstrating its potential for an antigen dose- sparing effect. ELISA results for IgA showed a stronger response to the lipidic formulation than the other test vaccines with Ova at 1 or 10 mg/dose ( Fig. 8 C), clearly demonstrating that mucosal immunity was achieved. This is particularly evident at the 1 mg dose of Ova, where the proportion of strong IgA responders is greater in the group receiving the lipidic formulation of TriAdj compared to soluble or microparticle preparations. ELISpot results from the second in vivo study ( Fig. 9 ) illustrate the IFN-c(Fig. left-side) and IL-5 responses ( Fig. 9 G-L, right side) from lymphocytes obtained from the spleens of the vaccinated mice were assessed by ELISPOT assay following ex vivo stimulation with Ova antigen at 5 or 10 mg/ml. Thus, this data not only compared the effect of adjuvant formulation and antigen dose, but also the range of responses to antigenic recall at two doses. Assessing the response of lymphocytes from vaccinated mice revealed that within each formulation group and antigen dose, the median response ofthe lymphocytes to the Ova recall was similar at both 5 vs. 10 mg/ mL Ova, based on the IFN- cand IL-5 ELISPOT results and for both the L-TriAdj and MP groups. However, a greater response was noted in IL-5 and IFN- cvalues when 10 lg Ova antigen was included in the vaccine compared to 1 mg Ova. Similar IL-5 and IFN- cvalues were measured from groups receiving L-TriAdj with just 1 lg Ova antigen compared to TriAdj MP with 10 lg of Ova in the vaccine. Fig. 10 illus- trates the median IgG2a titres at 6 weeks. Consistent with the rst in vivo study, in those animals receiving antigen with L- TriAdj, the IgG2a antibody titres and INF- csecretion from lymphocytes of vaccinated mice indicate a strong cell-mediated response for both the lipidic and MP formulations. 4. Discussion and conclusions The combination of lipid nanocarrier with TriAdj undergoes a super-molecular self-assembly process which results in lipidic Fig. 8.

The composition facil- itates adherence to mucin and may permit its penetration which would be promoted both by the cationic liposomes and the peptide IDR-1002. The lipid composition was comprised of cationic lipid (DDAB), for immunostimulation and mucin association, as well as ''helper lipid\" (DOPE) to aid endosomal escape. Modulation of both liposomal surface charge density and, theoretically, liposomal membrane fluidity was achieved by inclusion of egg phosphatidyl- choline (EPC). The assembly process of cationic liposomes andTriAdj was reproducible and generated stable, condensed L- TriAdj particles with adjuvant activity in excess of that achieved by the TriAdj alone. The ratio of components that produced stable lipidic complexes of the TriAdj adjuvant was assessed in detail (Supplementary Data ). Thus, the balance of charged polyelectrolyte components incorporated into the lipidic adjuvant promoted self- assembly and condensation, and an overall cationic charge inhib- ited gross aggregation and facilitated mucin interaction as indi- cated by its effects on the measured zeta potentials.

Wasan et al. / Vaccine 37 (2019) 1503-1515condensation of components also generated relatively small parti- cles (<200 nm) that would be of a diameter amenable to cellular uptake. Analysis of whole-vaccine (antigen + adjuvant) size and 24 h stability indicated a submicron particle size range also ( Sup- plementary Data ). Ideally, the antigen and adjuvant would be taken up by the same APC, so binding of the antigen to the lipidic adjuvant would be advantageous. The effect of the antigen physic- ochemical features on lipidic adjuvant binding as well as the impact of binding on the structure of the antigen may need to be further explored with the relevant therapeutic vaccine antigen [34]. This in turn might be affected by lipid parameters such asdegree of saturation, membrane fluidity and packing parameters [35]. For example, phosphatidylcholine, which is a neutral diacyl phospholipid with one unsaturation (16:1/18:0) would be expected to be in lamellar phase in the liposomes used to prepare L-TriAdj. However, the lipid phase organization after binding and its subsequent effect on adjuvant processing within the endosome, which may impact release of the various components, is not known. Although the EPC-containing liposomes (DDAB/EPC/DOPE 40/50/10 M ratio) would have a lower cationic surface charge den- sity, the lipid content was normalized to the same total molar con- tent of cationic lipid as DDAB/DOPE (50/50) for combining into Fig. 9 (continued )E.K. Wasan et al. / Vaccine 37 (2019) 1503-1515 1513lipidic particles with TriAdj. It can only be speculated that the dif- ference in the in vivo adjuvant effect with the Ova vaccine might be related either to differential APC uptake or endosomal processing, which bears further study. Other research groups have noted the importance of lipid composition on the degree of immunostimula- tion as well as the tissue transit of cationic lipid-based adjuvants [36-40] . It is also important to note that the in vitro cytotoxicity studies showed that formulation of TriAdj with lipids reduced the cytotoxicity of TriAdj towards RAW267.4 mouse macrophages in vitro , reducing concerns over the potential for toxicity. Future in vivo studies will include examining the histopathology of the nasal cavity following nasal administration of L-TriAdj adjuvanted vaccines. It should be noted that the other components of TriAdj, namely poly (I:C) and polyphosphazene, were varied in tandem with the peptide at previously optimized ratios and also contributed to the adjuvant activity. Mixed adjuvants provide a distinct advan- tage by activating different aspects of the immune response and lowering the antigen dose or number of doses required to generate a response of sufcient strength to protect the host following chal- lenge with the infectious agent. Poly(I:C) is a synthetic version of double-stranded RNA which alerts the immune system by nature of its pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), activates an innate immune response via Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). It not only drives a Th1/cellular response, but also modulates the duration of response, promoting apoptosis of dendritic cells [41], which is important for resolution of immune responses. Polyphosphazene is a synthetic anionic polymer with immunostimulatory properties that also serves as a polyelectrolyte binding agent [3,42] . Another critical component innate defense regula-tory (IDR) peptide 1002, which has multiple immune modulatory roles including recruitment and selective activation of neutrophils and dendritic cells [3-5,43] . Through the use of rational propor- tions of cationic and helper lipid which enabled mucoadhesive par- ticle formation, there was enhancement of an established adjuvant by the nasal route of administration resulting in a balanced Th1/ Th2 immune response in vivo . The trend of influence of the adju- vant dose and the lipid composition on the Th2/Th1 balance bears further study because this may inform future studies with thera- peutic vaccines where a specic type of response is required. A par- ticulate formulation also has the potential for a depot effect, residing in the nasal tissues for an extended time for ongoing exposure. Here we have demonstrated a novel intranasal adjuvant plat- form that can be used for a wide range of vaccines for the induction of both local and systemic immunity [44]. We have demonstrated an enhanced IgG ( Figs. 4 and 8 ) and IgA ( Fig. 8 C) response as well as an antigen dose-sparing effect, in that the lipidic formulationenabled a stronger response at the lower doses of antigen com- pared to non-lipidic preparations of TriAdj. The advantages of the intranasal formulation are to deliver the vaccine via mucosal sur- faces, thereby avoiding the use of needles, and inducing mucosal and systemic immunity simultaneously, which is key to enhanced protection against respiratory infections. These studies add to the growing understanding of the relationship between lipid composi- tion or particle features of cationic lipid carriers of vaccine adju- vants and how they direct or influence the immune response [38,39,45,46] . Using a variety of compositional variations to permit formulation optimization as well as the tools for physical charac- terization to ensure reproducible fabrication, it will be feasible to design carriers that generate specic responses in the context of payload type. The lipidic adjuvant is expected to be useful for a variety for vaccine types and formulations including inactivated,subunit and modied live vaccines. Future studies will focus on therapeutic nasal vaccines with the DDAB/DOPE (50/50) composi- tion of L-TriAdj that generated the most vigorous immune response at the lowest antigen dose.
