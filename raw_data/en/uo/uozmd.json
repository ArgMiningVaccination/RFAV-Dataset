Various challenges were identified: -The application process was inefficient, with significant time spent on administrative tasks, such as data capture and letter creation; -~50 % of applications were for renewals, which required the same amount of work as new applications Key achievements in 2018 -19 To address these challenges, SAHPRA introduced an online application process, which dramatically re -engineered the former process: -This greatly reduced the time required for the approval process, allowing two staff members to keep up with the daily volumes of ~110 incoming applications (including backlog resubmissions). The Section 21 backlog was cleared by November 2018Overview22Additional work will be undertaken on the digital systems to ensure that they optimally support the evaluation process of Section 211Key Objectives for 2019 -2020 Sale of unregistered medicines: Section 21 applications23 Clinical trialsA thriving clinical trials sector in South Africa is an important contributor to clinical and academic research expertise and local health product development SAHPRA's Clinical Trials Unit reviews four types of submissions: 1.New authorisations (pharmaceutical industry trials, academic trials, bioequivalence studies): evaluated on a two -month cycle 2.Protocol amendments 3.Investigator and site ( I&S) amendments 4.Notifications As of 14 December 2018 there were 175 clinical trial applications to be completed: -35 new authorisation applications were in -process, with another 30 applications due for evaluation in the January 2019 cycle -96 protocol amendments were in -process -11 investigator and site ( I&S) amendments were in-process -Improvements can be implemented to prevent a significant backlog developing. These improvements will be the strategic focus in 2019 -20Overview24To clear the backlog, and to prevent Clinical Trials from entering a crisis state, the unit will be assigned additional administrative and clinical staff In order to reassure industry and academic applicants, SAHPRA will regularly communicate the status of the Clinical Trials unit, for clearing the backlog SAHPRA will also investigate and potentially procure a digital workflow/online application system for Clinical Trials -This will enable automated data capture into databases, easy tracking of application status, and minimise basic administrative errors1 2 3 Clinical trialsKey Objectives for 2019 -202025 Inspections, licensing and regulatory complianceThe inspectorate, licensing and regulatory compliance arm of SAHPRA ensures that the pharmaceutical premises, personnel and medicinal products meet the minimum standards of Good Manufacturing, Wholesale and Clinical practice and function within the ambit of the Medicines Act and regulations through regular and scheduled inspection activities The unit has consistently met its mandate, and is under no immediate crisis. A natural consequence of change has resulted in higher attrition rates of staff, with a number of staff being poached from the industry stakeholders -Stabilising staff capacity and competency to meet the expanding mandate to support eradication of the registration backlog is a key area of focus for licensing and inspectionsOverview26The unit will continue receiving new applications and continue with further inspections. There will be reconciliation of the application fees as well as the inspection fees Staffing for both capacity and competency will be prioritised so as to prevent any development of a backlog in this unit An area of particular focus for the expansion of staffing for both capacity and competency must support the focus to strengthen border control The move of the entity towards digitised pathways and processes will also be a key focus of this unit with the intention of increasing current output1 2 3 4Inspections, licensing and regulatory complianceKey Objectives for 2019 -202027 Medical devicesThe medical device unit is responsible for the licensing of manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers of medical devices, facilitating the evaluation of medical device clinical trial applications, investigating and responding to law enforcement activities and section 36 exemptions related to medical devices, management of medical device vigilance reports and supporting the medical device committee In 2018/2019 the Medical Device Unit was staffed with a Deputy Director, two community service pharmacists and one administrative staff member who assisted the unit on a part- time basis -Despite limited staffing the unit was able to licence approximately 700 medical device facilities A large number of stakeholder engagements for information sharing and education and consultation on the road map for registration was held in 2018. This has brought this road map to readiness for Board approval which will be imminent in 2019Overview28Implementation of a system to register medical devices Increased staffing to support expanded registration and safety monitoring framework The implementation of a specialised IT system to complement the activities of the Medical Device Unit has been identified as a performance area for 2019/2010 The development of an online system for registration of medical devices1 2 3 4Key Objectives for 2019 -2020 Medical devices29 Radiation control A new functional area of SAHPRA responsibilities is the regulation of all electro medical devices and sources emitting ionising radiation. -Staff in the NDoH Radiation Control Unit responsible for this mandate were transferred to SAHPRA in October 2018 Regulatory functions of Radiation Control unit include licensing, compliance management, enforcement, investigation of complaints and incidents/accidents involving ionizing radiation, occupational exposures, import -export, disposal, etc. Regulation of devices involves validation and registration of devices that emit ionizing of non -ionizing radiation used in medical and industrial applications. It also involves devices, which contain radioactive sources These products are categorized into two groups, namely Group III and Group IV as defined in the Hazardous Substances Act Radiation Control is experiencing curtailment of its regulatory functions due to critical staff shortages that persisted over many yearsOverview30SAHPRA has prioritised capacitation of the unit A further consideration is that this is now the only unit of SAHPRA that has to -date not charged fees for the services provided -A working group was assembled in 2018 to review the situation and advise and changes to this fee for service infrastructure are envisaged for the future of this unit within the entity -Their recommendations will be reviewed for implementation in 2019 As this is a new portfolio for SAHPRA, there is a need for the Authority and the National Department of Health to converse with the relevant stakeholders, including the National Nuclear Regulator and the Department of Energy 1 2 3Key Objectives for 2019 -2020 Radiation control 31 Corporate servicesSAHPRA's first year as a fledgling entity was marked by protracted protest action that hindered the administrative support within SAHPRA's own structures as well as that which should have been received in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement signed with the NDoH This was compounded by difficulties with SAHPRA accommodation, necessitating an urgent relocation to keep SAHPRA functional Capacitation of the organisation's executive and senior management echelon began in 2018 and is ongoing in 2019 Staff Transfer Agreements signed in October 2018: Section 197 and staff formally notified of transfer in October 2018Overview32Agenda BudgetProgramsStrategic goalsPart B: Strategic objectivesIntroduction to the Backlog Clearance Program GovernancePart A: Strategic overview Overview & objectives across SAHPRAPolicy and legislative mandates33 A critical first task for SAHPRA was the clearance of the inherited medical products backlog, defined as: Allapplications1submitted which are yet to receive final approval (including certification), as of 31 January 20182 1.
