Nutritional guidelines in traditional Chinese medicine are unique because diet suggestions are based on each individual's health goals. What is Holistic Medicine? Holistic medicine is a medical approach that focuses on treating all aspects of a person. Optimal health is more than just the absence of sickness but mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual balance and wellness. Health is an interconnected system that requires balance of all aspects of a person. If one aspect of a person is lacking or problematic then other aspects of the person will be affected. For example stress, part of the emotional/mental aspect, can cause high blood pressure and other physical symptoms. Mind, body, spirit, and emotions are all considered when formulating treatment plans in order to assure optimal health and wellness. Traditional Chinese Medicine provides holistic treatments in order to balance all aspects of a person to promote health. It also enables people to take control of their health through educating on self-care, lifestyle changes, healthy eating, and exercise. The goal of our treatment is to balance the whole person and not just relieve their health symptoms. Ready to Begin?

What Our Patients Say Alyssa Cebulski I have been seeing Dr. Serena now for about 6 months and she has helped me with my migraines and digestive issues. As a dancer I have also have had multiple muscle pins that she has relieved quickly. Not only does she care for my well being but she also care for my career. I am so blessed I have found an acupuncturist that has been so beneficial. Also, cupping is magical! "}
