Anderson provides primary care alongside Royce Bailey, MD to provide whole-person care through integrated treatments to care for people - body, mind and spirit. Anderson earned his bachelor's degree in Management with a concentration in Marketing from the University of North Carolina in Asheville, NC and went on to earn his Physician Assistant Master's degree from Wingate University. He has experience in family medicine and outpatient Internal Medicine, with a passion for the prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes management, and Mental Health. - Personal Interests - In his free time, Corey enjoys spending time in his Japanese-style garden, where he has his collection of rare conifers and Japanese Maples. - Care Philosophy - One of the roles I believe I have as a professional medical provider is one of taking very complex ideas and simplifying them so I can teach the patient about their medical conditions. I find that if I create a narrative in which patients can relate concepts from everyday life, they are more likely to take more interest in their health care. - Areas Served - Hendersonville, NC - Languages Spoken - English - Board Certification - Physician Assistant: National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants NCCPA - Ages Accepted - Adults Insurances accepted by Corey Anderson, PA-C Disclaimer: The list below is for reference purposes only and is subject to change.
