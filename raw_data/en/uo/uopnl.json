Allrecipes' editorial guidelines Updated on September 8, 2021 Clean Eating is simple. Essentially, clean eating is about eating more healthy foods and fewer unhealthy, heavily processed or refined foods and foods with added sugars and unhealthy fats. When we talk about healthy clean eating recipes, we're talking fresh, whole ingredients, organic and eaten in season when possible, and prepared in unfussy ways that highlight natural flavors. You've heard Michael Pollan's maxim: \"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" That's kind of the essence of clean eating, too. And if you're doing the Mediterranean Diet, you're already eating clean. Clean eating is eating close to nature, without too much human or industrial interference along the way. Here's a simple way to determine if food fits the clean-eating concept. Consult the label. For starters, if it has a label, it may not be clean. But if it's a can of beans or tomatoes with only one or two ingredients, that's clean. Longer ingredient lists filled with unpronounceable words? Not so much. There's no rigid regime to follow. Organic produce and grass-fed meats are preferred. Breads are brown and made from whole grains. Healthy fats are favored, including olive and nut oils. Added sugars, salt, and additives are out, as are trans-fats and highly processed and refined foods. Simple ingredients, simple preparations. You get the idea. Now let's grab a glass of red wine, sit down with friends and family, and enjoy some simple clean eating recipes.
