All three of these vitamins are available in different foods and supplements. Talk with your doctor to determine the best way for you to get the vitamins your immune system needs.

Make sure you are consuming a healthy diet of unprocessed foods and antioxidants to help reduce inflammation and encourage good gut bacteria.
