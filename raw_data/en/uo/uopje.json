Even if you eat healthily, our food is less nutritious today than in years past, and most people are lacking in vital nutrients. Therefore, we believe that whole-food-based, premium supplements are essential for optimal wellbeing. While no supplement regimen is a one-size-fits-all situation, the following list outlines the basic building blocks that support the body's vital processes. If there are any specific health concerns or conditions, items may be added or subtracted. These products can help with immune function, energy, sleep, stress, pain and inflammation, and more. Even if you don't suffer from any major symptoms, these supplements are a fantastic way to feel your best! - Curcumin is the main active ingredient in turmeric (yes, the spice!). However, the curcumin content in turmeric is relatively low, so it's much more beneficial to take curcumin as a dietary supplement. Curcumin has powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, so much so that it matches the effectiveness of some anti-inflammatory drugs, but without all the harsh side effects. Promising research shows that curcumin is effective at combating chronic inflammatory diseases such as cancer, arthritis, and Alzheimer's, in addition to lowering your risk of heart disease and depression. Unfortunately, curcumin is poorly absorbed in the bloodstream, but pairing it with black pepper (piperine) helps to increase the absorption by about 2,000%. It is fat-soluble, so consuming it with foods that contain fat is ideal. *If you have a sensitivity to black pepper, please let us know! We do stock turmeric without it.* A whole-food-based, broad-spectrum multivitamin that is split between water-soluble energizing vitamins and minerals in the morning, and fat-soluble calming nutrients in the evening. Sunrise, the morning portion, is taken via pre-measured liquid packets. Sunset, the evening portion, comes in capsule form. Sunrise contains powerful antioxidants derived from superfoods such as Wild Alaskan Blueberry, along with a host of other potent natural ingredients. Sunset contains vitamins A, D, and E, along with Omega-3s derived from the purest source in the world, Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon. This combination offers unparalleled nutritional support for the body's vital systems, such as the cardiovascular and immune systems. Magnesium is a mineral that is involved in many important processes in the body, especially concerning the brain, heart, and muscles. Magnesium glycinate is magnesium bound to glycine, an amino acid. Magnesium glycinate is very well absorbed by the body and has been shown to help with anxiety, muscle pain, and maintaining strong bone density. It is also particularly effective in the brain, as it has a calming effect, and helps to promote better sleep. Probiotics are live microorganisms that can be consumed via fermented foods or supplements. They promote a healthy balance of gut bacteria and have been linked to a wide range of benefits such as improved digestion, immune response, and neurological health. An increasing number of studies directly link the gut microbiome to the brain, skin, and heart, among other vital systems. Emerging research shows the strong synergistic relationship between vitamins D3 and K2 in their effect on skeletal and cardiovascular health. These vitamins help support a healthy calcium balance in the body, promote bone health, and boost immune function. Vitamin D3 has long been known for its role in allowing proper bone remineralization to occur. New research shows, though, that vitamin K2 activates a protein that helps direct calcium to the bone and leads it away from arteries, decreasing the risk of calcium toxicity that comes with vitamin D3 usage. Additionally, vitamin D3 has incredible anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties, meaning it is excellent at assisting in the proper immune response. Vitamin K2 is found in animal products and fermented foods, and many recent studies are investigating its critical role in heart and bone health. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a chemical derived from the cannabis plant. CBD oil is made by extracting the CBD from the plant and mixing it with a carrier oil, such as coconut oil. The human body contains a specialized system called the endocannabinoid system (ECS), which is involved in the regulation of many bodily functions such as pain, mood, sleep, appetite, and immune response. Studies have shown that CBD helps control these functions by binding directly with ECS receptors. Developing research indicates that CBD may be a much safer, more natural method in treating depression and anxiety, which is usually managed with heavy-duty pharmaceuticals. It has even shown promise in alleviating cancer-related symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and pain. It is primarily used to control systemic pain and inflammation and is best taken with foods that contain fat, as it is fat-soluble. *As per the 2018 federal bill and 2019 Texas bill, any CBD product containing less than 0.3% THC is legal. WAAYB's third-party testing routinely shows that their products are well within this limit. However, if you have any concerns about drug testing or otherwise, we advise that you do not consume this dietary supplement.* *CBD can interact with medications. If you take any supplements or medications with a \"grapefruit warning\", it is best to avoid CBD. Both grapefruit and CBD can interfere with enzymes that are important "}
