Page 623 1. Student Success a. Implement policies established by the institution's management board to achieve cohort graduation rate and graduation productivity goals that are consistent with institutional peers. Policy/policies adopted by the management board Admissions standards. The Fall 2010 admission standards originated in the Master Plan for Public Postsecon darv Education: 2001 . The UL System Board of Supervisors took the lead in increasing admission standards, tightening admission exceptions and strengthening transfer student exiectations for Fail 2011 with Board action in October 2009. Admission by exception. Students who do not meet the criteria for Guaranteed Admission but do have a 2.0 GPA will be considered individually for Admission by Exception. For 2009-Il, seven percent of students, calculated from the entering freshman class, may be admitted by exception (Admission The Regents admissions criteria for 2012 specify that, six percent of students, calculated from the previous year's entering freshman class, may be admitted by exception. Credit hours required for degree. In Spring 2010, the ULS Council of Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs endorsed a System-wide 120 hour degree requirement and tasked their university provosts to pare down the number of hours required to earn a four year degree at their eight universities. The Board of Regents revised the total credit hours required for degree in August of 2010 specifying that the total number of credit hours required for a baccalaureate degree shall be 120 hours unless otherwise required for accreditation and/or professional certification purposes. In those cases where a degree program must exceed 120 hours, it shall first be submitted to the UL System Office for review and approval. Subsequent policy/policies adopted by the institution Admissions standards. Both the Fall 2010 and Fail 2011 UL Lafayette admissions policies conform to the System requirements. The University is also on track to implement Fall 2012 System and BOR requirements for first-time freshmen and transfer students. Admission by exception. Both the Fall 2010 and Fall 2011 UL Lafayette standards for admission by exception conform to the System requirements. Credit hours required for degree. The University's Strategic Plan, section 2.3.6, addresses the need to \"reduce the average time required for undergraduate students to graduate.\" During the Fall 2010 semester, virtually all curricula on campus were reduced from their prior total required credit hours of 124-129 to 120 effective for Fall 2011. The only exceptions are in a few degree programs such as Engineering in which an accrediting body's regulations prohibit reduction to 120 hours. Timeline for implementing policy/policies Fall 2011 UL System standards for admission, admission by exception, and credit hours required for degree will be implemented in Fall 2011. Fall 2012 Regents standards for admission and admission by exception will be implemented in Fall 2012.4 Performance of entering freshmen students admitted by exception (4-year universities). Mentoring Program. Students admitted by committee are required to participate in the Mentoring Program and their performance (Mentoring Program Eall .201 O.,p) is monitored. o In Fall 2010 and Spring 2011, students admitted by committee on average had a 2.7 cumulative high school GPA and composite ACT between 20- 21 while students regularly admitted students had an average high school GPA of 3.2-3.3 and an average composite ACT of 22-23. Students admitted by committee had an average Fall 2010 semester gpa of 1.81 and earned, on average, a passing grade in 67% of credit hours enrolled. FaIl 2010 first-time freshmen who met our minimum admission standards posted an average Fall 2010 semester gpa of 2.4 and earned, on average, a passing grade in 90% of credit hours enrolled. (FAO8 TI-IRU FAe 10 Performance). oOur goal with students admitted by committee is to provide them with the necessary support to assist them in performing at the same level as regular admits. The University surveys students and mentors each semester to gage the effectiveness of the Mentoring Program and make appropriate changes. (Mentor-Survey -Results). oPersistence from first to second semester for both regular admits and those admitted by committee is generally above 869o. Persistence from first fall semester to second fall semester is generally where the differences begin to emerge. While regular admits generally have a l fall to 2 fall persistence rate between 73-76%, students admitted by committee have a persistence rate between 52% -65%. These rates decline when you go from 2d fall to 3 fall. (FAO8 THRU FA 10 Retention) oThe majority of students admitted by committee, generally 42-47%, are required to take Math remediation. Approximately 40-45% of students admitted by committee enrolled in remedial Math do not earn a grade of \"C\" or better during their first enrollment in the course. Effective Fall 2011 the University will require all students needing developmental Math to participate in math tutoring at least two times per week. Additional Information The University's Strategic Plan 2.3.2 focuses on increasing retention rates as a means of increasing graduation rates for all students and particularly for \"transfer, at-risk, non-traditional and underrepresented students through the nurturing of appropriate support services and programs.\" Below is a brief discussion of selected programs which contribute to student success and retention. a Supplemental instruction (SI). The SI Program for freshman students in challenging courses offers bi/tri-weekly tutoring sessions facilitated by an SI tutor in which students compare notes, discuss readings and develop organizational tools. SI tutors are students who have previously done well in the course and who attend all class lectures, take notes, conduct SI sessions, and offer office hours. Results (Supplemental Instruction) show that on average students attending SI sessions receive up to one letter grade higher than those in the same class who did not attend SI. For Fall 2010, attendees made 2,973 visits to the Learning Center earning average grades 10.9% higher than those for non-attendees. The greatest impact was in Math 140 (PreCalculus Algebra and Trigonometry) where grades of attendees were 21.4% higher than those of non-attendees. Also noteworthy were results in BIOL 220 (Survey of Anatomy and Physiology); students who came to at least 5sessions had an average grade of 76.77%; those who came to 10 an 80.5%; and those who came to at least 20 earned an average grade of 83.84%. oAcademic Success Center (ASC). The ASC is an academic support center designed to assist students in their pursuit of academic success. Counselors are the assigned academic advisors for at-risk students, including students admitted by committee and meet with students to identify problem areas and develop action plans to assist them in returning to good academic standing. In Fall 2010, 11,812 student visits were logged into the ASC for academic counseling, advising, Career Counseling Center and the Learning Center(Learning Center).S i.a. i.

Increase the percentage of program completers at all levels each year. The University is dedicated to increasing the percentage of program completers at all levels. Results of some of the action plans under Strategic Imperative 2-Enhancing Student Engagement and Success - of the University's Strategic Plan follow: Create a meaningful first-year experience by developing a substantive and formative first-year seminar for incoming student and providing resources to assist students with choosing or affirming their choice of major. The Cajun Connection, a two-credit hour college success course, began its first year of ftill implementation in the 2010-20 11 academic year. One component of the seminar allows students to determine occupational interests, and research and evaluate information about career paths. Earlier identification of majors should both retain students and result in higher graduation rates. The Moody College of Business hosted a pilot of the course in Spring 2010 and became the first college to offer the course to 375of its incoming freshmen. Based on evaluations from Spring 2010 LCaIun.. Connection Results), action plans were developed to improve the delivery of course content, alter curricula, and improve course assessment. These changes were implemented in the Fall 2010 (Syllabus) when 15 sections of Cajun Connection were offered in the College of Business and one or more pilot sections were offered in each academic college. In Spring of 2011, two sections of Cajun Connection were offered to45students in the Moody College of Business. Data analysis will be completed at the end of this academic year for Fall 2010 and Spring 2011. Metrics will be developed to track the effectiveness of the course in terms of increased retention and graduation rates. To increase the number of students graduating by (1) increasing the graduation rates of transfer, at-risk, non-traditional and underrepresented students through the nurturing of appropriate support services and programs; (2) increase the number of graduates in high-demand professions; (3) grow selected undergraduate and graduate programs; and (4) reduce the average time required for undergraduate students to matriculate. a.Transfer and Retention Task Forces. The University has tasked two separate groups with addressing transfer issues (discussed in 2. Articulation and Transfer) and retention issues. The Retention Task Force, appointed in Spring 2011 and continuing the success of the 2003 -05 task force (Retention P1ar, has formed four sub-committees -Connection and Engagement, Freshmen, Adults, and Sophomores-who will make recommendations to the Administration by the end of the Spring 2011 semester. b.Efforts to graduate more students in high demand professions College of Engineering: The College of Engineering has added a number of engineering and technology student career development programs, such as the new Designing Leaders and Research Apprenticeship Programs, which will greatly enhance retention and increase the appeal of graduates to industries and professional schools. College of Nursing and Allied Health Professions: The department continues to collaborate with the LA BOR through the Health Works Capitation program to accept 20 additional BSN students to the first clinical nursing course every fall and spring semester (this equates to a 20% overall increase in BSN clinical enrollment per academic year). The increase in the number of clinical spots will directly impact the number of future completers.9 c.Program Review. In Spring 2010, the Provost was charged with developing a process to identify existing programs which are no longer viable atUL Lafayette as well as recommending new program initiatives to support economic and workforce development. After significant faculty involvement, recommendations were made to the President who will seek UL System and Regents Board approval in Spring 2011. d.Efforts to reduce time to graduation. The institution has taken several actions in the last year to reduce time to graduation and increase the number of completers. o In response to an analysis that demonstrated that the number of course drops was the primary predictor of time to graduation, the Task Force on Course Withdrawals developed and presented a set of recommendations that were endorsed by the Committee on Academic Affairs and Standards, the Student Government Association, the Deans, and the President. By moving the last day to drop a course with a \"W\" from the11thweek to the8thweek of classes, students are forced to get serious about their classes much earlier in the semester. With interim grades available after the6thweek of classes, students have time to bring up their grades. The attached charts (Dro pDate Data) show the effect of moving the last day to drop classes earlier in the semester for Junior Division students. In Fall 2006 55% of Junior Division students dropped classes; in Fall 2010 23% of Junior Division students dropped classes. In addition, in Fall 2010 a limit on course withdrawals without incurring a fee for dropping was implemented. o In order for students to make progress toward completing their degrees, they must have year round access to the courses needed to facilitate that progress. During the 2009-10 academic year, the University hired additional faculty to teach difficult-to-schedule \"bottleneck courses' and significantly increased course offerings. The University had polled students to determine the courses most needed during the two summer terms and, based on their response, offered 16 sections during the Summer Intersession 2010, with a total student headcount of flearly 400. Because of additional salary incentives, the University was able to add a number of additional science labs and other difficult- to-schedule courses to the Summer 2010 class schedule. In Summer 2009, 366 courses were offered compared to 590 in Summer 2010. o To further increase the number of course offerings, the Academic Delivery Systems Task Force was charged with developing a plan to increase faculty participation in the Summer Session and grow enrollment during that term. The Task Force surveyed faculty and determined that low summer school pay was the major factor preventing more faculty participation in summer school. During 2009-20 10, the Subcommittee developed a plan to increase summer pay at all ranks to incentivize faculty. While budget issues prevented the implementation of the plan, in Spring 2011 the University, as a first step, initiated a summer plan that equalizes the currently lower summer pay per class with academic year adjunct pay per class. Faculty also expressed an interest in teaching online courses in the sunmier and such offerings have increased. Develop an academic center for student athletes to enhance their educational success (6.b.2.). In Fall 2008, the Student Athlete Academic Center (SAAC) piloted the Academic Coaching Program-a program in which at-risk student-athletes are assigned academic coaches who meet regularly with students to review assignments, schedule study sessions and monitor academic progress. For 2009-10, the number of student-athlete participants increased by 148% from the previous year (2008-09). Sixty percent (6 0%) of the student-athlete participants improved their semester GPA from the Fall 2009 semester to the Spring 2010 semester; and 58% from Spring 2010 to Fall 2010. Over 95% of the student-athlete participants indicated that they were satisfied with the Program's objectives and find the Program to be a valuable experience (Academic Coaches).10 1.b.i.

Student Success c.Develop partnerships with high schools to prepare students for postsecondary education. Narrative Report: examples of newly created partnerships In 2010-11 the University created new dual enrollment partnerships with Notre Dame High, West St. Mary High, Carencro High, and Vermilion Catholic High School to offer several courses on their campuses (New Dual Enrollment courses 2010-2011). The University is providing free tuition to teachers at Notre Dame and Vermilion Catholic, and will offer an independent study course this summer and free tuition for the Fall 2011 semester for the history teacher at Notre Dame High. examples of strengthening existing partnerships In an effort to strengthen our existing partnerships and create new opportunities, UL Lafayette currently offers free graduate tuition to local high school teachers in order for them to enroll in graduate courses to become SACS certified and allow us to train and hire them as instructors in the local high schools. Two local teachers are currently seeking graduate credit to become certified, and the University is seeking additional candidates. The University also offers continuing graduate education to local teachers through over $100,000 in annual scholarships to assist them in obtaining graduate degrees in Education and Educational leadership. The University offered support to Erath High by giving a stipend to help offset their textbook costs. The University does not currently charge a public school system for students wanting to take a second course as long as the first course was supported by Board of Regents funds. UL Lafayette participates in a broad variety of partnership programs with area secondary education institutions, aimed at preparing students for post- secondary education including: Dual Enrollment. The underlying principle of the University's High School Dual Enrollment program is to enroll only students who are projected to be qualified to enroll in UL Lafayette as first-time freshmen. In 2010-11 the University increased the total number of schools, students, and courses in the program (Eall 2010 HSDE and Spring 2011 HSDE). By 2010-11, the program had grown by 43% compared to 2008-09 and courses were offered on S high school campuses. Approximately 68% of UL Lafayette's Dual Enrollment students enroll as full time degree-seeking students upon completion of high school. While some participants are graduating from high school with just three college credit hours, some have completed as many as 20. Closely monitored student feedback from surveys is positive, as is feedback from professors teaching dual-enrolled students. In the future, students completing the program will participate in an exit briefing to assess their future plans, as well as their holistic view of the program. Based on the success of the program in the regional public schools, the University is also working with several private parochial and independent schools to incorporate this program in their high schools. The University signed its first formal articulation agreement with the Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts (LSMSA) providing equivalencies for thirty-four courses in August 2009. The agreement was renewed for the 2010-2011 academic year.:l3 GEAR UP. (Gainingarly Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Program) is funded by a grant written by the Lafayette Parish School System for six years that services six Lafayette middle schools: Scott, Acadian, Carencro, Judice, Lafayette, and N.P. Moss. It exposes students, teachers and families in GEARUP schools to academic expertise, resources and the diversity of university offerings. The partnership allows schools to link their offerings with university programs, ensuring that students are challenged by academically-rigorous programs and teachers are prepared to teach advanced material that creates a learning environment shaped by high expectations for all students. Enrichment programs will provide students with swmuer academics and an introduction to diverse programs to help students identify their interests and skills. (GEAR UP MOU) Talent Search. The Educational Talent Search (ETS) Program at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette helps students (ages 11-27) complete high school and enroll in the post secondary education institution of their choice. ETS also helps high school dropouts reenter the educational system to complete their education. There are two components of the program. Talent Search one has a minimum of 1000 students and Talent Search 2 has a minimum of 600 students. Annual Performance Reports from September 1, 2009 - August 31, 2010 for the Talent Search 1 and Talent Search 2 Programs include targeted schools listed for each project. Talent Search and Talen Search) Upward Bound. The Upward Bound I and II are college enrichment programs offered by UL Lafayette for high school students ages 15-19 who share an interest and aptitude for obtaining a college degree. Upward Bound I has served 103 students per year since 2008, from three parishes (Lafayette, St.Landry & St. Martin) and 10 schools (Carencro High, Acadiana High, Northside High, St. Martinville High, Cecilia High, Breaux Bridge High, Beau Chene High, Opelousas Senior High, North Central High, Northwest High). Upward Bound II program has served 60 students per year since 2008, from 2 parishes (Vermilion and Iberia) and 4 schools (Abbeville High, Jeanerette High, Westgate High, and New Iberia Senior High. Upward Bound-Math Science. The Upward Bond Math Science Program helps high school students from low-income families to strengthen math and science skills so that they can complete the core necessary to enroll in college. Beginning at ULL in 2007 and serving 50 students annually at eight high schools, to date, the program has served 66 dents and has a retention rate of 90%. examples of feedback reports to high schools Dual enrollment program. The University provides high schools with an official enrollment report after the14thclass date which includes the course name, time and days offered, instructor, and credit hours of all students in the program. We also report any student that withdraws from the program as well as students' interim and final grades. An official transcript is mailed to all high schools upon completion of every semester. General feedback report. In Spring 2011, a committee was charged with developing and implementing a more formal comprehensive feedback report to high schools for all purposes, not just dual enrollment. The draft report (Lafayette High) will be finalized in Spring 2011. examples of the types of progress that will be tracked to evaluate the partnerships and demonstrate student readiness (e.g. increase in the number of students participating in dual enrollment opportunities, increase in the number of students taking a high school core curriculum, reduction in need for developmental courses, increase in ACT scores). Currently, the University tracks student retention to degree seeking status as well as first semester GPA, hours attempted and earned for all dual enrollment students. Second and third year retention rates as well as graduation rates are also tracked. Data is then compared to our overall first time freshman data and retention information. Fall 2010 average hours enrolled per student was 15;average hours completed was 14.20 (Dual Enrollment GRAD Act). The average Fall 2010 GPA was 2.95 while the average GPA for regularly admitted students was 2.43 on 11.74 hours. The committee generating the feedback report will also develop recommendations to collect data to analyze and evaluate the success of other partnerships.14 1.c.i.

Student Success d. Increase passage rates on licensure and certification exams and workforce foundational skills. Additional Information: The University is proactive in promoting increased passage rates on licensure and certification exams. A discussion of initiatives implemented by each of the reporting departments follows. Athletic Training. The pass rate of 13.33% for 2009-10 is not typical. The overall pass rate for the June 2007-February 2011 exam period is 36% (BOC Rert). Since the ATE? program applied for re-accreditation in 2008, several changes have been implemented in the curriculum to address areas in which students expressed weaknesses. Several lab components have been added to courses where students have previously experienced weakness in content mastery. We have also been actively encouraging our students to take the exam as soon as possible as a trend has been seen with lower scores when longer periods of time lapse after completing the curriculum. Content in two required courses addresses the SOC exam. oKNES 437, Clinical Experiences in Athletic Training IV, is taken in the fall semester of the senior year. This course provides students with a review of topics covered on the SOC exam such as anatomy, evaluation and assessment, rehab techniques, evidenced based practice (research, article reviews, and incorporating evidence into daily practice in treating injuries). oKNES 438, Clinical Experiences in Athletic Training V, taken in the spring semester of the senior year, is a capstone course where student purchase a textbook entitled \"Athletic Training Exam Review\" which specifically provides a thorough review for the BOC exam. Students in this course are also provided with instructions on how to register for the SOC exam, with the expectation that they take the test in their last semester of coursework, The class provides a detailed review of position statements that are part of BOC, such as how to treat different injuries as advised by NATA (treating the diabetic athlete, athletes with asthma, cardiac conditions, heat illnesses, etc.). ATEP students also have the opportunity to take a mock BOC exam which is hosted at one of the six ATEP schools in Louisiana. Dietetics. The Dietetics Program has a comprehensive plan (Dietetics Pass Rates) for increasing student pass rates on the exam. Praxis. The Department of Curriculum and lnstruction Value Added (VA) Steering Committee examined candidate needs and decided to add a READ 318 -(Reading in the Language Arts) for our Alternative Certification candidates seeking elementary certification. Prior to this decision, no language arts methods course was included in the alternative certification prescription. The Committee and subcommittees have reviewed the requirements of students in public schools (state testing) and reviewed our courses to make sure we are providing opportunities for our candidates to learn the essential elements of the knowledge and skills they must teach to their future students. The Department has purchased hard copies of Praxis Preparation books for candidates to use to familiarize themselves with the types of questions and content that could appear on the exam. Online Praxis Practice Tests are available and the Materials Center in Maxim Doucet has computer stations so candidates can access these materials while on campus. Due to our NCATE accreditation requirements, our courses are designed to meet both NCATE and SPA standards for each program offered in the Curriculum and Instruction Department. Within our teaching methods courses we have crafted our objectives to be task driven emphasizing the type of material our16 candidates need to know, understand and be able to do as a teacher. The Praxis test measures candidates' preparedness for teaching in the areas of content and principles of teaching and learning. Our candidates have a 100% pass rate. Health Information Management. UL Lafayette Health Information Management (HIM) faculty members prepare the students by conducting extensive review sessions during their final semester(Revjew Session). In 2008-09 the national pass average was 69% while UL Lafayette's pass rate was 73%; in 2009-10 the national pass rate was 78% while UL Lafayette's rate was 93%. While the pass rate is dependent on a number of factors (how soon after the review sessions students take the exam, the strength of the graduating class, the level of difficulty of the exam, etc.), faculty do feel that the extensive review session is a significant contributor to students' success. In addition, faculty prepare a comprehensive exam which mirrors the actual RHIA exam. This comprehensive exam is helpful to students in pointing out areas where more preparation is needed prior to scheduling the actual exam. APRN. In previous years, the certification exam pass rate for UL Lafayette master's program graduates was lOO'. In the Fall 2009 to Spring 2010 academic year, that rate dropped to 91.6% with one student not being successful on the first attempt of the certification exam. The Graduate Program coordinator will continue to monitor certification exam pass rates and if the benchmark of 100% is not met for this next academic year, a curriculum- wide assessment will be completed with ULL's consortium partners. BSN Program. As in previous years, the NCLEX pass rate for UL Lafayette graduates was well above state and national pass rates. However, the department has set a benchmark of 95-100% NCLEX success, and 2010 pass rates were below this benchmark. To increase pass rates, the department is planning or has already implemented several strategies: 1.A complete curriculum-wide assessment program has been adopted for upper division nursing students. Beginning with Nursing 308, students take nationally standardized assessments in the course content that was covered in that semester. Both individual and aggregate data is reported. This data will be used to assist students in planning individual strategies for NCLEX success as well as allowing course instructors access to assessment data to plan needed course revisions. In addition, remediation will be offered in each course for students who do not meet the level 2 benchmark. 2.As of Fall 2011, only the first 2 KNEA (Kinesiology Activity) courses taken will be used to calculate the GPA for eligibility to apply to Nursing 208. Retrospective analysis of graduates who were not successful on the NCLEX revealed that a majority of them had taken between 4 and 13 KNEA courses to raise their GPA for eligibility. 3.Evaluation of the appeals process for students who do not meet academic requirements has resulted in more consistency in how the appeals committee approaches these cases. 4.As of Fall 2011, Nursing 420 students will have an assignment that will require them to do a self-evaluation of their All assessments and submit a success plan for the NCLEX.17 1dJ.

Phase in increased admission standards and other necessary policies by the end of the 2012 Fiscal Year in order to increase student retention and graduation rates for transfer students. Policy/policies adopted by the management board Admissions standards. The Fall 2010 admission standards for transfer students originated in the Master Plan for Public Postsecondary Education: 2001 IThe UL System Board of Supervisors took the lead in increasing admission standards, tightening admission exceptions and strengthening transfer student expectations for_FalL2Ol 1 with Flard actfon in October 2009. Admission by exception. Students, including transfer students, who do not meet the criteria for Guaranteed Admission but do have a 2.0 GPA will be considered individually for Admission by Exception. For 2009-11, seven percent of students, calculated from the entering freshman class, may be admitted by exception (Admission The Regents admissions criteria for 2012 specify that, six percent of students, calculated from the previous year's entering freshman class, may be admitted by exception. Credit hours required for degree. In Spring 2010, the ULS Council of Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs endorsed a System-wide 120 hour degree requirement and tasked their university provosts to pare down the number of hours required to earn a four year degree at their eight universities. The Board of Regents revised the total credit hours required for degree in August of 2010 specifying that the total number of credit hours required for a baccalaureate degree shall be 120 hours unless otherwise required for accreditation and/or professional certification purposes. In those cases where a degree program must exceed 120 hours, it shall first be submitted to the UL System Office for review and aDproval. Subsequent policy/policies adopted by the institution Admissions standards. Both the Fall 2010 and Fall 2011 UL Lafayette admissions policies for transfer students conform to the System requirements. The University is also on track to implement Fall 2012 BOR requirements for first-time freshmen and transfer students. Admission by exception. Both the Fall 2010 and Fall 2011 UL Lafayette standards for admission by exception conform to the System requirements. Credit hours required for degree. The University's Strategic Plan, section 2.3.6, addresses the need to \"reduce the average time required for undergraduate students to graduate.\" During the Fall 2010 semester, virtually all curricula on campus were reduced from their prior total required credit hours of 124-129 to 120 effective for Fall 2011. The only exceptions are in a few degree programs such as Engineering in which an accrediting body's regulations prohibit reduction to 120 hours. Timeline for implementing policy/policies Fall 2011 UL System standards for admission and admission by exception with regard to transfer students as well as credit hours required for degree will be implemented in Fall 2011. Fall 2012 Regents standards for admission and admission by exception will be implemented in Fall 2012.20 performance of entering transfer students admitted by exception (4-year universities). Mentoring Program. Students admitted by committee are required to participate in the Mentoring Program and their performance (Mentoring Progrm Fall 2010.pdf) is monitored. oFor Fall 2010, transfer students admitted by committee on average had a 2.3 cumulative college GPA while regularly admitted transfer students had a 2.6-2.7 cumulative GPA (Fall 2010 Transfer Students). Students admitted by committee transfer on average 51 credit hours while regularly admitted transfer students transfer on average 67 credit hours. Transfer students admitted by committee earned a passing grade in 81% of their Fall 2010 classes compared to 86% for regularly admitted transfer students. (FAO9 THRU FA 10 Performance) oOur goal with transfer students admitted by committee is to provide them with the necessary support to assist them in performing at the same level of regular admits. Persistence from first to second semester for transfer students admitted by committee is just above 90%, while persistence rate for regularly admitted transfer students is approximately 83%. Persistence from first fall semester to second fall semester is generally ten percentage points less for both groups. ciOne recommendation we are making effective FaIl 2011 is to require all entering students (transfer or first-time freshmen) needing developmental Math to participate in math tutoring at least two times per week. Additional Information The University's Strategic Plan 2.3.2 focuses on increasing retention rates as a means of increasing graduation rates for all students and particularly for \"transfer, at-risk, non-traditional and underrepresented students through the nurturing of appropriate support services and programs.\" Below is a brief discussion of selected programs which contribute to student success and retention including transfer students. oSupplemental instruction (SI). The SI Program for freshman students in challenging courses offers biltri-weekly tutoring sessions facilitated by an SI tutor in which students compare notes, discuss readings and develop organizational tools. SI tutors are students who have previously done well in the course and who attend all class lectures, take notes, conduct SI sessions, and offer office hours. Results (Supplemental Instruction) show that on average students attending SI sessions receive up to one letter grade higher than those in the same class who did not attend SI For Fall 2010, attendees made 2973 visits to the Learning Center earning average grades 10.9% higher than those for non-attendees. The greatest impact was in Math 140 (PreCalculus Algebra and Trigonometry) where grades of attendees were 21.4% higher than those of non-attendees. Also noteworthy were results in BIOL 220 (Survey of Anatomy and Physiology); students who came to at least 5sessions had an average grade of 76.77%; those who came to 10 an 80.5%; and those who came to at 20 earned an average grade of 83.84%. oAcademic Success Center (ASC). The ASC (Academic Success Center websitei is an academic support center designed to assist students in their pursuit of academic success. ASC counselors are the assigned academic advisors for at-risk students, including students admitted by committee. and meet with students to identify problem areas and develop action plans to assist them in returning to good academic standing. The Learning Center offers academic support services including individual and online tutoring, study groups, and computer labs. In Fall 2010, 11,812 student visits were logged into the ASC for academic counseling, advising, Career Counseling Center and the Learning Center (Learning Center).21 2.a.i. 1st to 2nd year retention rate of baccalaureate degree-seeking transfer students (Tracked) _____________Baseline Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Year 6 Term of Data AY 0809* AY 0910* AY 10-11 08 and Summer 09, respectively 2.a.ii.

Provide feedback to community colleges and technical college campuses on the performance of associate degree recipients enrolled at the institution. Narrative report: examples of new or strengthened feedback reports to the college(s) There hasbeen a significant increase in communication between UL Lafayette and SLCC in 20 10-11. University staff and administrators including the Interim Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, the Director of Enrollment Management, the Director of Academic Planning and Development and the Transfer Coordinator have met this spring with SLCC officials for a series of discussions on cooperative arrangements between the institutions. Effective for Fall 2011, the University will provide SLCC with an annual performance report (E) that will track each fall's cohort of transfer students and provide information such as semester gpa, semester hours attempted, semester hours earned, number of students who graduated and the degrees earned. We will also assess performance and identify areas where improvement is needed processes in place to identify and remedy student transfer issues Transfer Task Force: Increasing the number and success of transfer students is a strategic imperative of the University. In order to accomplish this initiative a Transfer Student Task Force was formed in February 2011. The Task Force consists of a diverse group of administrators, faculty, staff and students all committed to improving the transfer process. The task force is co-chaired by the Director of Enrollment Services and the Interim Director, Office of Academic Planning and Faculty Development. It should be noted that as part of our continuing partnership with S LCC two members of the task force are from that institution. The Transfer Task Force has been charged with reviewing and making recommendations in four major areas: 1.Recruitment - Review recruitment trends for the past three years and identify primary feeders to 2 &4 year; establish transfer recruitment goals and recommend strategies to increase recruitment of transfer students. 2.Admissions - Review the admission process for transfer students, identify barriers in the admissions process and recommend strategies to improve the admission of transfer students. 3.Persistence/Retention - Review persistence/retention data for transfer students and identify strategies to meet established persistence and graduation goals for transfer students. 4.Support Services - Identify existing services for transfer students in the areas of Advising, Financial Aid, Scholarships, Orientation, Housing and Academic Success and to recommend improvement to these services where indicated. One of the first issues identified by the Transfer Task Force was that members did not have a clear understanding of how the transfer process at UL Lafayette actually works. Since different offices are involved in the process at differing points, we needed to get a clear understanding of the process. A Task Force member was asked to do an analysis of the transfer process. Over a period of approximately 3-4 weeks he met with staff of every office24 involved in the transfer process and conducted a survey of task force members to discern their thoughts about various offices serving transfer students. Recently, he reported his findings to the Transfer Task Force producing a flow map of the UL Lafayette transfer process (Transfer flow Chart) as well as a Transfer Student Process document. As a result of the Transfer Task Force's recommendations, a Transfer Student Workgroup was established to prioritize the list of recommendations and assist in indentifying resources needed to get them accomplished. The workgroup members will be identified by May 1, 2011, and will begin working over the Summer 2011, Timelines for completing the recommendations will be established by the workgroup and the Vice President for Enrollment Management. Transfer website. Transfer students are an important part of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette community, and we are committed to ensuring that they have a successful transition. Current and potential transfer students are kept informed through a dedicated portion of the Academic Success Center website as well as at UL Lafayette's Transfer News. The University has invested in a Customer Relationship Management software package, Hobsons, to assist us in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our communications with prospective students. Prospective students, including transfer students, have the ability to create their own personal homepage or VIP page which contains University information relative to their interests and intended major. Once they create their personal VIP page, the prospective student becomes part of our integrated communications stream and will receive scheduled information about the University, their major' college and other important University information relative to their interests via mail, e-mail and on their VIP page. Transfer Orientation. As part of the transition process, all new transfer students are required to attend a one-day Transfer Student Orientation program designed to assist them with understanding our university culture, academic programs, and the transfer credit articulation process, as well as familiarizing them with our campus. During Orientation, students have the opportunity to meet with college deans and members of our faculty, meet other incoming students, learn about university resources discuss the transfer credit articulation process, and, if needed, meet with an academic advisor in preparation of registering for classes. Agreements with SLCC. r The University has agreed to provide semester training to SLCC faculty advisors and academic advisors to provide a smooth transfer process to SLCC students. University staff will inform SLCC staff each semester of scheduled Fall and Spring advisor trainings at UL Lafayette for faculty and staff. A listing of current online advisor trainin_g is available to SLCC personnel. Better trained advisors will give the most up-to- date information to students and prevent transfer problems later in the process. In Spring 2011, the University and SLCC agreed that the University should have a consistent presence on the SLCC Campus the first Wednesday of each month from 9:30 am - 12:30 pm beginning on April 6, 2011, in order to assist students with transfer issues. An additional visit each month will be determined at the beginning of each semester > The University will publish information sheets for SLCC students with important transfer dates and registration timelines. > In Fall 2010 we continued our UL Lafayette Transfer Day on the campus of SLCC where students interested in attending the University get important information. Offices represented are Admissions, Financial Aid, Scholarships and an academic college representative from the most demanded majors. SLCC students are able to apply for admissions at this event. Those who apply on that day will have the admissions application fee waived. SLCC students are able to bring their grade transcripts to this event and receive an on-the-spot evaluation.25 2.b.i. 1st to 2nd year retention rate of those who transfer in with an associate degree from any two-year institution.

Narrative report: examples of the agreements with Louisiana institutions The University has drafted a MOU with SLCC (MOU) to enter a collaborative relationship specifically to facilitate the referral of students denied admission to UL Lafayette to SLCC. Currently, we refer to SLCC (Letter to Students) local students who have been denied admission by the committee. We will change the criteria for referral for the Fall 2012 entering freshman class because of the change in admission standards. The referral criteria has not been established for the Fall 2012 freshman class at this time. We will also be establishing referral agreements with LSUE, Delgado Community College and BRCC because we receive a significant number of applications from prospective students coming from these areas. We also refer students who are placed on academic suspension to SLCC to reduce dropouts and stop-outs. .processes in place to identify and refer these students. In the past two years, we have identified students who were denied, applied through the admission-by-committee process, and received a denial from the committee. Local students who are denied admission to UL Lafayette receive both the letter and a brochure (Brochure I and Brochure 2) provided by SLCC. We advise the student that if their ultimate educational goal is to earn at least a bachelor's degree at UL Lafayette they should attend SLCC oranother community college, earn at least 18 college credits with at least a 2.25 cumulative GPA and complete required developmental courses. Once this is accomplished they can then re-apply to UL Lafayette.27 2.c.i. Number of students referred at anytime during the given academic year to two-year colleges and technical colleges.

This is a new process started in Spring 2010. Referrals were sent in Spring 2010 and Fall 2010. When students are denied admission, they have the option to apply for consideration through the admission-by committee process. We do not want to refer students who may apply to the committee for additional consideration. That is why we only refer students who were also denied by the committee. We are discussing the establishment of a minimum criteria for referral to the committee for consideration. If a prospective freshman does not meet the proposed minimum criteria, they will be immediately referred to their local community college.28 2. Articulation and Transfer d. Demonstrate collaboration in implementing articulation and transfer requirements provided in R.S. 17:3161 through 3169. Narrative report: examples of collaboration in implementing all aspects of the transfer degree programs, Louisiana Transfer Associate Degree (AALT, ASLT)* and Associate of Science in Teaching (AST) programs During the Fall 2010 semester, the Director of Enrollment Services at UL Lafayette in partnership with the Dean of Students at SLCC, developed and implemented a new activity, Transfer Connection. The purpose of Transfer Connection \"is to increase outreach and presence of UL Lafayette on SLCC campuses; to provide on-site advising, transcript evaluation (unofficial) and admission to qualified SLCC students; and to provide information about academic programs and scholarships to SLCC students.\" Transfer Connection was a three-day event held November 17th - 18th at the SLCC main campus and November 22w' at the SLCC New Iberia campus. In order to inform SLCC students about the Transfer Connection a specifically designed postcard was mailed to every SLCC student. Approximately, 89 students participated in the Transfer Connection. Information on the LA transfer degrees was a significant component of Transfer Connection. Plans are underway to both hold the program again for the current spring semester and continually broaden the cooperation and facilitation of transfer students between UL Lafayette and SLCC. For example, the newly formed Transfer Student Task Force is already working on additional components to the Transfer Connection, UL Lafayette is continuing to increase our presence on the SLCC campus. The UL Lafayette President, Interim Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, and Vice President for Enrollment Management met with the Chancellor of SLCC on February 2, 2011, to discuss various cooperative endeavors. These included the process of updating and publicizing articulation and 2+2 agreements (2 - 2 Agreements) including the Transfer Associate degrees; increasing the presence of UL Lafayette transfer advisors on the SLCC campus; providing access to UL Lafayette sporting events, lectures, and cultural activities for SLCC students; providing training sessions for SLCC advisors to ensure that accurate information is provided to students; and other joint ventures in the areas of administration and human resources. Beginning in April 2011, UL Lafayette's Transfer Coordinator will be increasing her visits to SLCC and LSU-E to twice a month. The Transfer Coordinator already attends College Recruitment Day each semester at SLCC and LSU-E. Sharing information about the transfer degrees with students will be a primary responsibility of the Coordinator. The Transfer office also publishes a Transfer News flyer annually (Iransfer News). The most significant work in the area of articulation was done cooperatively by two and four-year institutions in designing the universal Transfer AA and AS degrees to accommodate the Louisiana Transfer Degree Guarantee Program. These degrees will allow a student from a community college to enter UL Lafayette (and other UL System universities) with junior standing and no credits lost in 13 degree tracks including Arts, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, English, History, ITECH, Journalism, Math, Music, Physics, Psychology, and Sociology. The transfer degree advising templates were created with the assistance of the Advising Coordinators in the respective academic colleges from within the University. Successful completion of the required courses should allow for a seamless transfer of credit for all students that complete the Louisiana Transfer Degree. Templates are29 provided. The University plans to increase the offerings in the future. UL Lafayette also is party to the transferrable Associate of Science in Teaching, which articulates with the baccalaureate program in Elementary Education Grades 1 through 5. .processes in place to remedy any articulation and transfer issues as they relate to the AALT, ASLT, or AST degrees. The Louisiana Transfer Degree webpage was created and added to the University transfer student information tab on the Academic Success Center webpage. The Louisiana Transfer Degree webpage consists of Advisor Resources, Frequently Asked Questions, a link to the UL Lafayette General Education Requirements, and a link to the Louisiana Board of Regents Articulation Matrix. University contact information is also available. It should be noted that currently our major feeder schools, SLCC and LSU-E, do not offer the AST degree.30 2.d.iii. 1st to 2nd year retention rate of those who transfer with AALT, ASLT, or AST degrees (Descriptive) Baseline Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Term of Data AY 08-09 AY 09-10 AY 10-11 AY 11-12 AY1243 AY 13-14 # of transfer 0 0 0 degree students enrolled # retained to next Fall semestero 0 0% 0%0 Rate 0%Year6 - AY 14-15 2.d.iv.

Eliminate academic programs offerings that have low student completion rates as identified by the Board of Regents or are not aligned with current or strategic workforce needs of the state, region, or both as identified by the Louisiana Workforce Commission. Narrative Report: a description of the institution's current review processes to identify academic programs that have low student completion rates or are not aligned with current or strategic workforce needs oIn Spring 2010, thePresident directed the Provost to lead a comprehensive review of UL Lafayette's academic programs. At the outset of the process during the Summer of 2010, academic deans were asked to review all within their respective colleges and prioritize their programs based on criteria they devised. To facilitate the review process, Dr. Landry created an Academic Affairs work group which did the bulk of the data gathering and program analysis. ln addition, in September 2010, Dr. Landry created an advisory body that consisted of faculty representing each college on campus and the library. Dr. Landry met with the advisory group regularly during the review, and they were instrumental in devising the criteria used in evaluating programs, as well as the relative importance of the respective criteria. This group communicated with faculty in their areas seeking input on criteria and their relative importance. Communication with faculty regarding the review process was augmented by the President's blog, the Academic Affairs e-newsletter, and briefings of the Faculty Senate. For the review, Dr. Landry consulted the published work of other university faculty and administrators on the subject of program review and academic unit restructuring. The criteria used for the review were derived from these sources as well as from our faculty advisory group and the Academic Affairs review team. The Academic Affairs team did an initial categorization of academic degree programs and concentrations into five categories ranging range from the programs that in the Team's judgment are most viable and important to the institution to those in which the Team found a number of concerns and issues that speak to the need to revise, reconstitute or terminate them. Following deliberation on the input by faculty, additional data mining, and reconsideration of the original conclusions, Dr. Landry's team offered several recommendations to President Savoie in January 2011 regarding program discontinuance and reorganizations. In April 2011, the President forwarded a package of termination and consolidations to the System Board. The Team also recommended a formal ongoing program review process, and the Faculty Senate supported the creation of a permanent Program Review Committee. o In terms of the Regents low completer review, the Academic Affairs Team working with appropriate deans and department heads made the determinations as to which programs should be terminated, terminated & consolidated, and continued and submitted the required reports on February 21, 2011, based on the data gathered in the Program Review. As a result of the low completer review (low completer proposals), 21 programs have been recommended for termination or termination & consolidation, and 2 new consolidated programs proposed. a description of the institution's collaboration efforts with the LWC and LED to identify academic programs that are aligned with current or strategic workforce needs oEvery form of program review takes into consideration regional and state-wide occupational demand for graduates as well as supply created by our own and other higher ed programs. Examples of alterations triggered by such reviews include the proposed elimination in Spring 2011 of our B.S.32 in Fashion Design and Merchandising, completely aborting the design component due to low occupational demand and reorganizing the merchandising component into a retailing framework in the College of Business. This recommendation was founded on data suggesting many merchandising majors were employed as managers of retail settings, and that the provision of more business courses would strengthen their occupational preparation and career success. o Similarly Louisiana Workforce Commission Workforce Investment Board data (OccWageData) stimulated realignments in our Dietetics and in our Health Information Management programs to better fulfill the need for positions in 11-9111 (Medical and Health Services Managers). oUL Lafayette faculty and administrators played a major role in Acadiana's presentation of its \"Blue Ocean\" regional assets during the LED visit to the area on January 18, 2011. Organized by Acadiana Economic Development, our participation was representative of our ongoing and regular interactions and collaborations with economic development organizations and the local technical school and community college. An example is Lafayette Economic Development Authority's (LEDA) engagement in and support of the December 2010 approved degree program in Moving image Arts, a program that will develop critically-demanded labor force in the digital media industry, a key Blue Ocean sector. Enrollment in this program has already far exceeded our projections. LEDA and UL Lafayette are further collaborating on the development of studio space, incubation opportunities for digital media start-ups, and support for pre-collegiate training programs in gaming. a description of how the institution has worked to modify or initiate new programs that meet current or strategic future workforce needs of the state and/or region oAs a result of Program Review in 2010-li and supported by LWC occupational data, UL Lafayette is pursuing the creation of two new \"Schools\" within the Ray P. Authement College of Sciences: the School of Geosciences (founded in the NSF Advisory Committee for Geosciences' October 2009 white paper entitled \"Geovision Report\"), and the School of Computing and Informatics. As envisioned, the School of Geosciences would subsume the administration of several related programs, including Geology, GiS, and natural resource management. Additional relationships may be established with instruction in Surveying, Geography, and Sociology. The School of Computing and Informatics would subsume the administration of the undergraduate degree program in Computer Science, the Center for Advanced Computer Studies, the new UNIV 200 course (a Gen Ed course completely overhauled based on assurance of learning and assessment results, as well as on employer surveys identifying worker skill deficiencies and needs), and a newly designed degree in informatics degree replacing the existing M.I,S. degree based on workforce demands. o In response to the FIRST Louisiana Science and Technology Plan framework emphasizing the need to educate students outside of the confined traditional silos, UL Lafayette has initiated significant efforts to create more interdisciplinary programs. To this end, a task force was created in Spring 2011 to create alternative enriching options for students who fmd their career success will be contingent upon expertise in several domains, including positions in core industry sectors such as energy and environment. oOther 2010-11 initiatives to meet strategic workforce needs include: (a) enhanced resource allocation to the creation of distance learning courses in high occupational demand areas across the state (e.g., Health Promotion and Weilness); (b) a series of individual meetings held with the Dean of the Graduate School and the Assistant VP for Institutional Planning and Effectiveness and each grad program coordinator and department head to discuss regional employer demand for graduate certificates; (c) the continuing use of graduate exit and employer surveys and advisory boards to inform curriculum structure and content (!jt); and (d) partnering with \"cultural economy\" agencies such as The Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL) and Lafayette Consolidated Government's Le Centre International to explore integrative initiatives such as offering a French-language media dubbing and translation track, or creating an international lab school. Such initiatives are cultural in nature but critical to the economic vitality of this region as required in Senate Bill 800 of the 2010 Legislative Session.33 3.a.i.

Increase use of technology for distance learning to expand educational offerings. Narrative Report: Description of current initiatives to improve technology for distance learning Introduction: Jn Spring 2010, the University hired its first Director of Distance Learning to \"champion, manage, andcoordinate all distance learning initiatives providing vision and direction for the University.\" He, in turn, appointed the Distance Learning Leadership Council (DLLC) who is charged with advising and providing counsel to the Director throughout the development and implementation of an action agenda for expanding the institution's distance learning capacity and production, Jn that same semester a Vision for the University with five accompanying objectives was developed as well as definitions and other policies and procedures. Included in the University's Strategic Plan Imperative 3 - Facilitating quality teaching and learning is 3B \"to enhance the classroom experience\" by continuing to \"pursue learning-oriented IT infrastructure opportunities.\" In Spring 2010, the newly hired Director of Distance Learning and the DLCC formed task forces to focus on each of the initiatives necessary to grow the University's distance learning program. A summary of actions to date follows. aLearning Management System: In Summer 2010, Moodle, the University's LMS was upgraded to version 1.9+ and supported by four servers and a load balancer to more effectively manage user traffic. The LMS Task Force submitted and was awarded a STEP (Student Technology Enhancement Program) grant for the upgrade of existing Moodle hardware and software to include the addition of a media server. In Fall 2010 an outsourced Moodle solution by Moodlerooms, Inc., Joule, was piloted by 22 faculty. In addition to face-to-face Moodle training, two additional modules have been added and are being offered in Spring 2011 with plans to convert all four modules to online delivery. Beginning in Spring 2011, the Office of Moodle Support automatically created course shells for all courses in the semester thus promoting increased use of the LMS. The Moodle 2.0 software course pilot is scheduled for Fall 2011 with an expanded pilot in Spring 2012 and full integration over Summer 2012. oEDUTooIs: Task force members researched three tools for purchase by the Office of Distance Learning (Web conferencing, Lecture Capture, and Pod/Video Casting). In Fall 2010, Elluminate, UL Lafayette's sponsored web-conferencing solution with 2 rooms of 50 seats available for reservation, was purchased. E-instructors who want to host synchronous events with their classes may schedule use of one of UL Lafayette's Web-Conferencing rooms. Twenty-four faculty received training to use all the features of the room. Jncreased reservations and use of these classrooms have been documented for the Winter 2010 intersession and Spring 2011 semester. In Spring 2011, the Task Force researched the benefits of E-Books and systems for E-book acquisition as well as developing a proposal for a Center for Faculty Excellence in E-Learning. A Pilot of Proctor U Virtual proctonng service with one nursing class is underway with plans to expand in Summer 2011. oProfessional development: In Spring 2010 and Fall 2010, faculty members were offered extensive training in Quality Matters (35 faculty and administrators completed training; additional training is scheduled for Spring 2011) and Moodle, Faculty may choose from a series of presentations and demonstrations of computer software and resources on topics such as online file management, social networks, online productivity, blogging and Twitter, communication resources, class content post production, mobile computing, and creative practical applications (see ULearn Calendar) o In addition, through Fall 2010 and Spring 2011 the Director of Distance Learning offered three online courses for faculty-Introduction to Online Learning; Instructor Introduction to Online Learning; and Course Design Practicum.35 Description of current initiatives to create and expand educational offerings by distance education Another element of Strategic Imperative 3B in the Strategic Plan is to \"offer distance learning to select markets and assure high quality delivery.\" Professional development. Professional development is important to creatively expanding educational offerings. UL Lafayette's Office of Distance and Electronic Learning provides technical and instructional design assistance to faculty as needed during the development and delivery of any electronic course. The Cajun Academy for Faculty Excellence (CAFE) is the faculty professional development unit within the Office of Distance and Electronic Learning. CAFE provides appropriate instructional sequences for faculty wishing to web-enhance and/or blend their courses as well as those with the desire to develop hybrid and/or online courses. CAFE training options available on the ULearn calendar are appropriate for faculty members with all levels of technological expertise. The CAFE Task Force has developed a framework for required faculty training and course certification. Electronic courses must be designed to meet the essential standards of the Quality Matters Rubric; the first courses were certified in Spring 2011. Course development initiatives. The development of distance learning courses requires significant time investment from faculty. A Faculty Incentives Task Force developed a plan for financial and non-financial incentives for faculty members who develop and teach new e-learning courses. In Fall 2010 43 course design proposals competed for 10 stipends of $2500. In Spring 2011, an additional 10 stipends were awarded for courses to be developed for Fall 2011 and Spring 2012. To date, supported course development has focused on general education courses and graduate courses. There has been a significant increase om rative Offerin ) in the number of hybrid and online courses offered at the University outside of those that have been funded. In Spring 2011, the Faculty Incentive Task Force recommended that the development and maintenance of distance learning courses should be an element in annual faculty evaluation considerations. Program development initiatives. In 2010-11 the Program Development, Deployment, and Evaluation Action Team reviewed the Noel Levitz study conducted for UL Lafayette to identify niche programs for online and/or hybrid delivery. To date two programs have been identified for online delivery. The UL System and the Board of Regents have approved UL Lafayette's Graduate Program in Gifted Education for online delivery. A request is in process at both bodies to approve an online Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology with a concentration in Health Promotion and Weilness. This program will serve as the lead program for a substantive change with SACS-COC. In addition, the University is participating in the University of Louisiana System Online Business Degree initiative offered through CALL (Center for Adult Learning in Louisiana). Description of any efficiencies realized through distance education Because the University's coordinated distance learning effort is just over one year old, it is difficult to project savings at this point. However, it can be estimated that in 09-10, a bit over 32,000 square feet of space (38 classrooms) was available to offer additional face-to-face classes in disciplines where there had been a critical shortage, thus decreasing time to graduation. Certainly in the future we can track efficiencies resulting from the ability to reach additional students without using already limited physical space. This will further be facilitated by a space study to be completed in Spring 2011. As the e-learning enterprise expands, the University can minimize instructional costs through the use of adjuncts that do not require benefits. For example, an instructor in English is developing a course to be offered online in Fall 2011. While her salary and benefits per class is approximately $5,500, properly trained adjuncts can later teach the designed course for $2,000. Higher level courses traditionally offered by ranked faculty will save additional dollars. In addition, the University can generate revenue from increased electronic course offerings during traditional periods when the University is closed or has a reduced face-to-face course selection (Summer and Intersessions), again contributing to reduced time to graduation.3.b.i.

Increase research productivity especially in key economic development industries and technology transfer at institutions to levels consistent with the institution's peers. Narrative Report: As described throughout this section of the narrative, research and development activities atthe University of Louisiana at Lafayette have had a significant andbroad-based impact on economic development and technology transfer throughout the region andstate. Guided by the Louisiana Board of Regent's FIRST Louisiana Science and Technology Plan and the Blue Ocean Initiative of the LED, the university is committed tocontinue towork with industrial partners and economic development entities throughout the state to align our research and development activities with Louisiana's key and targeted industries. 'a description of current and prospective research productivity and technology transfer as it relates to Louisiana's key economic development industries One standard indicator of research productivity is research and development expenditures as measured by the National Science Foundation. As reported to the National Science Foundation Higher Education Research and Development Survey for Fiscal Year 2010, over 69 million dollars was expended at the University of Louisiana a Lafayette from all sources (federal, state and local government; nonprofit organizations; business and industry; and institutional funds) in support of research and development activities. Of this amount, over 45million dollars (or 65%) was spent in research and development activities related to Core Industry Sectors identified in the Louisiana Board of Regents FIRST Louisiana Science and Technology Plan. Since a comprehensive description of all projects related to Core Industry Sectors is not practical given space limitations, a few (2 to 3) examples of externally sponsored projects related to each core sector is provided below. Examples of Funded Projects in the Core Industry Sector: Agriculture and Wood Products In the USDA funded project, Development of Chioroplast Transformation Vectors to Engineer Cotton with Resistance to A. Flavus, Dr. Caryl Chlan (Department of Biology) and her research team are working with Southern Regional Research Laboratories of USDA to develop chioroplast vectors to engineer cotton with genes to confer enhanced resistance to A. jlavus. A variety of approaches are being used to effectively eliminate or decrease aflatoxin levels in cotton to meet increasingly stringent regulatory levels. With these developments, genetically engineered cotton can then be grown using other strategies that also reduce toxin loads. The project entitled, Expression of Plant NAC Genes for Increased Biomass Production directed by Dr. Yi Hong Wang (Department of Renewable Resources) is funded by the NSF/LA Board of Regents through the EPSCOR P-Fund Program. In this study, the principal investigator is investigating gene manipulation and its impact on increasing biomass production of a crop plant. This proposal aims to test whether overexpressing the tomato S1NAC4-6 in Arabidopsis/tomato or overexpressing AtNAC1 in tomato will replicate the respective phenotypes. The results will lay a critical foundation for further study in high plant biomass production for sustained biofuel feedstock production in the state of Louisiana.39 The specific goal of the project entitled, Modeling Nonpoint Source Pollution and Landuse Types in Bayou Plaquemine B rule Watershed, directed by Dr. Durga Poudel (Department of Renewable Resources), is to quantify more accurately the contribution of landuse types (e.g. agriculture, forestry, urban areas) on nonpoint source pollution in Bayou Plaquemine Brule watershed. Spatial and temporal variation of nonpoint source pollutants source and loading are being examined to establish baseline information to quantify the effectiveness of best management practices in reducing pollution loads. This project is funded by the US Environmental Protection Agency though the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. Examples of Funded Projects in the Core Industry Sector: Arts and Media With funding made available from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the UL Lafayette Center for Cultural and Eco-Tourism was able to permanently install an original museum exhibit at the Acadian Museum in Erath, LA entitled Farming the Wetlands of Old Acadie: Exploring the Ecology and Cultural Traditions of Early Acadians. Developed in 2006 at Louisiana State University, the exhibit explores the ecological backdrop and agricultural innovations of the early Acadian settlers of the seventeenth century. It is the first exhibit of its kind in Louisiana to address the ecological component of Acadian cultural history. With funding from the Louisiana Economic Development Authority (LEDA), the Cinematic Arts Workshop at UL Lafayette filmed interviews with prominent Lafayette businesspeople. Sound bites from these interviews were incorporated throughout a presentation that LEDA's President gives each year to civic groups, government agencies and other groups throughout Lafayette and our neighboring parishes to illustrate Lafayette's history, current economic indicators and business forecasts. Led by Dr. Chris Carroll of the Civil Engineering Department, students in the College of Engineering built smaller-scale versions of historical architectural marvels of Ancient Rome and ancient Egypt such as the Bent Pyramid; pyramid construction, obelisk erection, and the Hypostyle Temple at Karnak; the Pantheon; an aqueduct; Roman bath; and Roman crane as demo sites for two episodes of \"Engineering the Impossible\" that aired on the Discovery Channel in the Fall of 2010. The purpose of the episodes was to show how ancient structures were built and what engineering techniques were used. This project also has implications for the Core Industry Sectors: Transportation. Construction, and Manufacturing. Examples of Funded Projects in the Core Industry Sector: Energy and Environment The UL Lafayette Center for Ecology and Environmental Technology (CEET) is a partner in the federally supported Louisiana Native Plant Initiative. The collection, assembly, selection and release of new plant material for restoration, conservation and revegetation projects are the goals of the Louisiana Native Plant Initiative (LNPI). The LNPI will collect, preserve, increase, and study native grasses, forbs and legumes of Louisiana, conserving a vanishing natural resource and providing an essential step in the development of a native plant industry. The primary goal of the National Science Foundation funded project entitled, Internal Carbon Cycling in Tropical Deltaic Sediments, directed by Dr. Andrei Cbistoserdov (Department of Biology) is to establish the relative importance of two processes of the carbon cycle in tropical deltaic and mobile mud environments, and to determine the role eubacteria play in them. This area of research is critical to understanding how further development of the catchment areas of rivers, which deliver sediment and particulate organic matter to tropical mobile deltaic sediments, may indirectly disrupt the natural carbon cycle in the sediments with unknown and possibly devastating consequences not only for the global carbon budget but local human activities40 such as coastal fisheries. The US Army Corps of Engineers funded the project Application ofAdaptive Hydraulics Modeling (ADH) to a Wetland Environment led by Dr. Ehab Meseihe of the UL Lafayette Civil Engineering Department. The objective of this effort is to illustrate the applicability and further develop and improve the existing hydrodynamic and water quality modules of ADH. This tool will be used to gain better understanding of the hydrologic, water quality, and ecologic conditions of the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge), also known as Water Conservation Area 1 (WCA-l), a renmant of the Northern Everglades. A priority for the Refuge is to develop water quantity and quality models to identify appropriate water management strategies that will maximize benefits for the protection of fish and wildlife, while meeting flood control and water supply uses. Examples of Funded Projects in the Core Industry Sector: Information Technology and Services Dr. Nian Tzeng of the UL Lafayette Center for Advanced Computer Studies is the project director for Ubiquitous Computing and Monitoring System (UCoMS) for Discovery and Management of Energy Resources funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and by the Board of Regents of State of Louisiana. The UCoMS project aims to develop and deploy a Ubiquitous Computing and Monitoring System (UCoMS) for discovery and management of energy resources. The technical solutions are expected to effectively facilitate drilling and operational data logging and processing, on- platform information distribution and displaying, infrastructure monitoring/intrusion detection, and management of complex surface facilities and pipelines. This project also has implications for Core Industry Sectors: Petrochemical and Energy and Environment. Dr. Arun Lakhotia is currently directing a Department of Defense EPSCOR project funded by the Army Research Office entitled, Obfuscating and Deobfuscating In tent of Computer Programs. In this project, the research team is working to develop new theories and technologies for countering threats relating to malware such as worms, trojans, viruses, rootkits, etc. though the reverse engineering and restructuring of these items. In the state funded project entitled, Geospatial Data Analysis, project director, Dr. Vijay Raghavan of the Center for Advanced Computer Studies and his research team adapt open source software to run in 64-bit, distributed environments. The choice of which open source software to develop and the priority to assign to the development was dictated by civil engineering applications. Initially, three applications were identified for this technology: (a) traffic safety analysis, examining the linkage between automotive accidents and the characteristics of accident locations; (b) propagation of uncertainty in flood models using radar-rainfall analysis, seeking to predict how reliable flood predictions will be given knowledge on reliability of input data; and (c) rainfall-accident relationships, analyzing the impact of rainfall upon the rate and types of automotive accidents. This project also has implications for the Core Industry Sectors: Transportation. Construction, and Manufacturing. Dr. Hongy Wu of the Center for Advanced Computer Studies is the principal investigator of the NSF funded project entitled, NeTS: Small: Scalable Routing in 3D Wireless Sensor Networks. This project centers on scalable routing protocols for wireless sensor networks deployed in a 3D space. A key strategy of this research is to preprocess the global network information via a distributed algorithm, such that a sensor only needs to store a minimum amount of information to make correct and efficient local routing decisions, thus achieving scalable routing. The 3D sensor network technologies developed in this project will benefit several fields ranging from biological research to environmental monitoring. This project also has implications for the Core Industry Sectors: Petrochemical and Energy & Environment.41 Examples of Funded Projects in the Core Industry Sector: Petrochemical The overall objective of the Gulf Petro Initiative funded by the US Department of Energy was to develop technologies for petroleum production and exploration enhancement in deep-water and mature fields. This project was a collaborative effort of faculty from the Departments of Petroleum Engineering, Geology and Computer Science. Activities included design of new fluids to efficiently drill deep-water wells that cannot be cost- effectively drilled with current technologies. The new fluids are heavy liquid foams that have low-density at shallow depth to avoid formation breakdown and high density to control formation pressure. The goal of this project was to provide industry with formulations of new fluids for reducing casing programs and thus well construction cost in deep-water development. Funding from the LA Board of Regents and Department of Energy supported activities related to Bioprocessing for Clean Energy and Clean Power Energy Research Consortium. These projects involve ongoing research initiated in 2007-2008 on bioprocessing topics related to: (a) fermentation of starchy substrates (rice starch) into ethanol, (b) microbial production of lipids from starchy substrates (rice and potato starch), and (c) production of biogas from algae cakes and wastes from meat processing industry. In addition to the ongoing research, new research related to: (a) production of oleaginous algae in photo bioreactors using carbon dioxide, and (b) catalytic conversions of lipids into fuels (renewable diesel) was initiated. Examples of Funded Projects in the Core Industry Sector: Transportation, Construction and Manufacturing Dr. Xiaodun Sun of the Civil Engineering Department leads several projects funded by the Louisiana Transportation Research Center. The primary goal of the project entitled, Developing Louisiana Crash Reduction Factors, is to develop and document a list of Crash Reduction Factors (CFR) to be used by LaDOTD. In the project entitled, Crash Analysis for Implementation of Pavement Edge Lines, the project team aims to improve the safety of narrow rural two-lane highways in Louisiana. Specifically, the research team is working to identify the segments that will benefit most from implementing the pavement edge line on narrow rural two-lane highways in Louisiana. The team then conducts studies at these locations to estimate the crash reduction factors. In the project entitled, Effect of Thermal Oscillation Frequency on the Effective Thermal Properties of Concrete and Asphalt, funded by the Louisiana Transportation Research Center, Dr. William Chirdon (Department of Chemical Engineering) investigates the impact of heat on asphalt and concrete. The research team investigates the effect of thermal oscillation frequency on the effective thermal properties of concrete and asphalt though the use an oscillating boundary temperature method to determine thermal conductivity and diffusivity, characteristics related to durability. Dr. William Emblom of the Department of Mechanical Engineering is the project director of the LA Board of Regents funded project entitled, Mechanical Engineering and Manufacturing Curricula Using Experimental and Virtual Tools -Specflcally Metal Forming. This project aims to develop experiments and simulations to enhance the theoretical material that is introduced into traditional courses offered in the Mechanical Engineering curriculum with the intent of developing knowledge a common and economical manufacturing process. Examples of Funded Projects in the Core Industry Sector: Health Care42 The Center for Business and Information Technologies (CBIT) has partnered with Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) to help the state agency improve the delivery of its services to citizens of Louisiana through the development of the Access to Recovery (ATR) tool, which provides clinical and support services to those citizens recovering from an addiction. The tool assesses the patient's needs through a series of questions, develops a plan of care, tracks their progress, and accelerates the return of a citizen to the workforce as a viable member of society. The system, for the patients and administrators alike, leads to more effective and efficient services, while minimizing duplication and fraud, Researchers at UL Lafayette are involved in the development of the Louisiana Health Information Exchange (LaHIE). The LaHIE will connect various health IT systems to exchange and share vital patient records that vastly improve healthcare delivery to citizens every day, and may mean the difference between life and death when the need for a secure and portable personal health record arises. In a project recently awarded by the National Science Foundation entitled, Models of antibody responses following Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection, Dr. Stanca Cuipe of the Mathematics Department plans a thorough investigation of the antibody mediated immune responses against HIV with an emphasis on their neutralizing and non-neutralizing activity. The proposed hypothesis is that broadly neutralizing antibodies develop alongside strain specific neutralizing antibodies, and that their small level (perhaps undetectable in vivo) is due to competition with the fit, strain-specific antibody. a a description of how the institution has collaborated with Louisiana Economic Development, Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, industrial partners, chambers of commerce, and other economic development organizations to align Research & Development activities with Louisiana's key economic development industries Several imperatives included in UL Lafayette's 2009-2014 Strategic Plan demand collaboration with regional economic development entities for purposes of enhancing Louisiana's competitiveness in research anddevelopment. Although space limitations preclude a comprehensive listing of such partnerships, several ongoing projects and networks will be highlighted and relevant Louisiana Board of Regents FIRST Louisiana Science and Technology Plan's Core Industry Sectors will be indicated. LOUISIANA WORKFORCE COMMISSION (LWC) I The Center for Business and Information Technologies (CBIT), the B.I. Moody III College of Business Administration, and the Picard Center for Child Development and Lifelong Learning, all at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, are working with the Louisiana Workforce Commission (LWC) in developing a Louisiana Workforce Supply and Demand Simulation tool to help improve the State's ability to develop a well-qualified workforce that is aligned with the state's economic development priorities. This simulation tool incorporates the Louisiana Industry and Occupational Employment Projections Process, along with a new Louisiana Workforce Supply Forecasting Model, into a simulation environment. The simulation tool enables LWC stakeholders to analyze the gaps between Louisiana's demand and supply of workers by skill, industry, and region, and it will have the capacity to answer \"what if' questions for policy formulation and analysis. (Core Industr Sector: Information Technology and Services.) LAFAYETTE CONVENTION AND VISITORS COMMISSION (LCVC) UL Lafayette's TEAM BeauSoleil continues to win awards for its design and construction of a solar-powered home that competed in the 2009 U.S. Solar Decathlon in Washington, D.C. (Core Industry Sector: Transport, Construction and Manufacturig). The Metal Construction Association recognized the home recently as one of its 2010 President's Award winners based on its remarkable research and design. The award honors innovation and creativity while showcasing how MCA members' products help achieve43 innovative building designs. The team won in the residential category. TEAM BeauSoleil is only team from Louisiana to ever compete in a solar decathlon and it was among 20 teams from across the globe competing in the 2009 contest. They placed first place in Market Viability and were named the People's Choice Award winners. Among BeauSoleil many partners are the United Way, Lafayette Utilities and the Lafayette Convention and Visitors Commission (LCVC). LCVC also partners with UL Lafayette to support research consistent with its mission to provide leadership in initiating as well as coordinating the marketing of Lafayette throughout the world as a highly desirable vacation and convention destination; and solicits and services conventions and other related group business, and engages in visitor promotions, which generate overnight stays for Lafayette, thereby enhancing and developing the economic fabric of the community. One such project was the development of a web-based virtual food tour (Core Industry Sector: Information Technology and Services) with UL Cinematic Arts Workshop and business marketing faculty. FIBERCORPS In order to assess the viability of live HI) television transmission over a fiberoptic network, UL Lafayette partners including the Lafayette Economic Development Authority (LEDA), FiberCorps, Acadiana Open Access Channel and the Acadiana Center for the Arts collaborated to use fiber to HI) broadcast a live performance of Louisiana Crossroads in late 2010 (Core Industry Sector: Arts and Media). This was accomplished using a FiberCorps supported research initiative called Community NetCast (Core Industry Sector: Information Technology and Services) which goes beyond web-casting to deliver live, high quality video from an event to local cable TV systems using basic hardware and software. Ultimately it will enable live video to be sent in HI) to a specific channel or VoD system anywhere. FiberCorps, a nonprofit whose members represent the Lafayette Consolidated Government, The Community Foundation of Acadiana, LEDA, the Greater Lafayette Chamber of Commerce, LITE and UL Lafayette, exists to: (a) support local and recruit outside innovators by helping them implement demonstration projects that leverage fiber, (b) create centers of gravity in Lafayette for foundational technologies to generate the intellectual capital needed for long-term economic growth, (c) evangelize the benefits of fiber and encourage greater utilization within the community to enable a robust marketplace of consumers and investors, and (d) transform Lafayette into a test bed for next generation applications and services. Lafayette's city-wide Fiber-Optic Connectivity to the Premise program, municipally owned by LUS is currently providing broadband connectivity to businesses over a 125mile, 96 strand fiber loop. Lafayette is the first municipality-owned wired city in Louisiana, and with the launch of the Fiber to the Premise Initiative, Lafayette is becoming one of the most wired communities in the world. The initiative creates a viable infrastructure to sustain the robust demands of post-production companies to produce entertainment content and globally exchange data at un-replicable speeds from anywhere in our community. Faculty in the College of Engineering's Telecomm program are valuable resources for engaging in research projects about fiber (Core Industry Sector: Information Technology). Other FiberCorps projects in which UL Lafayette is a key collaborator involve developments in additional Core Industry Sectors. For example, the creation of the Virtual City of Lafayette (core Industry Sector: Information Technology and Services and Arts/Media) is an initiative to bring together all individuals and organizations in Lafayette working on 3d modeling, programming, and digital media creation to focus on the common framework of building an interactive online 3d version of the city. This project ties into and supports the works of both the Academy of Information Technology and the UL Lafayette. The Health Information Exchange (HIE; Core Industry Sector: Health Care) project involves working with the UL Lafayette Research Office, the Picard Center and CBIT to develop of a prototype mobile and permanent medical record starting at the time a child enters school44 system. HIE is the glue that holds together 21St century healthcare communities, enabling providers to share patient data and researchers to analyze population-level health trends and outcomes. This project will establish the social infrastructure of an HIE to support the pilot deployments of an HIE by encouraging the adoption and utilization of HIEs in Lafayette. Another health care industry initiative in which we are involved is the development of a High Definition Video Bridge (Core Industry Sector: Health Care), which will setup a videoconferencing infrastructure and facilitate a series of use cases to prove how this technology can enhance business and government. The first use case will be a nurse practitioner examining patients in nursing homes, thereby saving her the time, cost, and pollution of driving to the assisted living facilities. LOUISIANA IMMERSIVE TECHNOLOGIES ENTERPRISE (LITE) I The 3D Render Farm (Core Industry Sector: Information Technology and Arts/Media) will be a HD solution that will support Lafayette and Louisiana's focus on supporting the creation of digital media jobs by giving local video producers the ability to speed up their rendering of HD video. The same infrastructure will be able to be used for 3d rendering, virtualized server capacity, and other applications as needed. LITE and UL Lafayette's CAVE Consortium are also key partners in this project. The CAVE (the Computation and Visualization Enterprise) consortium is an interdisciplinary team of 15 LITE Fellows from UL Lafayette. Their purpose is to inject the supercomputing and 3D visualization power of the Louisiana Immersive Technologies Enterprise (LITE) into their academic research. The result will be the collaboration of researchers from disciplines across campus. Their work could ultimately speed up conventional research processes. CAVE teams will be using LITE's supercomputing and visualization technology along with the high-speed fiber optic capability of the Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (LONI). The Fellows come from areas including biology, civil and chemical engineering, English and physics. Another current CAVE project is aiming to use glycerol in a more efficient, green way. Researchers from chemical engineering and biochemistry are working together to test and identify enzymes that will help convert glycerol into compounds for use in the chemical industry. Currently, glycerol is an abundant product with limited use. A modified enzyme could use glycerol as a catalyst for chemical processes, helping to reduce waste and making chemical processes \"cleaner.\" Supercomputers are helping to narrow down the number of enzymes that could be modified (Core Industry Sector: Energy and Environmental). LITE is one of the most comprehensive and tightly integrated visualization and high performance computing installations in the world, is a key economic development partner of UL Lafayette and was indeed born out of a joint collaboration among LEDA, LED and our institution. Powered by graphic supercomputers enabling clients to visualize volumes of complex data, LITE's capabilities and services bridge the gap in time and space between production studios, processing laboratories and post-production houses. LAFAYETTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (LEDA) I UL Lafayette's closest economic development ally is LEDA. In fact, LEDA's L3 Strategic Plan was specifically considered and incorporated into UL Lafayette's 2009-2014 Strategic Plan. LEDA's mission is to provide assistance to local companies in their growth, market development and workforce development efforts; to recruit additional companies considering locating in this area; and to assist in the development of new companies in order to diversify the economy within Lafayette Parish. Faculty and staff at UL Lafayette have daily contact with LEDA, and we collaborate on several projects including a very successful Biofijels initiative (Core Industry Sector: Agriculture and Wood Products). UL Lafayette is also a partner in LEDA's Opportunity Machine (OM) Business Incubator and Accelerator housed at LITE and recently expanded to a second location in downtown Lafayette. The OM's goal is to energize the Lafayette technology ecosystem for the benefit of the local community. For this reason, the OM wants to see as many local technology ventures succeed as possible. Each successful business gives back to the community by creating new jobs, diversifying the local economy and generating a technologically diverse workforce. As this effect compounds, what emerges is a growth spiral that attracts bigger businesses, better projects and greater profits while expanding sources of capital.45 OM's residents are engaged in several research projects with CAVE Fellows and other UL Lafayette researchers (Core Industry Sector: Information Technology and Services). UL Lafayette also partners with the City of Carencro and SLEMCO in a more traditional business incubator known as the Enterprise Center of Louisiana (ECOL). ECOL provides an environment in which a new or small emerging business can learn effective business practices while actually engaging in business operations with the end result of creating jobs and diversifying the economy in Acadiana. ECOL facilitate research assistance, among many other services, to clients needing such aid. LAFAYETTE CONSOLIDATED GOVERNMENT/LE CENTRE INTERNATIONAL I LEDA and UL Lafayette also support the works on Le Centre International, an entity of the Lafayette Consolidated Government. Since its inception in April 1990, the mission of Le Centre International has been to foster an increase in international commerce and tourism in the Lafayette area. Le Centre International has the following objectives: (a) to assist small and medium-sized businesses in the Lafayette area in exporting their products or services abroad through the identification of new markets and expansion of existing markets. Additionally, to assist companies in importing products andlor parts not available in the U.S.; (b) to promote international tourism, especially cultural tourism, and to attract a greater number of international meetings to the City-Parish of Lafayette and surrounding areas: (c) to manage and provide continuity and guidance for Lafayette's participation in the international economic development Network SESAME; and (d) to provide support and guidance for Lafayette's sister-city program and for other active international municipal twinning and networking programs in the region. Le Centre International offers, with the assistance of its partners, the following services: (a) Identification of trade opportunities and assistance with market research, (b) One-on-one export counseling, (c) Trade missions, trade shows and catalog shows abroad Organization of seminars, meetings, briefings and site visits for visiting delegations, (d) Export financing referrals, (e) Seminars and workshops, and (e) Public awareness programs. UL Lafayette interns and faculty (those who serve as board members and others) are regularly engaged by Le Centre to participate in research projects and international initiatives such as the creation of a research database of regional companies engaged in global business (Core Industry Sector: Information Technology and Services) and participating in business matchmaking events to facilitate shared research and commercial projects. The Community Design Workshop of the School of Architecture and Design partners with the Lafayette Consolidated Government provides expertise in urban design, planning, and landscape design, as well as architecture and housing. The Community Design Workshop, as a design studio, helps cities, small towns, and neighborhoods visualize their potential as communities. The Workshop has been operating as a mobile design studio within the community for twelve years. The Workshop has completed seventy funded projects that range from the urban design of a major interstate to small towns across the state of Louisiana including urban design projects for small towns impacted by Hurricane Rita. Cameron and Delcambre, Louisiana were impacted by this natural disaster and used test case-studies in which the studio proposed architecture that becomes more sustainable and defensible in these natural disasters. The Workshop also works closely with Lafayette Consolidated Government and their comprehensive plan to develop streets, such as Johnston Street and Ambassador Caffery South, to be more urban and pedestrian friendly. The CDW has also completed projects which enhance neighborhood development. Freetown and the Oil Center are projects in which landscape, housing, and compact building design are all issues explored within the studio. The Community Design Workshop links the 502Architectural Studio with the research office allowing faculty and students to work together with cities and neighborhoods to develop a vision for their community (Core Industry Sector: Transport, Construction and Manufacturing).46 CLECO Cleco Power and UL Lafayette's College of Engineering, are constructing the Cleco Alternative Energy Center at the Industrial Park in Crowley, La. The center will be used to study and develop alternative energy technologies using renewable energy sources, which benefit the environment (Core Industry Sector: Energy and Environmental). Cleco Power will build the facility with the help of a $1 million stimulus grant from the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources' Empower Louisiana Renewable Energy Grant Program. The state created the grant program with money received from the U.S. Department of Energy. Once complete, Cleco Power will maintain the facility, and UL Lafayette will operate and staff it.This facility will open new doors for students and faculty to explore alternatives in energy and product development, while strengthening the university's relationship with its community partners. UL Lafayette will research a range of alternative energy technologies at the facility; however, their first project will involve a pilot-scale biomass gasifier that they are hoping to one day market when the biomass gasifier prototype is complete. A biomass gasifier converts biomass materials such as woodchips, rice chaff, bagasse (sugar cane byproduct), manure and certain grasses into synthesis gas or syngas. The syngas can be used as a fuel to generate electricity or converted into important liquid fuels and chemicals. Gasification technology is not new but has evolved during the last decade due to additional research. Gasifiers extract energy from many different types of organic materials, including biomass, coal and petroleum coke. Cleco Power and UL Lafayette are working with NorthStar Resources of Jasper, Texas, to commercialize the biomass gasifier (Core Industry Sector: Petrochemical).

In addition to the specific projects and programs described above, there are several centers and departments at the University with a focus on economic and workforce development. These include the Manufacturing Extension Partnership of Louisiana (MEP0L), the Louisiana Procurement Technical Assistance Center (LA PTAC), and the Acadiana Small Business Development Center. Each of these entities collaborates with LED and other economic development agencies statewide to assist companies in Louisiana across all sectors, including those identified as Core Industry Sectors in the Louisiana Board of Regents FIRST Louisiana Science and Technology Plan.47 The Manufacturing Extension Partnership of Louisiana (MEPOL) provides Louisiana Manufacturers value-driven, best-practice solutions. MEPOL is a network affiliate of National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), a national network of more than 59 affiliate centers, bringing enterprise expertise to over 149,000 businesses across the United States (Core Industry Sector: TransDort Construction and Manufacturing). The NIST affiliation brings a state-of-the-art knowledge base and access to a national network of expertise, assuring clients that the latest technical knowledge will be brought to bear on their problems. MEPOL's project managers assess, consult, and assist with transformations by providing innovative research-based and technical solutions to Louisiana's small and medium sized manufacturers, helping them to strategically plan and implement business growth opportunities and improve their competitive position in national and international markets. The Louisiana Procurement Technical Assistance Center (LA PTAC) was established to generate employment and improve the general economy of Louisiana by assisting business firms in obtaining and performing under the U.S. Department of Defense, other federal agencies, state and local government contracts. With funding provided by the University and the U.S. Department of Defense (Defense Logistics Agency), LA PTAC provides marketing and procurement assistance, outreach, and training to Louisiana-based companies and individuals located in their respective service areas. Procurement specialists determine if businesses can compete in the government marketplace, guide companies through the marketing and bidding process, and assist with post-award and contract management. As part of its mission and function, LA PTAC, stimulates the economy and increases competitiveness and profitability of Louisiana businesses by assisting them in market diversification with an emphasis on federal, state, and local markets. It also assists the U.S. Department of Defense, other federal agencies, the State of Louisiana and local agencies with identification of vendors and it helps increase the business base for the U.S. Department of Defense, federal, state, and local contracts with emphasis on identifying and documenting the capabilities of small businesses. Its clients represent companies in all core science and technology industry sectors. Since 1989, LA PTAC has helped Louisiana businesses located in 54parishes to secure more than $2.5 billion in government contracts. The Louisiana Small Business Development Center (SBDC) headquartered on the campus of UL Lafayette is part of a network of nine centers throughout Louisiana, located at colleges and universities and serving the entrepreneurs of Louisiana. SBDC is an information clearinghouse designed toassist small businesses succeed. The Louisiana SBDC networks with the area economic development agencies, creating a web of support that entrepreneurs can use to assist them in achieving their goals. The Louisiana Small Business Development Center at UL Lafayette serves the Acadiana Region including the parishes of Acadia, St. Landry, St. Mary, Lafayette, Evangeline, theria, Vermilion, and St. Martin. SBDC operates in partnership with the U.S. Small Business Administration under a cooperative agreement and the Louisiana Department of Economic Development. a description of any business innovations and new companies (startups) and companies formed during previous years and continuing (surviving startups) resulting from institutional research and/or partnerships related to Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIRISTTR) Research and development activities at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette have resulted in the transfer of technology leading to creation of several startup companies. Some of these companies are still in existence today and maintain a collaborative relationship with the University and the faculty who developed the intellectual property licensed for commercialization. One such company that was created specifically to commercialize technology developed at UL Lafayette in collaboration with faculty at Xavier University is Innovative Learning Assessment Technologies, LLC (ILAT). ILAT, headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana, is an assessment solutions48 provider whose primary goal is development and delivery of assessment and accreditation support systems for institutional applications. Currently, their products and services focus on the needs of higher education and the complexities of information management those institutions face, particularly student assessments for certification purposes. ILAT licensed PASSPORT from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and Xavier University in 2005. PASS-PORT was developed in 2000 as a state-wide project funded by the Louisiana Board of Regents. The original implementation team consisted of a working group of individuals from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, University of Louisiana System, and Xavier University of Louisiana. This included Ryan Brooks who is now the ILAT's Chief Technical Officer. ILAT has developed new editions of PASS-PORT to bring its powerful capabilities beyond teacher preparation programs. ILAT has a close working relationship with the Center for Innovative Learning and Assessment Technologies (CILAT) - a research center at UL Lafayette - as well as Dr. Doug Williams, CILAT's director and a faculty member in the College of Education (Core Industry Sector: Information Technology and Services). In 2005, two technologies developed at UL Lafayette were licensed to a new company named Araicom. Araicom Life Sciences was created to help biomedical and life sciences researchers find answers faster to deliver better cures and solutions that improve the quality of life. The technologies it licensed from UL Lafayette are components of its comprehensive platform solution that will make \"conceptual biology and computational literature discovery\" a practical reality throughout the biomedical and life sciences industries. The solution provides researchers the ability to extract insights in a new and novel manner. The patent-pending technology retrieves information by creating concept associations that uncover hidden relationships and suggest new hypotheses. This makes the researcher more productive in discovering areas with the greatest potential. Compared to PubMed and Google, Araicom Life Sciences enhances traditional \"search\" by providing a visual \"map\" of contextual relationships and guides users to the prediction and discovery of hidden opportunities. (Core Industry Sectors: Information Technology and Services: Health Care). The Center for Business and Information Technologies (CBIT) in partnership with Osmin Energy developed the GEOPRO geological toolkit . The visualization tool, used in the program, VizPro, was researched and developed by CBIT, in collaboration with our industry partners Fusion Petroleum Technologies and Premiere, Inc. The applied research project was in development for over 3 years and leads the industry in the advancement of integrated geological and geophysics engineering toolkits. This was an applied research project that represents a significant innovation in the field of geological and geophysical data processing, computing and scientific visualization. Vizpro, is a complete visualization system for geological model building and velocity analysis. Fusion has incorporated the new visualization aid program to the GEOPRO package, a full service workflow matrix. The VizPro addition boasts unique visualization features such as oblique section capabilities and color palate options that allow users to see in 3D and 4D (Core Industry Sectors: Information Tecimology and Services; Energy and Environment), In addition, the university continues to work with private sector partners to commercialize technology developed through UL Lafayette research efforts. One such example is the licensing of a technology referred to as Hybrid Luminescent Tracer Ammunition developed by Dr. Andy Hollerman and a team of students in the Physics Department. This technology was licensed to Hallum, Inc. in 2005 for further development of the technology into non-burning tracer bullets for recreational and non-military applications. The company has developed a product called Glow Ammo which they describe as cold tracer technology for reloaders. The product can be applied to any cartridge that you are hand loading. It takes a bullet and turns it into a non - incendiary tracer. Because there is no fire or flame associated with the discharge, Glow Ammo is safe to shoot at any range. The company is currently implementing an aggressive distribution plan for the product. This research is considered Core Enabling S&T Research in Materials Science and Nanotechnology.49 Dr. Suzanna Garcia and her colleague Dr. Chan Kiat Lim from the UL Lafayette School of Music developed a web-based system called the eNovativePiano: Multimedia Tools for Developing Musicianship Skills that provides students seeking to learn music a set of experiential tools with feedback to improve their learning capability and experience. These technologies are being commercialized through eNovative Piano as a start-up company of the university (Core Industry Sectors: Information Technology and Services; Arts and Media). There are other startup companies that were created in whole or in part as a result of research and development activities at UL Lafayette that are not in operation today. These include Webscalers, Vilo and Senovation. Webscalers was a start-up company that involved faculty members from UL Lafayette, SUNY Binghamton and the University of Chicago. Its aim was toprovide solutions to various business problems associated with online search coverage, quality, and effectiveness. Technology created collaboratively among the three universities and released to the inventors by each respective institution was used to create customizable and extensible search technologies designed to address specific business requirements. In 2007-08, Dr. Arun Lakhotia from the Center for Advanced Computer Studies developed a technology that compares and analyzes software programs to help identify malware, which includes certain software applications, research, know-how and intellectual property that resulted in the creation of the Vilo technology and Vilo as a startup company. The technology continues to find promising applications within major initiatives, such as a DARPA-funded research project. It has also generated interest from such companies as McAfee and Symantec. However, the company could not generate adequate seed capital to survive (Core Industry Sectors: Information Technology and Services). Between November 2007 and January 2009, Dr. Vijay Raghavan and his colleague Dr. Zonghuan Wu, both from the Center for Advanced Computer Studies, led the development and commercialization of a search engine result visualization technology that resulted in the creation of SENovation, LLC. The company sought to commercialize but could not survive due to capital constraints. Though UL Lafayette has collaborated with small business concerns on Small Business Innovative Research and Small Business Technology Transfer awards from the federal government, there have been no new start-up companies ensuing. a description of how the institution's research productivity and technology transfer efforts compare to peer institutions. The data reported for Research and Development Expenditures at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in response to the FY 2009 National Science Foundation Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges and the FY 2010 National Science Foundation Higher Education Research and Development Survey appears in Table 1. Total R & D expenditures for FY 2010 were $69,412,000 compared to $68,018,000 in FY 2009, In benchmarking how UL Lafayette compares with its peers (Peers Selection) in terms of research productivity, data from the NSF Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges can be analyzed. The most recent data available from the National Science Foundation/Division of Science Resources Statistics is that reported for FY 2007. For comparison, separately budgeted R&D expenditures in the sciences and engineering, reported by source of funds for FY 2007 for UL Lafayette and a group of SREB peer institutions (Four-Year 2) will be considered. This Regents SREB peer group includes:50 Florida Atlantic University Old Dominion University University of North Carolina Greensboro University of Maryland Baltimore County University of Texas El Paso College of William and Mary all campuses Florida International University University of North Carolina Charlotte University of Alabama in Huntsville University of Memphis Virginia Commonwealth University University of Mississippi all campuses Georgia Institute of Technology all campuses In FY 2008, the total amount of research and development expenditures at UL Lafayette and at the SREB peer group identified above is provided in Table 2. The amount of expenditures for each source of funds is also provided, in addition to the percentage that source represents compared to the total. Figures are reported in thousands of dollars. UL Lafayette performs comparable to the peer group in terms of total research expenditures and the percentage of the total reported from external sources versus institutional investments. In terms of the total R&D expenditures, the median of the total research and development expenditures from all sources reported in FY 2008 for the selected peer group was $58,667,000. This amount reported by UL Lafayette for total R&D expenditures in FY 2008 was comparable to the median at $62,032,000; see Table 3. When considering the percentage of the total expenditures from external sources versus expenditures from institutional funds for UL Lafayette, 66% of the total expenditures reported in FY 2008 were from external sources and 34% of the total expenditures were from institutional sources. These are comparable to the median percentage from institution funds for the peer group (32%) and the median percentage from external sources for the peer group (68%). Other metrics could be considered to compare the research productivity of UL Lafayette to its peers, such as number of proposals submitted and awards received. A comparable set of metrics for the peer group or even a subset of the peer group was unavailable, as there is not a single source where institutions report such data similar to the manner in which expenditures are reported though the NSF survey. Attempts were made to collect these metrics for the peer group through web searches and other means; however, a comparable set of metrics for comparison was not found. Availability of such data was limited and variations in the mechanisms institutions use to track multi-year awards, renewals, amendments and supplements, would introduce variability, making comparison difficult.51 In order to compare the technology transfer activities and efforts of UL Lafayette to peer institutions, metrics outlined in the article entitled, Assessing Technology Transfer Performance by Richard Kordal and Leslie K. Guice that appeared in the Research Management Review, Volume 16, Number 1 (Fall/Winter 2008) were used. In this research, the authors present a set of technology transfer metrics calculated from the AUTM 2007 Annual Survey data. Metrics for institutions of three size categories based on amount of research and development expenditures are provided. Metrics presented for small institutions (<$75 MM) will be used for comparison. Selected metrics presented for small institutions are provided in Table 4. When comparing the metrics for UL Lafayette for FY 09-10 to the median figures for small institutions based on FY 2007 AUTUM, results presented in Table 5indicate that UL Lafayette performance is comparable in terms of number of new startups per $100 million in expenditures (UL Lafayette: 1.4; AUTM Group: 1.9), Lafayette: .0498%; AUTM Group: .06%). When examining the number of new invention disclosures per $10 million in research and development expenditures (Disclosures! $10 MM R&D), the median for small institutions (<$7SMM) is 5.1. The metric for UL Lafayette in FY 09-10 was significantly lower at 0.72. Kordal and Guice (2008) offer a few possibilities of what a disclosure rate lower than the median could mean. These include: More effort might be needed in terms of education and outreach in order to encourage faculty to pursue patentable innovations through their research activities. The type of research conducted at the institution is not conducive to innovation! technology transfer activities as measured by these metrics. Faculty does not believe that participation in technology transfer activities will help advance their careers in terms of reappointments, tenure, and promotion. Some consideration must be given to the nature of research conducted at UL Lafayette as a factor impacting our disclosure rate. Nearly 32% of our expenditures (over $22 million of $69,412,000) were committed to the New Iberia Research Center (from all sources including institutional funds) for contract research for private pharmaceutical companies and for maintenance of federally-funded primate research programs. Due to the nature of this work and the related contractual arrangements, one would not expect disclosures to result from these efforts. Also, much of the work conduced in education and other non-science and engineering disciplines at UL Lafayette have limited potential for commercialization.52 3.c.i.

Institutional Efficiency and Accountabifity a.Eliminate remedial education course offerings and developmental study programs unless such courses or programs cannot be offered at a community college in thesame geographical area. .Demonstration of collaboration efforts with the two-year college(s) in the region The University has a Cross-Enrollment Agreement with the South Louisiana Community College (SLCC) which allows eligible students from each campus to enroll concurrently at the home and host institution. SLCC offers remedial Math courses on the UL Lafayette campus targeting incoming freshmen needing Math remediation. The Cross-Enrollment Agreement allows the home institution to use the combined enrollment to certify enrollment and award financial aid and scholarships. The University has engaged in extensive planning to eliminate remedial education course offerings and developmental study programs and to ensure that students have a viable path to two-year and ultimately four-year degrees. The University established a Task Force on 2012 Admissions Standards that has met regularly since Summer 2010. The Task Force includes subcommittees on the Summer Bridge Program, Early Assessment, Community College Option, and Awareness. During 2010-il, each has developed detailed plans for addressing the elimination of remedial courses and the consequences of the change in admissions requirements. o Summer Bridge Program. The Summer Bridge Program sub-committee, working with SLCC, has developed and will pilot a program to allow students who do not meet ACT math (19) and English (18) requirements to qualify for admission through an intensive four-week course. The program will be offered through SLCC but will be housed on the UL Lafayette campus and taught by UL Lafayette instructor(s). The program will be piloted in the Summer of 2011 in a four-week math intensive course equivalent to Math 92. The class will meet 4 hours per day, 5days per week, and be supplemented with tutoring in the afternoon. One hundred fifty potential students have been identified from which 2 to 4 sections of 25 will be developed. The Mathematics department has tested the methods and believes that they can be highly successful. Following assessment of the program in Summer 2011, beginning in Summer 2012 students who have an ACT Math score of 17 or 18 will be invited to participate in the Summer Bridge Program. Students who successfully pass Math 92 will meet the new standards and will be eligible for admission. o Early Assessment. The Assessment sub-committee will develop and implement processes designed for the early identification of high school students who want to enroll at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, but do not meet the 2012 standards. Through the Assessment sub- committee the University plans to develop partnerships with high schools and school districts to assist them in identifying students who plan to attend a four-year university. One strategy will be to use ACT PLAN scores to identify students not on track to meet ACT math and English standards. These students and/or parents will be contacted and provided specific information to assist the student in meeting the universities requirements. The University is partnering with Sylvan Learning Center to develop the \"Score for Core\" tour (Score and Tour). \"Score for Core\" isan initiative designed to identify schools in need of assistance and get the word out regarding new requirements to high school personnel and58 the community. Another strategy is to partner with SLCC and the Lafayette Parish School System to use the Early Start program to allow students not on track to meet the new standards the opportunity to take developmental math andlor English at the community college. oCommunity College Option. Under the umbrella of the \"Transfer Connection\" between UL Lafayette and SLCC the Community College Option sub-committee has identified the following objectives: 1.Increase the number of students transferring from SLCC with an associate degree. 2.Remove barriers in the transfer process and ease the transition of students from SLCC to UL Lafayette. 3.Increase the retention and graduation of transfer students from SLCC. 4.Provide opportunities for high school students who plan to attend UL Lafayette to meet 2012 Admissions Standards at SLCC. Thus far the following strategies have been identified: Dual Admission between UL Lafayette and SLCC; Guaranteed admission for SLCC with associate degrees; Common UL Lafayette/SLCC application for Dual Admission students; UL Lafayette student privileges for SLCC students in Dual admission program; Pre-transfer advising; Scholarship opportunities. oThe Awareness sub-committee will develop and implement strategies to inform students, parents and the community about new standards and provide resources for meeting the new standards. Timeline for elimination of developmental course offering The University currently offers two remedial courses: Math 092 and English 090. These students will be cross-enrolled with SLCC. UL Lafayette will offer no developmental courses beyond Spring 2012. Both courses will be completely removed from our course offering beginning Fall 2012. The Vice President for Enrollment Management is collaborating with SLCC to allow SLCC to offer sections of these courses on UL Lafayette's campus for continuing students who still need these courses.59 4.a.i.

'annual plan for increasing non-resident tuition amounts Narrative Report: Annual plan for increasing non-resident tuition amounts. University of Louisiana -Lafayette Approved Out-of-State in SREB out-of- state tuition was 4.57 per year across all categwies. This percentage has been used to adjust targets for each year of the six-year schedule. Adjustments will be revised each year as new SREB data are available and the new schedule will be part of the GRAD Act Annual Report. Based on a template and parameters prepared by the UL System, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette devised a plan for the increase in non- resident tuition over six years targeting the projected nonresident tuition for all SREB 2 institutions. The plan was submitted to and approved by the University of Louisiana System Board on August 27, 2010. UL Lafayette's tuition for 20 10-11 is available hcic.63 Methodology: We used a modified sum-of-the-year's digits approach. At the time we did the computation, tuition of$12,998 for 20 10-11 had already been set. We first computed the difference between the actual tuition charged in 2010-11 and the target year (2015-16) tuition ($20,739 - $12,998) to determine that an $7741 increase in tuition must be spread over 5 years. The sum of the year's digits was determined (1+2+3+4+5-is). Therefore we determined that there should be a $516 ($7741 x 1/15) increase from 2010-11 to 2011-12 resulting in tuition of$13,514. .impact on enrollment and revenue The University took a conservative approach to implementing tuition increases. The data we analyzed combined with impending increased admission standards made it clear that at this point the impact of increased tuition on enrollment is not predictable. Although, as the charts below illustrate, in- state-enrollment is the determinant in overall enrollment trends because 90% of UL Lafayette's enrollment is from in-state students, we value our nonresident students and want to continue to be successful in recruiting the \"best and the brightest\" to the University. Certainly our position as a research institution with high research activity mandates that we continue to draw from students whose talents will enhance our academic programs and research initiatives. As the spreadsheet reporting enrollment and nonresident tuition for Fall 2005 through Fall 2010 indicates (Enrollment Data), total enrollment from Fall 2009 (16,361) to Fall 2010 (16,763) increased by 2.46% overall with in-state enrollment increasing by 2.95% (14,755 to 15,190) and nonresident enrollment decreasing by 2.05% (1606 to 1573). While the out-of-state portion of nonresident enrollment actually increased by 2.63% (873 to 896), there was a 7.64% decrease in out-of-county enrollment (733 to 677) for the second year in a row. However, despite 28.53% increase in tuition from Fall 2008 to Fall 2009 ($14,994,614 to $20,216,328), nonresident enrollment increased during that time period. Tuition revenue in Fall 2010 rose to $20,445,850, a 3.26% increase over Fall 2009. Assuming the enrollment trends continue for 20 11-12, net revenue should increase by $386,340.
