Here, we discover that the activity of dynamin-2 (Dyn2) in catalyzing GLUT4 endocytosis is negatively regulated by insulin signaling in muscle cells. Mechanistically, the fission activity of Dyn2 is inhibited by binding with the SH3 domain of Bin1. In the absence of insulin, GSK3 phosphorylates Dyn2 to relieve the inhibition of Bin1 and promotes endocytosis. Conversely, insulin signaling inactivates pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in diet-induced insulin-resistant mice. Together, we identify a new role of GSK3 in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal by regulating Dyn2-mediated GLUT4 endocytosis in muscle cells. These results highlight the isoform-specific function of GSK3 on membrane trafficking and its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders. Introduction Skeletal muscle is the primary responsive tissue for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake ( [Kraegen et al., 1985](javascript:;)) and is also the earliest tissue to exhibit insulin resistance, preceding the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D; [Rothman et al., 1995](javascript:;); [Warram et al., 1990](javascript:;)). The insulin-induced glucose uptake is executed by the glucose transporter GLUT4, specifically expressed in muscle and adipose tissues ( [Charron et al., 1989](javascript:;); insulin stimulation, the insulin receptor-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling cascade is activated to mediate translocation of GLUT4 from intracellular membrane compartments to the cell surface, including sarcolemma and T-tubules in skeletal muscle, thus reducing blood glucose ( [Kohn et al., 1996](javascript:;); [Tremblay et al., 2001](javascript:;); [Wang et al., 1999](javascript:;)). Contrary to its role in promoting GLUT4 exocytosis, the role of the insulin signaling pathway in GLUT4 endocytosis remains elusive. A recent phosphoproteomic study demonstrated that dysregulation of vesicle trafficking is one of the fundamental defects of insulin resistance in the muscle cells of T2D patients ( [Batista et al., 2020](javascript:;)), underscoring the importance of further exploration of GLUT4 vesicular trafficking in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. The GLUT4 is internalized mainly through dynamin-2 (Dyn2)-mediated endocytosis. Dyn2 is a large GTPase with a well-known function in catalyzing membrane fission, the last step of various routes of endocytosis ( and De al., 2009](javascript:;)). To drive endocytosis, Dyn2 needs to be recruited to plasma membrane by interacting with the SH3 domain of many BAR domain containing proteins, such as Bin1, through its proline-arginine rich domain (PRD; [Fig. 1 A]), where these proteins generate a highly curved membrane to facilitate Dyn2 assembly and fission activity ( [Chappie et al., 1996](javascript:;)). Dyn2 is ubiquitously expressed in mammals, yet mutations of Dyn2 lead to a tissue-specific disease, studies have demonstrated that CNM-associated mutants of Dyn2 are hyperactive due to abnormal et 2015](javascript:;); [Kenniston and 2010](javascript:;)). Expression of these Dyn2 mutants causes T-tubules, specialized structures derived from sarcolemma invaginations, to be abnormally shaped in 2011](javascript:;)) and et al., 2015](javascript:;)), excessive T-tubules due to Dyn2 hyperactivity. Besides Dyn2, mutations of its binding partner Bin1/amphiphysin 2 also result in autosomal recessive CNM, suggesting loss-of-function [Nicot et al., an N-BAR domain that forms a banana-shaped homodimer to sense, coordinate, and generate membrane curvature, and is required for biogenesis and maintenance of T-tubules in skeletal muscles al., 2002](javascript:;); 2001](javascript:;)). Prior research revealed that the downregulation of Dyn2 could rescue the phenotypes of Bin1-related CNM mouse model ( [Cowling myopathy in mice ( [Lionello et al., 2022](javascript:;)). These findings suggest a role for Bin1 as a negative regulator of Dyn2. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of how Bin1 and Dyn2 interact to regulate endocytosis in muscle remains largely unknown. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a serine/threonine kinase initially as a key regulator of glycogen synthase, suppressing glycogen synthesis via Cohen, is negatively regulated by through phosphorylation N-terminal 1994](javascript:;)). Importantly, higher GSK3 expression and activity have been observed in the skeletal muscle of T2D patients and diabetic mice ( [Eldar-Finkelman and Krebs, 1997](javascript:;); [Nikoulina et al., 2000](javascript:;)). There two ubiquitously expressed forms of GSK3 in mammals, GSK3 and GSK3, which share high similarity, but are not functionally redundant ( [Woodgett, 1990](javascript:;)). GSK3 deletion in mice results in embryonic lethality, whereas GSK3 deficient mice are viable and display enhanced insulin sensitivity ( [Hoeflich et al., 2000](javascript:;); [MacAulay et al., 2007](javascript:;)). Most previous research focused on GSK3, but emerging evidence demonstrated the isoform-specific effects of GSK3 on metabolic, cardiovascular, al., 2019](javascript:;)). In particular, GSK3 has been implied to have a specific function in endocytosis to mediate synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus ( we demonstrate that inhibition by Bin1 is relieved by phosphorylation of Dyn2-PRD by GSK3, which reduces the binding between the SH3 domain of Bin1 and Dyn2-PRD. Insulin Dyn2 in muscle cells. Furthermore, a GSK3 isoform-specific inhibitor improves insulin sensitivity and signaling in diet-induced insulin-resistant mice. Results Bin1 negatively regulates the fission activity of Dyn2 To measure the membrane fission activity of Dyn2, we quantified Dyn2-catalyzed vesicles released from the supported bilayer with excess membrane reservoir (SUPER) templates in vitro ( [Pucadyil and Schmid, 2008](javascript:;)). We investigated the effect of Bin1 on Dyn2 and found that the N-BAR domain of Bin1 (Bin1SH3) enhanced Dyn2-mediated membrane fission in a concentration-dependent full-length Bin1 lost this effect ( [Fig. 1 B]). To test whether Bin1 inhibits the fission activity of dynamin, we examined its effects on membrane fission activity of and CNM mutants of Dyn2, including A618T, S619L, higher than WT-Dyn2 ( [Chin et al., 2015](javascript:;); [Liu et al., 2011](javascript:;)). As expected, these proteins exhibited greater fission activity than WT-Dyn2 ( [Fig. 1, C and D]) and were inhibited Bin1 in a dose-dependent manner ( [Fig. 1 E]). The inhibitory effect of Bin1 on Dyn2 does not arise from interfering with membrane binding of Dyn2, as revealed by liposome binding assays in which a substantial amount of Dyn2 remained bound to the membrane in the presence of Bin1 ( [Fig. 1, F and G]). This result suggests the coassembly of Dyn2 with Bin1 on the membrane may alter Dyn2 activity. To further visualize how Dyn2 and Bin1 assemble on membrane, we performed negative-stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to observe liposomes incubated with purified Dyn2 Dyn2 assembly in membranous fission activity ( [Fig. 1 H]). The average diameter of Dyn2-decorated tubes is 44.5 \u00b1 2.3 nm with a spiral appearance regularly spaced of \u00b1 2.31 on liposomes also induced the formation of membrane tubules of a smaller diameter (31.4 \u00b1 1.2 nm) that lack the regular spacing pattern. Meanwhile, coincubation of Dyn2 and Bin1 led to fewer membrane tubules of an intermediate diameter (37.4 \u00b1 3.7 nm) with less-ordered, spiral-like protein assembly with higher pitch (18.35 \u00b1 8.10 nm), implying an altered assembly pattern. This is consistent with the result that Bin1 inhibits Dyn2 GTPase activity stimulated by endophilin, that binds I]), indicating distinct SH3 domains have differential regulatory effects on Dyn2. These results reveal the dual roles of Bin1 on Dyn2 fission activity governed by its N-BAR and the absence of SH3 domain, N-BAR stimulates Dyn2, and the inclusion of SH3 inhibits membrane fission activity of Dyn2 by altering Dyn2 assembly on the membrane. The PI motif of Bin1 is crucial for membrane binding and tubulation, but not Dyn2 fission activity The muscle-specific isoform of Bin1 contains a unique positively charged, 15-amino-acid stretch called the PI motif that enhances the lipid-binding ability of Bin1 ( [Lee et al., 2002](javascript:;)). We tested the potential role of PI motif in Dyn2-mediated membrane fission using different Bin1 variants ( [Fig. S1 To our surprise, regulation on Dyn2 fission activity ( [Fig. previous report ( [Lee et al., 2002](javascript:;)), the PI motif was essential for the induction of plasma membrane tubule formation (tubulation) in cells ( [Fig. S1 E]). These results suggest that the PI motif is important for membrane binding and tubulation of Bin1, i.e., the T-tubule biogenesis, with the CNM-related Bin1 mutations, Bin1Q434X 2007](javascript:;)). We speculated that these CNM-Bin1 mutants may lose the inhibitory effect on Dyn2. Indeed, GST pulldown assay showed significant decrease in the binding of Bin1Q434X and Bin1K436X to GST-Dyn2-PRD ( [Fig. 2, B and C]), while displaying membrane binding and tubulation activities similar to those of Bin1WT ( [Fig. 2, D and E]). with SH3 with smaller diameter ( [Fig. 2, G and H]). These data support the idea that Bin1-SH3 inhibits Dyn2 and raises the possibility that enhanced Dyn2 activity could be part of the pathogenesis of CNM associated with Bin1 mutations. Consistent with the result from liposome tubulation ( 2 E]), in the C2C12 myoblasts induced tubulation of the plasma membrane similar to that by Bin1WT-GFP ( [Fig. 2 I]). The morphology of these membrane tubules generated by Bin1-GFP was reminiscent of T-tubules in terms of their high curvatures and the enrichment of Bin1 and PI(4,5)P2 ( [Lee et al., 2002](javascript:;)). They could be severed into small vesicles by Dyn2, making them a feasible cellular system to validate Bin1-Dyn2 interactions observed in the reconstitution experiments ( [Chin et al., 2015](javascript:;); [Laiman both Bin1-GFP into membrane tubules ( [Fig. 2 J]). We categorized the cells according overall Bin1-GFP patterns reduced the proportion of cells with Bin1 tubules, with a reciprocal increase in cells that showed the characteristic vesicular membrane patterns ( [Fig. 2 K]). Furthermore, live-cell imaging of the dynamics of Bin1-mediated tubules revealed more frequent fission events in the or Bin1K436X ( [Video 1] and [Fig. that CNM-associated Bin1 mutants with truncated SH3 domain have weakened inhibition underscoring the importance of Bin1-SH3 in tuning Dyn2 fission activity. Phosphorylation of Dyn2-PRD confers resistance to Bin1 and promotes endocytosis The above data on CNM-associated Bin1 mutations indicated that Dyn2-PRD could be a regulatory hub for Dyn2 activity under physiological contexts. Given that phosphorylation of Dyn1-PRD has been known regulate Dyn1 function [Clayton et al., 2010](javascript:;); [Reis et al., 2015](javascript:;); [Slepnev et al., 1998](javascript:;)), we hypothesized that similar mechanisms operate in Dyn2-PRD. Among the putative phosphorylation sites on Dyn2-PRD, we focused on Ser848 and Ser856, two serine residues located within the pockets [Fig. pulldown assays, we found that Dyn2S848E, a phosphomimetic mutant of Dyn2-S848, had decreased binding affinity to Bin1-SH3, but not to endophilin-SH3 ( [Fig. 3, Dyn2-cotransfected C2C12 further confirmed that the activity Dyn2S848E was increased smaller tubules on liposomes similar those Dyn2WT These suggested that Dyn2-S848 is a critical residue governing Dyn2-Bin1 interaction, likely through its phosphorylation status. Of note, the S848 residue is evolutionally conserved among DNM2 genes from different vertebrates, whereas not found in zebrafish ( S2 To measure the effect of Dyn2S848 phosphorylation on endocytosis in muscle cells, we investigated the role of Dyn2S848 phosphorylation on GLUT4 endocytosis by performing subcellular C2C12 a higher ratio of GLUT4 in plasma membrane than those infected with Dyn2S848E and Dyn2WT, consistent with reduced Dyn2 activity due to Bin1-SH3 inhibition ( [Fig. 4, A and B]). Of note, the total amount of GLUT4 remained similar in cells expressing WT or mutants [Fig. S3, B and C]). membrane translocation is stimulated by insulin through the PI3K-Akt signaling cascade in muscle cells ( [Beg et [Katome et al., of Dyn2-S848 phosphorylation, we utilized L6 myoblasts to investigate the effect of Dyn2S848 phosphorylation on internalization of GLUT4-GFP with serum starvation (SS; [Lampson al., Quantification of cell surface GLUT4 by immunostaining without permeabilization showed that GLUT4 displayed a predominant intracellular distribution after 3 h of SS in Dyn2WT-expressing cells ( [Fig. 4, C-E]). Intriguingly, Dyn2S848A overexpression resulted in significantly higher HA-GLUT4-GFP level on the cell surface upon SS, whereas Dyn2S848E displayed a lower surface level of GLUT4 even with the growth medium containing 10% FBS, indicating that Dyn2S848 phosphorylation facilitates endocytosis cells, whereas phospho-resistant Dyn2S848A blocks GLUT4 We A Dyn2 mutant with a curvature-generation defect, Dyn2G537C, served as a negative control and displayed lower transferrin internalization than Dyn2WT. Similar to its effect on endogenous GLUT4 distribution, the overexpression of nor phosphomimetic mutants of Dyn2-Ser848 affect the exocytic pathway, monitored by the efficiency of transferrin recycling ( [Fig. S3, F-H]). These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of Dyn2-Ser848 enhances endocytosis in muscle cells. Phosphorylation of Dyn2-Ser848 is attenuated by insulin signaling We next sought evidence of endogenous phosphorylation of Dyn2-S848 by experiment showed significantly elevated p-Ser in precipitated HA-Dyn2WT under SS but not in HA-Dyn2S848A ( [Fig. 5, A and B]). To further pinpoint the phosphorylation site of Dyn2, we generated a specific antibody for phosphorylated Dyn2-Ser848 (named p-Dyn2S848) and detected a higher p-Dyn2S848 C2C12 myotubes after SS ( [Fig. 5 C]). Importantly, the phosphorylation of Dyn2-S848 was significantly increased by SS and reduced by insulin ( [Fig. 5, D and E]). Similar to the effect of Dyn2S848E on Bin1-GFP tubules, SS induced the fragmentation of Bin1-GFP tubules in myoblasts cotransfected with Dyn2, and this effect could be reversed by insulin ( [Fig. 5, F and G]). GSK3, predict possible kinases of Dyn2S848, insulin-PI3K-Akt ( [Cross et al., [Frame et 2001](javascript:;)). thus tested whether GSK3 increases the phosphorylation of Dyn2-Ser848 by expressing HA-Dyn2 GSK3 CA significantly enhanced p-Ser signal of HA-Dyn2WT without affecting the extent of phosphorylation of HA-Dyn2S848A 6, A and B], and [S4 B]). GSK3, which shares a high similarity in its catalytic domain with that of GSK3, might also phosphorylate Dyn2-S848 ( [Woodgett, 1990](javascript:;)). However, GSK3 effects on the phosphorylation status of S848 in HA-Dyn2WT and HA-Dyn2S848A ( [Fig. 6, C and D]), consistent with a previous report that Dyn2 is not phosphorylated by GSK3 in vitro ( [Clayton et al., 2010](javascript:;)). We further performed an in vitro kinase assay and demonstrated direct phosphorylation of Dyn2-Ser848 by recombinant GSK3 ( [Fig. 6, E and F]), which was mass spectrometry (MS) detection ( [Fig. S4 C]). effect on transferrin endocytosis, the expression of the GSK3 transferrin internalization GLUT4 distribution in L6 myoblasts, as shown by a lower ratio of cell surface HA-GLUT-GFP in cells expressing GSK3 CA ( [Fig. 7, C and D]). We also tried to observe the effect of GSK3, but the expression level of GSK3 CA and KI compared with that of their counterparts was very low ( [Fig. S4 D]); hence, we used (BRD0705) or - (TWS119) instead. inhibitor of ( [Wagner et al., 2018](javascript:;)) that selectively inhibits GSK3 mainly by forming two hydrogen bonds with Glu196, a unique residue in its kinase hinge region that that GSK3, resulted in a significantly higher ratio of HA-GLUT4-GFP on cell surface under both growth medium and SS ( [Fig. 7, E-H]). Together, these data demonstrated that phosphorylation of Dyn2-Ser848 is a critical regulatory target for Bin1-SH3 and GSK3 that tunes the endocytic and of Dyn2. Isoform-specific pharmacological inhibition GSK3 sensitivity in high-fat high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) Our findings of GSK3 isoform-specific role in regulating GLUT4 endocytosis in muscle cells led us to propose that the inhibition of GSK3 might improve insulin sensitivity in mice fed with HFHSD. 8-wk-old C57BL6/J mice were put on HFHSD and given BRD0705, the GSK3 inhibitor, (30 mg/kg/d) or vehicle by daily oral gavage since the age of 10 wk. There was no significant difference in body weight after administration of BRD0705 ( [Fig. 8 B]). HFHSD-fed mice treated with BRD0705 showed markedly improved glucose tolerance during glucose tolerance test ( [Fig. 8 C]) and improved insulin sensitivity during insulin tolerance test ( [Fig. 8 D]). We assessed the changes in phosphorylation of the Akt-GSK3-Dyn2 pathway in soleus muscle of mice treated with BRD0705 and vehicle with or without insulin injection after starvation ( [Fig. 8, E-I]). Consistent with our observation in cultured ( [Fig. 5 D]), insulin starved mice [Fig. 8 E]). Compared with vehicle control, GSK3 inhibitor-treated starved mice exhibited significantly lower basal Dyn2-S848 phosphorylation. Furthermore, insulin reduced Dyn2-S848 phosphorylation not in BRD0705-treated mice ( [Fig. 8 E]). We also analyzed the phosphorylation status insulin-signaling proteins, namely Akt, GSK3, increased insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK3S21 much lesser insulin-stimulated GSK3S9 phosphorylation ( [Fig. 8, that isoform-specific pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 improves insulin sensitivity in HFHSD-fed mice. Discussion Activation of the insulin-Akt signaling cascade is known to trigger GLUT4 vesicle exocytosis to promote glucose uptake [Tremblay et al., 2001](javascript:;); [Wang et al., 1999](javascript:;)). In this study, we reveal that insulin signaling also reduces GLUT4 endocytosis through GSK3-mediated internalization ( absence GSK3 phosphorylates Dyn2 to relieve the inhibition by endocytosis in muscle cells ( [Fig. 9], right). Given that both insulin and GLUT4 translocation ( [Richter and unappreciated role in contraction-stimulated glucose uptake in muscles. Furthermore, the integrative metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase has been protein kinase and for GLUT4 internalization in skeletal muscle. Dyn2 and Bin1 are interacting partners, and their mutations lead to the muscle-specific disease, CNM, despite their ubiquitous expression in human tissues ( [Bitoun et al., 2005](javascript:;); [B\u00f6hm of Bin1 and Dyn2 mutations underlines the importance of their regulations in muscle. Increased activity of Dyn2 in CNM-Bin1-expressing myoblasts with fragmented tubules is reminiscent of disrupted T-tubule network in mice expressing mutant Bin1 that lacks the SH3 domain ( [Fig. 2 J]; hand, CNM-associated Dyn2 mutants display enhanced fission activity due to lacking autoinhibition, which leads to disrupted T-tubules in Drosophila and mouse muscles ( [Chin et al., 2015](javascript:;); [Cowling et al., 2011](javascript:;)). The phenotypic similarities between muscles that express CNM-Bin1 and CNM-Dyn2, and the tunable Dyn2-Bin1 interaction identified in this study suggested that Dyn2 hyperactivity is a common pathogenic mechanism of CNM, which may also lead to abnormal GLUT4 distribution in patients ( [Gonz\u00e1lez-Jamett et al., 2017](javascript:;)). In line with that, both Dyn2 depletion and Bin1 overexpression could rescue CNM et al., 2019](javascript:;); [Tasfaout et al., 2017](javascript:;)). Further studies on how these three proteins physically and functionally interact in skeletal muscle would bring more insights into the pathological progression of CNM. Mammalian GSK3 comprises two isoforms, GSK3 and GSK3, that share high similarity but are not functionally redundant ( [Woodgett, 1990](javascript:;)). Knockout of the sole GSK3 homolog in Drosophila could be rescued by overexpression of human GSK3 but not human GSK3 ( [Ruel et al., 1993](javascript:;)). In mice, deletion of GSK3 results in embryonic lethality, while mice lacking GSK3 are viable and display enhanced insulin sensitivity, specifically in liver cells ( [Hoeflich et al., 2000](javascript:;); [Kerkela et al., 2008](javascript:;); [MacAulay et al., 2007](javascript:;)). The PRD of Dyn1 has been shown to be phosphorylated by GSK3 ( [Clayton et al., 2010](javascript:;)), endocytosis inhibition by GSK3 in non-small lung cancer cells gives rise to rapid, dysregulated CME, also called adaptive CME ( [Reis et al., 2015](javascript:;)). The isoform-specific regulation between GSK3 and Dyn1 is mirrored in our identification of Dyn2 as a specific substrate of GSK3, but not GSK3. More strikingly, GSK3 phosphorylation positively to Dyn1 inactivation. Pharmacological inhibitors of GSK3 have been reported to potentiate insulin action in insulin-resistant rats ( [Henriksen et al., 2003](javascript:;); [Ring et al., 2003](javascript:;)). Due to the diversity of their substrates, inhibition of both GSK3 isoforms might be detrimental as shown by the fatal consequence of GSK3 and GSK3 double deletion in mouse cardiomyocytes ( [Zhou et al., 2016](javascript:;)). There is also a concern regarding -catenin stabilization, which might arise from dual inhibition of GSK3 and GSK3 ( [Meijer et al., 2004](javascript:;); 2016](javascript:;)). The improved insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice treated with GSK3 inhibitor from our result, together with its beneficial effects on mouse models of acute myeloid leukemia and fragile X syndrome ( [McCamphill et al., 2020](javascript:;); [Wagner et al., 2018](javascript:;)), advocates potential of isoform-specific inhibition of GSK3 in ameliorating metabolic disorders or cancers. The discovery of insulin in 1921 brought hope and life to millions of people who suffer from diabetes, and the 100-year studies have revealed details of the molecular actions of this amazing hormone in cells and organisms. However, the prevalence of T2D, along with its health and socioeconomic impact, is constantly increasing. T2D is closely associated with many diseases including Alzheimer's disease due to the overlapping cellular and metabolic features shared by these two disorders, including altered glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance ( [de la Monte and Wands, 2008](javascript:;); [Frank and McNay, 2022](javascript:;)). Therefore, it is vital to have a better understanding of the molecular events downstream of the insulin. The isoform-specific function of GSK3 we uncovered here would hopefully shed light and bring unique insights into the molecular underpinnings of insulin resistance as well as its therapeutic strategy development. Materials and methods Protein expression and purification Human Dyn2 isoform 1 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells transiently transfected with various constructs and purified GST-tagged SH3 domain of amphiphysin-2. Purified dynamin was dialyzed overnight and stored in a solution containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, and 10% glycerol. Various constructs of human Bin1 isoform 8 were cloned into pGEX-4T-1 or pET30a vectors for expression in Escherichia coli and purified with glutathione Sepharose beads (GE) or Ni-NTA spin columns (Qiagen), respectively, followed by elution as recommended by the manufacturer. Mouse endophilin A1 was purified like Bin1. Preparation of lipid templates Membrane compositions used in this study were DOPC:DOPS:PI(4,5)P2 at 80:15:5 or DOPC:DOPS:PI(4,5)P2:Rh-PE at 79:15:5:1 for fluorescent-tagged membrane. For liposome preparation, lipid mixtures were dried, rehydrated in buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) and 150 mM KCl, and then subjected to three rapid freeze-thaw cycles followed by extrusion through a 0.1-\u00b5m polycarbonate membrane (Whatman) using Avanti generated by incubating 2.5-\u00b5m beads in a solution containing 100 \u00b5M fluorescent-tagged liposomes and 1 M NaCl for 30 min at room temperature with intermittent flicking. Excess unbound liposomes were washed four times with filtered water after incubation ( [Neumann et al., 2013](javascript:;)). In vitro fission assays activity of Dyn2 was measured by adding SUPER templates to the top of protein solution containing 0.5 \u00b5M Dyn2, 1 mM GTP, and indicated concentrations of in assay buffer (20 mM Hepes [pH 7.5], 150 mM KCl, and 1 mM MgCl2) for 30 min at room temperature. The mixtures were spun down at a low speed (260 \u00d7 g) in a swinging bucket rotor to separate SUPER template from the released vesicles. Fluorescence intensity was measured in a plate reader (RhPE 530/25 bandwidth). The fission activity was expressed as the fraction of released lipids from total SUPER templates. Liposome binding, TEM, and GTPase activity assays To analyze membrane binding ability, 0.5 \u00b5M Dyn2 and/or 0.5 \u00b5M Bin1 were and 100 nm liposomes at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. Pellets containing liposome-bound proteins were separated from soluble fractions containing unbound proteins (supernatant) by centrifugation at 15,000 \u00d7 g in 7.5], KCl). and supernatant were on SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and protein intensities were quantified using ImageJ. Membrane binding ability was expressed as the fraction of membrane-bound proteins divided by total proteins. To visualize protein assembly on membrane, 1 \u00b5M Dyn2 and/or 1 \u00b5M Bin1 were incubated with 25 \u00b5M liposome for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The mixture was then adsorbed onto the surface of glow-discharged (30 s), carbon film-supported grids (200 mesh copper) for 5 min followed by a 2-min negative-staining with 2% uranyl acetate. Images were captured with a Hitachi H-7650 electron microscope operated at 75 kV and a nominal magnification of 150,000\u00d7. Liposome tubule diameter was measured using ImageJ. \u00b5M with 0.5 \u00b5M Bin1 or endophilin in a reaction mixture containing 150 \u00b5M liposomes, 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM KCl, MgCl2, and mM GTP at 37\u00b0C. Liposome-stimulated GTPase activity of Dyn2 was measured as a function of time using a colorimetric malachite green assay, which monitors the release of ( [Leonard et al., 2005](javascript:;)). GST pulldown assay To analyze SH3-PRD binding affinity, purified His-Bin1 proteins first incubated with 100 nm liposomes containing 5% PI(4,5)P2 to alleviate the autoinhibition between SH3 domain and PI motif before being incubated with GST or GST-tagged PRD of Dyn2 immobilized on glutathione beads for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, the beads were boiled in sample buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.025% bromophenol -mercaptoethanol), by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. ImageJ software was used to quantify of relative of Bin1 or endophilin was performed in a similar manner without the presence of 100 nm liposomes. Cell (CRL-1772; ATCC) were cultured in medium composed of high glucose (4.5 mg/ml) DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 90% confluency, C2C12 differentiation was induced by replacing growth medium with differentiation medium (DM) composed of high glucose (4.5 mg/ml) DMEM supplemented with 1 horse serum (Gibco). The first time cells were incubated in DM was regarded as day 0 of differentiation. Rat-derived L6 myoblasts (CRL-1458; ATCC) were cultured in supplemented with antibiotics and 10% cells at 70% were interest using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or TransIT-X2 (Mirus Bio) as suggested by the manufacturers. For lentiviral infection, C2C12 myoblasts at 50% confluency were infected with viruses in the presence of 12 \u00b5g/ml polybrene followed by puromycin (2 \u00b5g/ml) selection 24 h after infection for 3 d before DM (containing 2% FBS) replacement. 10 \u00b5g/ml doxycycline was added to day-3-differentiated C2C12, and GLUT4 distribution in cells was analyzed at day 6 of differentiation.
