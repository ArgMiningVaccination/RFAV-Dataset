Progress and outputs Executive summary - Provide essential information about the progress and the outputs produced during the lifetime of the project. Write in a straightforward, clear and concise narrative style. 1. Introduction of the main advancements of the project Bio-Cultural Protocols (BCP s) have been generated by the traditional livestock keeping communities maintaining the local breeds viz., Pulikulam cattle, Kharai camel and Attappady black goat in India. Awareness has been created on the importance of conserving four local breeds including maintaining pure breeding males (Pulikulam cattle, Kharai camel, Boti sheep, Attappady black goat) through workshops, training to livestock keepers, organising animal health camps, testing and val ue addition of animal products . Registration of two breeds viz. Pulikulam cattle and Kharai camel has been completed by forwarding the applications along with breed descriptors and registration numbers are issued by National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resour ces, Karnal. Local state governments through their animal husbandry departments in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat came forward for taking up Pulikulam cattle and Kharai camel breed conservation respectively through resource allocation in future in collaboration wi th partner NGOs. These steps are expected to arrest the declining trend of breed population while contributing towards long term conservation of local breeds to the extent possible. 2. Activities undertaken (please put as annexes workshop proceedings, list of participants, pictures, etc.) 1. Breed Documentation Through Community Meetings and Discussions FAO project was launched officially with the participation of pastoralists / livestock keepers, government officials, dairy cooperative representatives and m edia at four places viz. Madurai Sadri -Rajasthan and Attappady -Kerala. It was inaugurated by Dr BK Joshi, Director, National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR) on 19th June 2013 at Pillar Hall, Madurai (for more details r efer the minutes of workshop, list of participants in Annexure 1). There was a discussion on the salient features and characterization of breeds, advantages of rearing the local breed, value of animal products, registration formalities of local breeds and how FAO gives importance to community based conservation of the four local breeds through f unding strategy for the implementation of the Global Plan of Action for animal genetic resources. This was followed by cluster level meetings with pastoralists on pl anning for sampling of animals for preparation of breed descriptors, understanding their genuine issues related with grazing, drinking water and health status related with the specific breed of animals. It is a challenging task to undertake our activities when there was a downward trend in the population of four local breeds for reasons like shrinkage of grazing land, water availability, non availability of labour, lack of marketing and transport facilities for selling animal products, less demand for wool of sheep, non - availability of pure breeding bucks and loss of interest among the younger generation. 2. Preparation of breed descriptors including their geographic distribution We have selected villages / habitats for identifying the pastoralists' f amilies and their animal herds for taking physical measurements of Pulikulam cattle in Tamil Nadu, Kharai camels in Kutch, in Rajasthan and Attappady black goat in Kerala. Sample size, method of recording the Page 3 data and tools for measurements were decided with the assistance of Project Advisory Committee (PAC) members and their occasional involvement in this process of recording data in the respective breeding tracts. The breed descriptors for the four breeds have been completed and they are shown in Annexure 2. Pulikulam cattle have been maintained only in migratory herds. We therefore surveyed the herds and updated our earlier survey conducted during 2008 and 2012. The survey has been conducted in Madurai, Sivagangai, Virudhunagar and Theni dis tricts. Each herd consists of about 70 - 500 animals. There are 175 herders in 15 villages in these districts. We have selected the herds for phenotypic measurement of 100 animals (height at withers, body length, chest girth, ear length, tail length, horn length) and data were recorded. Herd profiles were prepared for selected herds. It includes population of adults, calves, heifers, cows, bulls, income from herds / economics through selling of calves, manure and migratory route followed by them etc. For th is purpose we interviewed elder pastoralists in the breeding tract of Pulikulam cattle in villages viz. Idayapatti, U.Vadipatti and Manangathan. Kharai camels exist in the coastal region of Kutch in Gujarat. For physical characterisation and body measureme nts data has been collected from 150 Kharai camels which includes 78 adult females, 6 adult males (age above 4 years) and 73 calves (42 male and 31 female calves, age below 4 years) for parameters like hair on ear and eyelid, hair length, head size, depres sion above eyes, forehead (normal/prominent), muzzle and lips, chest pad, hump size, milk vein from 39 females, neck length, distance between eyes, length of forelegs, length of hind legs, foot pad length (fore and hind), foot pad width (fore and hind) etc . Similarly for physical characterisation data have been collected from 100 Kharai female camels for parameters like colour of coat, muzzle, eyelids and tail switch, tail length, foot pad colour, hair on ear, length and orientation of ear, forehead shape, face length, body size and udder shape and size, teat shape and teat tip etc. For the Boti sheep survey, a total of 91 households in 13 villages in Bali and Desuri Tehsils of Pali district were surveyed in Rajasthan. (The details of household wise survey p articulars are shown in Annexure -2C). However, it quickly became clear that the Boti sheep has almost disappeared in the last ten years and that the local herds are now entirely dominated by what is called \"Bhagli\" sheep, which corresponds to another one i n the vicinity i.e. scientific \"Sonadi\" breed. Shepherds are now using Bhagli rams exclusively, because of the much higher growth rates and quick maturity of this breed whose lambs are generally sold at one month of age. In the survey area, there are only two families that are still using Boti rams - one in Bhadras (Mr Dhana Ram - he took over from his father Mr Hakmaram, recipient of a Breed Saviour Award during 2009 with 120 heads) and three in Sesli (Dhiraram and 2 brothers) with a total of 227 sheep. T hus there are an estimated 350 fairly pure breed Boti sheep still available although at endangered level. Measurements of \"Boti\" sheep initially recorded turned out not to be genuine Boti sheep, but crosses which maintained some Boti traits, such as the pe culiar short and tubular ears as well as the black markings. These characteristics stand out, as the Bhagli sheep is characterised by long pendular ears and red markings. Breed descriptor has been revised for Boti sheep based on comments from Project Advis ory Committee when the population is reduced drastically (refer Boti sheep breed report in Annexure 2 C). Attappady black goat exists in the Attappady block of Palakkad district in Kerala. This breed is being kept by local hill tribes, viz. Irulas, Mudugas and Kurumbas . Survey was done for physical characterization of selected samples viz. bucks (6), does (10), kids male (9 -15), kids female (6 - 14) for recording of chest -girth, body length, height at withers (for details refer breed descriptor of Page 4 Attappady black goat in Annexure -2D). Project Advisory Committee's suggestion to increase the sample size to 100 goats could not be undertaken as it is an already registered breed with sufficient data existing in earlier studies. We surveyed 228 houses from 26 haml ets and found that pure Attappady goats are only 23 percent of the total goats. The decrease was drastic. A measurement study to assess the size of the goats revealed a decrease in the size over years. The reasons could be more environmental than genetic as 91.2 percent of famers depend upon open grazing for feeding their stock. The Adivasis now work as labourers outside their hamlets, thus deviating from their earlier livelihood systems. More than 80 percent men work as hired labourers and young people are reluctant to take up goat rearing. A survey on use of bucks showed that only 27 percent owners are using Attappady Black bucks and 73 percent use crossbred or other breed bucks. Ten Attappady bucks were distributed during the project period to 10 goat owners who assured to replace the bucks of other breeds. 3. Conducting workshops with livestock keepers and government officials at field level We have organised workshops followed by group meetings with pastoralists as indicated in activity -1. Government officials from state department of animal husbandry and dairying, representatives of Indian Council of Agricultural Research Institutes / Veterinary Universities, dairy cooperatives, NGOs and breeders associations actively participated in the workshops an d helped to concretize and contribute to our action plan as envisaged in our activities schedule. The government officials appreciated the role of NGOs which is very crucial in mobilizing communities for conserving agricultural biodiversity at field level. They assured to extend all moral and physical support wherever possible to achieve the objectives of the project. Finally animal husbandry departments in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat conceded in future resource allocation towards conservation of Pulikulam cattl e and Kharai camels in their respective states (refer Annexure 8). 4. Providing training on primary health care, preventive treatment and first aid for animals We have organized two days training programme on primary health care, seasonality of occurren ce of disease and preventive measures including herbal treatment of animals in the breeding tracts of four breeds. This was followed by organising animal health camps in selected villages for deworming and treatment for FMD (Pulikulam cattle), Trypanosomio sis & Dermatitis (Kharai camels) and PPR (Boti sheep). A total of 1521 camels owned by 36 breeders were treated in Lakhpat, Mundra and Abdasa taluks of Kutch in Gujarart. For details, refer to Annexure 6A. After initiation of our health care related activi ties, animal husbandry departments in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu now started to collaborate with our partner NGOs for regular supply of veterinary medicines for treatment of the breed population. 5. Training on value added products We organised t raining programme for 12 women and demonstrated how to prepare dhoop or incense blocks by using cow dung and cow urine as ingredients in addition to other herbal ingredients. After the training,, a lady is able to earn income by selling the products on par t time basis. We also demonstrated local farmers on the preparation of organic liquid fertilizers (Panchagavya , Amirthapani , herbal pesticide) using the urine, dung and milk products of native cattle (refer Annexure 3A). Value addition of camel milk has b een initiated by collecting milk samples from 37 Kharai camels in Jangi and Tehro villages of Bhuj district. The samples were tested for milk fat percentage and SNF percentage (refer table in Annexure 3B); lactation length was recorded by interviewing 50 Kharai camel breeders. Small scale selling of camel milk by few local vendors is being encouraged by supporting two vendors to open a tea stall in Bhuj city and also in Nakhatrana Page 5 town for selling about 75 litres of camel milk per day. This gives scope to scale up camel milk marketing by linking with Kutch District Co -operative milk producers Union Ltd. and the process is on . In the breeding tract of Boti sheep it has been observed that the wool of Boti sheep which retains a relatively high percentage of Boti blood, has high lustre and represents good quality carpet wool. This wool is being mixed with camel wool experimentally to produce rugs that represent threatened animal genetic resources. LPPS also looks into developing a breeding programme for upgrading the quality of Bhagli wool by introducing Boti sheep genes. In Attappady goat a preliminary meat analysis study on slaughter traits and fatty acid profile of the meat was taken up for the first time. The dressing percent of Attappady black goats u nder the free range system is 41% which is lower than Malabari goats. But the meat fetches a higher price in the markets especially of those in cities like Cochin, Kerala. Fatty acids observed were saturated as well as unsaturated. Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatt y acids were quantified and the ratio of Omega3 to Omega 6 is 1: 4 which is much lower to 4 and therefore looks good. (refer Meat Studies in Annexure 3D). Project Management Team and Project Advisory Committee We have formed a Project Advisory Committee (PAC) to provide technical consultancy and suggestions in the field level implementation of programmes. The project team with Project Investigators of respective breeds and NGOs and also the names of advisory committee members are shown in Annexure 9. Besid es, we correspond and interact with PAC members through e -mail on developing indicators for monitoring the progress and outcome of project activities, preparation of report and sorting out issues if any, that come across in order to smoothly implement the project. First meeting of PAC was held at WOTR Training Centre in Darewadi of Maharashtra on 4th July 2013 (refer Annexure 9A). This meeting helped to understand the field realities faced by respective NGOs, provided suggestions on survey format, sample si ze for breed descriptors and to finalise the draft indicators plan. The 2nd PAC meeting was held on 9 -4-2014 at NBAGR, Karnal (refer Annexure 9B) and the 3rd PAC meeting was held on 13 -2-2015 at Madras Veterinary College in Chennai (refer Annexure 9C). We are attaching the minutes of PAC meeting in Annexure 9. 3. The extent to which outputs have been achieved (p lease fill the work plan status in Section II) Outputs Participatory breed documentation completed In four breeding tracts we organised workshops involving all the stakeholders including pastoralists and BCPs have been prepared for 3 breeds (due to drastic reduction of population of Boti sheep and very few breeders BCP was not prepared for Boti sheep) and printed 1000 copies for two bre eds (Pulikulam cattle and Kharai camel) in English and in local language . Report on breed conservation, their associated Ecosystems, grazing land and traditional practices completed Breed population, grazing lands, production system and few traditional practices are recorded in the individual breedwise reports and also reflected in viz. Breed descriptors, breed survey, case studies, stories and BCPs (refer Annexure 2, 4, 5). Page 6 Value added products marketed In order to promote value added products we i nitiated production of dhoop sticks for women members, demonstration of organic liquid fertilizer preparation by using cow products , testing of sheep wool, camel milk testing and studies on goat meat on pilot scale basis which will enable future marketing for better remuneration for the community members. We have field tested on pilot basis by opening tea stall for selling camel milk and milk products in two places viz. Bhuj and Nakhatrana in Kutch, introduction of breeding bucks for Attappady tribal beneficiaries, i nitiating nucleus breeding unit for Pulikulam cattle bree d at Shri Krishna Gau shala Trust in Kakkivadanpatti village , which we achieved with the contribu tions of partner organizations ( though there is no provision in the existing budget head ). Mortality rate of animals minimised Animal health care camps organised in selected villages for deworming and treatment cattle) sheep) have minimised mortality rates and oriented pastoralists in preventive and primary animal health care and expected improving the health status of local breed population in the long run . 4. Description of the project impacts, including benefits obtained by local stakeholders and particularly indicating if impacts were particularly beneficial for women and/or children Bio-Cultural Protocols (BCP s) have been generated by the traditional livestock keeping communities who are maintaining the local breeds viz., Pulikul am cattle, Kharai camel and Attappady black goat in India. Awareness has been generated on the importance of conserving the four local breeds including maintaining pure breeding males (Pulikulam cattle, Kharai camel, Boti sheep, Attappady black goat) throu gh workshops, training to livestock keepers, organising animal health camps, testing and value addition of animal products. All these programmes served as a platform and enabled the livestock keepers interact informally with officials so that their inputs included in holistic development of breed is achieved. Animal health camps and orientation on primary health care of animals reduced the mortality of animals from infectious diseases and it is expected to improve the health status of the animals in the lon g run. Registration of two breeds viz. Pulikulam cattle, Kharai camel have been completed and due to this the local state Government is able to allocate resources which will help the breed keeping communities for breed development in future. Distribution o f 10 pure bucks of Attappady black goat to poor tribal beneficiaries including women and disabled, incentives for 12 camel breeders (valued at 1545USD), capacity building of two local milk vendors by opening two tea stalls for selling camel milk in Bhuj ci ty and Nakhatrana, conserving 10 heifers and males of Puliukulam cattle in a private Gaushala Trust and earning income by woman in dhoop stick making activity using the dung of Pulikulam cattle are few of the direct benefits realized to our beneficiaries t o quote. In the case of Attappady black goat it is expected that the progenies born to the distributed pure breeding bucks will have more characters of Attappady Black goats . Other owners are likely to adopt this buck selection method. If owners are to prefer Attappady goats and rear them the market values of the pure goats are to be much higher. Page 7 In order to promote value added products preliminary testing of sheep wool, ca mel milk and goat meat have been undertaken to enable future marketing and to bring better remuneration for the community members. Sahjeevan our partner NGO is collaborating with state animal husbandry department and Kutch District Co -operative milk produ cers Union Ltd for promoting marketing of camel milk by procuring camel milk with better rate or price from Kutch camel pastoralists may improve the economic status of camel breeders and attract younger generation to look into the traditional profession of camel breeding as a viable venture . Initial testing through capacity building capacity building of two local milk vendors by opening two tea stalls for selling camel milk in Bhuj city and Nakhatrana during November 2014 created greater awareness and p ublicity for consumption of camel milk inturn good demand and better milk procurement rate offered in future with camel pastoralists . Now additional two more camel milk stalls are on the way with local initiatives after our initiation. The awareness camps and camel health camps organised during FAO project period with camel herders ( 1521 camels owned by 36 breeders were treated in Lakhpat, Mundra, Abdasa taluks of Kutch in Gujarart) also made the local animal husbandry department to mainstream it by free supply of medicines for treating the animals against Trypanosomiasis and Dermatitis. Description of how the project has increased the likelihood for survival of the breed(s) involved The awareness about the value of the local breed through our workshops h as started prompting the owners to retain the population in a situation when people are leaving traditional livestock keeping. New farmers are procuring local breed of Pulikulam cattle for using the cow products for enhancing soil fertility or for practici ng organic farming . More than 120 farmers enquired about the value of Pulikulam cattle breed and 15 fa rmers procured 12 - 15 months old calves numbering few hundred from the cattle herders. This is a major shift from selling calves for slaughter purpose to p roductive organic farming. Recently the animal husbandry department procured 2 bulls of Pulikulam breed and they are used for producing semen at Hosur Govt Cattle Farm, and the semen is made available in Madurai district. Sri Krishna Gaushala Trust came forward to establish nucleus breeding unit with a proposed 50 animals and now 10 calves have been procured (refer future conservation plan of Pulikulam cattle in Annexure 8A). These initiatives together will ensure maintaining pure Pulikulam cattle breed p opulation at least at threshold level. During our discussion with Tamil Nadu forest department officials it has been decided to study further for making amendments in the Forest Working Plan(earlier 10 years plan closed the forests from grazing till 2016) to allow traditional grazing in forests with the consent of 3 village forest committees in Madurai district. This, if implemented in the near future, will morally motivate the cattle herders to upkeep their traditional lifestyle with their migratory herd s including seasonal migration to forests during rainy season. In the case of Attappady black goat it is expected that the progenies born to the distributed pure breeding bucks will have more characters of Attappady black goats. Other owners are likely t o adopt this buck selection method. If owners are to prefer Attappady goats and rear them the market values value of the pure goats are to be much higher. The Attappady tribals have a hope that the market value of goats will rise higher and goat rearing wo uld become a Page 8 profitable enterprise. Many people in different parts of Kerala state have started rearing Attappadi goat. (See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brhcB5myoew Black beauties of Attappady where the P.I. of the project is participating) With regular camel show s, camel health camps, cultural events with camel pastoral ists jointly organized in association with camel breeders association of is in the right track towards conservation of Kharai camel breed. It has brought together most of the camel pastoralists not only from different region of K utch but also from other districts like Jamnagar, Bhavnagar, Bharuch, Khambat and Okha. Many con sumers tasted ca mel milk and milk products and gave positive feedback as a health product to be made available at their doorsteps . Gujarat Govt has decided to collaborate with local initiatives through their participation such as annual camel events includ ing camel shows regularly and this will provide a conducive environment for the camel breeders along with their breed to survive. On 31 Dec 2015 C hief Minister of Gujarat state Smt.Anandiben Patel herself honoure d the occasion of camel mega show by releasing booklet on Kharai camel at C hala village near Bhuj . Selling camels for draught purpose in urban areas of Kutch fetch es good income for breeders and this is the area which needs detailed study and this component is incorporated in the new joint proposal (refer future plan of conservation of Kharai camel in Kutch in Annexure 8B and Annexure 11 ), 5. Indicate any plans that have been put in place to ensure long term sustainability of project related activities. Registration of two breeds viz. Pulikulam cattle, Kharai camel have been completed and due to these formalities local state Government is able to allocate resources which will directly benefit the breed keeping communities for breed development . We are showing the detailed future plan for conservation of two breeds viz. Pulikulam cattle and Kharai came ls in Annexure 8. (Rs.1.56 million is allocated for Pulikulam cattle breed conservation in Tamil Nadu while it is Rs. 40 million for conservation of Kharai camels). In Kharai camel breed conservation It is expected that 250 breeders will produce at least 7 50 breeding males in three years which then could be exchanged with other rearers. Sahjeevan and KUUMS will implement this activity with technical assistance from the animal husbandry department. Pilot tested buck distribution programme in Attappady, Kera la has to be continued if the breed has to sustain. With pure Attappady black goat population the income earning capacity of the tribals improves as Attappady black goat meat has consumer preference and hence has more marketing value. Due to intensive awa reness programmes more than 35 farmers enquired about the value of Pulikulam cattle breed and 15 famers procured 12 -15 months old calves numbering few hundred from the cattle herders. This is a major shift from selling calves for slaughter purpose to produ ctive organic farming. Recently the animal husbandry department has procured 2 bulls of Pulikulam breed and they are producing semen at Hosur cattle breeding farm, and the semen is made available in Madurai district. Local Gaushala Trust has come forward t o establish nucleus breeding unit with proposed 50 animals and now 10 calves have been procured (refer future conservation plan of Pulikulam cattle in Annexure 8A). These initiatives in tandem will ensure maintaining pure Pulikulam cattle breed population at least at threshold level. Page 9 6.

Problems encountered and actions taken to resolve them If relevant, please explain delays or any obstacles that hindered you to deliver so far, and which a ctions you have taken to keep to the original work plan and time schedule 1. Explanation for any instances where progress was behind schedule and plans undertaken to rectify problems and assure completion of all activities Initially one partner NGO, Vechur Conservation Trust (VCT) has no permission to receive foreign grants under Foerign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) and it delayed release of funds to VCT (later arranged through LPPS by signing formal agreement as needed for our internal system for flo w of funds) and by that time monsoon began in Kerala which further delayed implementation process in Attappady black goat conservation till October 2013. Delayed release of second instalment of funds during February 2015 (at the last quarter of the origina l project ending period) from FAO has forced us to extend the project period by 8 months i.e. from 24 months to 32 months ending 31 December 2015 through an amendment in Letter Of Agreement During 2013 Tamil Nadu faced severe drought leading to drinking wa ter scarcity for cattle which usually depend on rain fed tanks situated in the migratory route of Pulikulam cattle. Pastoralists have penned their cattle where open wells with pump -set facilities are available by paying cost of water for drinking purpose. One herder had disposed hundreds of cattle as he was unable to manage them due to the same reason. We prepared a co -founding proposal for providing drinking water through installations of bore well units at 3 locations in Madurai and Sivagangai districts and submitted this to Tamil Nadu Livestock Development Agency which has been approved recently, but funds would be made available only during next financial year 2014 -2015. We have been taking up the issue of grazing permission for traditional pastoralists to graze their animals in forests for many years as per the provision stipulated in Forest Rights Act 2006. Since there is no tangible outcome so far, we have now prepared a memorandum for taking up the issue at policy level. (refer memorandum submitted to Prime Minister for Pulikulam cattle and Kharai camel pastoralists grazing permission in Annexure 10). We are also negotiating withthe Forest Department of Tamil Nadu to allot 3 village forest committees in Tamil Nadu for local breeders associ ation to enable holistic resource management of conservation of both wild and domesticated biodiversity. Camel rearing is not economically attractive for younger generation and therefore no youth is interested in supporting their families to continue keepi ng of camels in Kutch region. The demand for camels for transport purpose is almost reduced and milk marketing is not providing adequate income security for them. However, the recent collaboration with Sharhad Dairy for marketing of camel milk may bring ad ditional income for camel breeders through value addition and premium price for camel milk. Opening of 2 tea stalls in cities viz. Bhuj and Nakhatrana for selling camel milk through capacity building of 2 local milk vendors is an initiative started during November 2014. These two stalls daily utilize 75 liters of camel milk procured from camel pastoralists. This has generated much awareness and publicity and inturn In Bhuj city 2 more camel milk shop have been started by other private entrepreneurs after se eing our initial success experienced by us. This will also lead to scaling up this venture which in turn will provide income security to camel pastoralists, and thereby will attract younger generation in future Both cities are known for visit by many touri st. The camel milk tea stalls sell fresh camel milk, masala milk, coffee, tea using camel milk, and daily utilize 75 liters of camel milk procured from camel pastoralists. This has generated much awareness and publicity and inturn In Bhuj city 2 more camel milk shop have been started by other private entrepreneurs after seeing our initial success experienced by us. Page 16 In Attappady black goat area there are other issues: difficult to get good surveyors in Attappady area; genetic dilution of the Attappady black goat breed; shrinking of grazing land due to cultivation; restriction of entry to forest land; water scarcity in certain areas; new breeds introduced by settlers and Government; lack of awareness among the tribals about the value of the breed and marketin g methods; shortage of veterinary support including medicines and vaccines according to the tribals. However initiatives undertaken in the FAO project viz awareness meetings, orientation on primary health care of animals, preventive treatments, pure bucks distribution programme for tribal beneficiaries, meat studies to focus value of meat of Attappady black goat etc are expected to increase the population level to a considerable extent. The population of Boti sheep is less than 1,000 and as per NBAGR guidel ines this breed cannot be registered. Therefore sending application for registration of Boti sheep is not necessary. LPPS has earlier prepared bio -cultural protocol for the Raika communities and their animal genetic resources in general including Boti shee p breed conserved by them. Therefore preparation of bio-cultural protocol for Boti sheep breed is not required. The committee members agreed that as the population is very low (200 -300), the Raika community nowadays is not interested in keeping Boti sheep breed. However the budget allocated for preparation of BCP was utilized for testing of wool and this has been accepted in the last PAC meeting held at Chennai (refer Annexure 9C). 2. Description of any changes that were not on original workplan ( no additional funds will be available) Procurement of pure male and female animals for distribution to beneficiaries (Pulikulam cattle and Attappady goat) have been made with the contribution received from partner NGOs as there is no provision for this in budget heads . Similarly Incentives for camel breeders for measuring physical characters and capacity building of 2 camel milk vendors through establishing a tea stall at Bhuj during November 2014 have been supported by them. However, these initiatives giv e us hope not only for survival of local breeds but in turn to bring income security to the breeds keeping communities. 3. Lessons learned For conservation of Attappady black goat, good initiative such as working with them in their areas and spheres is requir ed to gain the confidence of the Adivasis in Attappady region. Nowadays livestock rearing undergoes drastic changes with changes in the life style of the Adivasis. The potential of the valuable Attappady goats is not fully known to them and the project wor k was very useful in this direction. It is not enough to undertake occasional conservation efforts, but a very planned and continuous work is essential if Attappady Black goats are to exist. Incentives in the form of developing markets are the best way to keep the livestock keepers in this vocation / avocation . Attappady goats are profitable in the present low input system, but with higher inputs more income receiving methods can be adopted. Only the presence of good breeding bucks can save the breed. Uniqu e values if any in this goat meat has to be explored and exploited in future. This is not just for conservation, but for sustainable use, possibly including medicinal use. It is felt that intensive studies are required in all populations. One example is th at the Attappady Black goats which remained unknown to the world is looked upon with interest only due to studies and publications. Marketing outlet of camel milk through opening camel milk tea stall initiated during November 2014 by selling 40 -45 litres of milk has given further scope to scale up this initiative at higher Page 17 level. NGOs shall always work as a facilitator by experimenting with small initiatives or strengthening an initiative or innovations developed by the community members. Jumping to a bigger project in milk marketing without pilot testing will be a risky venture and will drain our time and resources. The awareness camps and camel health camps organised during FAO project period with camel herders ( 1521camels owned by 36 breeders were treat ed in Lakhbat, Mundra and Abdasa taluks of Kutch in Gujarart) also made the local animal husbandry department to mainstream it by free supply of drugs for vaccinating the animals against Trypanosomiasis and Dermatitis. The awareness about the value of the local breed has started prompting the owners to retain the population in a situation when people are leaving traditional livestock keeping. New farmers are procuring local breed of Pulikulam cattle for using the cow products for enhancing the fertility of soil or for practicing organic farming . More than 35 farmers enquired about the value of Pulikulam cattle breed and 15 famers procured 12 -15 months old calves from the cattle herders. This is a major shift from selling the Pulikulam cattle for slaughter p urpose to productive organic farming. However, the animal husbandry department in Tamil Nadu does not recognize the initiatives of the NGO as genuine partners and allocation of funds for conservation of Pulikulam cattle breed through partnership is not smo oth which depletes our energy as regular follow up and moving files is cumbersome process. (refer future conservation of Pulikulam cattle breed in Annexure 8A) During our discussion with Tamil Nadu forest department officials it has been decided to study further for making amendments in the forest Working Plan to allow traditional grazing in forests with the consent of 3 village forest committees in Madurai district. This if implemented in the near future will morally motivate the cattle herders to upkeep t heir traditional lifestyle with their migratory herds. However, this is a very slow process and we can't expect better outcome by working with Tamil Nadu forest department as their functionaries not at all oriented in participatory process. IV.

It is not surprising that livestock has turned into one of the world's largest threat s to the environment, to biodiversity, and even to food security. But it does not need to be that way: Livestock can also be beneficial to the environment and be a valuable tool for the conse rvation of biological diversity. It is all a question of management! In this respect we can learn much from those people who have a long tradition of livestock keeping in tune with the availability of natural resources - people who practice animal culture rather than agriculture. The Raika represent one of the largest groups of livestock herders in India. The Raika are a Hindu Caste specialised in livestock breeding and they are livin g in the Marwar area of Rajasthan. Traditionally associated with camel breeding, a majority of Raika is currently engaged in herding sheep; in sedentary and migratory systems. They have managed to thrive in harsh, semi -desert environment and have developed innovativeness, flexibility and specialised knowledge which are necessary to breed sheep. They have developed hardy livestock breeds and a complex social web that revolves around their animals. But external factors are pushing the Raika to the limits of t heir resourcefulness and threatening their livelihood with extinction, including their traditional livestock breeds. \"The Raika are not mentioned in connection with sheep -breeding in early records and the switch to this occupation probably post -dates the middle of the 19 th century since prior to this date sheep wool was not a marketable good\" (Kumar quoted in K\u00f6hler -rollefson, 1999; p 310) In migratory system s, the Raika wander around with their herds for about nine months but return to their permanent home for about three months every year. In se dentary system s the Raika go grazing every day around their village and come back home in the evening. Picture 1: Raika and his wife with Boti sheep . In Raika families, all members have different and precise tasks. Men are mostly involved in feeding, taking animals for grazing and cutting fodder trees. In case th e family has animals that don't go grazing, women take the responsibility of collecting gre en grass. I. Background The Boti was first ''discovered'' and described during a research project by Dutch student Ellen Geerlings (2001) when she undertook a study on the ethnoveterinary knowledge of the Raika, more tha n ten years ago. ''Boti'' was the local term for a breed that initially was thought to corresp ond to the M arwari sheep breed, because of similarities in colour pattern and ear shape. However, it eventually became evident that the Boti sheep is distinct from the Marwari breed. First, it is kept by a diff erent sub community, the Godwar Raika, whereas the Marwari sheep is kept by the Maru Raika. Since neither of these groups traditionally sold female sheep to anybody outside their communities, a genetic barrier existed between the two. S econdly, the Boti sheep is phenotypically distinct from Marwari sheep, being of much smaller in body size. Since it was observed that Raika sheep breeders were crossing the Boti sheep with rams of the Bhagli breed that they o btained on their migrations to southern Rajasthan and to Malva (in Madhya Pradesh), i t was thought appropriate to in clude conservation activities for the Boti breed in the FAO project on conserving indigenous breeds. II. Local and Sustainable B reed: Boti A. Origin of Boti S heep : The Boti breed was abundant until several decades ago. It is said that Sindhi Muslim s brought Boti sheep from the Sindh area (present day Pakistan) to Jaisalmer some centuries ago. During that time, when Raika s were migrating from Jaisalmer they began to bring back with them Boti sheep to Marwar area. Boti sheep possess behavioral patterns that enable them to optimally use their environments, since they have been subject to strong natural selection pressure, due to very hard environmental conditi ons where they are originating. Picture 2: Boti ram B. Qualities of Boti S heep : The Boti breed is distinguished by a black face, white body color, a small to medium sized body, short tail, very short ears, small udder, thick skin and above all, fine luscious and lustrous wool. According t o the sheep breeders, the \"Boti\" (\"smal l eared \") breed is better able to survive droughts and cope with lack of food than the \"Bhagli\" sheep. Officially s cientist s have declared Marwari breed as being equivalent to Boti breed , but they are kept by a differen t sub community and B oti has much smaller bod y. Boti is also referred to as \"Janchi \" and ''Vannermi'' (meaning from the forest, i.e. looking like Hanuman langurs). It s cheeks are also puffy like those of Hanuman. What the Raika say about the breed: The h air is long and fine and the woo l yield is double than that of the B hagli breed. But this breed has a very low milk yield, and the lambs often need to be supplemented with goat milk. The meat of this sheep is very dark, like that of a wild animal. The Boti sheep can withstand hunger and drought and d oes not suffer much disease. It is good in hilly areas. It can endure pain, and if it has F oot and Mouth Disease (F MD) or thorns in the foot, it can keep walking, if necessary even on three legs, whereas the B hagli sheep just lies down and dies. The Boti breed also has no problem in dealing with rains and water in the kada (pen), whereas Bhagli and Dumi always need dry gr ound. C. Reproduction : The Boti breed generally has one lamb per lambing. The growth rate of the lambs is relatively slow because of low milk production, but ewes go on producing milk well in dry season when other breeds have stopped. Raika s often use goat milk to feed lambs. Boti ewes also live very long and give up to 10 lambs. This breed is perceived by shepherds to produce a higher number of lambs during its life time than other breeds because of short parturition intervals and its long productive li fe span. In good years, this breed provides three lambs in two years. D. Production : Main source of income derived from sheep husbandry come from the sale of lambs for slaughter, s econdly from the sale of dung and thirdly from the sale of wool. Milk is also sold occasionally, but mostly used for home consumption to prepare tea and ghee. a. Lambs: Generally the male lambs are kept at home and milk fed until an age of 3 to 4 months, then they are sold to slaughterer (Khatik or Muslim communi ty) and if not sold, they are taken for grazing until they are sold. They are growing slowly but finally their meat gets fatter and tastier. Sheep meat is not popular in Rajasthan. T herefore Raika s depend on middleman to market live animal s, which are usually exported to big cities . Picture 3: Boti lamb b. Dung : Dung is sold or exchanged for grains (wheat). It is sold per tractor trolley (about 400 to 800 Kg of dung). c. Wool : Wool production ranges from 200 to 250 grams per shearing and they get more or less 10 to 15 rupees per animal. Production depends highly on feed intake and size of the sheep. Shearing is done three time s per year because huge amount of thorns and twigs get accumulate d in the wool . d. Milk : The Boti generally yields 200 -250 grams of milk per milking during lactation. III. Research M ethods A. Geographic Location : Rajasthan is a state in no rthwestern India, (see Picture 4 ). It covers 342, 239 square kilometers and is the second largest state in the country. The state has a long border with Pakistan, and contains a large area of desert. Within the arid and semi -arid part s of Rajasthan, annual rainfall varies from 100 mm near Jaisalmer in the extreme w est to 450 mm at its eastern boundary. Rainfall occurs mostly during the monsoon months from July to September. \"With 48 persons and 80 heads of livestock per square kilometer, the Great Indian (Thar) Desert (61% of the all desert su rface in India) was by the 1970's supporting a higher density of human and livestock populations than any physically similar area in the world\" (K\u00f6hler -Rollefson, 1999) . Our survey was done in the Godwar area of Pali district which is situated in south -central Rajasthan (s ee Picture 5 ) and it is bordered by Mewar in the south -east and Jalore and Sirohi in the south -west. It is a zone characterized by extreme cultural and ecological diversity. The Raika are densely distributed in this area and form a significant part of the population. Most of Raika families settle around the wild life sanctuary of K umbhalgarh. They call this area \"the forest\" and they go there for grazing . But over the years, they lost their grazing rights and now a National Park is being established which will create further uncertainty. Picture 4: Map of India Picture 5: Map of Rajasthan with all district s B. Survey and Breed Descriptor: After developing a household questio nnaire, LPPS staff initiated its survey in June 2013. A total of 91 households in 13 villages in Bali and Desuri Tehsils were surveyed. Desuri Berdi (19), Bara Guda (9). However, it quickly became clear that the Boti sheep has practically disappeared in the last ten years and that local herds are now entirely dominated by what is called '' Bhagli '' sheep, w hich corresponds to what is known as ''Sonadi'' breed among scientists . Shepherds are now using exclusively Bhagli rams, because of the much higher growth rates and quick maturity of this breed whose lambs are fast sold even at one month of age. In the s urvey area, there are only two families that still use Boti rams . One is Dhana Ram in Bhadras ( who took over from his father Hakmaram, recipient of a Breed Saviour Award) with 120 head s. Then there are three brothers in Sesli with a total of 227 sheep. Thus there are an estimated 350 fairly pure bred Boti sheep still available. LPPS staff also collected measurements of ''Boti'' sheep, according to instructions provided by its consultant, Mr. Kamal Kishore. Gradually it became clear that some of the \"Boti\" sheep that had been measured earlier were actually crosses with Bhagli breed which maintained the typical Boti traits, such as the peculiar short and tubular ears as well as the black markings. These charac teristics stand out, as the Bhagli sheep is characterised by long pendular ears and red markings. Finally only 8 families could be found that owned pure Boti sheep located in five different villages (see Picture 14). Picture 6: Map of the study area Picture 7: Face length measurement Picture 8: Chest girth measurement Picture 9: Tail length measurement Picture 10: Body weight measurement Picture 11: Ear length measurement Picture 12: Body length measurement C. Results Data : We used measurement s data from female adult, which are more than one and half years old . (Since there were only two adult rams to be found, their measurements are not included, but they are contained in the Appendix. ) Body measurements Boti sheep Height wither (cm) Chest girth (cm) Paunch girth (cm) Body length (cm) Body weight (kg) Ear length (cm) Face length (cm) Tail length (cm) 66.25 80.3 80.25 77.5 35 7.1 23.6 23.5 According to these results, the considerable contrasting characteristic s of Boti sheep are short ears, face and tail. Boti's chest and paunch girth are definitively longer than other sheep showing that fat and skin layer are thicker. These characteristics seem to be very specific to this breed . a. Traditional intervention and practices : Raika pastoralist s have developed their own traditional system of animal health care making use of plant and mineral based remedies, conventional drugs and traditional healers. \"Healers are call ed mostly for the sheep who have sprains or bruises, abscesses, nervous problems, coughing, liver flukes, udders problem a nd coordinating problems\"( Geerlings, 2001) . Generally women and children look after sick animals, which are kept near the home. Modern treatment with antibiotics is done by men, whereas the responsibility of making home -remedies such as decoction and mixtures of oil and turmeric and the administering of these remedies seems to be shared equally among family members. The herders supplemen t with salt when the sheep become weak or when they feel that they have an accumulation of sand in their stomach. For this purpose they use a log cut cross wise and they dig a cavity to get a manger -like cavity in which they disperse salt for the sheep. This piece is traditionally call ed \"Mol\"(see picture 13 ). Picture 13: \"Mol\" They also use a long flexible wooden stick, to shake down pods from forage trees. Picture 14: Raika shaking leaves and fruits Milking is a shared responsibility between men and wome n. Women are task ed with processing of milk into ghee and buttermilk. In most of the household s people keep an eye on ewes in lab or and give assistance with lamb ing only when necessary . Female household members are mostly engaged in caring for the newborn. b. Trends in sheep population : From the interviews conducted around 20 years ago, one Raika brought back from migration a specimen of the Dumi sheep. Back in his village people clearly were op posing this action to the extent that they prevented this animal from breeding by tying up t he scrotum and sheath around the penis to prevent the ram from reaching erection. There is a saying within Raika, \" ye nasal hamari bhedo ke pet me pa thar dal denge \" (mixing their breed with other breeds can only generate poor genes). Some years later, other Raika sheep breeders started crossing the Boti with other rams for improving growth rates to adapt to the emerging meat market. Sheep are sub com munity specific, since female sheep were never sold outside their immediate family. For instance, the four main pure sheep bre eds by Raika are namely: 1) Boti 2) Bhagli 3) Baradi 4) Dumi Bhagli (officially known as Sonadi) is the most abundant breed and originated from the state of Madhya Pradesh. The Bhagli sheep is medium to large in size, with long, broad ears and big head. The ears often display ear nodes. Baradi is also said to be a separ ate breed. It comes from Madhya Pradesh (Malwa) and is mostly kept by the Raika \"Kassi\" community from Gujarat. The Baradi breed is kept by very few Godwar Raika, mostly those going on migration. Dumi , originally coming from Gujarat, kept in very small n umbers in the project area. When their herd composition started changing, Raika were giving new name to those new crossbreeds also call \"Bhildami\" (not pure) . The following are the distinct colour patterns th at result from crossing the different breeds: Keri (reddish coloured face with brown/ black patterns) Kajali (white face with black ring around the eyes) Gungali (red face, short ears) Haodi (both sides of the face are coloured, from the forehead to the nose runs a white stripe) Lapri (long wide shaped ears, different colour types possible) Tepli (long ears, different colour types possible) Kabri (black and white spots all over the body) Picture 15: Bhagli sheep Picture 16: Kajali sheep Picture 19: Dumi Picture 20: Other cross bred IV. Observation: G eneral Decline of Sheep Population in the A rea Raika sheep herds are passed down for many generations from father to son, with pride in their occupation and they use d to provide a good living . But from a survey of LPPS in the Godwar area conducted exactly 10 years ago which forms a solid basis for monitoring the sheep population trend in the area, it is evident that there has been a tremendous reduction in the number of sheep breeding households as well as in the total number of sheep. The exact decline is yet to be calculate d. A. Low Status and Backward I mage : In the Raika culture there was a custom of giving a Boti sheep as a dowry brought by some family members to the bride. But t hese days, the new spouses prefer to be presented with a buffalo (when still living in countryside) . Many young people have also moved to the city and are not interested in keeping animals at all. Therefore this custom tends to disappear. Earlier , livestock was consider ed as a valuable possession and an owner of a large herd could easily ma rry his children. But now the society has change d and Raika s are also force d to adopt the modern notion of wealth that is defined only by money. As animal herding has lost status and involve s a lot of work , many families now refuse to marr y their daughter to a Raika who is still practicing pastoralism. B. New G eneration : Several factors th reaten the pastoralist lifestyle. In the past the Raika s were able to overcome many challenges because of their flexibility and expertise. Now, they are no longer in control of the circumstances and caught in a complex mix of local politics and unfavorable national agricultural policies. Formal education is a n important factor. Since youngsters are now going out for study, they miss out in their life the crucial time of living with the family, the time in which the traditional knowledge and empirical skill need to be acquire d. Secondly, elders are emphasizing about the struggles on problems they face during migration or with forest officials. It is no t surprising that most of the young er generation is moving to the city in search of work. The loss of traditional knowledge and the absence of the new generation force Raika s to reduce their flocks. They say that they need at least two people to graze a flock. For instance while one is shaking the trees for the leave s and fruits to fall down, the other on e needs to keep the flock away t o prevent animals from getting injured. The Raika s have to hire externa l help which is often not reliable or trustable. In addition, it is also very expensive, i.e.Rs.400 per day , Rs.8000 - 9000 per month . C. Grazi ng A ccess : From the interviews conducted , it becomes clear that the reduction of grazing land (pastureland, oran, g ochar , forest land) is a major constraint . During the rainy season all agricultural land is used for growing crops . During this period, the Raika use d to bring thei r sheep for grazing in the Kumbhalgarh Sanctuary, but the forest department is trying to stop this. In the pa st, sheep were folded in farmer s' fields in return of food and free grazing , as farmers were benefiting from this provision of organic manure. Nowadays chemical products have replaced the traditional system and are available at cheaper price than manure . Earlier , fencing was made using thorny branches and Raika s were ask ed to gather those branches and to remove the leaves from them, the leaves to be then given as feed for their livestock. Today people are building st one walls. Irrigation has increase d the extent of land under agriculture, while the drinking places for animals have reduced. The s ituation has now reversed: livestock keepers are getting beaten by those same farmers if they try to come on their land. Picture 21: Raika with his flock on field With this shrinking grazing land and lack of pasture opportunities, Raika are facing co mpetition among themselves and conflict increases. This reduction of help among families and community members makes the Rai ka feel more insecure and leads them to abandon the Boti breed and sheep rearing in general which requires a functioning social network. D. Incomes and Value A ddition : Around 30 years ago sheep and wool department s were supporting the families who were breeding Boti sheep by prov iding them with free pure Boti rams and giving award to Boti sheep keepers who kept the best flocks. Now this government division has come under the animal husbandry department with the cons equence of no more supports for conservation of this local breed . According to wool expert Kamal Kishore, the wool of sheep, which retain s a relatively high percentage of Boti blood, has high luster and represents good quality carpet wool. LPPS has purchased 8 sacks of wool from the Boti sheep owner s in Sheshli at the rat e of Rs. 25 per sheep (wool is paid by head of animal, not by weight) . This wool will be washed and carded, and tested; possibly mixed with camel wool to produce rugs that represent threatened animal genetic resources. V. Some C omments by Boti Sheep Keepers ''We have been traditional livestock keepers since generations, but now the lack of availability of grazing land is our main problem, therefore livestock keeping is an endangered profession. There is a g ochar (village grazing ground) in our village, but it has been misappropriated. Without grazing we can't keep animals. The wool traders now want to give us only 2 -3 rupee s per sheep. We stopped selling the wool to them an d now we are getting Rs.10 , but this hardly pays for the labour involved in shearing. If LPPS wants to buy wool, all of us are ready. When our sheep get sick, nobody is helping us to treat them. I n winter season, there is a disease called sinduriya which often leads to death of our animals. The medicines we buy from the medical store are not at all effective.'' Picture 22: Raika for grazing with his flock Conclusion The Raika s have many generations of experience in sheep breeding, which other communities don't have. Within a few years and without a new generation of sheep man, all of this traditional knowledge is will disappear. If the daily life of the sheep breeder is made easier , if their reputation is improved, and if their products are valued highly, then the next generation could be motivated to follow their parents' footsteps. First of all, with the change in climate ( monsoon has been delayed in the last five years) a nd in the general context of Rajasthan being drought prone, the conservation of a drought -resistant breed such as the Boti sheep is essential. They do not need a lot of food or water to continue to produce milk and to be in perfect health. Also, customary grazing rights of pastoralist in the forest in gauchars and orans , need to be recognized. In addition , research must be oriented towards solving the problems experience d by sheep breeders. In addition, Boti sheep is currently facing the dilemma of not growing fast enough when the market trend is only for meat. Boti sheep produce a very tasty and fatty meat and high quality milk. By protecting and recognizing the Boti sheep as a pure local br eed and by organizing market for sheep products, the Raika s can be stopped from cross -breed ing the Boti and certainly the breed would continue to dominate. The ultimatum would be to see the wool department gets re-established. In the past, Rajasthan's carpets were used to be made with pure Boti wool thanks to its luscious and lustrous aspect. Working on sensibilizing the people on the great qualities of Boti sheep products is decisive for the success. Conservati on, documentation and development of traditional knowledge should be promoted. We must allow Raika s to prosper and keep the traditional sheep breeding knowledge alive. With secure d access to grazing land, good value of quality sheep products and appreci ation for the Raika s knowledge, the survival of the Boti breed may be possible .

Communities responsible for developing the breed: Fakirani Jat and Rabari (community) Maldharis of Coastal hchh b. Description of (Farmers/nomads/isolated/tribal's): the nomadic Pastoralist. Fakira ni Jat used to stay in traditional dwelling known as Pakkha that made of reed grass, jute ropes and w ood. They move this temporary shelter when they move with their animal. Rabari: Rabaris who keeps Kharai camels are semi-noma dic in nature. Generally, male member travel widely with camels for nearly 8 months i n every year. Nowadays some of them handover Kharai camel to Fakirani Jat to graze thei r animal and in return Rabari pay Fakirani Jat Rs. 50 per animal per month. 10. Utility of the breed (Milk/meat/draught/manure/other specify):- Mainly for milk consumption for household and selling in local market. This camel is also used in draught purpose, transportation, Border Security, Police se rvices, tourism. 11. Temperament of the breed (Active/Dull):- Dull (Docile) 12. Any other information: - Detail of Kachchh area (Native place Description): Kharai Camel is exclusively found in coastal talukas of Kachchh district of Gujarat. Since, this breed adapted to mangrove ecosystem and dry land ecosy stem, most of its population is located in Lakhpat, Abdasa, Mundra and Bhacau taluka of the dis trict where mangroves are found significantly. However, due to shortage of grazing areas, few Kharai camel breeders migrated to Bharuch and Bhavnagar di stricts near Aliabet (an Iceland near Bharuch). Mangrove and other saline species like salvadora, sueada are major fodder for Kharai camel. Besides Island having mangrove, K harai breed graze main in the mainland adjustment to coast. Climate: Temperature: Maximum : Up to 50 0C Minimum : 5 0C Hottest Month : May Coldest Month : January Annual Rainfall : 330 mm Annual duration of draught : March to June Land use pattern in Kachchh (, 00 hectare): Area under forest : 2,883 Crop production : 6,550 Non-Agricultural use : 726 Barren land : 17,054 Pasture land : 701 Cultivable waste : 16,812 Fallow land : 1,275 Gross irrigated area : 1,769 Net irrigated area : 1,420 Feeding and Rearing Practice: Extensive grazing practices are followed by the breeders for Kharai Camel in the district. They do not provide special housing/shelter for their camels . Generally, during monsoon, Kharai camel stays in Iceland (locally called bets ) 3-5 km away from the main land for 2-3 months at a stretch as sweet water i s available in those icelands as rainwater store. They graze primarily on mangroves in the Iceland. In summer and winter Kharai camel are taken icelands to near cree ks for grazing on mangroves for 2-3 days and then returning animals to the mainland for w atering of camels. During low tide, camels swim through sea water rea ch Iceland. Besides, mangroves Kharai camel feed on other saline trees, shrubs and s species like kharijar (Salvadora persica), Lano (Suaeda spp) near village simt al, moving around 10-15 km, on rotation basis in order to avoid overgrazing. Ponds, wells and vi llage cattle troughs are the main source of water. An adult camel requi res 20-40 liters of water per day. Generally, the watering time is 12-3 p.m. as per a vailability and based on the source's distance from the grazing area. Breeding Practice: Breeders of Kharai camel keeps only one breedable male in their herd. Breeding males are carefully selected, keeping knowledge of their pedig ree. Well build, healthy males are selected for Breeding and raised. Breeders exchange their breeding male in every 3 years to protect from inbreeding. During breeding season, special care is taken for maintenance of breeding male. Ghee, Jaggury, eggs, Haldi, is provided to breeding male during breeding season. Breeders also ensure that K harai camel do not mix with Kachchhi Camel during grazing, therefore, they maintain enough space/distance and time between two herds of different breeds. Socioeconomic data analysis of 25 camel breeders: Socio-economic conditions of the 25 Kharai camel breeders have been st udied by Sahjeevan. Their economic condition is very poor as they do not have much i ncome from the camel now a day. They sell 2-3 animals in a year. Few of the breeders posses Rainfed farming.

Grazing mainly on mangrove and other saline species like Salvadora, Suaeda species. d. This breed can tolerate water with high TDS up to 10000 ppm. e. Resistance to common Camel skin diseases including dermatitis. f. Short chest pad does not touch humerus of fore legs during walking. g. Smooth, soft and long wool can be used for preparation of Cap, Shawl as we ll as Protecting Cloths in winter. IV. MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION:- a. Camels provides livelihood to many nomadic tribes of India and are the ir economic backbone. In India camels are restricted to western part of the c ountry and are represented by eight breeds. Gujarat possesses two camel breeds, Kachchhi and Kharai, inhabiting the Kachchh district and share many characters. Khara i breed is not yet recognized as a distinct breed. Population of both are facing severe decline requiring their immediate conservation. b. In present study we examined genetic variability and structure in these two breeds along Kutch and Aliabet region (n=224) using 27 microsatellite markers. c. A total of 141 and 144 alleles were observed for Kachchhi and Kharai bree d respectively with the mean effective camel (Aliabet region). e. The polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.287 (YWLL36) t o 0.872 (CVRL01) for pooled population. f. The mean estimates of F statistics were 0.234 (F IS ), 0.358 (F IT ) and 0.168 (F ST ). g. All the three estimates were significantly different from zero (P<0.01). Breed wise F IS values were also significantly different from zero, indicating mating of individual more closely related than average relationship of the population. h. The mean multilocus F ST value (0.168) suggested significant population differentiation. This was also supported by AMOVA (Analysis of Molecular Vari ance) which indicated 20% variation among the breeds. i. Genetic bottleneck in the recent past was evaluated under three mode ls and it showed bottleneck under two models. Structure analysis was also performed for the populati on. j. The genetic distinctness of these two camel breeds as revea led by microsatellite analysis may have significant impact on issues concerning conservation and biodiversity.

Thirupathy Venkatachalpthy , Associate Prof. a nd Head of Goat a nd Sheep Farm. The study was based on 3 goats of about 9 months ' age. This is a preliminary or p ilot study to get indications for detailed studies in future. According to meat scientists, factors like ultimate pH, colour, water -holding cap acity and intra muscular fat are the main technical attributes that drive consumer purchasing decisions. Goat meat is reddish in colour . It is due to myoglobin . Colour is affected by breed, sex, age, diet, exercise and others. So a clear cut basic knowledge on all these aspects is required. In the case of Attappady goats no such study is conducted so far though it is a meat breed. This study is the beginni ng in this direction and in future programmes should be done extensively and intensively. The s tudy was made on 27 cha racters. Live body weight and weight of edible and inedible parts were measured. All the parts are important in their own ways. There is no part of the goat that is not used. There are many preparations using head, feet, liver, spleen, kidney, heart and ot hers. Boti is a very popular meat product in Kerala using intestine. In this study, weight, pH of meat and colour, cooking loss and drip loss have been included. Colour monitoring is done to determine the freshness and quality of the meat. Colo ur differen ce can be defined as the numerical comparison of a sample's colo ur to the standard. It indicates the differences in absolute colo ur coordinates . Identifying Colo ur Differences Using CIE L*a*b* Coordinates Defined by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclai rage (CIE), the L*a*b* colo ur space was model led after a colo ur-opponent theory stating that two colo urs cannot be red and green at the same time or yellow and blue at the same time. L* indicates lightness, varies from 0 -100 and when L is negative it indic ates black . a* is the red/green coordinate, a is positive which indicates redness and negative means greenness. b* is the yellow/blue coordinate.

Crude protein appears to be less in Attappady goats . The ratio of Omega 6 to Omega 3 is1.4 :1 and looks good . In this more detailed study may be planned which might possibly get some useful result. Designer eggs with high Omega3 is becoming more popular and the possibility of fu rther increasing Omega3 is also something that can be explored. In western diets the ratio is 15:1 to 17:1. A lower ratio is said to be reducing heart problems.and rectal cell proliferation. A 5:1 ratio has beneficial effects in Asthma and 10:1 has adverse effects it is said.In India it is considered that 4:1 is a safe ratio. In this study it is 1.4:1 seems to be very safe. More studies are to be made, but this is a good indication from the grassfed Attappady Black goats. We will have to see whether the feed ing system or the Genetics or both are responsible. Docosah exaenoic Acid (DHA) is used as a supplement for premature babies and as an ingredient in baby foods for the first four months of life to promote better mental development. DHA is found naturally in breast milk. DHA is used for treating diabete s, coronary artery disease dementia, Age related macular degeneration and mental depression. It is a good sign to see that such components are present, but any conc lusion at this stage would be premature .

Our Bio-cultur al values Wher e we live: We are Pulik ulam cattle herders belonging to yadava (konar), Naick er and Thevar and other minor communities who live in 15 villag es in Sivagangai, Madur ai, Virudhunag ar districts adjoining to the Western ghats in Tamil Nadu, south India. We number about 1,000 families. We have lived in the region for over 400 years rearing this unique livestock breed and acting as custodians of the local forests, community grazing lands (revenue porambok e), tanks and ponds being utiliz ed for irrigation and animal drinking water purpose. Our Origin: During 18th century when Velunachiyar queen was ruling the Sivagangai, Ramana thapur am region of Tamil Nadu state 1790) a pastoral community called as konar (yadava) living in Cauv ery delta. Later on they migr ated due to fear of a Muslim king who wanted to marr y a girl from the yadava community . They settled in Soma thur villag Sivagangai district. Very ella thorn (Acacia planifr ons) trees is known as Theri or jungle with umbr ella thorn trees ) was existing wher e a tiger was said to be living and later it has been named as Pulik ulam which means Tiger Pond. The community established Pulik ulam Ayyanar deity in the bank of pond which still exists in the area. One of the families was main taining local cattle and later it has been impr oved with a good bull from a distant villag e Kalayarkovil. This distinct cattle has also known as Pulik ulam villag e. The pastoralist head had two wives and one wife had to sell buttermilk and the other sell curd separ ately to adjoining villag es. This family was said to be distribut ed the cattle to other member s. They again migr ated from Soma thur and Manang also migr ated to faraway villag es looking for better pasture and fertile land viz. Idayapatti, Manapa tti, Vadipa tti in Madur ai districts. adays these migr ated families are still main taining the same th Pulik ulam cattle breed. These families are now in 8 gener ation and they visit annually their family deities situa ted in Sivagangai district. The Pulik ulam cattle have been trained for draugh t purpose and used for ploughing , Jallik attu (bull taming event) and in Rekla (small cart) race event. These cattle accus tomed to both climbing the hills for grazing during rainy season and walk long distances in the plain lands during summer and off season. They are compact in body with more stamina and strong legs. Such animals have been kept by us for ploughing oper ation and for Jallik attu, Rekla purpose. We are keeping animals as a gift of God and extend love and affinity to them. We never sell milk on cost basis but dona te to those who are need of them especially for nourishing the young childr en in villag es. Our Spiritual Life: We yadavas worship Pulik ulam Ayyanar deity (Deity of Lord of Shiva cult). Now we have migr ated and settled in man y villag es in Sivagangai and Madur ai districts. Accordingly our spiritual life has under gone little chang es. For example, there are about 100 familes of Yadavas living in U.Vadipa tti villag e in Usilampa tti taluka Madur ai district. Each family has been main taining 10 to 300 cattle. During the mon th of Purat tasi (Sept ember-Oct ober) Saturday we will go to the adjoining Thang amalai hills and sprinkle cow urine and show fragrance dhoop to the local deity and offer cooked sweetened rice. While returning from the hills we usually get drenched with rain by us every year. After this rituals we will send our cattle to the hills for grazing till the Tamil BIO-CUL TURAL PR Thai (Januar y 15- Februar y 14). After that we will come down from the hills and take the animals to plain crop lands when harvesting of crops is over. We celebr ate bullock s festival on Januar y 16th Januar y and dec orate them with bells and pain t the horns. Now adays the traditional grazing system is disturbed due to closing of forests in the name of Joint Forest Manag emen t programme and it affected our social life. Grazing system: The presen t popula tion of Pulik ulam cattle breed is about 20,000 (refer Appendix-III). This cattle breed is noticed fited through penning which provides rich organic manur e for agricultur al crops. The herds are migr atory and except for a few mon ths when the herds are usually kept at their native villag es viz Manang athan (Sivagangai district), Vadipa tti (Madur ai district) villag es and are moving constantly from place to place for a distance of about 100 km wher e grazing or drinking water is available. During summer the animals are taken to Pilavukk al dam site adjoining the Western Ghats. How ever, of late, cattle are banned from grazing even in the areas adjoining the forests. The breeding tract of Pulik ulam breed is almos t alkaline soil with salty water. The farmer s in that area raise salt resistant crops like cotton, coriander and paddy . Ther efore the herders face problems for grazing and in providing drinking water for their cattle, and for this purpose we take our herds to distant green lush pasturelands surrounding Rajapala yam, Watrap, and Sivakasi regions of Virudhunag ar district (80- 100 km away from home) wher e good quality drinking water is also available. Our cattle are also taken to harvested paddy fields wher e fodder such as paddy straw, sorghum fodder and tank beds wher e pods of trees of Acacia nilotic a etc are available. Mon th Place of gr azing Februar y Manamadur ai March ar, Thiruchuli Penning A herd size is usually 250-300 heads of cattle. During nigh t time they do penning (to provide manur e) in farmer s' fields and collect about Rs. 3 - 5 per animal per day. Cattle penning help s farmer s consider ably to reduce fertiliz er consumption by more than 50 per cent. About 300 animals will be sufficien t to fertiliz e one acre of land in a day. Mos tly garden land farmer s growing paddy , cotton, maiz e, groundnut, coconut are engaging cattle herds for fertilising their field. A herder earns annually about Rs.60,000 from penning and Rs.160,000 through sale of manur e (20 tractor-loads per year @ Rs. 8, 000 per load). We earn income through sale of male calves of about 6-12 mon ths old at Rs. 3,000 per calf. Female calves are not usually sold. The sale of calves usually peak s during December-Januar y. We herders of Pulik ulam are selling about 2000 c alves annually . The calves are usually sold to be grown as draugh t animal, for ploughing and for Jallik attu during the occasion of harvesting festival (Januar y-Februar y). Pulik ulam bullock s are good draugh t animals. Economics of Ca ttle K eeping An average cattle herder who main tains about 150 cattle solely on grazing and they are allow ed for open grazing up to a distance of 10 km for 7-8 hour s per day in the harvested fields, uncultiv able land and road sides. He is not giving any concen trate feed supplemen tation to the calves and adults. The males are select ed for breeding based on the body size, colour and growth rate after 2.5 years of age. Every year he disposes of 30-50 male calves for Jallik attu at the age of 3 mon ths at the rate of Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 2,500 per calf. The old adults are sold for mea t purpose at the rate of Rs. 4500-Rs. 5000. From his herd of 150 cattle, he earns annually about Rs. 35,000 from penning; Rs. 96, 000 through sale of manur e (12 tractor-loads per year @ Rs. 8, 000 per load); and Rs. 50,000 through sale of 20 male calves. Female calves are not usually sold. The sale of calves is usually peak s during December-Januar y. Overall, he earns Rs. 50, 000-60, 000 annually as net income.BIO-CUL TURAL PR (Bull taming) The Pulik ulam breed has established itself as proven breed for \"Bull taming \" which is locally called \"Jallik attu\". Calves of good quality Pulik ulam cattle are procur ed by interested farmer s for the purpose of Jallik attu. The young bulls are fed with green and dry fodder and concen trates viz. cotton seeds, black gram husk , raw rice pow der each of \u00bd kg twice a day and Jallik attu bull main tenance costs about Rs.200 per day. The bulls are not allow ed for breeding purpose through natural service in order to keep up the vigour of the bull so that if it is not tamed during Jallik attu and chances of winning prizes is brigh t and prestigious on the part of the owner of the bull. Jallik attu festival is being organized during Januar y - Februar y. The famous Supr eme Court of India has giv en a v erdict t o ban the Jallik attu event due t o tortur es inflicted upon the bulls during the event of Jallik attu. How ever local state governmen t of Tamil Nadu is again appealing the court for reviving the event (For more details refer Appendix V on Supr eme Court judgmen t which bans Jallik attu in Tamil Nadu). Rekla Race It is a traditional sport event being organized for bullock carts in man y villag es of Tamil Nadu especially Thanja vur, Thuthuk udi districts. Bullock carts are designed with compact size so that bullock s can run with maximum speed in the rekla race. The event is organized for a distance of about 3 to 8 kilome ters and it varies from villag e to villag e and it also depends upon the size of bullock s under dif ferent categories. The loc al br eeds of Pulik ulam, K angayam, Umbalacherr y, Amirthmahal are usually engaged and they are trained for this purpose before the event. This event has also been banned along with Jallik attu by Supr eme Court of India. (Refer Appendix V on Supr eme Court Judg emen t). Animal tic are main tained as migr atory herd with herd size of about 150-400 animals. The animals are with compact body and pow erful. They are swift and vigorous It is medium-siz ed, horned, strong cattle with good posture. Bulls are very strong, vigorous with well-de veloped hump, naval flap and dewlap. The hump, neck and some region of f ace and back ar e greyish / black in c olour irr espectiv e of the c oat TURAL PR OTOCOL s10the cows are proportiona te and with compact body . The animals can well survive on grazing in the tropic al clima te of the area in the open housing system. The animals are contributing signific antly to farming of paddy , cotton, groundnut, bajra, maiz e crops of the area through manur e and draugh t pow er. The animals are more resistant to infectious and parasitic diseases as compar ed to the crossbr eds in that area under hot and wet conditions. We developed indig enous knowledg e in manag emen t of animal herds, selection of bulls, medicinal and grass species for animal nutrition, treatmen t etc. The breed is intrinsic ally migr atory and cannot be stall-br ed. These animals do not survive or keep its vigor if they are forced to be stall fed and therefore adapt ed with forest ecosystem. We have applied for registration of the breed with assis tance of SEVA NGO and accession of Pulik ulam breed provided is INDIA _CATTLE_1800_PULIK ULAM_03035. So far India has 39 recognised breeds of cattle and now Pulik ulam has been included as 35th breed in our country. Traditional knowledg e: We live in the rain shadow region of the Western ghats and annual precipit ation is 780- 800 mm. The breeding place of Pulik ulam breed is almos t alkaline soil with salty water. We developed knowledg e about plan t species which are useful for treating human as well as animals. Man y old Yadava families are still practicing ethonov eterinar y practices to all animal disease including black quart er. We developed the criteria for selecting breeding bulls for breeding purpose based on traits essen tial for up keeping true to type of breed. Breeding bulls are import ant asse t for the herders. We adminis ter medicine only during Sunda ys as 'sun' sign is auspicious for them. We graze our animals both in the plain and forest lands over different seasons. Whene ver graze our cattle in the forest some wild predators like wild dogs and panthers also prey upon old cattle or calves. Occasional casualties of calves is not at all loss to herder but it is providing food for wild animal during critic al times and therefore facilit ate symbiotic relationship s with forest eco-system. We also protect forest from illegal felling of trees. We also protect forests from fire and help protecting wild life. Our cattle provide manur e useful for agricultur al land as well as to forests. BIO-CUL TURAL PR OTOCOL Pulik ulam Ca ttle Br eed eeper s11In a her d of 50 animals ther e will be loss of 4 animals (annually) especially the y oung calves as preyed by predators. In the absence of forest grazing such animals will visit human habit ats and even attack human and our properties. Without under standing intricacies of wild and domes tic animals grazing - agro ecosystem the Forest Departmen t is interested in closing the forest and aliena te the forest dependan ts and they are not consulting our communities to use the traditional wisdom or innov ations from grassroots. Forest officials never allow rotational grazing system for traditional forest grazier but close the forests in full leng th and once closed (in the name of plan ting) is never re- opened. This system increase proliferate of grass growth and during summer the dried grasses spread the fire and destroy the forests. Now adays the restriction of animal grazier s into forests has consider ably reduced the popula tion of 'Pulik ulam' cattle. Popula tion survey ed by SEVA NGO and Tamill Nadu Veterinar y and Animal ersity(T ANUV AS) has revealed that Pulik ulam cattle has been reduced drastically over the last two decades : 90,000 in 1995 (SEV A 1995) 45,000 in 2006(T ANUV AS 2006) 21,225 in 2012 (SEV A 2012). From co-living to conflict facing becomes the reality which is posing threat to agricultur e, soil fertility and erosion of traditional knowledg e. This is the scenario created by the Governmen t by aliena ting from participa tion in decisions making process. Prior Informed Consen t and Bene fit Sharing Our animal genetic resour ces and our associa ted traditional knowledg e about breeding and ethnov eterinar y practices are collectiv ely owned by our Pulik ulam cattle breed keeping communities. We have customar y system that regula te decisions making in our communities. For issues that relate to all community member s, we assemble in the villag e Pancha yat before resolving the matter. This is the practice for any conflict resolution with regard to grazing of animals follow ed for gener ations. When the Forest Departmen t wanted to plan t trees and close the forests for implemen ting Joint Forest Manag emen t programme ation of Gian t Squirr el Sanctuar y they did not consult us. Villag e forest commit tee promot ed by the Forest Departmen t is there to fulfil official formalities with member secretary as governmen t official rather than participa tory in nature in decision making. The species BIO-CUL TURAL PR OTOCOL Pulik ed plan ting, s ystem f or Pulik ulam c attle were never discussed with us. Now because of this sudden developmen t we had to lose our cattle-based livelihoods and man y of our family member s /youth are going to nearb y cities like Tirupur , Coimba tore, Chennai to be engaged in unskilled labour mark et. Now we are unable to pass on the resour ces and knowledg e to our young er gener ation as keeping animals of traditional breed is not at all recogniz ed by Governmen t and in turn pastoralism is viewed with an eye of low social status. Breed saviour award programme initia ted by SEVA in associa LIFE network has iden tified our associa tion and one of the best herders for the award in 2011 and 2013 has motiv ated us in keeping our hope alive and continue our pastoral life while conser ving Pulik ulam cattle breed. Our Futur e: gener ation is not interested in our agricultur al and animal husbandr y activities because of hardship s mainly associa ted with the Forest Departmen t on the issue of grazing , conflicts with local villag ers occasionally and ill treatmen t met with police while crossing the high ways. But at the same time frustrated from city life with unskilled labour work in mills/ factories. We are caugh t in a no man's land of being unable to carry on our traditional livestock keeping and unwilling to suffer the indignities of life as unskilled labour ers. Due to lack of grazing land man y herders are disposing their herds and in turn animals are taken to nearb y Kerala state for the purpose of slaugh tering for mea t purpose. Ther efore the popula tion of the Pulik ulam cattle has been reduced drastically over the last two years. We requir e grazing rights, right to eradicate the alien species Prosophis juliflor a through Governmen t schemes such as National Rural Emplo ymen t Gener ation (NRE GA )programme which also assur es 100 days emplo ymen t for rural poor in a year by emplo ying in constructiv e work and providing drinking water facilities at select ed places in the migr atory route of our herds. Our Righ ts in National Laws & Policies. We have consider ed opinion that the laws of land are in place to protect nature, biodiv ersity and livelihoods. These laws have not been implemen ted in true spirit so far. We urge the agencies to involve our communities in implemen tation of the laid BIO-CUL TURAL for best bene fits to biodiv ersity and the overall production and survival systems. A. The Biologic al Diversity Act of 2002 and the Biologic al Diversity Rules of 2004 The Biologic al Diversity Act of 2002 in its efforts to fulfill India's commitmen ts under the Convention on Biologic al Diversity provides for the conser vation of biologic al diversity, sustainable use of its componen ts and the fair and equit able sharing of bene fits arising from the use of such biologic al diversity and associa ted traditional knowledg e (TK). The Biologic al Diversity Act sets up the National Biodiv ersity Authority (NBA) and the Biologic al Diversity Rules of 2004 lists the functions of the NBA as including regula ting access to biologic al resour ces TK for commer ch purposes. The NBA is also empow ered to advise the Central Governmen t on any matter relating to the conser vation and sustainable use of biodiv ersity and associa ted TK and the fair and equit able sharing of bene fits arising from the utiliz ation of biologic al resour ces and associa ted TK. The Biologic al Diversity Act among other things requires the Central Governmen t under Section 36 to promot e the conser vation and sustainable use of biologic al diversity through in situ conser vation and minimiz e the adverse effects on biologic al diversity of any project undert aken through environmen tal impact assessmen ts that includes public participation . The Central Governmen t is tasked with ensuring respect and protection of associa ted TK of local communities in accordance with the recommenda tions of the NBA including registration of TK and other sui generic methods for its protection. Under Sec 38 the Central Governmen t is also required to preser ve and prot ect those species that are on the verge of extinction. In order to ensur e the effectiv e fulfillmen t of the role of the NBA at a local level, local bodies such as the Pancha yats or Municipalities are requir ed under Sec 41 to set up Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) to promote conservation and sustainable use and documen tation of biologic al diversity and associa ted TK. The NBA and the State Biodiv ersity Boar ds would consult with the BMCs while taking any decision relating to the use of biologic al resour ces and associa ted TK within the territ orial jurisdiction of the BMC. Under Rule 22 (6) of the Biologic al Diversity Rules of 2004 the main function of the BMC is to prepar e a Peoples Biodiv ersity Register in consult ation with the local people which shall contain compr ehensiv e informa tion on availability and knowledg e of local biologic al resour ces and eed eeper s14Biologic al Diversity Act under Sec 21 envisag es that the NBA will base its appr oval regarding any applic ation for access to biologic al resour ces or associa ted TK on the whe ther a mutually agreed terms and fair and equit able bene fit sharing has been negotiated with the local community that provides such resour ce or associa ted TK (bene fit claimer s according to Sec 2 (a) of the Biologic al Diversity Act). The local community or bene fit claimer s in ques tion will be iden tified according the Peoples Biodiv ersity Register under the territ orial jurisdiction of the local BMC. The Biologic al Diversity Act and Rules therefore provides certain rights to our Pulik ulam cattle herders : ? The right to consult ation and public participa tion prior to any project that may affect our livelihoods, our animal breed and associa ted TK; The right to conser vation and sustainable use of our animal breeds; ? The right to give prior informed consen t and negotiate mutually agreed terms when our animal genetic resour ces or associa ted TK is accessed and shar e fairly and equit able in any bene fits arising from the utiliz ation of our animal genetic resour ces and associa ted TK; ? The right to a Peoples Biodiv ersity Register that will documen t Pulik ulam cattle keeping communities on biologic al diversity and associa ted TK; ? The right to a BMC to advise the NBA on how our community in main taining Pulik ulam cattle breed and associa ted conser ved ,impr oved and sustainable used; and ? The right to carry on our traditional lifestyles of migr ation during different seasons which involves continued access to grazing lands in order to conser ve the biologic al diversity of our breed and associa ted TK. B. The Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dweller s (Recognition of Forest Righ ts) Act, 2006 The preamble of the Forest Righ ts Act in accordance with Art 8(j) of the Convention on Biologic al Diversity recogniz es that the forest dwelling scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dweller s are integral to the survival of the forest ecosystem. The Forest Act seek s to addr ess the long term insecurity of land tenur e and of these communities and therefore recogniz es the rights of forest dwelling tribes and other BIO-CUL TURAL PR OTOCOL Pulik ulam Ca ttle Br eeper s15traditional forest dweller s, which include nomadic or settled pastoralists, on all forest lands. The Forest Righ ts Act therefore provides certain rights to the Yadava community: ?The right of owner ship, access to collect, use, and dispose of minor forest produce which has been traditionally collect ed within or outside villag e boundaries (Section 3c) ?Community right of use or entitlemen ts including grazing (both settled or transhuman t) and traditional seasonal resour ce access, of nomadic or pastoralist communities (Section 3d) ?The rights in or over disput ed lands under any nomencla ture in any State wher e claims are disput ed (Section 3f) ?The right of access to biodiv ersity and community right to intellectual property and TK related to biodiv ersity and traditional knowledg e related to biodiv ersity and cultur al diversity (Section 3k) ?The right to traditional rights customarily enjo yed by the Pulik ulam cattle herders (Section 3l) We acknowledg e the limit ation of these rights under Section 4 of the Act in cases wher e forests ar e designa ted as Na tional P arks or Sanctuaries, but poin t out tha t the processes set out under Section 4(2) such as ascert aining whe ther other reasonable options such as co-existence are not available remain to be complied with. C. National Policy For Farmer s The National Policy for Farmer s (NPF - 2007) is an attempt to reorien t agricultur al policy to take a more holis tic vision of agricultur al production to include a focus on socio-ec onomic wellbeing. Animal genetic resour ces and pastoralists are among the areas it focuses on to achie ve in situ conser vation according to the NBA.

We also call on the UN Food and Agricultur e Organization to acknowledg e the import ance of our animal genetic resour ces and to recogniz e livestock keeper s' rights. Our Contact Details Mr. Chinnapandi, U. Vadipa tti, ated) We the Pulik breed keeper s this Pulik ulam Biocultur al Community Protocol iden tify the following principles and rights based on interna tional law: Principle 1: We are creat ors of Pulik ulam cattle breed and practic al custodians of animal gene tic resourc es for food and agriculture. Over the course of history, the Pulik ulam cattle breed keeper s have manag ed and breed livestock, select ed and used them, thus shaping them so they are well-adapt ed to our environmen t and its extremes. Keeping these breeds is a vital part of our cultur e and livelihoods. Yet these breeds and our livelihoods are under risk through loss of access to our traditional grazing lands. This has endang ered our food security and our way of life. As recogniz ed in the Global Plan of Action for Animal Gene tic Resour ces and the Interlaken Declaration on Animal Genetic Resources, livestock keeping communities are thus the creators and custodians of the breeds that they eeper s21We have therefore earned certain custodianship rights over these breeds, including the right to decide how other s use the genetic resour ces embodied in our breeds. Principle 1 is support ed by: Point 9 of the Interlak en Declar ation on Animal Gene tic Resour ces recogniz es \"tha t the genetic resour ces of animal species mos t critic al to food security , sustainable livelihoods and human well-being are the result of both natural selection, and directed selection by smallholder s, farmer s, pastoralists and breeder s, throughout the world, over gener ations\" . Point 12 of the Interlak en Declar on Animal Gene tic Resour ces recogniz es \"the enormous contribution that the local and indig enous communities and farmer s, pastoralists and animal breeder s of all regions of the world have made, and will continue to mak e for the sustainable use, developmen t and conser vation of animal genetic resour ces for food and agricultur e\". Part I Point 10 of the Global Plan of Action for Animal Gene tic Resour ces: \"all animal genetic resour ces f or food and agricultur e are the r esult of human in tervention: the y have been consciously select ed and impr oved by pastoralists and farmer s since the origins of agricultur e, and have co-evolved with economies, cultur es, knowledg e systems and socie ties. Unlik e mos t wild biodiv ersity, domes tic animal ces e human manag emen t, sensitiv e to their unique nature\". Principle 2: Our seasonal migrat ory life style, spiritual life and the sustainable use of traditional breed are highly dependen t on the conser vation of our ecosystem both fores ts and farming system Our traditional breed was developed through the interaction between our livestock, the Pulik ulam cattle breed keeper s and our natural environmen t. This natural environmen t is conser ved, inter alia, through traditional practices of the Pulik ulam cattle breed keeper s and traditional breeds lose their specific char acteristics once remov ed from this ecosystem. The Pulik ulam cattle breed keeper s therefore have a right to access our natural environmen t, so as to ensur e the sustainable use and conser vation of eeper s22Principle 2 is support ed by: Article 8 of the Convention on Biologic al Diversity: \"genetic resour ces should be conser ved in the surroundings in which they have developed their distinct properties\" . Article 10 (d) of the Convention on Biologic al Diversity demands that \"local popula tions are support ed to develop and implemen remedial action in degr aded areas al diversity has been reduce\" .

Principle 22 of the Rio Declar ation: \"Indig enous people and their communities and other local communities have a vital role in environmen tal manag emen t and developmen t because of their knowledg e and traditional practices. States should recogniz e and duly support their iden tity, cultur e and interests and enable their effectiv e participa tion in the achie vemen t of sustainable developmen t\". Principle 3: Our traditional breed represen t collective property , products of indigenous knowledge and cultural expression of our communities While the Pulik ulam cattle breed keeper s have collectiv e custodianship rights over our breed and the g enetic tr aits of this br eed, it is crucial tha t these righ ts ar e support ed and promot ed by the governmen t. Our governmen t mus t therefore respect, preser ve and main tain the knowledg e, innov ations and practices of the Pulik ulam cattle breed keeper s embodying lifestyles relevant for sustainable use and conser vation of livestock diversity.

Sr eedhar an, f Conser vator of F orests Sub : Grazing P olicy in F orest Departmen t - Cir cular ins tructions issued Regarding. * * * * Grazing has always remained a sensitiv e issue calling for a clear policy . Grazing of domes tic livestock continues to be the prime factor in the degr adation of the forest of the Tamilnadu. Continous grazing in the degr aded forest destroys all the potential of the degr aded forest eco-systems. Uncontrolled and unlimit ed grazing is incompa tible with scien tific forestry. Grazing also destroys all the potential of the natural regener ation possible in the forest eco- systems as the domes tic livestock destroys the natural seedings of the tree species. Mor e than 80% of the forest fire in Tamilnadu are caused and induced by the grazier s. Grazing and forest fire go together in several forest area Grazier s are also head loader s in the forest areas and mos t of the grazier s indulg e in tree felling and in collection of fire wood. Ther e is potential dang er of spread of several diseases like anthrax, food and mouth disease etc from grazing livestock to wile herbiv ores there by causing serious impact on the wild herbiv ore popula tion. This calls for restrictions in grazing for scien tific manag emen t of the fragile eco Systems. Ther e have been instructions from Governmen t (Environmen t and Forests Departmen t) at intervals revising rates for grazing. Taking all these facts into consider ation grazing is permit ted gener ally in the forest areas with restrictions and not all permit ted in cases indic ated K eeper s27a.No grazing is permit ted in protected areas like National park, Tiger reser ve and Sanctuaries. b.No grazing is permit ted in the reforestation areas up to 5 years, in order to ensur e that plan ts attain-high t beyond browsing. c.Cert ain areas are liable to be closed to a grazing either permanen tly import antly closur e is applied to areas under regener ation to burn t areas and to those in which grazing is harm ful. Forest may be closed to grazing in cease of fire. Presen tly grazing permits are being issued for domes tic live stock except for goat in the recen t times various complain ts are receiv ed from the cattle and other livestock grazing. Associa tions seeking permission from the Governmen t to allow their cattle to browse in the forest areas considering the reques t of various associa tions the following may be consider ed by the Field Officer s for allowing grazing in the forest areas. Efficien t forest manag emen t requir es that grazing be regula ted in time, place and cattle leads to be grazed. 1.Grazing in other forest areas including older reforestation areas (mor e than 5 years) may be consider ed by District Forest Officer s after inspecting the areas and to permit grazing in such areas talking in to consider ation the presence of wildlif e. This would be again subject to resolution to be passed by VFC about grazing of local cattle popula tion in the forest areas. 2.In respect of allowing Malaimadu (ferel cattle) to graze inside the forest area the VFC may decide by passing resolution taking into consider ation the availability of area and fodder for the local cattle. 3.The Conser vator of Forests / District Forest Officer s are reques ted to stick to the various Governmen t orders / instructions issued in this regard while following the abov e instructions before allowing cattle owner s to browse their domes tic animals in the forest areas.

Radhakrishnan and Pinaki Chandr a Misr a in their judgmen t on 7 May 2014 said that, \"Forcing a bull and keeping it in the waiting area for hour s and subjecting it to the scorching sun is not for the animal's well-being. Forcing and pulling the bull by a nose rope into the narrow, closed enclosur e or \"vadi vassal \"(en try poin t), subjecting it to all forms of tortur e, fear, pain and suffering by forcing it to go the arena and also over-pow ering BIO-CUL TURAL K eeper s33it in the arena by bull tamer s, are not for the well-being of the animal. \" The Bench said the Animal Welfare Boar d of India had given details on the manner in which the bull fight was conduct ed across Tamil Nadu. It said the tortur e and cruelty meted out to the bulls were unimaginable. \"Being dumb and helpless, they suffer in silence. We notice that the situa tion is the same in Mahar ashtra too.\" Animal Welfare Boar d of India (AWBI) investigators observed that bulls were forced to participa te and were deliber ately taunted, tormen ted, mutila ted, stabbed, beaten, chased and denied even their mos t basic needs, including food, water and sanit ation. The findings of this investigation clearly show that bulls which are used in Jallik attu are subject ed to extreme cruelty and unmitig ated suffering. All the acts of cruelty to animals are met with. The court also struck down a 2011 Tamil Nadu law regula ting the conduct of Jallik attu. The law provided for conducting Jallik attu from Januar y to May in various places in Tamil Nadu to ensur e the protection of not only the participan ts but also of the spect ators. The law was enact ed in the wake of a large number of deaths and injuries that took place during the sport. The ban order came as the apex court allow ed an appeal by the Animal Welfare Boar d of India challenging a Madr as high court verdict. The apex court concludes \"We, therefore, hold that AWBI is right in its stand that Jallik attu, bullock-c art race and such events per se viola te Sections 3, 11(1)(a) and 11(1)(m)(ii) of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 (PCA) and hence we uphold the notific ation dated 11.7.2011 issued by the Central Governmen t, consequen tly, Bulls cannot be used as performing animals, either for the Jallik attu events or bullock-c art races in the State of Tamil Nadu, Mahar ashtra or ernmen ts were directed to take appr opria te steps to see tha t the persons-in-char ge or care of animals, take reasonable measur es to ensur e the well- being of animals, to take steps to prevent the infliction of unnecessar y pain or suffering on the animals, since their rights have been statutorily protected under Sections 3 and 11 of PCA. Parliamen t is expect ed to mak e proper amendmen t of the PCA to provide an effectiv e deterrent to achie ve the object and purpose of the Act and for viola tion of Section 11, adequa te penalties and ttle Br eed K eeper s34Parliamen t, it is expect ed, would elevate rights of animals to that of constitutional rights, as done by man y of the countries around the world, so as to protect their dignity and honour . The Gov ernmen ts would see tha t if the pr ovisions of the PCA and the declar ations and the directions issued by this court are not properly and effectiv ely complied with, disciplinar y action be taken against the erring officials so that the purpose and object of PCA c ould be achie ved. T amil Nadu R Jallik attu Act, 2009 is found repugnan t to PCA, which is a welfare legisla tion, hence held constitutionally void, being viola tive or Article 254(1) of the Cons titution of India. Tamil Nadu State Governmen t had filed a review petition with the apex court for removing bulls from the specific list of animals to facilit ate revival of Jallik attu.

He earns net income of Rs. 10,000 per month after the cost of maintenance of bullocks are meted out. Earlier there were more than 50 bullock carts in Kattikulam and Mettumadai villages but now reduced to merely five due to modernization of rural transport after introduction of motorized vehicles viz. tractors and mini vans during the last 3 decades. 3. Rekla Race (bullock cart race event) Rekla race is a traditional village sport event during September -October in a few villages in Madurai and Sivagangai districts. Mr R.P asupathi is 38 years -old farmer, studied up to 8th standard, living in Karuppukal village near Varichur, Madurai district. He is a full time and regular participant in the Rekla race events for the past 15 years . Earlier he maintained six pairs of bullocks , but now he is maintaining only two pairs exclusively for Rekla race purpose because of scarcity of fodder and no proper monsoon . He procured two pairs of bullocks from Kadaladi (Ramnathapuram district) and Singavanam village (Pudukottai district) from ca ttle owners by paying for Rs 30,000 / pair when they were young calves 4 years back and now being utilized fully in Rekla race .

He is illiterate and he and his family members are fully involved in rearing their Pulikulam cattle. He is owning 1acre of garden land and cultivates paddy, cotton , brinjal and vegetables. He is maintaining two Jallikattu bulls and two dairy cows . He purchased one young calf from the local Pulikulam cattle herd in Sakkudi village during 2007 for using Jallikattu purpose. The animal gets ready for the sport arou nd three years. After that it will not be allowed for breeding purpose to keep up its stamina and ferocity. His son Mr.Ganapathi (22) also helps in maintaining the bull since over 10 years . .Jallikattu is village festival and it is termed as bull taming a nd it is usually organized after the harvest of paddy crop from January 14 onwards and extended up to February. The dates will not overlap among Jallikattu organizing villages in that vicinity.

Nowadays the event is conducted with strict regulations imposed by the Government and lost its charm . Annexur e - 5B Profiles of of Pulikulam & Malaimadu cattle Breed keepers : Breed Saviour Award ees 2013 * 1. Pulikulam Cattle - A Culture Rich Breed Conserved by Mr. Ramakrishnan Mr. B.Ramakrishnan is 53 years old livestock keeper studied up to 5th standard . He has 2 son and one daughter .He is living in Managathan village , Manamadurai Taluka, Sivagangai District. Mr. Ramakrishnan belongs to Konar (yadavar) community. Earlier his father maintained about 60 animals and Ramakrishnan is h aving more than 150 Pulikulam cattle's (117 cows, 30 calves and 3 bulls). He is engaged in pastoral life since last 45 years. Mr Ramakrishnan is instrumental in registering the cattle with NBAGR with support of SEVA and Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Anim al Science University (TANUVAS). NBAGR has approved the registration of Pulikulam cattle and accession number of Pulikulam breed provided is INDIA _CATTLE_1800_PULIKULAM_03035. So far India has 34 recognized breeds of cattle and now Pulikulam has been inc luded as 35 th breed in our country. Many pastoral families in his native village of Manangathan gave up cattle keeping but Mr. Ramakrishnan is continuing his pastoral life in spite of problems of availability of labour and water shortage during summer and drought period. The herds are migratory and except few months at Manangathan village the animals are moving constantly from place to place where grazing /drinking water are available around distance not exceeding 100 km. During summer the animals are t aken to Pilavukkal dam site adjoining the western ghat and nowadays cattle are banned for grazing even area adjoining the forests. The present population of Pulikulam cattle breed is about 20,000 . This cattle breed is known for supplying bullocks for ploughing, draught and for bull taming (Jallikkattu ) purpose. Farmers are benefited through penning which provides rich organic manure for agricultural crops. The story behind the name of the breed The existence of Pulikulam cattle the breed can be traced back to about 500 years ago . Once upon a time j ungles surrounded this present Pulikulam village (Manamadurai Taluka , Sivaganga District ) and one tiger came to a pond to quench its thirst. It has been entrapped with thorny bushes found in the banks of pond and people named that pond as Pulikulam literally means \"Tiger pond\". The cattle found in that village become synonyms with \" Pulikulam \" breed. It is also called Palingu Maadu for its marble colour or Naattu Madu or Mani Maadu (bell cattle). The pastoralists belonging to yadavar or konar when they mig rate from Manamadurai and settled in Madurai district (villages viz. Manapatti, Idayapatti, U.Vadipatti etc ) they have taken their cattle along with them and till date they are keeping this breed. Migratory System The breeding place of Pulikulam bree d is almost alkaline soil with salty water. The farmers in that area raise salt resistant crops like cotton, coriander and paddy. Therefore the cattle herders take their herds to distant green lush pasturelands and for good quality drinking water available in Rajapalayam, Watrap, and Sivakasi regions of Virudhunagar District (80 -100 km away from home). Their cattle are also taken to harvested paddy fields where the available fodder are paddy straw, cholam fodder, pods of Acacia arabica, Prosopis juliflora. Month Place of grazing February Manamadurai May Karuppayuarani June Sirivilliputhur July Koomapatti Sivakasi, Thiruchuli Penning A herd size is usually 250 -300 heads of cattle. During night time they do penning (to provide manure) in farmers field and collect about Rs 300 per 100 animals. Cattle manuring help considerably to reduce fertilizer consumption by more than 50 percent. The herders earn income through sale of male calves of 6 months old and above at Rs. 3000 per calf. Female calves are not usually sold. The sale of calves is usually peak during Dec -Jan, the herders of Pulikulam are selling 2000 calves annually. Their calves are usually sold to be grown as draught animal, for ploughing and for jallikattu / bull taming festival during festival occasion. Female calves are not usually sold. The sale of calves is usually peak during Dec -Jan; the herders of Pulikulam are selli ng 2000 calves annually. Their calves are usually sold to be grown as draught animal, for ploughing and for jallikattu (bull taming) during harvesting festival occasion (Jan -Feb).The Pulikulam breed has established itself as proven breed for\"bull taming\"wh ich is locally called \"Jallikattu\". These bullocks are good draught animals. Economics of Cattle keeping Mr Ramakrishnan's family offer milk to the needy villagers and never charges and it is their custom not to sell milk. He maintains the c attle solely on grazing and they allowed for open grazing up to a distance of 10 km for 7 -8 hours per day in the harvested fields, uncultivable land and road sides. He is not giving any concentrate supplementation to the calves and adults. The males are selected for breeding based on the body size, color and growth rate after 2.5 years of age. Every year he disposes 30 - 50 male calves for Jallikattu at the age of 3 months at the rate of Rs 2000 to 2500 per calf . The old adults are sold for meat purpo se at the rate of Rs 4500 -Rs 5000. In his herd of 150 cattle earns income of Rs 35,000 annually from penning ; sale of manure through tractor loads Rs.96,000 (12 loads in a year 12 x 8000); sale of 20 male calves Rs 50,000 (3 - 5 months old). Female ca lves are not usually sold. The sale of calves is usually peak during Dec -Jan. He earns Rs. 50,000 - 60,000 annually as net income after meeting the cost of laborers. Ethno veterinary practices followed by Mr. Ramakrishnan Animal not taking food and fe ver : Take leaves of manjanathi (Morinda tinctoria), turmeric , pepper, cumin seeds and onion and the ingredients are ground well and mixed with butter milk or boiled rice water. It has to be administered orally for twice in a day. For Foot & Mouth Dise ase : The diseased animals are to be administered orally with banana fruits (2 -3 )mixed/smeared with 50 ml sesame oil. For Wounds : Take seeds of Senkottai (Semecarpus anacardium) seeds boiled with neem oil filtered and apply over on the wound . Address of the livestock keeper : P.Vivekanandan, SEVA Nov 2013. 2. Organic Farming by conserving Malaimadu cattle by Mr . Jude Thaddeus in Theni District, Tamil Nadu Mr. Jude Thaddeus (54) is a farmer in Royappanpatti village, Theni district of Tamil Nadu. He studied up to 10th standard and looks after farming for more than 30 years. He is owning 15 acres of bot h dry and garden land; he raises paddy, banana, pulses,and sorghum. His family has been maintaining Malaimadu cattle over many generations. Malaimadu literally means\"hill cattle\". Malaimadu cattle is distinct population and it is very close resemblance of Pulikullam cattle. He is keeping a herd of 80 animals (65 cows, 15 calves, 2 bulls). He is also secretary of Malaimadu cattle herders association (Theni district with 21 herders ) and he has represented pastoralists delegates for meeting Parliamentary C ommittee members/policy makers of Tribal Bill at Delhi during 2006 for claiming grazing rights in forests. Malaimadu cattle Breed Malaimadu cattle has been existence for more than 10 generations in villages situate in the foothills of Western ghat in Th eni District. These cattle have been taken for open grazing and during monsoon season (cropping season mainly with paddy ) the only place available for grazing was forests in the villages adjoining to western ghats. Therefore the local cattle were taken to uphills for grazing in forests for few months and this rotational system of grazing between plains and hilly tract might have helped them to adopt special traits and their body become campact and more strength or stamina for climbing the hills and evolv ed into hill cattle or Malaimadu . This is distinct from Pulikulam cattle breed . Malaimadu breed is short and sturdy and body colour varies from place to place based on availability of vegetation viz Mayilai (grey (pale black spots ) . According to cattle herders they claim that malaimadu cattle were existence only less than 10 generations. Penning system At present these cattle are being maintained by herders for the purpose of penning and manuring farmers fields. During the monsoon (north east monsoon in Oct - Dec and April - June ) the cattle are sent to forests (western ghats /Sirumalai hills ) for grazing; in the off-season after the harvest of paddy or other crops the cattle are let into the fallow lands for the purpose of grazing and penning. Breeding in Malaimadu Malaimadu cattle breeders follow some criteria for selecting males for breeding . They are : calf obtained through 3rd lactation; horns straight or tilted frontward; colour of t he bull should be vellai (bright white), mayilai (milk white), sembor and karumbor; the mother of the bull, should be a high milk yielder among the cattle; the tail should be short and thin and above the knee of the bull ; dewlap should be very little in t he neck region; lung frame should be wide and body frame to be lengthy; the length of the face and ears should be short and eyes projected for attraction of the face; the testicles should be small in size; the skin should be nice, soft and thin. These last two features make the bull active and speedy in mating ; the bull must be ferocious in nature and taller than all other animals in a stock ; the bull must have a leading capacity character, able to lead the herd while grazing in forests and save the cat tle herd from the attack of wild predators; the parents, especially the mother of the stud bull, should be bright in colour as such as vellai (white), mayilai (grey) , karumbor(black spots ), sembor(red spot) and even karumayilai (dark gre ) ; the same is to be adopted for selecting the stud bull also. Maintaining 5 Pairs of Plough bullocks Mr. Jude Thaddeus has been keeping plough bullocks. Seven years ago he has been keeping 11 pairs of bullocks and now reduced to 5 pairs. Now a days tractor ploughing has replaced the utility of plough bullocks. Many farmers have disposed their animals and shifted to tractors. He still utilizes plough bullocks for the reason that deep ploughing up to 1 feet depth is possible only by using bullocks and it least kills earthworms. He is keeping bullocks during the sowing season (July - August ) and during the off season he is sending them to labourers families on tenancy basis. i.e. The labourers maintain the cattle in the remaining months and earn income out of them. These animals were earlier given to them without cost but the labourers have to train the animals and keep them for ploughing operations. One pair of bullocks when used for ploughing the labourer earn Rs. 600 per day , However for the animal owner (Mr.Jude Thaddeus) he charges Rs. 300 for the labour wage alone. Advantages of using Bullocks for Ploughing 1. Deep ploughing up to 1 feet depth is possible 2. In a single day 2 acres of land is covered 3. Least damage to earthworms 4. Ideal for paddy puddling , banana, gro undnut and sugarcane preparatory cultivation Economics of cattle herd In Theni district there are about 12,000 malaimadu cattle owned by more than 30 herders . Cattle herds were taken for grazing in rotation to forests (seasionally) and animals will be cam ped in the night time during particular months. Nowadays forest department has declared the forest area into Megamalai Sanctuary area and banned cattle grazing.However the association has taken up the issue including writ petition in court and able to secu re grazing of cattle in forests but without night camping. The manure stored are sold to farmers on tractor load basis and this is major source of income for the pastoralists besides disposal of male calves for Jallikattu /rekla race festivals. He collec ts penning charge of Rs. 400 - 500 per day from farmer where 80 animals are penned during night time. He also sell the dried cow dung on tractor load basis. He sells manure of 20 -25 loads annually and earn Rs. 1,25,000 . Usually he disposes manure at Rs . 5000 per tractor load. He sells about 20 male calves at Rs. 10,000/ male animal (for the purpose of Jallikattu,Rekla race ,ploughing bullocks) and earns about Rs. 2 lakhs per annum. He is paying Rs. 60,000 to the herdsman as wages to look after the a nimals as full time worker for grazing the cattle . He also spends about Rs. 25,000 towards the cost of fodder and medicine. Net Income from cattle is Rs. 2,40,000 year. In addition for his 15 acres of land he is using his cattle manure and never uses inorganic chemical fertilizer for maintaining the soil fertility . Constraints When Malaimadu cattle are used for wetland ploughing continuously for a week they are susceptible to FMD. He treats the animals with neem oil , turmeric powder and making a pa ste and applied over the foot region for 2 -3 days for complete curing. When cattle is showing symptoms of fever he takes the extract of bamboo leaves (100ml) and mix it with ginger extract (30 ml) and it is administered twice. For diarrohea administers 5 banana soaked in castor oil. For indigestion he administers fenugreek 100 gm soaked in butter milk and it should be given twice. The farmer has not been using any chemical pesticide or weedicide over the last 40 years in his field . Address : Mr. N. A J ude Thaddeus 161/4 Rayappar Street Rayappanpatti (Post), Uttamapalayam (Taluka) Theni Documented By : V.Alagumalai , SEVA Oct 2013 3. Conservation of Malaimadu Cattle by Mr . Govindan - A Herdsman supports for Liv estock keepers Rights Mr. Govindan is 57 years old studied up to 5th standard. He is an agricultural labourer ,belong to konar community (know for traditional pastoralism)and pooled Malaimadu cattle from dif ferent farmers in Koomapatti village and looking after them for the past 50 yrs. He is living in Koomapatti village, situated under the foot hills of western ghats in Srivilliputhur Taluka, Virudhunagar District, Tamil Nadu. Malaimadu cattle breed keeping is the traditional livelihood for many generations in the family of Govindan since british period. Earlier his father maintained about 20 animals only but now gradually improved and at present keeps on his own 42 malaimadu cattle (14 milch cows, 10 heifers, 15 calves and 3 bulls) and in addition look after the cattle of other farmers. Status of Malaimadu cattle Malaimadu cattle has been existence for 10 generations in villages situate in the foothills are about 25 families owning about 5,000 cattle . The decline of population of cattle from few lakhs to 5,000 is due t o various factors viz. the denial of grazing permits by forest officials, the unavailability of labour to look after the herds and tractorization, which reduces the demand for plough bullocks or draught animals. The forest has been declared as squirrel san ctuary and grazing banned in forests. These cattle have been taken for open grazing and during monsoon season (cropping season mainly with paddy ) the only place available for grazing was forests in the villages adjoining to western ghats. Therefore the local cattle were taken to uphills for grazing in forests for few months and this rotational system of grazing between plains and hilly tract might have helped them to adopt special traits and their body become compact and more strength or stamina for clim bing the hills and evolved into hill cattle or Malaimadu . This is distinct from Pulikulam cattle breed. Malaimadu breed are short and sturdy and body colour varies from place to place based on availability of vegetation viz Mayilai (grey ), Sembarai brown spots ), Karumbor (pale black spots). Penning system At present these cattle are being maintained by herders for the purpose of penning and manuring farmers fields. During the monsoon (north east monsoon in Oct. - Dec and April - June) the cattle are sent to forests (western ghats) for grazing; in the off -season after the harvest of paddy or other crops the cattle are let into the fallow lands for the purpose of grazing and penning. Breeding in Malaimadu Malaimadu cattle br eeders follow some criteria for selecting males for breeding . They are : calf obtained through 3rd lactation; horns straight or tilted frontward; colour of the bull should be vellai (bright white), mayilai (milk white), sembor and karumbor; the mother of the bull, should be a high milk yielder among the cattle; the tail should be short and thin and above the knee of the bull; dewlap should be very little in the neck region; lung frame should be wide and body frame to be lengthy; the length of the face and ears should be short and eyes projected for attraction of the face; the testicles should be small in size ; the skin should be nice, soft and thin. These last two features make the bull active and speedy in mating ; the bull must be ferocious in nature and taller than all other animals in a stock ; the bull must have a leading capacity character, able to lead the herd while grazing in forests and save the cattle herd from the attack of wild predators; the parents, especially the mother of the stud bull, s hould be bright in colour as such as vellai (white ), mayilai (grey), karumbor (black spots ), sembor (red spots) and even karumayilai (dark grey) ; the same is to be adopted for selecting the stud bull also. Details of breed conservation Income t hrough Malaimadu cattle Mr. Govindan earns income of Rs. 90,000 per year by selling young calves (20 calves fetches Rs 60,000), disposing of manure (20 tractor loads of cow dung value at Rs 20,000) and share crop of about of Rs 10,000 from other farmers. This area is cropped with two crops annually by using well and tank water and crops like paddy and cotton and pulses are raised.The fields manured through penning with malaimadu cattle maintains good soil fertility and farmers reduces uses of chemical fer tilizer to the extent of 50 -60 percent as told by the herder Govindan and he arranges farmerwise penning by negotiating with other herders. Ethno veterinary practices followed by Mr.Govindan Black quarter ( Santhunoi )is one of major disease in malaimadu cattle . It shows symptoms of animal getting tiredness, swelling on the front (neck region ) and back side (Thigh region) of the body , high fever, no feeding. If all the symptoms are continue without taking any treatment the animal will die within a week . For this he is preparing herbal recipe with ingredients viz. latex of Thirukalli (Euphorbia thirukalli) - 50 m , Pothakalli - 50 ml, Kodikalli - 50 ml, Kalli - 50 ml, Mosakalli - 50 ml, Erukku ( Calotropis gigantea) - 50 ml, cow milk or ghee - 50 ml, T he powdered mixing of dried ginger -10gm , Pepper -10gm, Thipili (Long peper and Vellarugu .All the above items are mixed in the new clay pot and put in open place of sunlight. After 7 hours the mixture will become violet color. Take the mixture with cotton cloth tied -up stick and apply over on the affected place for only one time . So far more than 400 animals treated were cured Mr Govindan sa ys. Supporting Grazing Rights of Cattle Herders in Srivilliputhur Taluk He is founder leader of Malaimadu cattle herders association in Koomapatti and surrounding villages viz. Kansapuram, Sethunarayanapuram, Nedungulam in Watrap block. He has taken ini tiative in filling writ petition in Madras High court for obtaining grazing permission for cattle herders in Virudhunagar District. This petition is still in the court and members await for favorable judgement. He also joined pastoralists delegates to meet parliamentarian committee in New Delhi on the tribal bill amendment during 2005. He is well known herdsman and negotiates with forest officials whenever herders face confrontation with forest department along with penalties as grazing in forest zone is viewed illegal. He regularly visits office of district collector and wild life warden of Squirrel sanctuary for the cause of grazing rights of traditional herders in this region. But still the problem continues and herders undergo agony and tortures includin g arrests and confining custody till the penalties are paid/false cases booked.

In Kutch region usually the camels spend 3 days feeding in t he mangroves and then one day back on main land for drinking fresh water and then the cycle repeats. In Kutch region of Gujarat about 16 generations ago (400 years back ) camels have been maintained by Rabaries (Hindus ) in Pipar village, Lakhpat taluka . During that time there was a dispute in one of the Rabari family when they want to divide their property between 2 brothers . There was only one camel left in the family and 2 brothers wanted to own the single camel and they were unable to settle the m atter . They went to one muslim saint named Savlapir who lives in nearby mangroves island adjacent to the village. By seeing the complicated issue Savlapir made a small camel with clay and he asked choice of 2 brothers to take each one take one camel. The elder brother immediately opted for living camel and it had been given to him. Then the younger brother with the blessings of muslim saint had to take the clay camel with him. Savlapir told that the single clay camel which will be multiplyi ng in to many camels on the way to his home. The muslim saint advised the younger brother that he should not turn back while returning home. The saint told the younger brother he can hand over surplus camels to muslim community in case Rabari fam ilies unable to maintain them . Then many camels appeared and followed the younger brother . The younger brother had a doubt in his mind to see back whether camels were really following him. Then he turned back .This has stopped further appearance of new camels and he returned home with as many number of camels as already appeared along with him. Now a days there are no Rabaries has been rearing the camels but the Jat community (Muslim) alone keeping the kharai camels. One of the Jat ( Muslim) famil y Mr.Agakhan Savlani who is living now in Pipar village can be traced back to 16 th generation of the muslim saint Savlapir who lived in the island of mangroves .

Mr P.Vivekanandan highlighted Livestock Keepers Rights and how SEVA in association with other NGOs succeeded amending Tribal Bill in Parliament which led to enactment of \" Th e Scheduled Tribes and other forest dwellers Forest Rights Act 2006 . It restores grazing rights of traditional pastoralists communities in forest areas including sanctuaries and national parks . To implement the Act again lot of ground formalities are t o be fulfilled. He suggested Govt .has to promote separate authority/ entity in order to achieve the rights. . The Director of NBAGR stressed that it is not the same model evolved by Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Right Act 2001 but to fulfil l the needs of local livestock keeping communities. Dr. Ilse Kohler Rollefson founder, LIFE Network told the history behind the LKR and it was first defined in 2002 during FAO conference. In 2007 Interlaken declaration LKR was mentioned officially. The Nag oya Protocol on ABS in 2010 obliges community protocol. Dr. D K Sadana emphasised that the farmers should have the right to choose the bull/semen so that they can maintain their local breed animals as pure. P. Vivekanandan mentioned legal frame work for cl aiming LKR through Forests Rights Act 2006, National Policy for farmers 2007, Biological Diversity Act 2002. He highlighted classification of category of farmers / livestock keepers, landless, Gausalas, breeders association, private companies for providing material and not material support to them. Dr. Kamal Kishore told that a couple of corporate companies are keeping only 20 bulls of Holstein Friesian to supply semen worldwide, which affects genetic variability within the species. Mr. P.K. Lal and Dr. J ayadevan of Kasargod cattle breeders association told that 1961 Livestock Improvement Act of Kerala led to castration of 2600 bulls in the year 2006 and penalty of Rs. 500 and jail if a person keeps bulls of native cattle breed. Government decides the bre eding policy excluding other stake -holders viz. NGOs and livestock keepers. Mr. P. Vivekanandan told that institutions related to breed conservation shall play role of facilitator in the process of participatory decision making while making awareness on t he importance of local breeds in sustainable livestock production. All agreed to promote breed society / association at village level and means to support them through Govt. funds by creating national level authority . Dr Benittopaulraj, Malaimadu cattl e Ashoka swamiji, Bargur Lingayats community maintaining cattle breed have highlighted their grazing problems associated with forests. Grazing has been stopped when Joint Forest Management (JFM) programme has been introduced in Tamil Nadu during 1997 -1998 . More than 1000 villages have been allotted with 500 ha of forest land for protection and planting of trees in forests after promoting village forest committees . In the micro plan document it has been told that grazing will be revived after 3 -5 years of tree planting. Practically it didn't happen and SEVA NGO has referred this to forest department on several occasion. Finally grazing policy has been envisaged by forest Department in 2007 . However there wa s no sincerity in implementing this policy . Again in the name of Forest Working Plan, JFM area has been closed. There was no discussion with forest dependants before preparing the Working Plan and therefore it needs to be amended and grazing sites shal l be reworked in this plan. They told that instances of destruction of forests due to spread of exotic species Lantana sp.,( Bargur forests) Prosopis juliflora (Kutch), Eucalyptus and Vishamul -a posionous thorny species (Nilgiris) and by other means like quick spreading of fire due to over growth of grasses. Therefore restricted grazing is a tool in ecosystem management and could not be neglected. The pastoralists suggested to allow grazing wherever 5 -7 years completed from the date of commencement of JFM in specific Village Forest Committees (VFC) areas, providing permanent permit cards for those traditional communities keeping native breed of animals, passing of resolution in VFC. VFCs are merely operational units for the sake of records due to mul tivarious work load of range officers. Therefore it is crucial ensuring Participatory involvement of local people in management and protection of forest resources through strengthening. VFCs will be strengthened only if local forest dependants derive bene fits from forest through sustainable management of resources including grazing and experimentally linked with selected NGOs. The traditional camping system of cattle inside forests is century old practice and it shall be continued as per FRA 2006 which i n turn promote mutual benefit both to forests by providing manure to soil and occasionallyInternational Symposium on \"Sustainable management of AnimalGeneticResources for Livelihood Security in Developing Countries\"duringFebruary 13 -14, 2015, MVC, TANUVAS, CHENNAI, TAMILNADU, INDIA Proceedings & Recommendations Page5wild predators prey upon few cattle which is benefiting the wild life. The pastoralists are to be integrated as custodian of forests rather than alienating them. Thi s is crucial for breed keeping traditional pastoralists viz. Malaimadu cattle herders in Theni district. And Virudhunagar district and Bargur cattle breed keepers in Bargur forests area of Erode district. In the afternoon pastoralists delegates met senior officials of Tamil Nadu forest and Tamil Nadu tribal welfare department and submitted a memorandum on grazing issues of Tamil Nadu state pastoralists including Pulikulam cattle pastoralists .

The First presentation by, Jose Otario Zimas on \"Present status and future prospects of India n cattle and buffaloes in Brazil and their contribution to livelihood security in developing countries\" has established the fact that the Indian breeds have performed well abroad. By selective breeding of the Zebu species, the milk production has raised fr om 3,000kg to 10,000kg which could be well replicated in India. The Second presentation on \"Defining the undefined Animal Genetic Resources to complete the National Inventory of India\" by Dr.Arjava Sharma had given complete picture on Livestock population dynamics from 1951 to 2012 with 151 breeds reported so far. Species wise categorization of Indian livestock has thrown light on importance of an National Documentation System for registering valuable sover eign genetic resources along with knowledge, skills and techniques and biological resources of local communities. It was documented that there is no programme / policy for non -distinct population and any group of population with very less number of animals .

Responding to a query on supply of sexed semen; it was recommended that s emen should not be from exotic inheritance The presentation on \"Genetic improvement of Cattle genetic resources of India: Issues and Challenges\" byDr.B.Prakshhas thrown light on cattle production system in India and recommended the use of MOET based full sib information for selection of bulls has an alternative to the FBT programme. The increase of indigenous cattle population at the cost of CB cattle was recommended. The presentation on 'Status of camel genetic resources of India, conservation and bree ding policy for their improvement' has brought out the distorted sex ratio in the species and the camel development policy was requested to be shared with line departments and farmers. It was insisted that farmers have to be involved while framing policies . The presentation on \"Animal genetic resources of Uttarkhand, management and breeding policy for improvement of AnGR in Himalayan region\" by Dr.C.V.Singhhas suggested the breeding strategies for hill livestock germplasm and guiding principles for live stock breeders. A Vechur model for conservation' presented byDr.K.Anilkumar is a work that can be taken as an example of how a breed was conserved with the concerted efforts of the University, Farmers and NGOs. The oral presentation on local Goats of K arnataka and Sikkim, Punganur cattle of Andhra Pradesh and Katchchi horse of Gujarat all focus on the need for identifying and documenting the Indigenous breed and framing policy for their improvement.

Hence there is an urgent need to prepare the BCPs of all Indian Livestock keeping communities to achieve sustainable livestock development at national level. 2.Breed society is an officially recognized organization for the association of people with common interest for improvement or development of the breed. Breed societies have made significant contributions to development and conservation of breeds around the world. India with large livestock wealth, have few breed societies and hence formation of a breed societies of all the breeds of India have to be made and they to be finan cially supported for its maintenance. In addition, the breed societies that will be formed will have to work in more networked manner and in a joint action mode to be more effective. 3.Pastoralists are involved in in -situ conservation of the breeds over the decades and hence they have to be involved or consulted in policy formulation by the Government agencies. 4.Livestock keepers have the right to be rewarded for their efforts in keeping the local breeds and hence benefit sharing have to be provided to them 5.Value addition of livestock waste will be an economical and sustainable approach in the conservation and management of AnGR and the same have to be made for the all the livestock breeds in India.

Rapporteur : Dr.P.K.Singh, Scientist, NBA GR, Karnal. After presentation of Dr. D.V. Singh , the topic was open for debate. Dr. Arjava Sharma said that breeding policies formulated at National and State levelsareadequate but implementation of breeding policies is poor. Most of the states are not strictly following their breeding policies. He also stated that basic raw material for implementing the breeding policies is bull/semen of the bulls of superior genetic m erit, which is not adequately available in the country. Dr. M.Babu also admitted that the breeding policies are made at state or national level are OK but proper sensitization of veterinarians and other staff of AHDs is required so as to implement it in t rue spirit. Dr. S.K. Singh stated that in India breeding policy is restricted to artificial insemination only. We are not having adequate number of bulls or semen which is to be developed by ourselves for producing quality animals and no one from other co untry will do for us. We have to locate genetically meritorious animals from our population and use them for breeding. For this national evaluation centre is needed. It also true that maintaining the male animal sis a costly affair for the farmers keeping few female animals . Dr. S. Iype advised proper identification of animals for all the breeds and species. She also opined that Kerala is importing semen from 1960 which should immediately be stopped and we must develop our capacities in this regard. Dr. P.K. Singh stated that breeding policy is a state subject and keeping in view in diversification in livestock, soil, purchasing power of livestock keepers and livestock production system in the country and even within the state. Therefore, there is a need t o develop breeding policies in accordance with production system, species, breed and area under consideration. He also advocated that involvement of the livestock keepers and all the stake holders is needed at the time of formulation of breeding policies. Dr. K. Nadarajah was of the opinion that semen data is available in exotic semen production systems therefore, the imported semen is more reliable for genetic improvement of livestock. Dr. N.K. Verma stated that NBAGR, Karnal is organizing brain storming sessions for livestock resources in different states and so far 13 states have been covered. In these sessions breeding policy of respective state is discussed by the scientists and state AHD officers. Such regular interactions are needed to modify and improve the breeding policies at regular time intervals. Dr. M.R. Jayshankar was of the opinion that there is no need to change the breeding policy. We should incorporate the breeder associations in implementation of these policies. More frozen semen stati on and better conception rate is required so as to supply the semen in accordance to its demand and develop the faith of the livestock keepers in the technology. He was of the opinion that all livestock and poultry species should be covered in the breeding policy rather than only cattle and buffalo. He also suggested that animals may be purchased from other states, if needed. International Symposium on \"Sustainable management of AnimalGeneticResources for Livelihood Security in Developing Countries\"duringFebruary 13 -14, 2015, MVC, TANUVAS, CHENNAI, TAMILNADU, INDIA Proceedings & Recommendations Page20Dr. D.K. Sadana stated that our breeding policy is focused on milk yield only. The farmers actual requirements like draft power are also needed and should be incorporated in the breeding policy. He emphasized that in many areas like Southern India milk is not primary req uirement. Dr. N. Sahoo emphasized the need of developing a road map indicating the agencies to perform their duties within a stipulated time frame for genetic improvement of livestock. He also stated that a comprehensive breeding policy is also needed for all the state rather than a few lines document. Dr. M.S. Tantia stated that breeding decisions are to be made by livestock keepers/ farmers only. Mr. Jude Thadheus from Malaimadu breeders association wanted recognition of malaimadu cattle as a breed and pr oper solution for the problem of grazing land for the animals in consultation with the forest ministry. Dr. David E. Steane stated that role of extension is very important in implementation of breeding policy. Farmers should be explained about the breedin g policy in depth so that it may be properly implemented at grass root level. He also stated that the breeding policy offers an opportunity to monitor the selection made by the breeders. At the end , theChairman of the session Dr. Arjava Sharma concluded that the breeding policy should be framed in form of breeding management including policies for all the species, breeds, production system and areas keeping view the capacity of the livestock keepers in the state. PROCEEDINGS OF GENERAL BODY MEETING Society for Conservation of Domestic Animal Biodiversity, Karnal (SOCDAB) (February 13, 2015, atTANUVAS, Chennai ) The General Body meeting of SOCDAB was held at 5.30 PM on the first day of XII Inter-national Symposium under the chairmanship of Dr. Arjava Sharma, President, SOCDAB and Director, NBAGR, Karnal.

In this regard we organized a meeting with different stake holders on 16 .9.2015 .The Director of Animal Husbandry officially deputed Regional Joint Director of Animal Husbandry, Madurai to attend the meeting . Dr. Gopinath, Joint Director of Animal Husbandry and Dr. Jeyakumar, Ass istant Director of Animal Husbandry attended the meeting. This meeting was attended by 80 members which include d Pulikulam cattle herders, Malaimadu cattle herders, Umbalachery Cattle Breeders ' Association, farmers interested in conserving native breeds of cattle and non- governmental organizations (NGOs ) The Department of Animal Husbandry conveyed that a budget of Rs. 15,60,000 will be extended to SEVA to promote nucleus breeding unit at S ri Krishna Goshala Trust, Kakkivadanpatti, Virudhu nagar district. However , the funds will be released as and when the Ministry of Agriculture, New Delhi released second insta llment of funds to the State government. Semen of the Pulikulam cattle will be ma de available to the farmers interested to inseminate their cows for conserving this breed. The District Collector , Mr. L. Subramanian assured the pastoralists that the issue of grazing of cattle in forest areas will be finalised after discussing with the District Forest Officer (on that day pastoralists submitted a memorandum to the District Collector). SEVA forwarded the concept note on rotational grazing system in forests on seasonal basis so that this can be accommodated in the next working plan of fore sts. In this regard , Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests ( Working Plan) convened a meeting with all stake holders in Madurai on 27 .12.2015. (SEVA could not participate in the meeting due to other engagements but pastoralists views were submit ted through an official letter to them for their consideration). We are enclosing the minutes of 19.9.2015 meeting held in Madurai and also d etails on nucleus breeding unit for Pulikulam cattle and budget envisaged are shown separately. Minutes of One Day Workshop on Conservation of Local Breeds of Livestock in Tamil Nadu Symp Madurai A one day workshop on 'Conservation of local livestock breeds in Tamil Nadu' was organized as part of Madurai Symposium 2015* in collaboration with the DHAN Foundation. Eighty members representing farming communities, pastoralists, livestock keepers, breeders ' associations and NGOs from different districts of Tamil Nadu attended. Dr. Gopinath, Joint Director of Animal Husbandry, inaugurated the workshop. In his keynote address Dr. Gopinath explained different schemes of the Dep artmen t of Animal Husbandry includ ing free distribution of dairy animals, sheep and goats to poor beneficiaries. Dr. Jayakumar, Ass istant Director of Animal Husbandry , Madurai, spoke about various cattle, sheep, and goat breeds of Tamil Nadu and highlighted preventative treatments for d iseases like foot and mouth disease . Mr. P. Vivekanandan, Executive Director of SEVA, explained how native breeds evolved after domestication of different animal species. He spoke about the advantages of local breeds that evolved in the specific region bei ng conserved by local communities for many generations. He also told salient features of the breeds viz. Puilkulam sheep, Kanni adu goat and Kachaikatti Black sheep. He also explained the r ole and activities of breeders ' associations promoted by SEVA. Mr. Jude Thaddeus, president of Malaimadu cattle herders ' association explained that there were 2 lakhs population of Malaimadu cattle but now the population was reduced to 20,000 only. In spite of the reduction in cattle population, the forest officials are not in a position to provide grazing permits to cattle herders. This is the case for Malaimadu cattle herders in Virudhu nagar district also. Mr. Muthukumaresan, a herder from Salem d istrict, told that there is a distinct population of local cattle known as ' Naattumadu ' numbering about 500. They graze in forests during the rainy season and they are taken to plain s for grazing for 6 months during summer in Thanjavur district. This type of tradition is being disrupted due to the ban on forest grazing enforced by the Forest Department. M.K.Rajakopalan explained how the value -added products from cow urine, cow dung viz. Ark and Panchagavya have good potential for marketing. Mr. Chellamuthu , a farmer from Erode district, obtained bumper yield in maize and turmeric by applying Panchagavya and herbal pesticide prepared by himself. Mrs. Indira Gandhi presented her case of marketing navagavya product (organic liquid fertilizer) prepared by herse lf with nine ingredients mostly from cow products. Mr. Janakiraman, secretary of Umbalachery Cattle Herders ' Association, explained the procedure for obtaining Umbalachery heifers from Korkai cattle farm. There was interaction between farmers and breeders of different livestock viz. Kachaikatti Black sheep, Malaimadu cattle, Pulikulam cattle. The workshop passed the following resolutions: 1. Semen of local breeds of cattle shall be made available in all districts. 2. Local breeds of livestock are to be included in government free distribution of animals to poor beneficiaries. 3. Traditional grazing system of pastoralists has to be studied formally and recognize customary practices which include grazing rights to the livestock keeping communities. 4. In the Internati onal Year of Soils, restore soil health by increasing soil fertility through the traditional system of penning, which in turn reduces the cost of external inputs in agriculture. List of participants attended the workshop on Conservation of local livestock breeds on 16 Sep 2015 at Thamukkam Maidhanam, Madurai. S.No. 625 39.

The Symposium attracts over 15,000 participants and the one being organized in 2015 is the seventh edition. The theme of the Symposium 2015 is ' Localizing Sustainable Development Goals'. Conservation Plan of Pulikulam Cattle Breed in Tamil Nadu 1. Nucleus Breeding Unit for Pulikulam cattle Plan by SEVA Initially 50 elite heifer calves along with 3 males of Pulikulam cattle will be procured from the herders . The procured cattle will be maintained at Sri Krishna Goshala Trust (promoted by SEVA during 2005 )at Kakkivadanpatti village , Virudhunagar d breeding tract of Pulikulam cattle . New -born male calves after o ne year will be distributed to herds maintained by pastoralists . Each male will be allowed to do natural service for 3 years in a herd or group . The bulls already existing in the herd will be castrated or discarded . The nucleus unit will be able to supply elite male s or females to interested farmers on cost basis after 5 years of establishment (males have demand for Jallikattu , Rekla race or for draught purpose . The existing infrastructure at Goshala will be utilized . However renovation of roof and,floor w ill be undertaken for hygienic management of the animal unit . We have procured10 calves of Pulikulam breed from cattle herd. The animals will be taken for open grazing daily from morning to evening . After 5 years , income from sale of male / female calves, manure will able to contribute to the overall maintenance cost and towards sustainability of the unit. \\ 50 cows x 3 bulls (Elite animals procured from herders) First generation - 30 calves (15 females +15 males); males will be distributed to pastoralists herds at 3 -years interval Second generation - 10 calves (5 females + 5 males); males to be distributed to pastoralists herds and so on. The animals will be grouped in such away so that anytime mating of sister -brother or sire- daughter or closely related animals will not happen. Providing drinking water facilities for C attle Pulikulam cattle are maintained as migratory herds. The herd size ranges from 50 to 500. They depend upon common grazing land for grazing. During rainy season the cattle are taken to forest for grazing and return to the plains after harvesting of the field crops in the plains. Nowadays forest grazing has been banned by the Forest Department and it has affected the migratory pattern of animals. During summ er or in drought period the cattle herders face difficulties for providing drinking water to animals when the ponds / tank dry up. In our last workshop with pastoralists (June 2013) it has been suggested to provide drinking water facilities for the cattle herds. Therefore community drinking water points are to be established by installing bore well s and drinking water trough s in the following places of cattle migration: animal drinking water ponds in Manangathan village (Sivagangai district) are to be de -silted. Bore wells will be sunk in common lands identified (adjacent to tanks site) in the above three sites. A water trough will also be constructed near the bore well and water will be filled when the animals enter the site. These drinking water units will also be utilized by the village cattle and other ruminants when they also visit those grazing sites. For each site it will cost Rs 1,16,600. We are encl osing engineering estimate in the Annexure. Budget for Sanction S.

Found in the coastal areas of Gujarat state, this is a unique 'dual ecosystem' breed as it survives on underwater -mangroves as well as in dryland -ecosystem. The surveys undertaken revealed that , alarmingly, the population of Kharai is short of a max figure of 4000 . In view of breed conservation, hence, Kharai is a threatened breed . In its husbandry, a number of constraints were recor ded which have a bearing on survival and continui ty of the breed and sustenance of this unique production system: Shrinking grazing areas near coast Several restrictions imposed on grazing of Kharai camel on m angrove which is major source of fodder for this breed , and often, the only source of nutrition. As Kharai camel are reared in the interior locations, health care services do not reach on regular basis , even on short term basis. There is no supported facilities formarketing of camel milk or products No economic incentives (or biodiversity considerati on) for rearing this unique breed in the face of tremendous hardship In general, the Kharai camel breeders are not organized Some of a round 500 families that rear Kharai camel and are dependent on its husbandry, are leaving the profession due to above cons traints. The breed supports the local eco -system and is spread out in the coastal areas of Bharuch, Jamnagar, Khambat and Okha. A Plan for Conservation of Kharai Camel In order to combat the above constraints, following activities have been planned: 1. Creating fodder security by improving grazing areas / habitat for Kharai camel 2. Ensure healthcare services for Kharai camel 3. Create economic opportunities, particularly through sale of camel milk and products 4. Building capac ities of b reeders by strengthenin g their institutions 5. Improvement of Kharai Camel through selective b reeding These activities require collective actions from various stakeholders to arrest the declining trend of Kharai camel population . It is envisaged that the Department of Animal Husban dry, Camel Breeders' Association, Sarhad Dairy (Kutch District Co -operative Milk Producers Union Ltd.) and Sahjeevan will work together to overcome the limitations . In addition to breed improvement, healthcare, grazing area restoration, focus will be give n for economic development through developing market linkages for camel milk and milk products. Since, c amel milk has high nutritional and therapeutic properties, promotional activities will be taken up to raise consumer awareness , as follows: Sl No Activities Main Responsibility Collaboration 1 Breed Improvement programme Sahjeevan Breeders Association 2 Regular Healthcare Department of AH Breeders Association 3 Grazing Area restoration Department of AH & Breeders Association Sahjeevan, Department of Forest, Ministry of Rural Development 4 Milk and Milk Product Marketing Sarhad Dairy (Kutch District Co-operative Milk Producers Union Ltd.) Breeders Association & Sahjeevan 5 Strengthening Breeders Association Sahjeevan Departm ent of A nimal Husbandrys In order to sustain this work, it is necessary to strengthen breeders association. It is expected that Breeders Association will carry on with above activities in the long run. Sahjeevan will take responsibility for capacity buil ding of Breeders Association. As camel is culturall y associated with breeders, awareness and c apacity building programmes can be organized during cultur al events . A Kharai Camel Restoration Programme has been prepared requiring a budget of Rs 4 crore, and expected to achieve the following in a time -frame: Declining trend of Kharai c amel population will be checked Around 2500 ha o f Grazing land will be restored Healthcare programme will be streamlined - in general At least 80% of Kharai camel (3000) will be covered with healthcare Camel milk and milk product market will be developed and marketed in association with Sarhad Da iry (Kutch District Co -operative Milk Producers Union Ltd.) Rs. 1. 25 crore released to Sarhad Dairy for infrastructural establis hment for camel milk marketing. Enterprises will be developed for camel milk and other products and tourism -services Government participation in Camel Mega Show in Kutch With regular camel show s, camel h ealth camps, cultural events with camel pastoralists jointly organized in association with camel breeders association ( Kutch Unt Uchherak Maldhari Sangathan ), Sahjeevan in the right track towards conservation of Kharai camel breed. It has brought togeth er most of the camel pastoralists not only from different region of K utch but also from other districts like Jamnagar, Bhavnagar, Bharuch, Khambat and Okha. Many consumers tasted ca mel milk and milk products and gave positive feedback as a health product t o be made available at their doorsteps . Gujarat Govt has decided to collaborate with local initiatives through their participation s uch as annual camel events including camel shows regularly and this will provide a conducive environment for the camel breed ers along with their breed to survive. On 31 Dec 2015 Chief Minister of Gujarat state Smt. Anandiben Patel herself honoured the occasion of camel mega show by releasing b ooklet on Kharai camel at C hala village near Bhuj .

Dr. N. Kandasamy, Retd. Professor & Head of Department of Animal Genetics & Breeding, Veterinary College, Namakkal , Germany Summary : The project implementing partners have agreed to promote project advisory committee with respective partners representatives, experts in order to get technical advice or inputs while implementing the project activities in the respective breed conserving area. Besides, we correspond and interact with PAC members through e -mail on the indicators, preparation of report and sorting out issues, if any, that come across in order to smoothly implement the project. First meeting of PAC was held at WOTR Training Centre, Darewadi, Maharashtra on 4th July 2013. This meeting helped to understand the field realities faced by respective NGOs, suggestions on survey format, sample size and to fine -tune activities and finalising the draft indicators plan. Few resolutions have been passed to take important decisions viz. Su bmitting proposal for to government for cofounding, documentation, reporting and ratification of budget spent for this PAC meeting. 3 Objective : To seek expert opinion and consultancy for implementing FAO project \"Documenting and supporting community b ased conservation for 4 local breeds in India\" Introduction : Dr. Kamal welcomed the participants of the First Advisory Meeting of the FAO Project. He requested Mr. Vivekanandan to present the status of the project. P. Vivekanandan thanked the members f or their overall support extended to obtain approval and sanction by FAO for our Project entitled \" Documenting and Supporting Community based Conservation for 4 Local Breeds in India \" under funding strategy for the implementation of Global Plan of Action f or Animal Genetic Resources. He asked the Project Investigators of the respective sub -projects to present the progress achieved so far. Dr. Nimbkar shared the questionnaire for a survey of goat keepers and their goats, prepared by the Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute, Phaltan. 1. Presentation on Kharai Camel Mr. Ramesh Bhatti from Sahjeevan have initiated the breed survey and documentation. He narrated that physical measurements of 100 camels (of different ages and sexes) were recorded and 30 of t hose were weighed. A draft biocultural protocol for Kharai camel in Kutch region has been prepared which he circulated amongst the members. Mr. Vivekanandan suggested to undertake case studies of local farmers, and labourers keeping camel cart and how they sustain their livelihoods. Camel disease inventory is to be recorded along with rainfall pattern to 4 understand the production system better as expressed by Dr. Ilse. It was decided that we need to find out what was the mortality in the last year although Dr. Ilse cautioned that mortality figures would fluctuate from year to year due to various factors. Mr. Ramesh mentioned that at present 72 families are maintaining 1580 Kharai camels in Kutch region even though there are families who migrated to Aliyabet of Bharuch, Bhavnagar, Khambhat and periphery of Gulf of Khambhat, Vadodara and Junagadh area are keeping the same breed (in south Gujarat). In total, there are 4000 Kharai camels in northern and southern Gujarat. Kharai camel project has been launched officially on 22nd June 2013 at Bhuj with participation of officials from the department of animal husbandry, Gujarat. Dr. Kamal suggested that the biocultural protocol (BCP) should be printed once final version was compiled. Dr. Sadana desired to increase t he number of animals to be recorded for characterization. 2. Presentation on Boti sheep Mr. Hanwant Singh Rathore of LPPS highlighted that at present pastoralists who migrate long distance prefer keeping Bhagli sheep as it is fit and can withstand long migration. Therefore the population of Bhagli sheep is on rise while Boti sheep is showing decline in numbers. It was expressed that the Boti sheep have a black face and a white body, vestigial ears and fine wool and are bigger than Chokla while Bhagli hav e a brown face and white body and have higher length Sonadi like. Bhagli is also preferred because Bhagli lambs can be sold at the age of one month. Breed survey is being undertaken at family level in villages (survey has been done in 9 villages so far). M r. Hanwant Singh said that only 300 Boti sheep were found in a survey of 20 -25 villages and that there are virtually no breeding rams to be found. Nowadays the wool is being sold at lower price. The wool is processed by few families engaged in weaving thro ugh handlooms. \"This will be studied in depth\" he told to the members. It was decided that after the survey is completed, a decision will be taken about a BCP as Boti sheep have been included in the Raika BCP. 3. Presentation on Pulikulam cattle Mr. P. Vivekanandan presented that Pulikulam cattle are maintained in herds by migratory pastoralists in Madurai, Sivagangai, Theni and Virudhunagar districts. At present the number of herds is drastically reduced due to lack of grazing permission in forests d uring rainy season. He mentioned that earlier there were 150 herds which reduced to 50 herds about five years ago and now there are only around 25 herds, each having about 400 cattle belonging to many farmers. He told that survey of cattle breed, Jallikatt u bulls, plough bullocks in the selected villages are being undertaken as per the format suggested by Dr. Kandasamy. He said that 10 case studies of bulls being kept for Jallikattu have been compiled. Dr. Kandasamy said that this breed was first described by Gunn who established the Madras Veterinary College long ago. The project has been officially launched on 19 June 2013 at Madurai by Dr. B.K. Joshi, Director, NBAGR, Karnal. Dr. Kamal suggested that the BCP is to be printed after breed survey and discus sion with pastoralists is completed. Mr. Vivekanandan mentioned that in Theni district, the cattle owners had got permission to graze 10% of the animals from every herd in the forest, due to the efforts of a lawyer who is a cattle owner. 5 4. Presentat ion on Attap pady goat Attappad y goats are found in the hilly, drought -prone area in Palakkad district of Kerala, which is an entirely different area from that where Malabari goats are found. It was decided that the Attappady goat survey has to be done ag ain. Dr. Jayan, Vechur Conservation Trust, Kerala told that breed survey work is delayed due to monsoon. It will be commenced by the end of July 2013 once monsoon slows down. It is also difficult to do the survey since the goats are sent for grazing early in the morning and return late evening. Some of the villages are deep in the forest and the tribal goat owners are generally not cooperative. There is also rampant malnutrition and high infant mortality in the tribal population. He explained the importance of goat meat as it is preferred due to its flavor by the traders - the meat from black goats is preferred but no particular value is attached to Attappad y goat meat. Dr. Chanda wanted to know the basis of meat studies possible for value addition. Resolu tions and Recommendations After the discussions, the meeting passed the following resolutions: 1. Resolved to submit co -funding proposal to Dept. of Animal Husbandry, New Delhi to meet the cost of midterm review and other components not included in FAO p roject to solve the problem of pastoralists associated with common property resources (CPR) in respective field sites and same shall be forwarded by first week of August 2013. 2. Resolved to complete breed survey work, documentation and case studies by Sept ember 2013 so that it will be included in the progress report of FAO in October 2013. Resolved that all material for the first report should be sent to Dr. Nimbkar by 15th September so that the report can be submitted in October 2013. 3. Resolved to seek prio r permission whenever FAO logo is to be used in banners, reports or media purpose. 4. Resolved to circulate the existing indicator and fine -tune these along with time plan so that it is finalized by August 2013.
