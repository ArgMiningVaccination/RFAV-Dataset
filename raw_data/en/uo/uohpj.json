The vaccines given under the UIP are provided free of cost to beneficiaries including infants. The UIP is one of the largest immunization programmes in the world with an annual target of nearly 2.67 crores (26.7 million) infants and 2.9 crores (29 million) pregnant women.1 Reduction of under-five and infant mortality in India is a priority goal under the National Health Mission (NHM) of the Government of India. After the first month of life, vaccine-preventable diseases remain the biggest threat to children, accounting for more than 500,000 deaths annually in India, as of 2008.2 Immunization is considered to be one of the most cost-effective public health interventions for protection of children, especially under-5 years of age, from life-threatening conditions which are preventable. The immunization programme has contributed significantly in bringing down infant mortality rate (IMR) from 50/1000 live births in 2009 to 32/1000 live births in 2018. Similarly the under 5 mortality rate has decreased from 45 in 2014 to 34.3 in 2019.3 To achieve the full impact of vaccines, both current and new, high full immunization coverage in every state must be ensured. As per the recently released NFHS 5 (2019-20) data, evaluated full immunization coverage has improved compared to the NFHS-4 (2015-16) in majority of the 22 states where the survey was conducted.4 As envisaged under the Comprehensive Multi-Year Plan for immunization (2018-22), the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India, has implemented various routine immunization intensification strategies to reduce under-five morbidity, mortality and disability due to vaccine preventable diseases by providing quality immunization services to all eligible populations. Each such stride helps to save more lives and prevent illness and it is important to continue to maintain the same level of momentum for the fight against vaccine-preventable diseases. As part of Government of India's accelerated efforts, pledging to achieve full immunization coverage in coming years, the UIP is already implementing strategies to reduce left-outs, missed opportunities and drop-outs. Some of the notable interventions are by using due list by front-line health workers for tracking beneficiaries, strengthening mother-child tracking system (MCTS) and conducting special immunization drives at regular intervals. The efforts to strengthen political commitment and mobilize communities to scale up efforts that target the hardest-to-reach communities signal the renewed commitment of India's leadership to improve child survival. India has now been increasingly focusing its efforts on hard-to-reach populations and addressing the coverage and equity agenda through evidence- based strategies. 'Mission Indradhanush,' launched in 2014, is one of the key initiatives to rapidly improve immunization coverage by addressing equity gaps and increasing demand for immunization. As on March 2020 during the various phases of 'Mission Indradhanush,' a total of 3.76 crore children and 94.6 Lakh pregnant women have been vaccinated across 690 districts in the country. National Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 02To rapidly improve the full immunization coverage, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare launched Intensified Mission Indradhanush in selected districts/ urban areas with low coverage through targeted interventions focusing on routine immunization microplanning and greater inter-ministerial/ departmental convergence. Under the UIP, significant achievements have been made in preventing and controlling vaccine-preventable diseases through introduction of various new and underutilized vaccines (Annexure 1). These include nationwide introduction of Hameophilus influenzae type (Hib)-containing vaccine. Pneumococcal disease is the biggest vaccine- preventable cause of death in children under five, globally and in India (Figure 1-3). Pneumococcus is the leading cause of pneumonia, identified as one of the major causes of death in children globally. India accounted for one-fifth (20%) of the global pneumonia deaths in 2015. The figure 1 illustrates global causes of deaths among children under 5 years, 2018.5 WHO recommends the inclusion of PCVs in childhood immunization programme worldwide. Use of pneumococcal vaccine should be complimentary to other disease prevention and control measures, such as appropriate case management, promotion of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life and reducing known risk factors such as indoor air pollution and tobacco smoke.6Nearly 8 Lakh child deaths worldwide from pneumonia: a preventable and treatable illnessBiggest infectious is a respiratory infection that aects the lungsPneumococcus is the leading cause of pneumonia Source: Levels and trends in child mortality.

Global distribution of deaths among children under age 5, by cause, 20185Figure 2. Global Burden of pneumonia 20185 Pneumonia, 3% Preterm complications, deaths (47%)Background and Introduction 03Based on literature review and available evidence on disease burden, safety and efficacy, cost-effectiveness, sustainability and global experience, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) recommended the introduction of pneumococcal vaccine in the national immunization schedule. PCV has been introduced in the UIP in a phased manner starting from June 2017. Under the UIP, the PCV is now being administered to eligible children in 5 states - Bihar, expansion is planned to cover the remaining states and union territories. 1.2 CHILDHOOD PNEUMONIA Pneumonia continues to kill more children under five worldwide than any other single infectious disease, claiming an estimated 800,000 children's lives in 20187,8. Young children are at particularly high risk of developing severe pneumonia disease and death. More than 80% of deaths associated with pneumonia occur in children during the first 2 years of life. Pneumonia affects children and families everywhere, but is most prevalent in the developing world in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Children infected with pneumonia require early diagnosis and treatment. Many cases of pneumonia are vaccine-preventable. Pneumonia is caused by a number of infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria and fungi. The most common are: Streptococcus pneumoniae - the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in children; Hib - the second common cause of bacterial pneumonia; Respiratory syncytial virus - is the most common viral cause of pneumonia; Pneumocystis jiroveci - responsible for at least one quarter of all pneumonia deaths in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected infants. 1.3 GLOBAL SCENARIO OF PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE Pneumococcal disease is the name given to a group of diseases caused by a bacterium called Streptococcus pneumoniae (also known as pneumococcus). Pneumococcal disease can affect multiple organ systems, causing pneumonia, meningitis, bacteraemia/ sepsis, sinusitis, bronchitis and middle ear infection (see Chapter 2). Pneumococcal mortality is a significant contributor to the under-five mortality rate worldwide. As per WHO position paper-2019, of the estimated 5.83 million deaths among children <5 years of age globally in 2015, 294 000 were estimated to be caused by pneumococcal infections.6 An additional 23 300 deaths were estimated to have occurred in children co-infected with HIV. Disease and mortality rates are higher in developing than in industrialized settings, with most deaths occurring in Africa and Asia.6 The figure 4 depicts the percentage of deaths among children under 5 attributable to pneumonia for each country in 2017.7 Despite steady progress, pneumonia remains one of the single largest killers of young children worldwide. Pneumococcal pneumonia in particular is a major public health concern for children globally. This infection accounts for 18% of all severe pneumonia cases and 33% of all pneumonia deaths worldwide.9 The high concentration of pneumonia deaths among poor and marginalized populations is a key marker of inequity both across and within countries, and much more needs to be done to reach the most vulnerable children.This translates to: 808600 childhood deaths per year2200 childhood deaths per day92 childhood deaths per hour1 childhood death per 39 seconds1 out of 6 childhood deaths were due to pneumonia in 2018 1Figure 3. Infographic showing global burden of pneumonia among under 5 children in 20185National Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 041.4 INDIA SCENARIO As in the global scenario, pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal pneumonia) is responsible for a large portion of pneumonia episodes and deaths in India. It has been estimated, that in year 2010, 3.6 (3.3- 3.9 million) million episodes of severe pneumonia and 0.35 (0.3-0.4 million) million pneumonia deaths (all-cause) occurred in children younger than 5 years in India. The estimated incidence of severe pneumonia was 30.7 (95% CI, 28.1-33.5) per 1000 children per year in those less than 5 years of age, and 87.3 (95% CI, 80.1-95.2) in children aged less than 1 year. Further, it has been estimated that in year 2010, 0.56 million (0.49- 0.64 million) severe pneumococcal pneumonia episodes and 105 thousand (92-119 thousand) pneumococcal pneumonia deaths had occurred in children younger than 5 years of age in India. The annual incidence of severe pneumococcal pneumonia in India was estimated to be 4.8 episodes (95% CI, 4.2-5.5) per 1000 children younger than 5 years. The figure 5 depicts the estimated under-five pneumococcal pneumonia episodes and deaths in India.10 All-cause pneumonia deaths (3.5 lakhs) Deaths due to pneumococcal pneumonia Deaths due to other causes of pneumonia70%30% (1.05 Lakhs)Severe pneumonia episodes (36 lakhs) Pneumococcal pneumonia Other pneumonia causes84%16% (5.6 Lakhs)Figure 4. Percentage of deaths among children under age 5 attributable to pneumonia: 20177 Figure 5. Estimated under-5 Pneumococcal pneumonia episodes & deaths in India, 201010Background and Introduction 05Figure 6 depicts the distribution of severe pneumonia episodes and pneumonia deaths in children younger than 5 years in India. Severe pneumonia frequently requires hospitalization for treatment, leading to emotional and financial burden for caregivers and stress on the public healthcare system. Risk of pneumonia is largely driven by factors associated with malnutrition, poverty, air pollution and other environmental factors (see section 2.5). As mentioned, India contributes to a substantial portion of pneumococcal pneumonia burden across the globe. Number of severe pneumonia episodes in children aged 0-59 monthsNumber of pneumonia deaths in children aged 100000 - 200000 India, the states with the estimated pneumococcal burden are Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh (Figure 6). These four states account for an estimated 71% of all pneumonia deaths and 57% of severe pneumonia cases. The figure 7 depicts the selected Indian states with the highest number of pneumococcal pneumonia deaths in children younger than 5 years in India, 2010. Bubble size indicates the number of pneumococcal pneumonia deaths.10 Bubble size denotes pneumococcal pneumonia deaths in children less than 5 years Figures denote severe pneumonia episodes in children less than Distribution of severe pneumonia episodes and deaths in children younger than 5 years, 2010, India10 Figure 7. States with highest burden of pneumococcal pneumonia deaths in children under five, 2010, India1006As per the 2015 estimates available, severe pneumococcal disease in India manifests primarily as severe pneumonia. There were 1\u00b76 million (UR 1\u00b72-1\u00b78) estimated cases of severe pneumococcal pneumonia in 2015, accounting for more than 97% of all severe pneumococcal disease. Despite substantial reductions in mortality, pneumococcus accounted for 14% (UR 9-17) of all deaths among children aged 1-59 months in India in 2015. In 2015, 68700 (UR 44600-86000) pneumococcal deaths were estimated to have occurred in children aged 1-59 months in India. Of these, an estimated 53300 (UR 37800-55500) deaths were due to pneumococcal pneumonia.11 07Pneumococcal Disease2Chapter 2.1 THE ORGANISM Pneumococcal disease is the name given to a group of diseases caused by a bacterium called Streptococcus pneumoniae (also known as pneumococcus) as shown in the figure 8.12 S. pneumoniae is a Gram-positive, encapsulated diplococcus. The polysaccharide capsule of this bacterium is an essential virulence factor, and pneumococcal serotypes are defined on the basis of differences in its composition.13 Antibody to the capsular polysaccharide protects against disease. In general, immunity from natural infection or vaccination is serotype-specific, but cross-protection among related serotypes can occur. There are >90 known serotypes of S. pneumoniae. The distribution of serotypes that cause disease varies over time and by age, disease syndrome, disease severity, geographical region and the presence of antimicrobial-resistant genes. 2.2 DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISEASES CAUSED BY PNEUMOCOCCUS Pneumococcal infections can lead to serious invasive diseases such as meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia, as well as milder but more common illnesses such as sinusitis and otitis media (figure 9). The causative agent, Streptococcus pneumoniae, frequently colonizes the human nasopharynx and is transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets. Infants and young children are the main reservoir of this organism, in whom the cross-sectional point prevalence of nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage ranges from 27% to 85%. Most illnesses occur sporadically. Outbreaks of pneumococcal disease, although uncommon, may occur in closed institutions, such as in nursing homes and childcare centres. About 75% of invasive pneumococcal disease and 83% of pneumococcal meningitis occur in children aged <2 years, among which many cases occur in neonates and children under 6 months of age. cytoplasmStreptococcus pneumoniae DNA Cell wallCell membraneCapsuleFigure 8. Morphology Figure 9. Diseases by Streptococcus pneumoniaeNational Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 082.3 TRANSMISSION Pneumococcal infection is transmitted by direct contact with respiratory secretions from patients and healthy carriers. Transient nasopharyngeal colonization - not disease - is the normal outcome of exposure to pneumococcus. The figure 10 depicts how pneumococcal disease spreads. Disease is caused either by contiguous spread to the sinuses or the middle ear, aspiration into the lower respiratory tract causing pneumonia, or by invasion of the bloodstream with or without spread to other sites. Most acute respiratory infections result in mild illnesses. In vulnerable children, infections that begin with mild symptoms may sometimes lead to more severe illnesses, such as pneumonia - especially when they coincide with other illnesses like diarrhea or malaria. HIV infection and other conditions associated with immune deficiency greatly increase the likelihood of contracting pneumococcal disease. 2.4 PNEUMOCOCCAL PNEUMONIA Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that causes inflammation and accumulation of fluids in the lungs. It makes breathing difficult and limits oxygen intake. Symptoms include cough, chest in-drawing, difficult and rapid breathing, and wheezing. If infants From sick and healthy people cough! cough! Uninfected Healthy carrier Disease manifestationare severely ill, they may also be unable to feed or drink and may have convulsions, become unconscious and may even die. Figure 10. How pneumococcal disease spreads?Pneumococcal Disease 09The figure 11 depicts spread of pneumococcal pneumonia. 2.5 RISK FACTORS The figure 12 depicts who is most at risk of pneumococcal disease. While most healthy individuals can fight the infection with their natural defenses, the children most at risk of pneumococcal disease are: Children under 5 years of age and especially those under 2 years of age are the most at risk of developing and dying from the disease. Children <5 years, especially those <2 yearsElderly and immunocompromised people Risk Factors Infants Lack of breast feeding MalnutritionExposure to indoor smoke CrowdingHIV infection Sickle cell diseaseRenal diseases (e.g. nephrotic syndrome Previous influenza and other respiratory virus infectionAll ages Children who are immunocompromised (HIV infection, sickle cell disease, renal diseases, e.g., nephrotic syndro me) or have history of previous influenza or other respiratory virus infection. Infants and children who are exposed to additional risk factors: Malnutrition, lack of breastfeeding, exposure to indoor smoke and crowded living conditions. Elderly and immunocompromised people Poor and marginalized populations with poor access to health care.Streptococcus pneumoniae PneumococcusNasal cavity TracheaNasopharynx A bacterial infectionFigure 11.

Who is most at risk of pneumococcal diseasesNational Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 102.6 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Pneumococcal disease can affect multiple organ systems, causing pneumonia, meningitis, bacteraemia/ sepsis, sinusitis, bronchitis and middle ear infection. Pneumococcal pneumonia in particular is a major public health concern for children globally. The presenting features of viral and bacterial pneumonia are similar. However, the symptoms of viral pneumonia may be more than the symptoms of bacterial pneumonia. In children under 5 years of age, who have cough and/or difficulty in breathing, with or without fever, pneumonia is diagnosed by the presence of either fast breathing or lower chest wall in-drawing where the chest moves in or retracts during inhalation (in a healthy person, the chest expands during inhalation). Wheezing is more common in viral infections. Very severely ill infants may be unable to feed or drink and may also have convulsions, become unconscious and may even die. 2.7 SEVERITY OF DISEASE Pneumonia is a severe form of acute lower respiratory tract infection. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing difficult and limits oxygen intake. Severe pneumonia or sinusitis can progress to bacteremia/sepsis or meningitis, which require antibiotic treatment and have high mortality rates (Table 1).2.8 DIAGNOSIS Pneumonia is diagnosed based on clinical evaluation and X-ray imaging when available. The figure 13 depicts clinical signs of pneumonia and X-ray imaging.14,15 It can be difficult to establish whether pneumococcal infection is the cause of the patient's symptoms because even in true pneumococcal cases, the specimens collected often do not yield the bacterium. This is particularly true of pneumococcal pneumonia because specimens from the actual site of infection (i.e., the lung) cannot be collected and in only a small fraction of pneumococcal pneumonia cases is the blood also infected. When laboratory testing is possible, pneumococcal infections may be identified through testing of the blood (for bacteraemia and bacteraemic pneumonias) or in the case of suspected meningitis by performing a lumbar puncture, which involves inserting a needle into the epidural space to obtain a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Left imagine: Wedge-shaped consolidation consistent with bacterial pneumoniaRight imagine: Chest in-drawing due to pneumonia infection Type of pneumococcal disease Signs/Symptoms All types of pneumococcal disease fever, chills Pneumonia fever, chills, cough, dicult and rapid breathing, chest wall in drawing Meningitis fever, headaches, sensitivity to light, neck stiness, convulsions and sometimes confusion or altered consciousness Bacteraemia and sepsis fever, chills, low alertness Otitis and sinusitis fever, pain and discharge from the ears (otitis), tenderness over sinuses and/or persistent discharge from the noseFigure 13. Diagnosis of pneumonia based on clinical evaluation and X-ray imaging14, 15 Table 1. Signs and Symptoms of diseases caused by pneumococcusPneumococcal Disease 11Pneumococcus is a difficult bacterium to grow in the laboratory and frequently goes undiagnosed even when blood or CSF samples are truly infected with the pneumococcus. Testing to determine the pneumococcal serotype is used primarily for research purposes and is not available for patient diagnosis in most clinical settings. 2.9 PREVENTION Preventing pneumococcal diseases, particularly pneumonia, in children is an essential component of a strategy to reduce child mortality. Immunization against Hib, pneumococcus, measles and whooping cough (pertussis) is the most effective way to prevent pneumonia.Adequate nutrition is the key to improving children's natural defenses, starting with exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life. In addition to being effective in preventing pneumonia, it also helps to reduce the length of the illness, if a child does become ill. Addressing environmental factors such as indoor air pollution (by providing affordable clean indoor stoves, for example) and encouraging good hygiene in crowded homes also reduces the number of children who fall ill with pneumonia (Figure 14). In 2009 and 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF published the integrated Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhea (GAPPD), a bold call to action with the goal of achieving a global 75% reduction in incidence of severe pneumonia and diarrhea in children under 5 by 2025. GAPPD outlines a set of core interventions to successfully prevent, protect, and treat children who are at risk of serious illness or death due to these two diseases.16 2.10 TREATMENT Pneumonia is diagnosed clinically based on the signs and symptoms described above. Frontline health workers should be well-trained to identify cases and refer to health facilities for evaluation and treatment. As per treatment protocols, patients with pneumonia will require antibiotics and supportive care. Amoxicillin is the antibiotic of choice. Based on severity of the case, health facilities may refer to higher level care as needed. Facilities should ensure adequate documentation of clinical and laboratory diagnosis of pneumonia in order to support surveillance activities. Vaccination is not intended to be used for treatment of active infection. The figure 14 and 15 depicts prevention measures for pneumonia. Development of pneumococcal resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as penicillin, macrolides, cephalosporins and co-trimoxazole is a serious problem in some parts of the world. Large- scale pneumococcal immunization in many countries has resulted in a reduction in the circulation of drug-resistant strains in countries where it has been introduced.16SIMPLE INTERVENTIONS Prevent, protect and treat children from pneumonia Routine immunizations, including pertussis, measles and HibExclusive breastfeeding for first 6 months Improve indoor air qualityRecognizing danger signs of pneumonia and seek care quicklySafe drinking water, good sanitation, and frequent hand washing with soapGood nutrition, especially for children over 6 months of ageFigure 14. Interventions to Prevent, protect and treat children from pneumoniaNational Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 12Protection, Prevention and Treatment Pneumonia can be prevented by comprehensive approach Vaccination Breastfeeding Adequate NutritionReducing Indoor Air PollutionDiagnosis Pneumococcal Conjugate from Streptococcus pneumoniae , which is the most common cause of severe bacterial pneumonia among children. PCV is already being used in the national immunization program of 146 countries (as of June 2020)Hib Vaccine: Hib vaccines protect children against Haemophillus influenzae type b (Hib), which is another major cause of severe bacterial pneumonia. It is available in more than 193 countries worldwide and is component of pentavalent vaccine, which is available under India's Universal Immunization Program.Figure 15. Interventions to Prevent, protect and treat children from pneumonia13Vaccines Used to Prevent Pneumonia3Chapter Vaccination is a safe, effective and cost-effective tool for saving millions of children's lives by reducing deaths from pneumonia. Vaccinations help reduce childhood pneumonia in two ways: First, vaccinations help prevent children from developing infections that directly cause pneumonia, such as Hib and S. pneumoniae. Second, vaccinations may prevent infections that can lead to pneumonia as a complication, such as influenza, measles and pertussis. This is also called indirect protection. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Pneumococcal pneumonia (Streptococcus pneumoniae) is the most common cause of severe pneumonia among children in the developing world. The fight against pneumonia-related deaths in children relies on prevention, protection and, when infections occur, on better treatment. PCV has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing incidence and severity of pneumonia and other lower respiratory infections in children. Children must receive all recommended doses in the vaccine schedule for maximum protection. Vaccination is not intended to be used for treatment of active infection. Hib-containing pentavalent vaccine Hib is the second leading cause of bacterial pneumonia in children, but it is preventable with the highly effective Hib vaccine. In 2011, the Government of India introduced the Hib-containing pentavalent vaccine in a phased manner. The pentavalent vaccine provides protection against five diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and Hib. India has now successfully scaled up pentavalent vaccine across the country. 3.1 TYPES OF PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINES Pneumococcal vaccines are derived from sugars (polysaccharides) from the capsule of the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. They may or may not be attached to the carrier protein. Based on the presence of carrier protein, two broad categories of pneumococcal vaccines are available in market: Polysaccharide vaccines (with no carrier) and Currently, three vaccines have the potential to significantly reduce childhood mortality from and related to pneumonia: PCV, Hib-containing pentavalent vaccine and measles vaccine. PCV and pentavalent vaccines work directly to reduce the incidence of bacterial pneumonia by preventing Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b. Measles vaccine prevents the systemic viral infection caused by measles. Measles infection can affect multiple organ systems including the lungs and can suppress the immune response transiently, putting infected children at risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia, alongside other infections that can be fatal. The WHO recommends that all routine childhood immunization programs should include these vaccines to protect against above-mentioned diseases. National Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 14Conjugate vaccines (with protein carrier) (Figure 16). Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV): 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PCV): A 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7), which was introduced in 2000, has been phased out In PCV, each polysaccharide is attached, or conjugated to, a carrier protein. The carrier protein is selected to improve the immune response in those vaccinated. In contrast to PCV, PPSV has poor or absent immunogenicity in children under 2 years of age. PCV has been shown to protect very young children starting at 6 weeks of age when infants are most at risk of infection. It protects against severe forms of pneumococcal disease, such as pneumonia, meningitis and bacteraemia. It will not protect against these conditions if they are caused by agents other than pneumococcus. The PCV7 was first introduced in the United States in 2000, followed by many other countries in the subsequent years. As the first licensed conjugate vaccine, PCV7 demonstrated effectiveness against invasive (meningitis, bacteraemia, and bacteraemic pneumonia) and non-invasive (pneumonia and otitis media) pneumococcal disease. However, based on the available evidence, PCV7 was found not to contain all of the important serotypes that are prevalent in developing countries. PCV10 and PCV13 provides increased coverage of the serotypes most commonly found in those areas. PCV13 was introduced in the United States in 2010, and subsequently into the national immunization programs of more than 100 countries. As of June 2020, 146 countries have introduced PCV. The figure 17 depicts PCV introduction worldwide18. In India, in the private sector, PCV7 was introduced in 2006 and was phased out in 2010 when PCV10 and PCV13 were introduced.

Types of pneumococcal vaccinesVaccines Used to Prevent Pneumonia 15 WHO recommends the inclusion of PCVs in childhood immunization programmes worldwide. The most recent WHO position paper on PCV published in February 2019, states that the currently available PCVs are safe and effective, and the increase in the number of serotypes in these vaccines as compared with the first licensed PCV7 represents significant progress in the fight against pneumococcal disease-related morbidity and mortality, particularly for developing countries (Figure 18).3.2 DECISION-MAKING PROCESS FOR PCV INTRODUCTION IN INDIA (FIGURE 19) India has planned for introduction of PCV into its universal immunization program based on global and Indian evidence and recommendations. The Standing Technical Sub-Committee (STSC) of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) deliberated on pertinent issues regarding the inclusion of PCVs in India's UIP.

Characteristics of available PCV products under UIPNational Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 16establishment of a Working Group for collating additional India-specific evidence. The Working Group conducted critical appraisal of evidence on burden of disease, serotype prevalence, prevalence of antibiotic resistance and surveillance of pneumococcal disease in India and submitted its recommendations to the STSC. The recommendations of the Working Group and STSC were discussed in the NTAGI meeting. Based on disease burden, safety and efficacy, cost-effectiveness, sustainability and global evidence, NTAGI recommended a phased introduction of PCV in India's UIP. A dosing schedule of 2 primary doses at 6 weeks and 14 weeks, followed by a booster dose at 9 months is recommended. This dosing schedule also aligns with the UIP schedule. In the first phase, the vaccine should be introduced in at least some high priority areas (high under-five mortality areas) with quality controlled surveillance systems to conduct impact assessment of the vaccines. The recommendations of the NTAGI were approved by the Empowered Programme Committee of the NHM, and subsequently by the Mission Steering Group. The Government of India has constituted a National Pneumococcal Vaccine Expert Committee to guide the introduction of pneumococcal vaccine in the country. Currently, there are three pneumococcal conjugate vaccines that are licensed and available in the private sector in India.Figure 18.

Decision-making process for Pneumococcal ConjugateVaccines Used to Prevent Pneumonia 17The National Technical Advisory Group for Immunization (NTAGI) in 2015, based on the available documents regarding product specifications, projected availability, and operational feasibility including multi-dose presentation and compliance with open vial policy, recommended PCV13 (4-dose vial) as the preferred vaccine type for introduction in the UIP. The PCV13 4-dose vial is WHO prequalified. In case of shortage of supply of PCV13, the NTAGI recommended that other vaccine types may also be considered.19 3.3 VACCINE EFFICACY & SAFETY Based on efficacy data, PCV10 and PCV13 would provide good protection for pneumococcal disease in India. Based on the immunogenicity data, PCV10 and PCV13 show comparable vaccine efficacies for serotypes contained in the vaccines. PCVs are considered safe in all target groups for vaccination, including immunocompromised individuals. Protection by PCV vaccination (seroconversion) does not change when the vaccine is given along with other childhood vaccines. PCV can be administered to prematurely born infants (i.e., <37 weeks gestation) at the recommended chronologic age concurrent with other routine vaccinations, unless there are contraindications. Several studies have assessed pneumococcal disease serotype distribution in India. In a Vellore study among children under five, the most common serotypes causing invasive infections were 14, 19F, 5, 6A and 6B.19 Both PCV10 and PCV13 would be expected to provide coverage for these serotypes. 3.4 ROUTE AND SITE OF ADMINISTRATION The dose of the vaccine is 0.5 ml and to be administered by intramuscular injection in the anterolateral aspect of the right mid thigh of infants. If multiple injections must be given in the same thigh, the distance between the two injections should be at least 2.5 cm (1 inch) (Figure 20). 3.5 VACCINATION SCHEDULE FOR PCV VACCINE PCV will be administered in three doses (2 primary and 1 booster) at 6 weeks, 14 weeks and 9 months of age as part of routine immunization. The first dose, PCV1, will be administered at 6 weeks of age with the first dose of pentavalent vaccine, oral polio vaccine (OPV), fractional-dose IPV1 and rotavirus vaccine. Please refer to the scenarios depicted in figures 21. The second dose, PCV2, will be given at 14 weeks of age, with the third dose of pentavalent vaccine, oral polio vaccine, fractional-dose IPV2 and rotavirus vaccine. Please refer to the scenarios depicted in figures 21. The steps below detail how to hold a child (infant) for intramuscular injection in anterolateral aspect of right mid thigh. Hold the child on their lap. Place the child's arms under one of their own arms and around their back and apply gentle pressure for a secure, hug-like hold. Use their free arm and hand to hold the child's other arm gently but securely. Anchor the child's feet firmly between their thighs.Figure 20. Holding the child for VaccinationNational Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 18 The PCV booster dose will be administered at 9 months of age with the first dose of measles-rubella (MR) vaccine and first dose of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccine (in endemic districts). The two primary doses and one booster dose of PCV should be given during the first year of life. If the doses are delayed within the first year of life, delayed doses must be separated by a minimum interval of at least 8 week s, to be given at the next scheduled immunization visit.In delayed cases beyond 1 year of age, due doses can be given to a child only if a child has received at least one dose of PCV before his/her first birthday. 3.6 COMPARISON OF IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE BEFORE AND AFTER PCV INTRODUCTION The table 3 describes the current immunization schedule (i.e., prior to PCV introduction) and immunization schedule after the introduction of in endemic districts Right Side Left Side2 Measles/MRVita A 4 3 PCV-BJE16 Weeks 14 Weeks 9 Months Right Side Left Side3 fIPV-2 5 Penta-3 4 PCV-21 2 Right 4fIPV 3 5Vita A MR JE PCV-B 1 3 2 4 Figure 21.

It should be stored at temper atures ranging between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C in the basket of an ice-lined refrigerator (ILR). zDo not freeze PCV. zIt is important to use conditioned ice packs to prevent freezing during transpo rtation. zThe Shake Test is applicable to PCV vaccine. Discard the vial/s if there is any doubt of vaccine having been frozen. Age group for vaccinationPCV in the UIP is recommended for infants (up to 1 year of age) in three doses (2 primary doses and 1 booster dose) at 6 weeks, 14 weeks and 9 months. Dosage and route z0.5 ml using auto-disable (AD) syringe available in program. zIntramuscular injection in the anterolateral aspect of the right mid thigh. Recommendations for immunodeficient children zRegardless of the presence of underlying medical conditions (e.g., children with HIV infection, sickle cell disease or who are otherwise immunocompromised), th e national schedule for giving PCV should be followed. zIn fact these children are in particular need of PCV because their risk of pne umococcal disease is high. PCV has been proven to be safe and well-tolerated even among children infected with HIV. Children with HIV infection require a booster dose to sustain protection. Immunogenicity, ecacy and effectiveness zPCV vaccines are safe and being used in 146 countries. zPCV ecacy is more than 80% for serotypes present in the vaccine. zPCV10 and PCV13 show comparable vaccine ecacies for serotypes containe d in the vaccines. zPCV10 and PCV13 have adequate ecacy to protect against the majority strain s of pneumococcal disease in India. zPCVs are considered safe in all target groups for vaccination, including immunocompromised individuals. zPCV can be administered to prematurely born infants (i.e., <37 weeks gestation) at the recommended chronologic age concurrent with other routine vaccination s, unless there are contraindications. zPCV is not intended to be used for treatment of active infection. Co-administration with other vaccines zPCV can be co-administered with other UIP vaccines. zThe vaccine cannot be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe. zIf two injections are being given in same limb, then they should be administered at le ast 1 inch apart. Contraindications zPCV is a safe vaccine. Severe reactions are extremely rare. zPCV should not be administered to children with severe allergic reaction to a prior dose, or to vaccines containing diphtheria toxoid, such as pentavalent vaccin e. zPCV should not be given to a child with severe illness. However, PCV may be given in children with mild respiratory illness with or without low-grade fever. zMost common PCV side eects: Irritability, crying, swelling and tenderness at injection site, transient fever >39\u00b0C (102\u00b0F). Vaccine cost zPCV is an expensive vaccine in the private sector zUnder the UIP of Governemnt of India, PCV will be given free of co st to all eligible infants in the fixed and outreach session sitesTable 4. Key operational aspects of PCV under UIP3.7 KEY OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF PCV UNDER UIP (REFER TABLE 4 BELOW)Vaccines Used to Prevent Pneumonia 213.8 OPEN VIAL POLICY The Open Vial Policy guidelines, when followed correctly, ensures effective utilization of vaccines and minimizes wastage. Open vial policy is applicable to PCV 4/more dose vial. The permissible wastage for PCV is less than 10%. The states need to have a robust alternate vaccine delivery mechanism to ensure effective implementation of the open vial policy. Vaccine vials opened in a fixed or outreach session can be used at more than one immunization session for up to 4 weeks, as per the open vial policy of Govt. of India, provided |the expiry date has not been reached. |the vaccine vial monitor (VVM) has not reached the discard point; |vaccines are stored in appropriate cold chain conditions, both during transportation and in the cold chain storage point; |aseptic technique has been used to withdraw vaccine doses. (That is needle/septum has not been contaminated in anyway); and |vaccine septum has not been submerged in water or contaminated in any way. 3.9 CHALLENGES The introduction of a new vaccine into any routine immunization schedule poses challenges at various levels. In India, the health system provides a strong infrastructure for delivering these services to all parts of the country. Recent introduction of Hib-containing pentavalent, rotavirus and IPV vaccines have provided valuable experience and lessons to steer introduction of other vaccines. As part of introduction, the main challenge will be at the level of the health worker to administer the three required PCV doses (2 primary doses and 1 booster dose) at 6 weeks, 14 weeks and 9 months of age along with other routine vaccines at the same age. Efforts to ensure high coverage of PCV or any routine immunization should translate to improve coverage of the vaccines given concomitantly at the same visits. Program officers must supervise closely to ensure that all scheduled vaccines are given concomitantly such that coverage of all vaccines scheduled together remains high. For example, at 6 weeks of age it should be assured that high coverage rates of pentavalent1, OPV1, rotavirus1, fractional-dose IPV1, and PCV1 coverage rates are achieved and consistent across vaccines. Similarly, coverage rates should be tracked for all scheduled vaccines at PCV2 and PCV booster dose time points, respectively. Reporting and recording practices for PCV (mother- child protection [MCP] card, vaccine registers, due lists, tally sheets, reporting coverage portals such as health management information system [HMIS] and mother- child tracking system [MCTS] /Reproductive & Child Health [RCH] need to be updated) will require attention at all levels. Strong monitoring and supervision are required to identify gaps and to ensure accountability and take necessary corrective actions where needed. Trainings for frontline health workers will be crucial for smooth introduction of PCV, particularly in terms of community mobilization and vaccine acceptance. These interventions will contribute to strengthening the routine immunization system overall and for increased PCV coverage.23Preparedness for PCV Introduction4Chapter The introduction of PCV vaccine should be viewed as an opportunity to strengthen the overall routine immunization service delivery in the states and districts. Introduction of any new vaccine in the program requires meticulous planning at all levels. This initially involves top-down microplanning at the national and state levels, followed by bottom- up microplanning and detailing precise logistic and financial needs for each district and sub-district, starting from the more peripheral levels and moving towards the higher levels, adjusting macro-plans on state and national levels (Figure 22).requirements. The PCV introduction operational guidelines have been standardized for uniform understanding at all levels. 4.1 STATE AND DISTRICT PREPAREDNESS ASSESSMENT The MoHFW, Government of India, has developed and disseminated state- and district-level preparedness assessment checklists to support the state and district program managers in assessing critical information prior to introduction of any new vaccine (Figure 23). These checklists helped in assessing and identifying strengths and weaknesses at state, district and block levels to take corrective actions for effective and successful introduction of new vaccines such as Hib- containing pentavalent vaccine, IPV and rotavirus vaccine in the UIP. WHO, UNICEF, JSI and other immunization partners will continue to support MoHFW in reviewing the preparedness based on information provided by states in the checklist. The district checklists duly completed and signed by district authorities should be forwarded to the state. All districts are to submit their filled checklists to states within 15 days of receipt of the checklist. The states then review checklists received from districts and complete the state checklist within 2 weeks of receipt. These checklists are first State District Taluk / CHC Primary Health Centre / Primary Urban Health Centre Sub Centre / Urban health post Timely trainings/orientation/media briefing and information sharing with community helps in smooth launch at the level of health care service providers, mobilizers and community settings. The PCV introduction plan encompasses all components, including a program assessment at all levels to determine what is required for the introduction. The introduction plan takes into account the timelines for successful completion including vaccine supply and estimated procurement Figure 22. Bottom up approach for RI microplanning Figure 23. State and district preparedness checklist for PCV introductionNational Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 24analyzed by state immunization officers (SIOs) with support from partners to identify gaps and level of preparedness through state- and district-level scoring systems before sharing it with the ministry. The state checklists duly completed and signed by state authorities should be forwarded to the national level (MoHFW). These checklists can also be filled in an online tool. National observers will review the preparedness, vaccine requirements and cold chain capacities at state and district levels during their field visits.The key issues identified in checklists are discussed and sorted through task force mechanisms. PCV introduction should happen only when district preparedness is found satisfactory along with completion of trainings and other important activities. PCV vaccine will only be introduced in districts/blocks that have completed trainings. These checklists will also help the districts to assess availability of resources, especially cold chain space.

Components of preparedness assessemnt checklists for PCV introduction 25Trainings5Chapter The successful introduction of PCV vaccine will largely depend upon trainings conducted for all levels of health functionaries. Health-care providers are not only responsible for handling and administering the vaccine, but are also an important source of information for parents as well as community. Strengthening capacity of health workers on interpersonal communication skills (IPC) is important to ensure effective delivery of PCV in routine immunization, particularly in terms of community mobilization and vaccine acceptance. Trainings shall particularly focus on building capacity of vaccinators to alleviate any anxiety of vaccinators and community occurring due to multiple injections at the same visit. A systematic review found that parental acceptance of multiple injections during single visit was associated with a positive provider recommendation to the caregiver (Source: SAGE April 2015). A good training gives confidence to health workers to introduce new vaccines (Figure 24).Health-care personnel who require training on introduction of PCV include district immunization officers (DIOs), urban nodal officers (NHM-Urban), medical officers (MOs), cold chain handlers, data managers, supervisors, ANMs and frontline health workers. The officials and staff of the Department of Women and Child Development such as child development project officers (CDPOs), integrated child development services (ICDS) supervisors and anganwadi workers also need to be trained at the same time. In addition, plans should be drawn up to orient the faculty of pediatrics and preventive and social medicine departments in medical colleges as well as professional bodies (IAP, IMA) involved in immunization service delivery. All sessions must be interactive. Methodology should include PowerPoint presentations, role plays, exercises and interactive discussions. Each batch should not have more than 40 participants. More than one batch may have to be planned in large states/districts. Trainers should be patient listeners to any feedback from trainees. It is important to conduct intensive discussions on scenarios customized as per field experience from previously introduced new vaccines during trainings to sensitize health workers on issues anticipated in the field situations. REMEMBER PCV introduction training should be conducted as per guidelines. Standardized training package to be used during the trainings. All trainings will have some common and cadre-specific messages. Key tips/messages for participants have been incorporated into respective agendas. Pneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide, accounted for about 8 lakh deaths in 2018.

Key take home messages for PCV trainingsNational Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 265.1 TRAINING APPROACH FOR PCV INTRODUCTION Training is a critical activity and needs timely planning and implementation. Cascaded trainings are envisaged for building capacity of all cadres of staff involved in routine immunization. Training activities will be conducted beginning at least 1-2 months before PCV introduction and will commence at the national/state/ district level and to be cascaded up to sub-district level trainings of health workers and frontline health workers. Each district will prepare block/ planning unit wise training calendar and share it with state. SIO will track district-wise progress on trainings. DIO will ensure quality, participation and timely completion of district and all sub-district block/planning unit level trainings in the district. PCV will only be introduced once all trainings are completed in the district/block/ planning unit. Timely trainings/orientation of health care service providers, mobilizers and media as well as information sharing with community will help in smooth introduction of PCV. In order to train health workers, a pool of master trainers will be created through training-of-trainers (ToT) at national/state/district levels. Trainings will adhere to relevant guidelines and training material developed for each level. A comprehensive training plan developed for PCV introduction is attached as annexure 2.State workshop (ToT) for PCV introduction Training activities will commence at the state level with a one-and-a half day orientation of SIO, state cold chain officer, data manager, and other state trainers and partners on PCV introduction. Subsequently, these trained officers will conduct trainings in their respective districts, beginning with state-level training for district followed by block-level trainings. Ensure that at all levels key officials/program managers involved in urban health participate in trainings. The table 6 below depicts the state training plan for PCV introduction. State media workshop for PCV introduction The purpose of this workshop is to sensitize IEC officials and media. The table 7 depicts the state plan for media workshop on PCV introduction.

The table 8 depicts the district training plan for PCV introduction. Sub-district/block/planning unit training of frontline health workers These block level trainers will, in-turn, be responsible for training health workers, including ANMs, supervisors and cold chain handlers. ANMs/ASHAs/ AWWs/link workers will be trained at block PHC/ additional PHC (Table 9). Block-level trainings should be planned in such a way that there are not more than 40 participants per batch. If required, more than one batch can be planned accordingly. The training should be planned in such a way that each ANM attends the training along with ASHA and anganwadi workers posted in her sub-centre area. This also means that for every ANM (sub-centre) there will be approximately 4-5 ASHAs/ anganwadi workers each who will be attending these block/ sub-block level trainings (preferably at block level).

The table 9 depicts the block training plan for PCV introduction. The frontline health worker is the keystone of community engagement. It is important to ensure that ANMs, AWWs, ASHAs and community volunteers are well trained before the PCV launch. Health workers, if properly trained and informed, can motivate and generate community interest in the UIP and the new vaccine. They are the main source of information for the general public. It is, therefore, critical to ensure that all ASHAs, AWWs and link workers are trained on key aspects of PCV, including the four key messages. If there are any pertinent issues in undertaking all these batches at the block level, the district may plan to do these trainings at sub-block level such as the PHC/planning unit. In all scenarios, ensure at least all ANMs are trained at block level. It has bee n observed that when ANMs are given the responsibility of training mobilizers, the quality of trainings may be compromised. In case the trainings of mobilizers are planned at sub- block level, the training calendar/plan should clearly reflect the nodal officer responsible for planning, implementation and monitoring of trainings. All efforts should be made to undertake and monitor mobilizers' trainings. Partner agencies supporting mobilization activities will actively support other block-level trainers such as medical officers, AROs, block program managers (NHM) in imparting training to frontline health workers. Every opportunity should be utilized for sensitization of PCV introduction. For example, state/district task force meetings and medical officers' trainings are Training of health workers is the key to vaccine acceptance and community mobilization Trainings 29 REMEMBER States are encouraged to conduct regular PCV preparedness and implementation review at district and block level. We are aware that the time interval as per the recom- mended immunization schedule between rst and second doses of PCV is 8 weeks and between the second and booster doses of PCV is almost 5.5 months. A reorienta- tion of health workers between PCV rst and second doses, and then between PCV second and booster doses will be helpful in timely updating due list and mobilizing beneciaries. The DIO/block medical ocer may include the following points as part of PCV review agenda at all levels: Reporting & recording issues in PCV administrative coverage, with a focus on left-out/drop-out between rst and second doses of PCV/second dose and booster doses of PCV Vaccine & cold chain logistics. including high vaccine wastage (if any) Key lessons learned Communication & mobilization issues AEFI reporting Monitoring dataideal to discuss PCV introduction topics. The state, district and sub-district program managers should remember that trainings should exclusively be held as per the recommended timelines. Training materials have been developed based on the past experiences of new vaccine introduction, post introduction evaluations as well as preparedness assessments conducted before the introduction of PCV. These include standardized power-point presentations from operational guidelines for ToTs and handouts/information kits that include FAQs on PCV for health workers and mobilizers. These materials (FAQs) will be translated by state in the local language for appropriate use at health worker level. The FAQs on PCV vaccination should be widely used for dissemination of information, especially to medical officers, frontline health workers and mobilizers.31Vaccine and Cold Chain Management6Chapter An effective vaccine, logistics and cold chain system is an essential prerequisite for successful implementation of the immunization program. It is critical for immunization services to ensure the availability of appropriate equipment and an adequate supply of high-quality vaccines and immunization-related materials to all levels of the program. The key areas of logistics support include vaccine management and monitoring, cold chain management and immunization safety. Target population X Number of doses X Wastage factor = Total doses required Vaccine stores at all levels (state, regional, district, primary health centers (PHCs), community health centers, other cold chain storage points) need to forecast their vaccine needs for the stipulated time period to ensure that the right amount of vaccines, logistics and cold chain equipment are available to vaccinate all eligible infants at a given time in a given area. Each of these levels should monitor the stock of vaccine and syringes in order to assess the lead-time and re-ordering levels. If vaccine, logistics and cold chain programs are well managed, it not only ensures that none of the eligible children are missed due to vaccine shortage, but also helps in saving on program costs in ensuring program implementation efficiently without sacrificing the quality of service delivery. Poorly managed logistics systems can lead to high and/or unnecessary vaccine wastage rates, stock- outs, or improper management of waste, resulting in significant operational program costs, as well as a negative impact on public health. 6.1 VACCINE MANAGEMENT In general, PCV vaccine introduction should follow the standard procedures for calculating vaccine supply of other vaccines and be integrated into existing mechanisms for procurement. PCV vaccine should also be integrated into the stock-management system and vaccine orders must be timed such that the supply is not disrupted. The number of doses required is based on the size of the target population and vaccine wastage. The Simple formula at Table 10 can assist. Wastage rate = doses supplied - doses administered x 100 doses supplied Vaccine BCG MR, Rota and JE PCV, IPV, OPV, Pentavalent, Hepatitis acceptable wastage 50% and the w astage multiplication factor for calculation is 2.0. 25% and the wastage multiplication factor for calculation is 1.33. 10% for all vaccines eligible for reuse under the open vial policy. The wastage multiplication factor for calculation is 1.11.Table 10. Permissible wastages for vaccines under UIPNational Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 326.2 WASTAGE RATE AND BUFFER STOCK PCV introduction recommends indicative wastage values of less than 10%. The buffer stock recommended is 25% for the first year of vaccine introduction. All efforts should be made to minimize vaccine wastage at all levels. The open vial policy is applicable to PCV. The buffer stock is meant for managing sudden and unexpected shortages. The amount of buffer stock recommended is generally 25% of the annual requirement. Buffer stock is supplied only in the first year of vaccine introduction. 6.3 ESTIMATING VACCINE AND SYRINGES NEEDED The AD syringes (0.5 ml) available under the UIP are to be used to administer PCV. Number of AD syringes supplied is equal to the number of vaccine doses supplied. This means wastage rate calculated for vaccines by default gets calculated for the AD syringes. A child requires 3 doses and vial contains 4/ more doses per vial; hence wastage rate is negligible. PCV is a liquid vaccine, hence, no requirement of reconstitution syringe. 6.4 COLD CHAIN SPACE AND INVENTORY The cold chain infrastructure in India is a wide network of cold chain stores consisting of government medical store depots, state, regional/ divisional vaccine stores, and district and PHC/CHC. The cold chain network in the country has been the backbone to ensure that correct quantity and quality of vaccine reaches the target population. The figure 25 depicts the cold chain system in India. With the nation-wide roll out of pentavalent vaccine, there has been a significant increase in the cold chain space availability due to the reduced requirement of DPT and hepatitis B vaccines. However, districts and states must review the cold chain space available at different levels to ensure that adequate space is available to accommodate the PCV vaccine. Cold chain monitoring through National Cold Chain Management Information System (NCCMIS) is operational across all states/union territories. The cold chain inventory should be regularly reviewed and status of the same should be updated in the NCCMIS. India recently conducted a national EVM assessment and also developed electronic vaccine Vaccine Manufacturer Child & Mother Sub-Centre Session StiesVaccine Centre (+2o to 8oC)Insulated Vaccines Van to 8oC) Figure 25. Cold chain network in IndiaVaccine and Cold Chain Management 33 REMEMBER To avoid freezing of vaccine ensure cold chain point are visited and evaluated once before the start of the vaccination drive. Vaccine and cold chain ocials posted at all levels are expected to undertake field visits regarding cold chain preparedness. intelligence network (eVIN), an online system for assessing cold chain equipment functionality and vaccine storage status (Annexure 3). 6.5 COLD CHAIN MONITORING PCV is a heat and freeze sensitive vaccine and loses its potency when exposed to temperatures outside the range recommended by the manufacturer. Its capacity to produce neutralizing antibodies is destroyed by both heat and freezing. The heat impact on vaccines is cumulative. Proper storage of vaccines and maintenance of the cold chain during storage and distribution are essential to prevent the loss of potency. Once a vaccine loses its potency, this cannot be regained. Damaged vaccines should be discarded according to the guidelines. All PCV vaccine vials have a vaccine vial monitor (VVM-30). The VVM registers cumulative heat exposure, and changes from light to dark. Before use, check the VVM on each vaccine vial. If inside square is the same color, or darker than the outer circle, do not use the vaccine (Figure 26).6.6 STORAGE AND HANDLING OF PCV VACCINE PCV vaccine management should follow the same procedures as for other vaccines in the cold chain. Upon receipt and confirmation of quantity and quality delivered, the vaccines should be placed in the designated ILR. All PCV vaccines should be stored between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C. PCV vaccines SHOULD NOT BE FROZEN as they are exceptionally sensitive to temperatures lower Figure 26. Stages of VVM Reading the stages of the VVM The inner square is lighter than the outer circle.

Any frozen vaccine should not be used and to be discarded as per policy guidelines. If there is suspicion that a vaccine has been frozen, a shake test should be done. PCV vaccines cannot be placed directly on or near the freezer portion of refrigerators, and should not be stored near the liners or walls of cold boxes and or ice-packs in vaccine carriers. Refer to section 6.7 for proper procedures on conditioning ice-packs and use of ice packs in vaccine carrier. To ensure efficacy of the vaccines, proper storage and packing are essential. The following are recommended for vaccine storage: In ILR, store PCV and other freeze- sensitive vaccines near the top of the basket. PCV should be placed adjacent to pentavalent vaccine. Refer to figure 27. PCV could be damaged if placed in direct contact with frozen ice packs that were inadequately conditioned; therefore, water ice packs should be conditioned before use. Use a packing table, and remove ice packs from freezer and place on table to defrost. Packs are ready to use when there are physical signs of thawing; no ice and drops of water on surface, and liquid is observed inside. Dry the packs and line the walls of the insulated vaccine carrier with them. Place the vaccines inside and ensure that the container is properly closed. Allowing ice packs to thaw means that the initial freezing temperature is lost, so the temperature in the insulated carrier does not drop below 0\u00b0C. Properly conditioned ice packs constitute the best method to maintain the temperature of the insulated carriers and cold boxes. There should be sufficient ice packs to ensure that the vaccines are totally surrounded during transportation. 6.8 PCV VACCINE HANDLING For use of PCV, it is to be ensured that health workers are trained on appropriate handling of PCV vaccine, as per the revised open vial policy guidelines REMEMBER PCV is stored at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C in ILR along with other UIP vaccines at all levels. PCV should be transported with conditioned ice packs with other vaccines. Open vial policy is applicable to PCV. Figure 27. Storage of UIP vaccines in ILR 6.7 CONDITIONING OF ICE PACKS In order to ensure correct storage of vaccines, the following procedures should be followed (Figure 28): Ensure that the insulated vaccine carriers are clean before use and at end of the day.Vaccine and Cold Chain Management 35 When ice packs are removed from the freezer, they may be at very low temperature between -15 oC to -20 oCPlace ice packs on the table and wait until the frost on the surface of ice packs melts Clean and dry the ice packs before placing them in vaccine carrier Place the ice packs first and then the vaccineTo see if ice packs are conditioned observe for sweating (water drops) on ice packs shake the ice packs to hear the water move inside by MoHFW. Each vial contains a VVM to indicate cumulative exposure to heat. Any vaccine vial beyond the discard point of VVM should not be used and to be discarded. The vaccine should be stored between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C. Remember PCV is a freeze sensitive vaccine and shake test is applicable. 6.9 PCV STOCK MANAGEMENT (INVENTORY CONTROL) The inventory system should ensure that units with the nearest expiry date are used first in a system known as EEFO (Early Expiry, First-Out). Expiry date should always be checked whenever a vial is opened. Never use vaccines after the expiry date (Figure 29). If you find frozen vaccine vial, do not use it and record it in the vaccine stock and distribution register.Figure 28. Conditioning of Ice packs REMEMBER PCV is a freeze-sensitive vaccine.

Key operational aspects of PCV 37Safe Injection Practices and Management Of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)7Chapter 7.1 QUALITY OF VACCINATION - SAFE INJECTION PRACTICES Safe injection is defined as the one which causes no harm to the recipient to the provider to the community Some steps to ensure injection safety are as follows: As in routine service, all vaccinators will use only AD syringes for PCV vaccination. These syringes prevent person-to-person transmission of blood- borne pathogens (Figure 30). Use a new sterile packed AD syringe for each injection for each child. Use the same syringe to draw and administer the vaccine. Do not touch the needle at any stage. Do not touch or contaminate the septum of the vial. Do not pre-fill syringes. Do not attempt to recap the needle. This practice can lead to needle stick injuries. Immediately after injecting the child, the AD syringe must be cut from the hub (plastic part at base of needle) using the hub cutter, and put the cut part of the syringe in the red bag. DO NOT PUT the syringes on the table or in a tray after the injection. Do not use AD syringes that have damaged packaging, or have passed the manufacturer expiry date. Wash your hands with soap before and after the vaccination session. Figure 30. Using AD syringes for vaccination National Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 387.2 SAFE DISPOSAL OF WASTE The immunization waste generated during vaccination must be disposed of as per current CPCB guidelines of biomedical waste disposal. Cut the hub of the AD syringe immediately after administering the injection using the hub cutter. The cut needles will get collected in the puncture proof translucent container of the hub cutter. Segregate and store the plastic portion of the cut syringes, plastic ampoules, used gloves in the red bag. Expired or discarded vaccines, broken vials, empty unbroken vials, glass ampoules will go into Blue bag. All other non-infectious wastes will go into black bag. 7.3 MANAGEMENT OF AEFIs DURING PCV VACCINATION An AEFI is any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization and which does not necessarily has a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine. The adverse event may be any unfavorable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease. The experience of earlier vaccine introductions such as pentavalent vaccine have shown an increase in reporting of serious AEFI cases (deaths and hospitalizations) immediately after vaccine introduction due to increased sensitivity to safety as a result of training of health workers and awareness in the community and media as well as improved surveillance. Occurrence of an adverse event after immunization and its reporting does not necessarily imply that the vaccine is the cause of the adverse event. Ensure that before introduction of a new vaccine such as PCV, the AEFI surveillance system in the district/state has been strengthened and AEFIs are being reported for all vaccines. It is important that all AEFIs thought by parents/ community to be due to a vaccine/vaccination are reported and investigated completely. Parents/community must be kept informed about the results of the investigations. This will help maintain confidence in vaccines and the immunization program. 7.3.1 AEFI DURING PCV VACCINATION PCV vaccines have an excellent track record for safety and efficacy, whether used alone or when co-administered with other vaccines. But a small percentage of children may experience some adverse effects from PCV. The vaccine may be associated with injection site reactions (redness, swelling, tenderness) in 10% of vaccine recipients. Generalized reactions such as fever occur in <1% of vaccine recipients. Rarely, as with other drugs and vaccines, allergic reactions and anaphylaxis may occur with PCV. In such cases, the vaccine recipient should be rushed to nearest health facility (AEFI management centre) and subsequent doses should not be given. During PCV vaccination, AEFIs must be quickly detected and promptly responded to. Lack of response can undermine confidence in the vaccine and immunization program. This will ultimately have a negative impact on immunization program and the program objectives will not be achieved. Safe Injection Practices and Management Of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) 39Frontline health workers/link workers (AWW/ ASHA/community volunteer)/ANM should immediately inform the MO of the AEFI and arrange for transportation to the nearest AEFI Management Center or health facility. After an AEFI takes place, arrange to provide immediate and appropriate treatment to the child experiencing the event, and report and investigate the case. All efforts should be made to manage the adverse event (if any) followed by investigation of AEFIs as per guidelines. Reporting of AEFIs related to PCV should be conducted as per the Government of India's revised AEFI Surveillance and Response Operational Guidelines, 2015. Medical officers in charge of immunization at PHCs/CHCs/SDHs/District hospitals will be responsible for managing and reporting AEFIs. Ensure that all other MOs in the PHCs/CHCs/ SDHs /District Hospitals are trained and sensitized on immediate reporting of serious/severe AEFIs. The AEFI management centers at select PHCs/ CHCs /SDHs should be monitored, steps taken to ensure the staff are trained, and infrastructure and medical supplies must be in adequate supply (refer to Immunization Handbook for Medical Officers, MoHFW, GOI, Reprint edition 2017). If the case cannot be managed locally, arrange to refer the case to a higher treatment center. It should be ensured that the AEFI management kit has all the required drugs, etc. (refer to AEFI kit contents). 7.3.2 AEFI SURVEILLANCE DURING PCV VACCINATION Standard operating procedures have been laid out by the Government of India for responding to AEFI (AEFI Surveillance and Response Operational Guidelines 2015). As for other vaccines, these guidelines also apply to PCV vaccine. AEFI detection and management should be done according to the following plan: All ANMs/ASHAs/AWWs and MOs (in addition to MO in-charges) in PHCs/CHCs/SDHs/District hospitals, medical colleges and private practitioners must be sensitized to recognize, manage and report AEFIs promptly. They must know what to do in the event of an AEFI and the location of the nearest AEFI management center. All serious and severe AEFIs are to be reported using the Case Reporting Form (CRF) immediately (within 24 hours) to the District Immunization Officer. The form will be provided in the kits for AEFI management. Minor, serious and severe AEFIs will also be notified by the ANM/Health worker in the AEFI register maintained at the PHC/CHC every week. Serious and severe AEFIs will be reported in the weekly nil reporting VPD H-002 and district D-001 Figure 31. Minor, serious and severe AEFIs should be appropriately reported in HMIS (abscesses, deaths and all others). Serious AEFI Severe Monthly HMIS Reporting of AEFINational Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 40 The DIO will investigate all reported serious/severe AEFIs in Preliminary and Final Case Investigation Forms (PCIFs and FCIFs). The timelines for case investigations should be strictly adhered to (Figure 32). During the quarterly meeting of the district AEFI committee before the introduction of the PCV, the Immunization Division, MOHFW AEFI SecretariatThe DIO sends CRF within 48 HOURS OF NOTIFICATION and PCIF within 10 DAYS OF NOTIFICATION. The FCIF is submitted within 70 DAYS OF NOTIFICATION. Report AEFI within 24 HOURS OF NOTIFICATION through CRF to DIO.National AEFI Committee State AEFI Committee District AEFI CommitteeState Immunization District Immunization Oce Health facilities and outreach sessionsPrivate practitionermembers must be informed and prepared to be involved in investigating AEFIs, if necessary. They can also contribute to managing the media as needed. The following figure depicts timelines for reporting and investigation of serious and severe AEFI (Figure 32). Figure 32.

There should be clear communication about the safety and common side effects of the vaccine, together with endorsement from trusted leaders. Communication helps build trust with the public. This includes providing information on possible side effects in the information, education and communications (IEC) materials and when communicating with parents and the community. Awareness among health workers and the public of possible adverse events will also reduce fear and misunderstanding and facilitate early recognition and management of AEFIs. It is very important to engage the media (through journalist briefings, information packages, etc. prior to PCV vaccination, because if they are not well informed about the facts media can often amplify any rumors, leading to a larger crisis (for details, refer to Chapter 9: Communication Strategy & Social Mobilization for PCV Introduction). Each state will prepare a crisis communications plan to allow for a rapid effective response to AEFIs, and any allegation that may have a negative effect on public acceptance of PCV or trust in the immunization program.7.3.3 CONTENTS OF AN AEFI KITNational Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 42 IMPORTANT AEFI MESSAGES Serious and severe AEFIs should be immediately reported to the appropria te authority. The MO and health worker at the vaccination site will provide primary mana gement of AEFIs. If needed, they will refer serious and severe AEFI to the nearest higher AEFI management center. Transportation for referring patients, if needed, shall be provided by MO I/C. Benefit of immunization in preventing disease is well proven. It is very risky not to immunize vis-a-vis risk of disease and complications . Before the introduction of vaccines, vaccine- preventable diseases caused millions of deaths and/or disability. That situation would return without continued use of vac cines. Vaccines do cause some reactions, but these are rarely serious and hardl y ever cause long-term problems. Well-established immunization safety surveillance is in place. Immunization s afety is very important, and even the slightest suspicion of a problem is investigated.43Reporting and Recording of PCV in Routine Immunization8Chapter All recording and reporting formats should be revised well in time to include PCV before the introduction of vaccine. All the revised formats should be distributed before introduction and ensure that during health workers' training, an exercise for filling the MCP card should be conducted. Inclusion of PCV will be required in vaccine stock and distribution registers, immunization cards, due lists, tally sheets, monthly progress reports at all levels, maternal and child health (MCH)/immunization register, coverage monitoring charts, supervisory checklists, computer databases, immunization coverage surveys and evaluation formats, as well as AEFI reporting formats. HMIS and MCTS/RCH portals are being modified to record the coverage of PCV. Till then, reporting of PCV coverage from state is to be done through manual reporting. As part of introduction, the main challenge will be at the level of the health worker to understand and implement the overlapping vaccine schedule and administer multiple injections in one visit. Program officers should ensure quality trainings up to the level of health workers to make them understand that three required PCV doses (2 primary doses and 1 booster dose) at 6 weeks, 14 weeks, and 9 months of age need to be administered along with other routine vaccines at the same age, and no eligible child should be devoid of any of the scheduled vaccines. They should also closely supervise to ensure that all scheduled vaccines are given concomitantly such that coverage of all vaccines scheduled together remains high. For example, at 6 weeks of age it should be ensured that high coverage rates of pentavalent1, OPV1, rotavirus1, fractional-dose IPV1, and PCV1 coverage rates are achieved and consistent across vaccines. Similarly, coverage rates should be tracked for all scheduled vaccines at PCV2 and PCV booster dose time points, respectively. In case the printing of revised MCP card and other reporting formats is delayed in the initial few days of PCV introduction, program managers should ensure that they provide clear instructions to health workers/vaccinators in such situations how they should record vaccination data in the MCP card or which reporting formats are to be used alternatively to record vaccine coverage (Figure 33). Reporting and recording practices for PCV (MCP card, vaccine registers, due lists, tally sheets, reporting coverage until HMIS and MCTS/RCH portals are updated) will also need attention at all levels. Strong monitoring and supervision are required to identify gaps and to ensure accountability and take necessary corrective actions where needed. Monthly reporting of PCV coverage should be collated at the state level and sent to the national level, so as to reach the national level by 7th of the next month. This manual reporting will continue until such time that the HMIS is updated to capture the National Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 44 same electronically. All blocks/planning units should send reports to the district and all districts should send reports to the state. The state report needs to be submitted to Immunization Division, MoHFW by 7th of every month for the preceding month. Figure 33. Updated MCP card after introduction of PCV45Communications Strategy & Social Mobilization for PCV Introduction9Chapter The success of a new vaccine is achieved when the supply and demand sides are in equilibrium. Communication approaches have proved effective in building the demand for the new vaccine and subsequently increasing the uptake of the vaccine among the communities with high burden of pneumonia. Considering the above factors, the communication strategy for PCV focuses on an integrated approach which includes (Figure 34): MOs should brief the ANMs and their supervisors, ASHA and their supervisors, IEC staff, about the introduction of PCV in the routine immunization program. MOs need to support frontline health workers in developing a social mobilization plan focused on PCV. ANMs with the support of ASHAs prepare the due list for PCV as part of the routine immunization activities. Inform local influencers, mobilizers and their networks about PCV, orient them about their roles and responsibilities, and develop a plan of action for mobilization. A template for developing a plan for social mobilization with indicative activities should be developed. Post-introduction of vaccine Organize community meetings with community members and leaders. Conduct meetings for mothers with infants under 1 year of age during village health & nutrition day (VHND) to explain about PCV and its benefits. Conduct sensitization meetings of local non- governmental organizations, community-based organizations and other networks.Communication Strategy Social MobilizationCapacity BuildingAdvocacyMedia Management 9.1 SOCIAL MOBILIZATION Social mobilization plays a vital role in building the trust and confidence of the community, dispelling myths and misconceptions, engaging multiple stakeholders for collaborative partnerships, and creating an enabling environment and a positive response towards the new vaccine. Pre-introduction of vaccine District level officials should brief the block level health and IEC officers about the introduction of PCV. Health officials should orient officials of ICDS, PRI, RD and education departments on PCV during inter- departmental meetings and reviews. Figure 34. Key aspects of communication strategyNational Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 469.2 CAPACITY BUILDING It is essential to refresh and build the interpersonal skills of health workers for mobilizing caregivers and community members. Timely trainings/orientation of health care service providers and mobilizers on PCV introduction will build their confidence in the new vaccine, enable them to share essential and relevant information with the community which will eventually help in the smooth introduction of the vaccine. The following trainings should be carried out at each level prior to the introduction of the new vaccine: Training of frontline health workers by trained block- level officials. Training of influencers, mobilizers on IPC skills, facilitating group meetings, delivering key messages and using lively interactive methods. Communication training sessions will be part of state and district ToTs. Use of IEC materials needs to be emphasized during ToTs. Facilitate announcements from mosques and temples about routine immunization sessions. Ensure that sessions are held in sites which are easier to access for the caregivers. Ensure that ANMs and ASHAs communicate the four key messages to child's caregivers and family members during sessions. Advocacy is the process of building support and gaining consensus, building a positive environment by using various tools for fostering a commitment for the new vaccine/ immunization and thereby increasing its uptake. The following are some of the advocacy activities that need to be carried out: Community meetings School meetings with teachers, parent-teacher groups and school management committees Meetings with religious leaders Meetings with VHSNC members The advocacy and social mobilization activities for PCV should be conducted simultaneously to build a conducive environment for vaccine introduction and ensure its sustainability. Use of interpersonal channels is very effective in influencing the advocates . ANMs/frontline health workers/link workers need to mobilize influencers and mobilizers, and orient them about PCV through one-on-one meetings, and discussions with family members, peers, friends and co-workers.9.3 MEDIA MANAGEMENT Media management is an important aspect of newvaccine introduction. The advocacy needs for any new vaccine are different from those that are already introduced. While traditional media like mass and mid-media will be utilized for visibility, new media (social and digital media) platforms will have to be utilized for further advocacy and awareness generation. Communications Strategy & Social Mobilization for PCV Introduction 479.3.1 PLAN AND ACTIVITIES Advocacy for new vaccine introduction needs to begin before the roll-out of the vaccine. The plan should include the following: Pre-launch activities Media sensitization workshops: Need to be organized at the state level for providing journalists an overview of the routine immunization program, pneumococcal disease burden and need for the new vaccine. Informal media interactions by state government officials to engage the media and sensitize them regarding disease burden and need for the vaccine. These should begin at least a month before the launch and at least one should be planned every week with different media outlets each time. Opinion articles: On the need for the vaccine and the disease burden by either a state government official or a well-known public health expert should be given out at the state level. Media monitoring: To begin at least 2 weeks prior to launch. Launch Activities Press conference : To be clubbed with the launch. This should be organized along with state/district Press Information Bureau. Opinion articles : On the launch of life-saving vaccine and how many children will benefit from the vaccine at the state level. This should be put out either on the day of the launch or a day after or within the week. Post-launch activities Media monitoring: To continue at least 4 weeks post launch Formal media interactions with govt. officials: It is important that the media gets adequate opportunities with the state officials and independent public health experts to do stories apart from the launch of the vaccine. These ensure bigger and more in-depth stories. Opinion articles : On the roll-out of the vaccine, how many children have received it, and the benefit of the vaccine. This should be placed in the media a month after the launch with fresh details from the ground/field. 9.4 CRISIS COMMUNICATION Any new vaccine introduction generates a special interest among the community regarding the vaccine and its benefits. Since a lot of visibility is generated through effective advocacy, any adverse events following immunization that may be reported also get highlighted instantly in the media due to strengthening of the AEFI surveillance across the country, National Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 48 ACTIVITIES Set up an internal information system (before the crisis occurs/before the roll out of the vaccine) Flow of information: District State National Timelines for sharing information and response at each le vel As soon as an AEFI occurs, all levels have to be immediately given the information (as FYI). This is important because the media may make queries at any level. If the first response of the govt. is that they know about it and are investigating, the media would tend to trust the system instead of raising negative questions. Identify spokespersons Primary spokespersons: to comment on the basic details of the case (no comment on causality until it is confirmed). Secondary spokespersons: to share positive messages on the v accine, demystify AEFIs, support the government (no comment on causality until it is confi rmed). Media mapping of the states where the vaccine is being introduced. Pre-draft Press releases (national and state level) A. PROACTIVE STEPS IN A NUTSHELL Set up an internal information system. Identify and train media spokespersons. Media mapping. Pre-draft advocacy material (Press releases, info kits, opinion articles). Develop FAQs for program managers for use in crisis situations. Pre-draft AEFI responses with possible scenarios. Schedule regular news media interactions for pitching in positive stories. Media scanning.9.4.1 WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE? Communications Strategy & Social Mobilization for PCV Introduction 49 Develop info-kits for advocacy Opinion articles (Child health & immunization, pneumococcal disease burden, need for the vaccine) Develop FAQs and fact sheets Use AEFI responses/templates for response to possible crisis situations Schedule news media interactions Formal briefings Informal briefings (regular opportunities; to start at least a mont h before the launch/roll out) Media scanning: Scan through the pages of 2-3 newspapers for coverage regarding vaccine or AEFI reports every day and look out for news reports on local TV channels in the evening and/or through the day. B. REACTIVE STEPS - what to do when the crisis has occurred? IN A NUTSHELL Implement the AEFI Media Response Protocol. Swift/timely response. Do not neglect media queries. Use/Refer to the case specific response templates for possible crisis situati ons. How to respond? Media briefings/press statement/written responses. Media scanning and follow up. Avoid press conferences When a crisis occurs and the media picks up the news over 3-4 days or more, the states tend to call a press conference to address the issue. THIS MUST BE AVOIDED. The r eason is when the reporters are given an opportunity to ask questions in a group, they tend to harp on the neg ative and not give the spokespersons time to respond properly. Media scanning and follow up It is imperative that the media reports are scanned especially when there is a cris is and see if the govt.'s response has been carried or not and judge whether the news is balanced or nega tive. If the news is negative, the reporter must be contacted to share the appropriate facts.National Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 50Messages to be given out by primary and secondary spokespersons Primary (government)Messages The case is noted and is being investigated. The state/district AEFI experts are analyzing the reports. The vaccine is safe. (All other children who got the vaccine are well). Side effects are very rare and can be managed. They also occur in children who have not received the vaccine. The vaccine has been in use in the private sector in India for many years and is being given in many other countries as part of national immunization systems.Spokespersons Secondary (private practitioners/ medical experts) The vaccine has been in use in the private sector in India for many years and is being given in many other countries. The vaccine is safe and beneficial. Reporting an AEFI does not automatically mean the vaccine has caused it. Many cases are co-incidental. AEFI surveillance system acts as a disease surveillance system. It is beneficial and is being strengthened. Monitoring the communication activities State health officials should guide district-and block- level officials to develop district- and block-wise plans for undertaking communication activities. A plan for the dissemination of IEC materials for PCV needs to be developed at the state, district and block levels. Implementation of both the plans need to be monitored by the health and IEC staff (BEEs/MEIOs).51Monitoring & Supervision10Chapter The introduction of PCV in the UIP provides an opportunity to strengthen the overall monitoring of the routine immunization program. An intensified monitoring strategy should be used during PCV vaccinations. Appropriate information will be collected on the status of implementation through all components of routine immunization monitoring. A team of national and state observers shall supervise and monitor all activities during the preparatory and implementation phases across the country. These teams shall guide and evaluate the progress and share their findings with the state and district task forces, and subsequently at the national level for further action. It is recommended that introduction activities start 2-3 months prior to the scheduled introduction of the vaccine. 10.1 SUPERVISION AND MONITORING OF IMPLEMENTATION Oversight of the implementation activities is crucial at all levels. Supervision should focus on bridging the gaps identified through the state and district preparedness assessment checklists. 10.1.1 National Level Review of the state preparedness checklists and assessment of progress achieved in addressing the identified issues at regular intervals will contribute to effective implementation and will also strengthen the routine immunization system in each state. Field visits by national observers will provide real- time information. The observers must visit the health facilities at all levels to assess the preparedness of states prior to introduction. The observers must share their observations with the district- and state- level officials for further action (if any). 10.1.2 State Level Review of the preparedness checklists of the districts will be done by the state immunization officer (SIO). It is recommended that a state team be formed to oversee the implementation process. Officers from various departments can also be involved in the state- level trainings to enable participation in monitoring.Field visits by the SIO and state observers (assigned for high-priority districts) must focus on checklist findings and visit the district training sessions. Issues identified must be shared with state and district task forces for corrective actions. State task force for immunization (STFI) STFI should be convened periodically to steer key messages for all activities for introduction of PCV in the state, including commitment and support from various departments and stakeholders. Issues identified in preparedness assessment should be addressed during meetings of the STFI, State AEFI committee and the State Health Society (SHS) for ensuring smooth introduction of the vaccine. Any funding issues related to new vaccine introduction should immediately be addressed by the STFI and SHS; and necessary instructions for the same should be communicated to the districts concerned. States should make best use of lessons learnt from the polio program to strengthen routine immunization. Opportunity like new vaccine introduction should be used to highlight issues that need attention for corrective action. Before introduction of the new vaccine, ensure that AEFI surveillance system is strengthened with reporting of AEFI cases following other vaccines also. The increased AEFI reporting following new vaccine introduction may be blamed on the new vaccine. This may affect the acceptance of and demand for new vaccines in other states and districts. However, the medical fraternity across all cadres should be reassured as National Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 52District task force for immunization (DTFI) DTFI should be convened periodically to steer all activities for introduction of PCV vaccine in the district, including obtaining commitment and support for introduction of this vaccine from various departments and stakeholders. Issues identified in activities essential for smooth introduction of PCV in the district should be addressed during meetings of DTFI, district AEFI committee and District Health Society. Districts should make best use of lessons learnt from the polio program and introduction of other new vaccines to strengthen routine immunization. Make best use of this new vaccine introduction opportunity to highlight issues that need attention for corrective action. The DTFI should monitor preparations for reporting and managing AEFIs. It should monitor the status of AEFI trainings, reporting and investigation of serious/severe AEFIs following all vaccines (not just PCV). It should also ensure that the district AEFI committee is active and meets at least once a quarter. WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, JSI and other key routine immunization partners at district level are expected to proactively extend support in providing quality information/monitoring data to DTFI for guiding and taking appropriate actions. 10.2 MONITORING THE PROCESS OF PCV VACCINE IMPLEMENTATION Standardized data collection formats and operating procedures have been developed by MoHFW to monitor the provision of routine immunization services at immunization session sites and community level coverage of all antigens offered through UIP to detect coverage gaps. The introduction of PCV vaccine in the UIP provides an opportunity to strengthen the overall monitoring of the routine immunization program. The MoHFW mandated intensified routine immunization monitoring strategy should be used for PCV-related monitoring as well. Appropriate information may be collected on the status of implementation through all components of routine immunization monitoring. increased sensitivity in reporting of AEFIs actually is in the interest of the immunization program. WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, JSI and other key routine immunization partners involved in immunization at state and district levels are expected to proactively support the authorities in providing quality information/monitoring data at STFI and DTFI levels for appropriate actions. 10.1.3 District Level In addition to officers of the health department, officials from Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) department should also be involved in block- level monitoring of training. Child development project officers and local administrative officers should be invited by block MOs to observe training of ASHAs and AWWs at the PHC level. Issues identified must be shared with district task forces for corrective actions. Monitoring of preparatory activities, training and field implementation will be done by all immunization partners. District-level monitoring provides information on vaccine availability, engagement of ICDS and education department, microplanning, trainings, vaccine coverage, vaccine stocks, wastage rates, social mobilization and communications, etc. Monitoring & Supervision 5310.2.1 District-Level Monitors' Briefing To build capacity of district- and block-level officials, government and partners are responsible for monitoring the preparedness and implementation of PCV introduction in the districts. Monitors are expected to use standardized monitoring formats. These monitors will share monitoring feedback at respective levels as per timelines. 10.2.2 Monitoring vaccine, logistics and cold chain at PHC PCV is a freeze sensitive vaccine. This vaccine should be stored between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C. Available records must be examined for supply, utilization and balance of vaccines with AD syringes. Records should be cross- verified physically to see whether there is a logical association between vaccines and AD syringes supplied and used. eVIN is an important tool to monitor vaccine stock and cold chain status at all levels. Program officers are encouraged to physically validate the data recorded in eVIN and also in the NCCMIS. 10.2.3 Session site monitoring This captures information on vaccine supply and the availability of logistics, functioning of alternate vaccine delivery (AVD) system, injection practices of ANMs, injection safety and waste disposal, record keeping and inter-personal communication of service providers. 10.2.4 District and block level monitoring This provides information on coverage, vaccine stocks, wastage rates, etc. 10.2.5 House-to-house monitoring This involves interacting with the caregivers of eligible children in the community both during the session as well as after immunization sessions through a standard format. This is done to assess the reach of utilization of services by the community and completeness of vaccination coverage. The monitoring will reveal the reasons as to why any child has missed the due PCV and/or any of the UIP vaccines appropriate for the age. The evidence generated through the community level monitoring in the form of percentage eligible children found not to have received the due vaccine and full immunization status are the two key indicators that would be used to apprise the task forces and guide the mid-course corrective measures. 10.2.6 Rapid monitoring Following PCV introduction, simultaneous rapid monitoring will also be initiated for at least 3 months to assess implementation status of PCV, identify gaps/bottlenecks and provide feedback for immediate corrections. The findings will be very useful in introduction/expansion of PCV in the country. All immunization partners will assist the MoHFW in undertaking rapid monitoring through standardized rapid monitoring formats along with standard operating procedures. Rapid National Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 54 monitoring will be done at block and session level, for which separate formats will be developed. This monitoring will be undertaken in addition to routine immunization monitoring. 10.3 LESSONS LEARNT FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF PCV VACCINE - POST INTRODUCTION EVALUATION (PIE) The introduction of any new vaccine is an opportunity to strengthen health systems and improve the reach of immunization services to disadvantaged populations. WHO recommends that a post introduction evaluation (PIE) of new vaccines be conducted within 6-12 months of introduction of a new vaccine. The aim of such evaluation is to assess community acceptance, impact on the existing immunization system and derive lessons for necessary corrective measures. Although a PIE is done in the context of new vaccine introduction, the exercise provides a broad overview of the performance of the immunization program, and thus boosts the confidence to further scale up and introduce new and underutilized vaccines in the program. Findings from PIE of nationwide pentavalent vaccine and measles-containing vaccine second dose, as well as lessons learnt from introduction of IPV, rotavirus vaccine are being used to inform the introduction of PCV in the country.55Introduction Activities at State, District and Sub-district Levels11Chapter The inclusion of PCV into the UIP schedule requires careful preparation and implementation at all levels. This initially involves top-down macro-planning at the state level, followed by bottom-up micro-planning, detailing precise cold chain space at different levels, logistics and financial needs for each district and sub-district, starting from the more peripheral levels and moving towards the higher levels. The broad steps involved for the introduction of PCV vaccine are similar to the recently introduced pentavalent, IPV and rotavirus vaccines. The specific learning and observations related to this process in the states where early implementation of the vaccine is being planned shall inform appropriate refinement in the operational guidelines. 11.1 STATE-LEVEL ACTIVITIES The following activities need to be undertaken at state level for successful introduction of PCV vaccine: State task force for immunization (STFI) STFI should be convened periodically to steer key messages for all activities for PCV introduction in state, including commitment and support from various departments and stakeholders. Issues identified for smooth introduction of the vaccine should be addressed during STFI. Assess state preparedness The state needs to assess preparedness of districts using standardized checklists. The data should be reviewed, compiled and reflected in the state preparedness checklist. Assign state observers to track planning, preparation, launch and implementation of PCV in the districts. Track preparation in high-priority districts Assign state observers to track planning, preparation, launch and implementation of PCV vaccine in priority districts. They should visit these districts and provide oversight to activities for introduction of PCV vaccine, including participation in DTFI and assessment of district preparedness using checklists. Strengthening routine immunization micro-plans Ensure that all vulnerable sections are provided an equal opportunity to avail services. Monitor completeness of all components of microplanning. Indenting and delivery of vaccine and logistics Ensure availability of required doses of PCV vaccine and other logistics. Assess cold chain space. PCV is a freeze sensitive vaccine. To avoid freezing of vaccine ensure cold chain points are visited and evaluated once before the start of vaccination drive. National Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 56Training workshop at state level This is a critical activity and needs timely planning and implementation. Conducting this ToT will create a pool of master trainers who, in turn, will ensure that officials concerned at all levels are sensitized well in time prior to introduction. Key developmental partners such as WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, JSI and others should proactively support the states and districts in planning, implementation and monitoring. The training at different levels including target trainees, trainers and duration is summarized in the Chapter 5 above. Tracking beneficiaries (left-outs and drop-outs) Undertake headcount for estimation of beneficiaries by ANMs/ ASHAs/AWWs for improved micro planning and tracking. Use standardized tools for microplanning and estimation of beneficiaries. Ensure it is a time- bound activity and gets completed in 1-2 weeks. Ensure that vaccinators update due lists before every session. Following PCV introduction, ensure that PCV1 should be included as part of due lists for beneficiaries coming at 6 weeks for pentavalent1, OPV1, Rota1 , fractional-dose IPV1 and subsequently for PCV2 at 14 weeks and PCV booster dose at 9 months. State health authorities and partners should intensively monitor this activity and share findings at all relevant platforms. Implementation of immunization tracking bag (one per session site). ANM will keep one immunization tracking bag for each session site. She will make the ASHA/AWW of that area responsible for safe keeping of tracking bags containing counterfoils. The ANM will provide oversight and cross check counterfoils to ascertain reasons for dropouts. Dissemination of operational guidelines/IEC materials Disseminate relevant guidelines and training materials to each category of staff during trainings for PCV introduction. Ensure printing of IEC material in local language in adequate numbers. Intensified monitoring and supervision Intensify supervision and monitoring of program at district, block, session and house-to-house levels through government functionaries and partners. Use standardized routine immunization monitoring formats recently revised and shared with states by MoHFW. (Refer to the revised routine immunization session and house-to- house monitoring formats). Rapid monitoring will be initiated at block and session level for at least 3 months of new vaccine introduction to assess the implementation status, identify gaps/bottlenecks and provide feedback for immediate corrections. This activity will be undertaken by all immunization partners. Separate formats for rapid monitoring have to be filled in addition to the routine immunization monitoring formats. Introduction Activities at State, District and Sub-district Levels 5711.2 DISTRICT LEVEL ACTIVITIES The following activities should be undertaken at the district/block level for successful PCV vaccination: District task force for immunization (DTF-I) DTFI should be convened to steer all activities for introduction of PCV vaccine in the district, including obtaining commitment and support from various departments and stakeholders. Representatives of urban local bodies should be part of DTFI. Assess district preparedness The district needs to assess the preparedness of the blocks using standardized checklist. Quantitative and qualitative data should be compiled and reflected in the district preparedness checklists. Track high-priority blocks Senior district health officials have to be identified and assigned to visit and provide oversight to activities for introduction of PCV vaccine in high-priority blocks and urban areas, including participation in DTFI and assessment of district preparedness using checklists. Strengthen routine immunization micro-plans Ensure all vulnerable sections and high risk groups are provided an equal opportunity to avail services. For improved microplanning, ANMs/ASHAs/ AWWs should undertake a headcount survey for estimation of beneficiaries by using standardized tools. This has to be a time-bound activity (1-2 weeks) and has to be intensively monitored by government functionaries and partners. DTFI to monitor the completeness of microplans. Indenting and delivery of vaccine and logistics Ensure availability of required doses of PCV and other logistics. Assess cold chain space. PCV is a freeze sensitive vaccine. To avoid freezing of vaccine ensure cold chain point are visited and evaluated once before the start of vaccination. Vaccine and cold chain officials posted at all levels are expected to undertake field visits regarding cold chain preparedness. All immunization partners are expected to use standardized formats to assess cold chain preparedness at all levels. Training workshop at district/block level Prepare a training calendar to train the health workforce. Conduct district-level ToTs to create a pool of trainers at district and block levels. The DIO will be responsible for ensuring timely completion of training as per guidelines. Key development partners such as WHO, UNICEF and others are expected to proactively support the district in planning and sensitization for the workshop activities including monitoring the quality of training. The district- and block-level pool of trainers is expected to follow the cascading approach for sensitizing the health work force at district and block levels. (Refer to Chapter 5 on trainings for further information). Do not forget to train the staff posted in big government hospitals and medical colleges. Ensure that key officials identified under NHM (Urban) are included as participants. Each planning unit in urban area should be considered like a block. Develop training plan accordingly.

State and Local Organizations Other organizations such as IMA, IAP and civil society bodies to extend support at national, state and district levels. These organizations can play an important role in information dissemination and advocacy at various levels. Their involvement at district and state task force meetings can be encouraged based on decisions by state and district health department needs.Annexures65Planning & Introduction State and district workshops should be organized to sensitize stakeholders on the technical and operational aspects of vaccine introduction at least 2-3 months prior to the vaccine launch. Each state should use standard assessment checklists to review district-level preparedness before allowing introduction of new vaccines. Program stewardship Each state should have a functioning STFI and DTFI to regularly review and guide the new vaccine introduction and immunization program. Sensitization of all key stakeholders and partners Sensitizing leading pediatricians, including IAP, IMA and IRC local chapters is an absolute requirement before launching PCV vaccination drive at both the state and district level. Human resources The immunization management structure should particularly be strengthened at state and district levels. Additional special sites need to be planned for targeting the high risk groups scattered within urban areas identified in advance through field validation. Vaccinators, identified from medical colleges, nursing colleges, ANM training schools, pharmacy colleges and private nurses, need to be trained in advance on new vaccine before the introduction. The plan should be made to include them in the respective urban area micro plans. Microplanning Micro-planning should be initiated 1-2 months prior to new vaccine introduction using bottom-up approach to ensure inclusion of all components. Availability of micro-plans for outreach sessions (who will get vaccinated, Annexure 1: Key lessons learned from new vaccine introduction in India (Measles vaccine, Hib-containing pentavalent vaccine, etc.)20 where, who vaccinates, when vaccination will be done, team information, number of beneficiaries, nearest health facility etc.,) is the most crucial component of the program. Existing routine immunization micro plans in all districts should be revised to include high-risk areas, including urban slums and missed areas, so that vulnerable populations are not missed. Due-listing by health-link workers in advance for true enumeration is an absolute requirement Due-listing through house visits by link workers will help in enumerating the true target population for high vaccination coverage. Preparation of due lists based on head count survey should capture information on beneficiaries under 2 years of age. This head count survey will provide the authorities with almost close to actual number of target beneficiaries. National Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 66Supervision and monitoring Supportive supervision and appropriate oversight should be maintained and a regular feedback mechanism should be in place. Identify supportive supervisors and independent external monitors at all levels and make a plan for supervision - monitoring with emphasis on the high risk areas/populations as part of the micro plan. Rapid monitoring should be initiated at block & session level for at least 3 months of new vaccine introduction to assess implementation status, identify gaps/bottlenecks and provide feedback for immediate corrections. Separate formats for rapid monitoring have to be filled in addition to the routine immunization monitoring. Monitoring data from the field is fed back to the block, district and state task forces to guide programmatic decision-making and actions. Conducting a PIE within 6-12 months of new vaccine introduction helps in identifying gaps Coverage, reporting and data collection Channel for e-reporting (HMIS) should be strengthened. The data collected from paper reports and drop-out and vaccine stock should be readily retrievable at all levels and should be checked for accuracy. Data should be analyzed to improve program performance and fill in gaps. Reporting and recording tools such as MCP cards, registers, tally sheets, etc. should be timely updated to include columns for recording of new vaccines. Surveillance for adverse events following immunization (AEFI) Training and sensitization for reporting and investigation of all serious/severe AEFIs for all frontline health workers, MOs (and not just MO in charges) all PHCs/CHCs/SDHs/District Hospitals and private practitioners. All AEFI cases should be investigated promptly, as this helps to establish causality and builds trust among the community. Training and knowledge of healthcare workers Cascaded trainings are envisaged for building capacity of all cadres of health staff involved in new vaccine introduction and other routine immunization strengthening activities. The completion of trainings at all levels should be tracked. These trainings should begin at least 2-3 months before new vaccine introduction. Districts should be allowed to introduce new vaccine only after block-level trainings have been completed. Health financing Funds for the introduction of vaccine should be ensured beforehand. The incentives of ASHAs and health workers should be released timely. This is important to ensure their motivation and commitment. Vaccine, cold chain and logistics management Cold chain & vaccine management should be reviewed and strengthened before any new vaccine introduction to ensure space availability for both vaccine and related logistics at state, district and block levels. Cold chain inventory should be regularly reviewed and status of the same should be updated in the NCCMIS. A quarterly review of district cold chain handlers should be organized at the state level and on a monthly basis at the district level. Recording of temperatures in ILRs and deep freezers (DFs) should be done regularly even on weekends. REMEMBER It will be important to ensure that these recommendations are acted upon during PCV introduction process in states.Annexures 67 Standardized AEFI management kits should be procured by the district health team in advance for distribution to all AEFI treatment centers before any new vaccine introduction drive as per micro-plan. For more details, refer to AEFI chapter. Open vial policy The Open Vial Policy is applicable to PCV vaccine. Refer to the most recent MoHFW letter regarding open vial policy. Vaccine wastage records should be analyzed to identify poor-performing areas and corrective action taken. Injection safety and waste management States should consider adopting the outsourced models of waste management for more efficient waste management and ensure regular review at all facilities. Hub cutters and black and red bags should be made available at immunization sites as part of waste disposal mechanism (refer guidelines). Advocacy, social mobilization and communications A media sensitization workshop should be conducted before the vaccine launch to increase public awareness and deal with vaccine-related queries. IEC materials prepared in local language should be made available to the community at least 2-4 weeks prior to vaccine launch. Health workers should also deliver the key messages to all caregivers and explain the need for the newly introduced vaccine. IPC is the best tool to connect with community mobilization and vaccine acceptance.National Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 68Annexure 2: Training Plan for PCV Introduction Timeing Trainers Participants Tranining support State Workshop (ToT) for PCV Introduction Duration: 1.5 daysMoHFW and national level partnersState-level: Immunization partners District-level (maximum 4-5 participants): Immunization partnersState Health Department with support from all immunization partners State Media Workshop for PCV IntroductionChair: Principal Secretary (Health & FW) Co-chair: MD NHM Key facilitators: State Immunization Officer, Director Supporting partners: WHO NPSP, UNICEF, JSI with support of other partners (ITSU, GHS)State-level: State Immunization Officer, State IEC Officer (Mass Media Officer/State BCC Coordinator NHM), WHO NPSP and partners District-level (maximum 2 participants): District Mass Media Officer, District Immunization Officer (if required), any other official identified as district spokesperson.SEPIO and nodal officer at state for mass media Funding support (NHM): State Health Department District Workshop (ToT) for PCV Introduction Duration: One dayDistrict Immunization Officer, WHO NPSP, District Program Manager (NHM), District Cold Chain Handler and PartnersDistrict-level: District Program Manager, District Cold Chain Handler, District Mobilization Coordinator (SMNet), Vaccine cold chain manager (UNDP) and partners Block-level (maximum 4-5 participants from blocks and urban planning units): Block MOICs, Block Program Manager (NHM), CDPO-ICDS, Block-IO/ICC/ARO, Block Cold Chain Handler, Block Mobilization Coordinator (SMNet)District Health Department with with technical support from immunization partners Block Workshop for PCV Introduction (for health workers and mobilizers) Duration: One dayBlock MOICs, Block Program Manager (NHM), CDPO-ICDS, Block IO/ICC and Block Cold Chain Handler, Block Mobilization Coordinator (SMNet)ANMs, front-level mobilizers (ASHA/AWW) and Health & ICDS supervisors officers (if any)District Health Department (NHM budget)Annexures 69Annexure 3: Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) government cold chain handlers and deploying vaccine and cold chain managers in every district for constant support to estimate vaccine requirements, supervise cold chain handlers and coordinate with cold chain technicians across the district. Cold chain handlers are provided smart phones with the eVIN application which allows for the digitization of vaccine inventories. As a routine task, every cold chain handler enters the net utilization for each vaccine in the standardized registers at the en d of every immunization day. This is simultaneously updated in the eVIN application and uploaded on a cloud server which can then be viewed by programme managers at district, state and national level through online dashboards. In addition to providing real-time information on vaccine stocks, the system also helps to track storage temperature of vaccines. SIM-enabled temperature loggers atta ched to the cold chain equipment capture temperature information through a digital sensor placed in the refrigerator. Temperature data is recorded every 10 minutes and updated at an interval of 60 minutes on the server via General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). In case of temperature breach, the logger alarms and sends email and SMS alerts to responsible cold chain technicians and managers. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has rolled out an innovative electronic vaccine intelligence network called eVIN in all states. eVIN aims to support the Government of India's Universal Immunization Programme by providing real-time information on vaccine stocks and flows, and storage temperatures across all cold chain points in these states. eVIN provides an integrated solution to address widespread inequities in vaccine coverage by supporting state governments in overcoming constraints of infrastructure, monitoring and management information systems and human resources, often resulting in overstocking and stockouts of vaccines in storage centers. The integrated solution combines: Technology: to facilitate evidence-based decision-making by making available online real- time information on vaccine stocks and storage temperature through the eVIN application software and temperature loggers; Governance: to ensure efficient vaccine logistics management by systemizing record keeping through standardizing stock and distribution registers; identifying gaps and improving clarity on vaccine cold chain network; drawing attention to infrastructure upgrades; developing standard operating procedures; and encouraging good practices; Human Resources: to empower the state cold chain network by building the capacities of National Operational Guidelines for PCV Introduction 70eVIN Process Flow Cold chain handler then punches data in eVIN mobile application to update the stock for each vaccine.
