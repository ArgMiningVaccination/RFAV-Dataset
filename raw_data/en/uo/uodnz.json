The exemption is retroactively effective and applies to taxable events occurring after December 31, 2014, and through December 31, 2020. House Bill No. 1319 provides a sales tax exemption for gross receipts from tickets or admissions to athletic, musical, dramatic, or scholastic events of institutions of higher education in which the primary performers or participants are students of an institution of higher education. The bill also provides that gross receipts from these activities are not subject to the $10,000 per event cap. Senate Bill No. 2094 expands the sales tax exemption for manufacturing or recycling machinery and equipment to include molds purchased by a customer and used directly by a manufacturer in the manufacturing process. To receive the exemption at the time of purchase, the customer must receive a certificate from the Tax Commissioner stating the mold qualifies for the exemption. If a certificate is not received before the purchase, the customer must pay the tax and apply for a refund. Senate Bill No. 2036 extends the sales tax exemption available on gross receipts from the initial sale of beneficiated coal that is not subject to tax under Chapter 57 -60. The exemption was scheduled to expire on July 1, 2015. The bill extends the sales and use tax exemption available for certain purchases made by power plants classified as electrical generating plants which convert beneficiated coal into electric power. This exemption was scheduled to expire on July 1, 2017. The bill also extends the severance tax exemption for coal used in certain plants and provides an exemption from the coal conversion facilities privilege tax for beneficiated coal produced for use within a coal conversion facility, which are described in the mineral taxes section of this title summary. Senate Bill No. 2037 expands the items included in the definition of machinery and equipment used to produce coal from a new mine for purposes of a sales tax exemption and allows for purchases of machinery or equipment made after December 31, 2010, to produce coal either directly or indirectly, to qualify for a refund of sales or use tax paid. The bill restricts the interest allowed on any refunds of sales and use tax paid to interest on purchases made before July 1, 2015. The bill applies retroactively to purchase of machinery or equipment made after December 31, 2010. The bill also provides for payments in lieu of property taxes for certain centrally assessed wind turbine electric generating units and an income tax credit for installation of qualifying wind energy devices, which are described in the property taxes and income taxes sections of this title summary. House Bill No. 1110 addresses administrative difficulties in determining whether sales or use tax was paid on the purchase price of an item purchased by a lease or rental company or whether the tax was not paid by the company at the time of purchase with the intent of collecting the tax on the lease or rental charges applied to each customer leasing or renting the property. The bill requires a retailer to separately state on the invoice or other supporting document that sales or use tax was paid by the retailer at the time of purchase if the retailer is not applying tax to the lease or rental charges due from the consumer. Senate Bill No. 2115 allows the Tax Commissioner to authorize a retailer to deduct and retain compensation on sales and use tax returns filed or paid after the due date, if the Tax Commissioner determines the taxpayer showed good cause for the delay. The bill also allows the Tax Commissioner to make changes to assessments in certain situations which are described in the miscellaneous tax provisions section of this title summary. MINERAL TAXES House Bill No. 1476 provides for a restructuring of oil extraction tax rates and exemptions. The bill provides that current law regarding tax rates and the application of triggered incentives will remain in effect through December 31, 2015, subject to two exceptions: North Dakota Legislative Council 57-5 May 20151.Beginning December 1, 2015, if triggered rate exemptions are in effect, a 24 -month exemption from the oil extraction tax will no longer be available for wells drilled and completed a horizontal well; and 2.Oil produced from new wells, drilled and completed after April 21, 1987, will no longer be eligible for a reduced tax rate of 4 percent but will instead be taxed at the full rate of 6.5 percent. The remaining term of all other rate reductions or exemptions eliminated by the bill may not be carried forward past December 31, 2015. Beginning on January 1, 2016, the rate of extraction tax on all oil will be reduced from 6.5 percent to 5 percent. This rate is subject to change depending on the average price of a barrel of crude oil. If the average price of a barrel of crude oil exceeds the trigger price of $90 for three consecutive months, the rate will increase to 6 percent on all oil extracted. The rate will remain at 6 percent until the average price of a barrel of crude oil falls below the trigger price of $90 for three consecutive months, at which time the rate will revert back to 5 percent on all oil extracted. The bill eliminates several oil extraction tax exemptions. Production that will remain exempt from the oil extraction tax after December 31, 2015, includes: 1.Production that is exempt from the gross production tax imposed by Chapter 57 -51; 2.Production from stripper well property or an individual stripper well; 3.Incremental production from a secondary recovery project, for five years from the date incremental production begins; 4.Incremental production from a tertiary recovery project that does not use carbon dioxide, for 10 years from the date incremental production begins; and 5.Incremental production from a tertiary recovery project which uses carbon dioxide, for 5 years from the date incremental production begins if the project is located outside the Bakken and Three Forks Formations and 10 miles or more outside an established field with a pool including the Bakken or Three Forks Formation. A subsequent change was made for the tertiary recovery exemption under Senate Bill No. 2015, described below. Production that will continue to be subject to a reduced oil extraction tax rate after December 31, 2015, includes production from wells drilled and completed outside the Bakken and Three Forks Formations and 10 miles or more outside an established field that includes either formation. The first 75,000 barrels of oil produced during the first 18 months after completion are subject to a reduced tax rate of 2 percent on the gross value at the well of oil extracted. Exemptions that the bill eliminates after December 31, 2015, include exemptions that are dependent on the average monthly comparison price of a barrel of oil dropping below the trigger price in current law for five consecutive months, specifically: 1.A 15-month exemption on the initial production from a vertical well; 2.A 24-month exemption on the initial production from a horizontal well; 3.An exemption on all oil recovered during the testing period prior to well completion; 4.A 12-month exemption on production from a qualifying well that was worked over; 5.A 10-year exemption on production from a certified two -year inactive well; and 6.A nine-month exemption on production from a certified horizontal reentry well. In addition, a 60-month exemption on the initial production from wells drilled and completed before July 1, 2013, on nontrust lands within the boundaries of an Indian reservation or on lands held in trust by the United States for an individual Indian or tribe, and wells drilled and completed before July 1, 2013, on lands held by an Indian tribe if the interest was in existence on August 1, 1997, will no longer be in effect after December 31, 2015. Rate reductions that will no longer be in effect after December 31, 2015, include rate reductions dependent on the average monthly comparison price of a barrel of oil dropping below the trigger price in current law for five consecutive months. These reductions currently bring the 6.5 percent tax rate down to 4 percent on: North Dakota Legislative Council 57-6 May 20151.Oil produced from a vertical well completed after April 27, 1987, following the first 15 months of exempt production; 2.Oil produced from a horizontal well completed after April 27, 1987, following the first 24 months of exempt production; 3.Oil produced from a qualifying secondary or tertiary recovery project certified by the Industrial Commission after June 30, 1991; and 4.Incremental oil produced from a qualifying secondary or tertiary recovery project, following the initial 5-year or 10-year exemption period. In addition, production on which a rate reduction is dependent on the average price of a barrel of oil falling below $55 for one month will no longer be in effect after December 31, 2015. This reduction currently brings the 6.5 percent tax rate down to 2 percent on the first 75,000 barrels, or the first $4.5 million of gross value at the well, whichever is less, of oil produced during the first 18 months after completion. This rate reduction only applies to horizontal wells drilled and completed after April 30, 2009, and before July 1, 2015. Senate Bill No. 2015 further amends House Bill No. 1476 to remove any references to whether carbon dioxide is used in a tertiary recovery project for purposes of determining the duration for which the oil extraction tax exemption will apply to incremental production. The bill also provides that incremental production from a horizontal well drilled and completed within the Bakken and Three Forks Formations is not exempt from oil extraction tax from July 1, 2015, through June 30, 2017, but is thereafter exempt for a period of five years from July 1, 2017, or the date incremental production begins, whichever is later. House Bill No. 1176 provides for adjustments to the distribution formula for oil and gas gross production tax collections. The bill makes the following changes to the distribution of revenues from the first 1 percent of the oil and gas gross production tax: 1.For the period beginning September 1, 2015, and ending August 31, 2017, a total of $375,000 shall be allocated per fiscal year to hub cities located in oil -producing counties for each full or partial percentage point of oil and gas related employment, and for allocations for the period beginning August 31, 2017, a total of $375,000 shall be allocated per fiscal year to hub cities located in oil-producing counties for each full or partial percentage point of private employment engaged in the mining industry; 2.For the period beginning September 1, 2015, and ending August 31, 2017, a total of $250,000 shall be allocated per fiscal year to hub cities located in non -oil-producing counties for each full or partial percentage point of oil and gas related employment, and for allocations for the period beginning August 31, 2017, a total of $250,000 shall be allocated per fiscal year to hub cities located in non-oil-producing counties for each full or partial percentage point of private employment engaged in the mining industry; 3.For the period beginning September 1, 2015, and ending August 31, 2017, a total of $125,000 shall be allocated per fiscal year to hub city school districts located in oil-producing counties for each full or partial percentage point of oil and gas related employment, and for allocations for the period beginning August 31, 2017, a total of $125,000 shall be allocated per fiscal year to hub city school districts located in oil-producing counties for each full or partial percentage point of private employment engaged in the mining industry; 4.A total of $1.5 million per fiscal year shall be allocated to an oil -producing county that received between $5 million and $30 million of allocations, for further distribution to school districts; 5.An amount not exceeding $140 million for the 2015 -17 biennium shall be credited to the oil and gas impact grant fund, and an amount not exceeding $100 million per biennium thereafter; and 6.An amount of 8 percent of revenues from the first 1 percent of oil and gas gross production tax, but not in an amount exceeding $20 million per fiscal year, or $40 million per biennium, shall be credited to the North Dakota outdoor heritage fund. For distribution of revenues from the remaining 4 percent of the oil and gas gross production tax, the bill makes the following changes: North Dakota Legislative Council 57-7 May 20151.Of the annual revenue collected in each oil -producing county in excess of $5 million, 30 percent, rather than the current 25 percent, shall be allocated to each oil -producing county which will reduce the state's share to 70 percent; 2.In determining the percentage of an oil -producing county's revenues that will be distributed to various political subdivisions, a county's classification as a county receiving less than $5 million in allocations, or $5 million or more in allocations, is based on the allocations a county received in state fiscal year 2014, rather than the most recently completed state fiscal year; and 3.Hub city school districts must be omitted from distributions otherwise made to school districts from allocations to an oil-producing county that received less than $5 million in allocations in state fiscal year 2014. The bill also expands the reporting requirements for boards of county commissioners in each county receiving an allocation. The bill requires that in addition to reporting the county's statement of revenues and expenditures, the board must also report the amounts allocated to the county's general fund and to townships within the county, and include the amounts expended from these allocations and the purposes of the expenditures. The bill also creates similar reporting requirements for each school district receiving an allocation. Senate Bill No. 2226 imposes additional requirements on state-tribal oil and gas tax agreements by requiring that agreements be confirmed by a majority of members elected to the House of Representative and the Senate, by limiting agreements to a duration of no more than 16 years following the agreement's effective date, and by requiring that each agreement contain an expiration date which falls on March 31 of an odd-numbered year. The bill expands the scope of the parties who may enter into an agreement by allowing the Governor to enter into agreements with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians. The bill provides that any aspect of an agreement which currently applies within the exterior boundaries of a reservation also applies in an equal manner to trust properties outside reservation boundaries, which are described as those lands held in trust by the United States for any Indian tribe or owned by an Indian tribe or tribal member subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States. The bill also designates the venue for any dispute arising from a revenue sharing agreement. The changes are effective for agreements entered into after July 31, 2015. House Bill No. 1377 creates a political subdivision allocation fund for purposes of allocating oil and gas tax revenues to political subdivisions in oil -producing counties. The bill directs that biennial revenues from oil and gas taxes designated for deposit in the state general fund be deposited as follows through June 30, 2017: 1.The first $200 million will continue to be deposited into the state general fund; 2.The next $300 million, rather than the next $341,790, will be deposited into the tax relief fund rather than into the property tax relief sustainability fund, which the bill eliminates; 3.The next $100 million will continue to be deposited into the state general fund; 4.The next $100 million will continue to be deposited into the strategic investment and improvements fund; 5.The next $22 million will continue to be deposited into the state disaster relief fund, but not in an amount that would bring the unobligated balance in the fund to more than $25 million; and 6.Rather than depositing all additional revenues into the strategic investment and improvements fund, only 70 percent of additional revenues shall be deposited into the fund with the remainder deposited into the newly created political subdivision allocation fund. The bill provides that revenues designated for deposit after June 30, 2017, shall be deposited as follows: 1.The first $200 million into the state general fund; 2.The next $300 million into the tax relief fund; 3.The next $100 million into the state general fund; 4.The next $100 million into the strategic investment and improvements fund; 5.The next $22 million into the state disaster relief fund, but not in an amount that would bring the unobligated balance in the fund to more than $25 million; and North Dakota Legislative Council 57-8 May 20156.Any additional revenues shall be deposited into the strategic investment and improvements fund. House Bill No. 1409 increases the funding for the North Dakota outdoor heritage fund from 4 percent to 8 percent of the remaining amount available from a one -fifth share of oil and gas gross production tax revenues. The bill also increases the maximum allowable allocation to the fund per state fiscal year from an amount not exceeding $15 million to an amount not exceeding $20 million. The per biennium limit is also increased from an amount not exceeding $30 million to an amount not exceeding $40 million. House Bill No. 1032 increases transfers of oil and gas gross production tax revenues to the abandoned oil and gas well plugging and site reclamation fund from $5 million to $7.5 million per fiscal year and increases the maximum allowable balance of the fund from $75 million to $100 million if the triggered exemption for new wells under Section 57 -51.1-03 is not in effect for the period of July 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015. Senate Bill No. 2039 provides that any income, including interest payments on loans, from the coal development trust fund be deposited in the school construction assistance loan fund, rather than the general fund, after any amounts needed to replace uncollectible loans made from the fund are deducted. Senate Bill No. 2318 provides that a carbon dioxide capture system located at a coal conversion facility and any equipment directly used for enhanced recovery of oil or natural gas is exempt from all ad valorem taxes, and exempt from the coal conversion facilities privilege tax. The exemption does not apply to the land on which the capture system or equipment is located. The bill also creates a sales and use tax exemption for materials used to construct or expand systems relating to the use of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil or gas recovery, which is described in the sales, use, motor vehicle excise, and gross receipts taxes section of this title summary. Senate Bill No. 2036 provides an exemption from the coal conversion facilities privilege tax for beneficiated coal produced for use within a coal conversion facility. The bill also extends the severance tax exemption available for coal purchased for improvement through beneficiation which is then used in an agricultural commodity processing facility or in any facility owned by the state or a political subdivision. This exemption was scheduled to expire on July 1, 2015. The bill also extends sales and use tax exemptions, which are described in the sales, use, motor vehicle excise, and gross receipts taxes section of this title summary. Senate Bill No. 2172 allows for oil and gas gross production tax and oil extraction tax revenue collected by the Tax Commissioner to be allocated by the State Treasurer according to the distribution and allocation rules in place at the time the revenues were received by the Tax Commissioner rather than applying the distribution and allocation rules that were in place at the time the taxable production was produced. Senate Bill No. 2377 provides that for purposes of taxation, commercial leonardite is treated in the same manner as coal. House Bill No. 1013 eliminates the requirement that grant recommendations made by the Director of the Energy Infrastructure and Impact Office be made not less than once each calendar quarter. FUELS TAXES House Bill No. 1020 eliminates the seven cents per gallon withheld from agricultural fuel tax refunds which had previously been deposited into the agricultural research fund. The bill also provides for transfers of farm machinery gross receipts tax revenues, which is described in the sales, use, motor vehicle excise, and gross receipts taxes section of this title summary. Senate Bill No. 2008 provides an exemption to the requirement of depositing special fuels tax receipts in the highway tax distribution fund, requiring that special fuels excise taxes collected on sales of diesel fuels to a railroad, in the amount of up to $275,000 per year, must be deposited in the rail safety fund. The bill limits deposits into the rail safety fund to a portion of collections received after June 30, 2015, and before July 1, 2019. EMERGENCY SERVICES COMMUNICATION FEES Senate Bill No. 2101 revises the definition of an emergency services communication system to clarify that it is composed of two systems, the \"911 system\" and the \"radio system,\" and defines those systems.

House Bill No. 1060 allows the Tax Commissioner to share confidential sales, use, and income tax information with the Department of Commerce for the purpose of evaluating tax incentives. The bill provides for safeguards in restricting the use and further disclosure of that information by the Department of Commerce. Senate Bill No. 2115 allows the Tax Commissioner to accept a reduced amount of tax for purposes of legal settlements of final and nonreviewable tax assessments if information is received from the taxpayer that the assessed amount of tax exceeds the actual amount due. The bill also allows the Tax Commissioner to assess tax in addition to the amount stated in the final and nonreviewable assessment if the Tax Commissioner receives information that the tax was under -assessed.

The bill requires the Director of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation to disclose the reason for a denial or revocation of a concealed weapons permit. The bill removes the requirement that a National Firearms Act licensee provide a copy of the license to the county sheriff and the Director of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation within five days of receipt of the forms.
