The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus, named as SARS-CoV-2, as a global pandemic in early 2020 after the disease spread to more than 180 countries leading to tens of thousands of cases and many deaths within a couple of months. Consequently, this paper aims to summarize the evidence for the relationships between nutrition and the boosting of the immune system in the fight against the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. This review, in particular, assesses the impact of vitamin and mineral supplements on the body's defence mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2. The results revealed that there is a strong relationship between the ingestion of biological ingredients like vitamins C-E, and minerals such as zinc, and a reduction in the effects of coronavirus infection. These can be received from either nutrition rich food sources or from vitamin supplements. Furthermore, these macromolecules might have roles to play in boosting the immune response, in the healing process and the recovery time. Hence, we recommend that eating healthy foods rich in vitamins C-E with zinc and flavonoids could boost the immune system and consequently protect the body from serious infections. Inflammopharmacology Revista Brasileira de Farmacognosia Biological Trace Element Research Bio-Design and Manufacturing There is a pressing need for effective therapeutics for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The process of drug development is a costly and meticulously paced process, where progress is often hindered by the failure of initially promising leads. To aid this challenge, in vitro human microphysiological systems need to be refined and adapted for mechanistic studies and drug screening, thereby saving valuable time and resources during a pandemic crisis. The SARS-CoV-2 virus attacks the lung, an organ where the unique three-dimensional (3D) structure of its functional units is critical for proper respiratory function. The in vitro lung models essentially recapitulate the distinct tissue structure and the dynamic mechanical and biological interactions between different cell types. Current model systems include Transwell, organoid and organ-on-a-chip or microphysiological systems (MPSs).... Journal of Polymers and the Environment Advances in Traditional Medicine Environmental Chemistry Letters Molecular Neurobiology Immunologic Research Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic and is the cause of increased mortality, especially among elderly patients and those who have severe complications, such as chronic pulmonary obstruction, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. Nutrition, especially micronutrients, plays an important role in reducing mortality and complications from COVID-19 because micronutrients strengthen our immune system and nutritional status is an important factor that affects the outcome of patients with COVID-19. Among micronutrients, selenium has an important effect on both intrinsic and acquired immunity. Host selenium deficiency affects the viral genome and increases the virulence of viruses. We have investigated the serum selenium levels in COVID-19 patients and healthy control individuals. Methods A total of 50 patients with COVID-19 infection were included in this study. During hospitalization, 13 patients died (non-survivor group) and 37 patients recovered (survivor group). We assessed the serum selenium levels in 50 COVID-19 patients and 50 healthy individuals by Agilent SpectrAA-240 Z atomic absorption spectrometer. Results The serum selenium level was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients (77. 8 \u00b1 13.9 g/L) as compared to healthy control individuals (91.7 \u00b1 16.7 g/L), but there was no significant difference between the survivor and non-survivor groups. Also, there was no significant relationship between serum selenium levels and laboratory findings of COVID-19 patients. Conclusions These results suggest that decreased serum selenium levels may be a risk factor for the COVID-19 infection, but there was no significant relationship between selenium and severity and mortality of COVID-19 disease.
