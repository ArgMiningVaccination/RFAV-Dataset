Errata to:The therapeutic value (TV: the ratio benefit to harm) of holistic medicine is 1,000,000,000 times larger than the therapeutic value of pharmaceutical drugs for cancer, coronary heart disorder, depression and schizophrenia. Errata: There is an error in the calculation here, but the result is correct. NNTtotal for holistic medicine is 0.1, not 10. It comes from 80% of patients getting cured physically (NNT=1) and at the same time getting 10 other positive, clinically relevant effects, like happiness, improved mental health and improved sexual functioning (therefore NNTtotal=1:10=0.01). The Therapeutic Value of holistic medicine is then calculated: TV(holistic medicine)=NNHtotal/NNTtotal=1,000,000/0.1=10,000,000. Then the ratio TV(holistic medicine)/TV(drugs)=10,000,000 /0.01=1,000.000.000 The result is thus correct. The authors. Competing interests: No competing interests The therapeutic value (TV: the ratio benefit to harm) of holistic medicine is 1,000,000,000 times larger than the therapeutic value of pharmaceutical drugs for cancer, coronary heart disorder, depression and schizophrenia. It is easy to see where medicine \"I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy is just two different forms of the same thing.\" Dean Ornish, MD The success rate in medicine is often expressed as Number Needed to Treat (NNT): How many patients do I as a physician need to treat for one patient to reach the treatment goal? In the same way, the risk of harm is expressed as the Number Needed to treat to Harm: How many patients will I need to treat for one to have this adverse effect or event? In medicine two things are interesting for patients: Efficacy and harm. A treatment must be efficient to be interesting. It must be likely to help. If the change of being helped is below 50%, say 20% or 5% or 1%, the treatment is not very attractive, for then it is not very likely that I get better. Patients are therefore very sat to learn that the normal NNT -number for pharmaceutical drugs is about 20 (1), meaning that only 5% of patients are helped. And this is according to the pharmaceutical industry. If you ask the Cochrane researchers the NNT-numbers are more likely to be 50 or 100 (2). But even more important is harm, and especially the ratio benefit to harm - which we often call Therapeutic Value (3,4). It can be expressed as NNH/NNT, or more correctly, NNHtotal/NNTtotal, where NNHtotal expresses the total likelihood to be harmed (experience a adverse effect or event), and NNTtotal in the same way expresses the total likelihood to get clinical benefit. Most drugs have one positive effect and 10, 20 or more adverse effects with NNHs of 2-50, and NNTtota of 1-3 (3). The therapeutic value TV of drugs are often 1 or less. For the major physical and mental illnesses like cancer, heart disease, depression and schizophrenia the NNTtotal is about 100 while NNHtotal is about 1, giving a TV=0.01 (2,3,11,12,13). How efficient is holistic medicine? Dean Ornish clinical studies have documented that about 80% of patients with coronary heart stenosis or prostate cancer get clinically well after interventions on life-style and the level of intimacy they practice (long term results). You can hear him say the following on YouTube: \"Anything that promote intimacy is healing\" and \"I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy is just two different forms of the same thing\" (14). Ornish believes that love and intimacy and emotional openness is the way to healing. As do most holistic doctors. Ornish is treating patients with the most severe physical disorders and he is doing this with a NNT of 1. Often NNTs of holistic medicine (holistic mind body medicine i.e. CHM) is 1 or 2 short term, and 1 long term (15,16). Holistic medicine is so efficient that it heals and cures most patients. But the positive effects do not stop here. When non-drug medicine works it improves all aspects of existence. When we measure the effects of holistic medicine it has at least 10 important, clinically relevant, positive effects (5,6,7,8). The patient goes for improving one aspect of life, but end up with a complete new life. The central healing (salutogenic) principle of holistic medicine has ever since Hippocrates been to learn to love yourself more and understand yourself better (17). Self-insight is the essence of the cure, and through this you will also improve all other aspects of health, quality of life and ability (social, sexual, work-related, study-related), as well as your personal relations with yourself, your partner, your friends etc. It is amazing that holistic medicine heals the whole person and everything related to him or her! Compared to this pharmaceutical drugs almost always address one aspects of one organ or function, and the aim is rarely healing but most of the time only improvement of symptoms. Often surrogate outcome measures are used with modest correlation to the clinical outcome if interest. In this way a positive effect of drugs can be documented even when it hardly has any clinical significance to the patient (18)! We could fairly have divided NNTs from drug trials with 10 on this account but we will not do that. We just set NNTtotal=10 for holistic medicine. At the same time research has documented touch and talk therapy to be almost without side effects; less than one in a million gets hurt by massage therapy and gentle physical touch according to the NCCAM (9), and mind-body medicine which also includes talk therapy is similar harmless (10). Therefore we set NNH and NNHtotal to >1,000,000 (4). With NNHtotals of 1,000,000 and NNTtotals of 10 the TV of holistic medicine is NNHtotal/NNTtotal=10,000,000. TV for drugs for the serious clinical conditions was 0.01. This means that the therapeutic value (TV) of holistic medicine is about 1,000,000,000 times larger than the therapeutic value of drugs for the severe mental and physical diseases. One billion times is a lot. It is so much that one starts to wonder what is happening in medicine. Well, when you think about it this is quite obvious: Love and healing has been replaced with drugs and money. Medicine has gone astray (19). BMJ deputy editor Trish Grovesis talking about \"evidence-debased medicine\" (20). We think it is time to take it a step further. Instead of evidence- based medicine we have got \"industry-based medicine\". This is what has gone wrong in medicine. And this is what we need to change. And we need to change it right now.

A review of metaanalyses and reviews of positive effect, adverse effects, and therapeutic value of whole groups of pharmaceutical drugs. To answer the question: \"Which types of drugs can be used in evidence -based medicine?\" we have made a review of metaanalyses and reviews of positive effects and therapeutic value of whole groups of pharmaceutical drugs. METHOD We have searched MedLine ( [www.PubMed.gov](http://www.PubMed.gov)) and journals of alternative medicine often having critical reviews not listed in MedLine, and we have included PhD dissertations and doctoral theses in the search. We found 7 metaanalyses and 4 reviews of whole groups of drugs. The search process was difficult as the concept \"drug group\" or similar high-level concepts were not commonly used, combined with the enormous number of articles and dissertations (over 20 millions), and compared to this we had limited resources for the study. It is therefore very likely that several relevant meta-analyses and reviews have been excluded. To compensate for that we also used the Danish Drug Directory \"Medicin.dk\" (1), giving highest priority to meta-analyses, then priority to reviews and finally lowest priority to the drug directory as this is mostly build on single industrial RCTs (2). RESULTS Table 1 shows the drug groups that we found general reviews and metaanalyses of. For all drugs, except contraceptives, we found serous methodological problems in the testing (3,4). Most RCTs did not use the proper type of placebo, which is active placebo, needed when the drug has a well-defined toxic effect. Many RCTs did not include the induction of \"spontaneous\" dead known to be caused by a wide range of pharmacological drugs (5,6). The problem of not using active placebo is that a harmful effect of the drug appears as a positive effect in the RCT (6,7,8). In general the outcomes were not clinically relevant but only week surrogate outcome measures (resorption of calcium to bones is a poor indicator of bone strength so number of fractures should have been used; blood pressure is a poor predictor of stroke so stroke rate should have been used etc., see (9)), and the adverse effects were only registered short term, while most adverse effects appears after long term use (see 3). The NNT was not based on healing of patients diseases but almost always on small clinical improvements, giving a wrong impression of low NNT-numbers (3). Even in the best of the studies many adverse effects were not included in the RCTs, like the well-known loss of sexual desire from many hormonal contraceptives (10). We found anti-depressant drugs to be almost without effect in one metaanalysis (11) and completely without antidepressant effect in another correction for the use of the wrong type of placebo in the RCTs (in the Cochrane review one study was removed to secure homogeneity and after the exclusion of this study antidepressant drugs were not better than active placebo (8). As there seems to be general agreement about the need for active placebo in such studies (7) the latter analysis is more correct. Antipsychotic drugs did not improve mental state (mental health) but did sedate the patients (reduce \"hallucinogenic behaviour\"); the outcome \"global impression is a mix of these two and behaved accordingly; new drugs were not more efficient or less harmful than Chlorpromazine (12). A large metaanalyses of anti-cancer chemotherapy was found for epitheloid cancers meaning all common cancers, and it showed systematically that anti -cancer chemotherapy did not improve quality of life or survival; as adverse effect were shorter survival and destruction of quality of life (13). As some of the analyses were quite old we repeated them (14,15), but we found the same results again. For NSAIDs we found a Danish doctoral dissertation showing no effect of the group of drugs (16). Metaanalyses of anti-resoptive (17) and anti-hypertentive (18) drugs shows little effect on clinically relevant outcomes; many studies only used indirect measures with low correlation to the actual clinical problem. While there seem to be some effect of these drugs the NNT numbers are still so high and the NNH and NNHtotal numbers so low that the therapeutic value is much less than one, which means that the drugs are likely to course more harm than benefit for the patients. For anti asthma corticosteroids, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines, anti-cholinergic drugs, anti-AIDS retroviral drugs, hypnotics, sedatives and contraceptives we found fair therapeutic effect but still massive methodological problems (except for contraceptives where only one major adverse effect in general was missing) (see table 1 for references). Table 1: Effect, adverse effects, and Therapeutic Value (TV) of major pharmacological drug groups, listed according to Therapeutic Value (calculated as TV=NNHtotal/NNT). (NNT: Number Needed to Treat; NNH: Number Needed to treat to Harm; NNHtotal: The total likelihood to get one or more adverse effect or event, expressed as NNH) DISCUSSION Many classes of drugs are not included in this analysis due to lack of data. We noticed the pattern that when large meta-analysis was made including all studies of all drugs in a drug-group, and including also unpublished data of negative findings, the drug-type often was found to be ineffective and harmful. Most of the drug types in table 1 that came out as efficient and fairly safe drugs have not been that thoroughly tested, leaving the possibility that higher quality meta-analyses will document less efficacy and more harm. Also, almost all the studies suffer from rather severe methodological problems, because of the many problems associated with the RTC-test (3,8,11).

Rough estimates for all clinical conditions based on Cochrane reviews and the ratio: Number Needed to Harm/Number Needed to Treat (TV=NNHtotal/NNT). BMJ-deputy editor Trish Groves writes about the great problems related to medical evidence, putting the whole project of evidence-based medicine in danger (1). But it is mainly drug-medicine which is endangered by the problems mentioned by Groves. Non-drug medicine can also be evidence-based, and because of the limited financial interests in non-drug medicine these studies might suffer less from bias. Non-drug medicine is often documented with the before-and-after design, using (chronic and stable) patients as their own control, which is a design that is much more difficult to manipulate than the RCT-test (2). Therapeutic value of non-drug CAM treatments In the US a \"Committee on the Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine by the American Public\" has reviewed all Cochrane meta-analyses of CAM (3). This independent research group found 145 alternative medicine Cochrane reviews, and the study found that 38.4% of the CAM-Cochrane reviews concluded positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%) effect, 4.8% concluded no effect, 0.69% concluded harmful effect, and 56.6% concluded insufficient evidence. The group concluded that CAM is very safe for the patients and that CAM often is effective. Typical CAM NNTs found in the Cochrane reviews with active treatments were 2-10, while a typical CAM NNHtotal were >1000. Thus TV=NNHtotal/NNT=100-500. Compared with the TV of drugs of one at best (NNHtotal/NNT<1 as NNT of drugs is often about 20 (4)), CAM is doing fine in such an analysis. The 145 Cochrane reviews documented all together that out of hundreds of thousands of CAM patients very few CAM patients were harmed (some got fractures from chiropractic treatment, some got allergy from strongly aromatic, herbal treatments and some got symptoms from radical changes in diet). Taken all together the 145 Cochrane metaanalyses showed a NNHtotal>1.000 for CAM in general, with lots of CAM treatment not being very efficient (NNT=10) or undocumented, but still giving TV=NNHtotal/NNT>1000/10=100. The extreme safety and fair efficacy of CAM justifies the high and increasing popularity of CAM with the patients (3). As there is only little commercial interest in CAM, most CAM- treatments are still not sufficiently documented, as the study showed. And CAM-research is not easy; CAM research has often been obstructed, and CAM- researchers severely discredited, by people and organizations close to the pharmaceutical industry (5), as could be expected from the conflict of financial interests coming from more and more patients choosing CAM and wishing to avoid drugs. Therapeutic value of Clinical Holistic Medicine (CHM) Another problem is that there are so many different types of CAM that it is difficult to talk about the effects of CAM in general (3). We have made a review of the positive effects (6) and a meta-analysis of the negative effects (6,7) of holistic mind-body medicine, (clinical holistic medicine, CHM). We believe this type of holistic treatment to be among the most efficient CAM methods, and as it mainly intents to improve quality of life it is also useful for most clinical conditions (8). It's practiced as a combination of therapeutic talk (STPP) and therapeutic touch (healing massage). We found NNT=2 for physical and mental diseases and symptoms like chronic pain and depression, NNT=2 for low self-esteem, existential problems and low quality of life, and NNT=1 for most sexual dysfunctions (6,7,8). In the metaanalysis we found NNHtotal=18,500. From this we calculated the therapeutic value TV=NNHtotal/NNT=18,500/2=9,250 (6). DISCUSSION Physicians and health politicians need to be wise and understand how the world works around medicine. Strong commercial interests will always give bias in research and the pharmaceutical industry also has a strong political influence and commercial power to market their findings (2). It is hardly a coincidence that we found that the information about pharmaceutical drugs in the official Danish drug directory (Medicin.dk) mostly came from the pharmaceutical industry's own drug trials while the information from the Cochrane reviews almost never were found here (9). While we definitely needs drugs like antibiotics in medicine, we cannot hope to keep a population healthy with treatments for mental illnesses and cancer that only cure or help one patient in 20, 50 or 100, and harm one in three or even more (2,4). The drugs simply don't work (4); they won't do that for us. This is why populations with nationalized biomedicine like Denmark have about 50% of its populations chronically ill now (10). (You think we are happy in Denmark? Well, we are! But according to the official statistics we are not healthy.) CAM as we know it today from the many Cochrane reviews is often undocumented or inefficient, but at least CAM is found to be safe for the patients. We believe that some types of CAM like holistic mind-body medicine is much more efficient than other types of CAM, like herbal treatments. We are very impressed by studies from USA showing that coronary heart disease can be effectively cured by holistic medicine (NNT=2) seemingly without side-effects (3,6,7,8). This is where we think medicine should go in the future. Therapeutic Value (TV) is not a perfect measure; it can never be more than a rough indicator. When TV of a CAM treatment is 100, 1000 or 10.000 times as large as the TV of a treatment of the same clinical condition with a drug (TV<1), this should make us think. Maybe CAM is really the treatment of choice for most clinical conditions? We know that most physicians today are trained to prescribe biomedicine and would have difficulties if they suddenly were expected to provide healing touch and existential conversations instead. The future generations of physicians - and this goes for all the medical students of the world - should be trained to use the most efficient and safe types of CAM to heal and help their patients. CONCLUSIONS In the future it will not be enough for a physician just to prescribe drugs with NNTs of 20, 50 or 100, and NNHs of 3, 2 or 1. In the future patients will be better informed and they will want more from their doctor. They will want a medicine that is likely to cure them. CAM has a TV which is often 100 times higher than TV of drugs. For some clinical conditions like acute infections future medicine might still be an antibiotic drug, but for most clinical conditions the medicine that cures patients in the future is likely to be a non-drug medicine (CAM). Dean Ornish's highly effective and well-documented non-drug cure for coronary heart disorder is such a treatment of the future (11,12).

Rough estimates for all clinical conditions based on Cochrane reviews and the ratio: Number Needed to Harm/Number Needed to Treat (TV=NNHtotal/NNT). BMJ-deputy editor Trish Groves writes about the great problems related to medical evidence, putting the whole project of evidence-based medicine in danger (1). Bias in pharmaceutical studies have been known for a long time, as the randomised clinical trial (RCT) is very easy to manipulate, to make a drug treatment look better and safer (2). Treatment efficacy can in general be expressed as NNT: Number [of patients] Needed to Treat [for one to reach the treatment goal], and treatment harm can be expressed as NNH: Number [of patients] Needed to treat to Harm [one patient with a specific side/adverse effect]. Mostly pharmaceutical drugs have one positive outcome and a number of adverse effects, so the total likelihood to get one adverse effect can be calculated from the list of adverse effects taking the specific likelihood for each adverse effect. We call this total likelihood for getting one adverse effect for NNHtotal (3). The ratio benefit to harm can thus be calculated as TV=NNHtotal/NNT. Obviously NNHtotal/NNT is a fairly rough estimate of the therapeutic value (TV) of a treatment as beneficial effects and mortal and insignificant adverse effects are all attributed equal importance. But this is not as meaningless as it might look for a first glance, for in most industrial RCTs the treatment goal is not a cured patient, but only a clinically significant improvement (often the smallest improvement you can argue has clinical significance, or an indicator of such an improvement (4)), and adverse effects are only included and counted when they are found clinically significant to the patient. So for practical reasons - the pharmaceutical industry trying to maximize NNT and minimize NNH - this measure of therapeutic effect ends up pretty meaningful after all. Therapeutic value of pharmaceutical drugs To estimate the size of the Therapeutic Value (TV) for a pharmaceutical drug you need to know the NNT and NNHtotal(3). These numbers are easily collected from Cochrane reviews when such exists listing all the positive and negative effects and the likelihood for a patient to get them. It is worth noticing that while the industrial trials often give a NNT of 5, 10 or 20 for a drug (5), the Cochrane reviews of a single drug often give NNTs of 20 or 50 (6), while the meta-analyses of whole groups of drugs often give NNT of 100 or more, as we recently have seen it for the outcome \"improvement of mental state\" (mental health) for the whole group of antipsychotic drugs (7) and the whole group of antidepressant drugs (8). It's a paradox that the pharmaceutical companies again and again find their new drugs to be efficient and relatively safe, while independent meta-analyses later again and again document whole classes of drugs to be of modest value for the patients, and harmful. It is also sad that such thorough analyses often have little impact on our medical reality, as the drugs often just continues to be used, in spite of meta-analyses concluding that the drugs are of little therapeutic value if any, as we saw it with Abel's famous study of anticancer chemotherapy 20 years ago (9). Able concluded that anti-cancer chemotherapy when compared to no treatment, for most types of cancer shortened life and destroyed quality of life. In the history of medicine the commercial interests have often trumped science, and we need to learn from that so we can make medicine more rational in the future. Typical values of NNT, NNHtotal and TV for some drug groups are listed in Table 1. Table 1: Typical values of NNT, NNHtotal and (Therapeutic Value TV= NNHtotal//NNT) for pharmaceutical drug (single drugs and drug-groups) (Typical numbers from industrial trials, Typical numbers from independent analyses of single drugs and Typical numbers from independent analyses of whole groups of drugs). The NNT and NNH numbers from the pharmaceutical industry's RCT tests are often of such a size that one safely can argue that the benefits might be worth the risk (TV?1); the numbers from independent metaanalysis of the same drugs often makes this unlikely to be the case, as a typical ratio of benefit/risk here is only about 2:20 (TV?0.1) (6). If you go to the metaanalyses of the whole drug-group you sometimes see that practically all effect is lost while the drugs are likely to harm almost all patients (TV<0.01) (7,8,9). DISCUSSION Some drug-groups seem to \"pass\" the tough test of the high level metaanalysis, like the antibiotics, while other drug-groups \"fail\" the test, like the antidepressants (8), the anti-psychotics (outcome: mental state) (7) and anti-cancer chemotherapy (9) (see Table 1). The rule is that the more data that is included in a study and the more rigid the protocol of the analysis is, the smaller is the treatment effect and the larger is the harm. The reason for this effect is easy to understand: just think of inducing bias with the selection of small (appropriate) samples and with test-methods you can influence to get the result you want (1,2). If the patients were informed that the risk of being harmed is about 100% and the likelihood of gaining a benefit is below 1% they would probably not choose such a treatment. CONCLUSIONS In general pharmaceutical drugs have a therapeutic value TV=NNHtotal/NNT=0.67-0.01.The future of pharmaceutical medicine will be determined by which source of information we accept as valid. If we accept the data coming from Cochrane metaanalyses and similar independent research institutions, most drugs in use today will not be used in the future as their therapeutic value is too modest (TV= NNHtotal/NNT=0.1- 0.01).

Isn't it about time that such biased information was excluded from a reputable journal? Competing interests: No competing interests The caption of this response is one of the many brilliant sayings of that great brain, Sir William Osler. In the twenty first century, I could only echo that great sentiment as a truism, despite all the tall talk about the \"so called\" evidence based medicine. Napoleon Bonaparte went one step further, but one could ague that he was not a physician. Napolean was at the receiving end of such a medical practice in Persia where he died. \"Medicine is a collection of uncertain prescriptions the results of which, taken collectively, are more fatal than useful to mankind.\" Napoleon, though, was more accurate scientifically today. Latest science says that uncertainty is the only certainty in the world. This is truer in medical science, if there is one. A proverb is a short sentence based on long experience. If that were so, this one from Voltaire takes the cake: \"The art of medicine consists in amusing the patient while nature cures the disease.\" Time and again I had written in responses to the journal as also in my articles elsewhere that our evidence base has been built on loose sand. ( [www.plosmedicine.org/annotation/listThread.action-](http://www.plosmedicine.org/annotation/listThread.action-) ) [www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b1272.extract/reply](http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b1272.extract/reply)) Of course, no one seems to take it seriously. They would have, if it had any financial interest behind it. The present RCTs and linear relations help generate billions of dollars in chemical therapeutics even if that results in thousands dying of our efforts directly or indirectly. (search.barnesandnoble.com/Death-by -Medicine/Gary-Null/.../9781607660026) This morning I had a message from one of my old students who is a leading dermatologist in India doing innovative research in his area. \"I always wondered when I used to listen to you during my student days and respected your views all along. In dermatology evidence is found only in 28% of published studies. All molecular biology companies come with an offer to give authorship if we buy their equipment for our lab! Doesn't that mean that most molecular biology studies are prototype and try to find out how what is known fits into their study?\" Foundations of our evidence in modern medicine like the statistical risk calculations, (especially the relative risk reductions in place of absolute risk reductions that are sold to gullible doctors in most of the \"scientific\" articles without mentioning the NNT figures) and, the RCTs, which have no true science base, are very shaky indeed. We need to have a new science of man, which is sadly missing in this whole bargain. Physics changed in 1925 and there is no more physics, but we still use the same old physics laws for our statistics. Matter is not made up of matter. Matter and energy are interchangeable. (journalofcosmology.com/QuantumConsciousness106.html) Human molecules communicate with one another which can now be documented through the photon lights emitted from each DNA. What is the science base of our reductionism, organ based specialization and our reliance on Mendelian inheritance? Instead of trying to rehash the existing evidence base it is better to think of a new evidence base for health and illness. Health is a state where each human body cell is in sync with other cells. Illness is when this communication breaks down. (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophoton) We need a new non- linear, holistic, dynamic, scientific base for future medical research. Nature has provided a robust repair mechanism inside the human system which has been weakened by our modern life style. Even though both Claude Bernard and Louis Pasteur did note that the \"terrain is more important than the seed\" we have gone whole hog on the seed, risk factors, and what have you. Modern medicine has forgotten the essence of illness care which is basically to strengthen the terrain. Yours ever, bmhegde Competing interests: No competing interests After about 30 years medical practice at the front (direct patient contact) I felt a bit lost in understanding new published papers, how data were produced and used. Thus, I have started and completed an online course Translational Medicine as I thought -and have been proven right- that this is a possibility to catch up with new methods of research and science, and how this finds its way into clinical use. I was proven to be rather naive as I wondered how it could be seen as a highly praised success that in Scotland ALL universities doing Translational Research were co-funded by Pfizer (former Wyeth). Every research suggestion/idea is first to be sent to Pfizer.( [www.tmrc.co.uk](http://www.tmrc.co.uk)) I, in obvious minority, doubted that this is good for science, research, public and patients, and the development of useful and affordable remedies. When medical research in its earliest roots is industry funded and controlled what can you expect? So, I think the question of trust in medical science has become/ is a political one, too. Competing interests: passed certificate Translational Medicine at the University of Edinburgh with the recommendation not to study further on, supporter of the Marshall Protocol The use of relative risk and selective or distorted reporting of data is part of a wider problem of misinterpretation of scientific findings. For example, the way 'specificity' is measured and interpreted can be very misleading. If 'guarding' occurs in 20/100 = 0.2 of patients without appendicitis admitted to a surgical ward in a fixed time then its 'specificity' would be 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. However, if guarding occurs in 20/1000 of patients without appendicitis admitted to the same hospital in the same time interval, the 'specificity' is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98. The 'specificity' can thus be changed dramatically by merely increasing the size of the study population. The likelihood ratio is also exaggerated by this of course. If the frequency of guarding in appendicitis was 80% then the likelihood ratio from a study on the ward would be 0.8 / 0.2 = 4. However the likelihood ratio for the hospital population would be 0.8 / 0.02 = 40. The problem is that 'specificity' and 'likelihood ratio' should only be used as a measure of a test's ability to screen for a diagnosis in a well defined asymptomatic population and not for clinical differential diagnosis. The appropriate index for differential diagnosis in the clinical setting is the ratio of sensitivities. For example, an important differential diagnosis in patients with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain is 'non-specific abdominal pain' (NSAP). If guarding occurs in 80% of those with appendicitis but only 4% of patients with NSAP then the sensitivity ratio is 80/4 = 20. The combination of RLQ pain and guarding makes the diagnosis of appendicitis more probable and NSAP less probable [1]. There are other serious blocks for practicing intelligent, genuinely evidence based medicine in a cost-effective way. For example we do not provide evidence for the choice of gold standard tests, we do not provide evidence for the use of the best treatment selection criteria and their cut-off points and we do not provide evidence for the findings that provide the best differential diagnoses [1]. Finally, we should combine P values and confidence intervals in an explicit way with information about the study methods, other study results, etc in order to estimate the probability of replicating the result if we repeated the study according to our own standards. 1.
