Both perspectives are valid. Securing patient loyalty is a critical revenue opportunity for hospitals and health systems in increasingly competitive markets. At the same time, physicians' limited capacity to take on additive patient experience initiatives can make it difficult for CMOs to engage them in system -wide experience efforts. Reaching a point of diminishing HCAHPS returns There is one key point of agreement between executive teams and frontline physicians: HCAHPS is an insufficient measure of patient experience. First, the physician -specific HCAHPS domain1is too narrowly focused on communication \u2014a necessary but incomplete measure of overall experience. Second, from a national perspective, physicians consistently perform well on HCAHPS. Narrow opportunity to improve national physician HCAHPS performance The narrowing bell curve for national HCAHPS performance indicates that focusing on physician communication alone is not enough to engage physicians in patient experience efforts and inspire transformational change. Rather, the greatest opportunity for hospitals and health systems to mobilize physicians and improve the patient experience is to look beyond HCAHPS. 1)The three HCAHPS questions that address physician communication specifically. 2)\"Top box\" defined as patients who responded with \" always\" to all three HCAHPS physician communication questions.

Prioritizing initiatives that correlate to both quality and experience improvements aligns patient experience efforts to physicians' top priority: providing best-in-class clinical care. In theory, nearly all CMOs agree that relinking quality improvement and patient experience efforts is the right thing to do. In practice, it is difficult to identify strategies that drive both quality and experience. Delivering on a quality -driven patient experience requires two layers of prioritization: 1.Identify initiatives that correlate with both quality and patient experience improvement. Polychronic patients Definition: A patient with three or more chronic conditions, one of which significantly impacts quality of life Top opportunity to improve both quality and patient experience : Proactively identify chronically ill patients and their needs \u2014and match them to tailored interventions In this brief, we outline five tactics to simultaneously improve quality and experience for polychronic patients during and after their hospital stay. advisory.com 6 \u00a9 2019 Advisory Board All rights reserved WF1431673Source: \"The Cost of Chronic Diseases in the US,\" Milken 2017, https://assets1c.milkeninstitute.org/assets/Publication/Viewpoint/PDF/Chronic -Disease- Executive- Summary Muth, et al., \" Prioritising and optimising multiple medications in elderly multi -morbid patients in general practice. -A pragmatic cluster -randomised controlled ; S Cohen and D Meyers, \"Trends in health care costs and the concentration of medical expenditures,\" PowerPoint presentation to the National Advisory Council, A gency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2012; C Fung, et al., \"The relationship between multimorbidity and patients' ratings of communication,\" J Gen Intern Med, 23, no. 6 (2008), https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517863/ ; M Mihailoff , et al., \"The Effects of Multiple Chronic Conditions on Adult Patient Readmissions and Hospital Finances: A Management Case Study,\" Inquiry, 54, 2017, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5798680/ ; Physician Executive Council interviews and analysis .Introduction Hospitals and health systems increasingly encounter polychronic patients, individuals with three or more chronic conditions. Projections show that the polychronic patient population will grow significantly \u2014nearly tripling in the next 15 years. 1)Based on study of Medicare and Medicaid patients at a general hospital in a rural area of Virginia, 2010- 2015, by M Mihailoff , et al. 2)Length of stay. Polychronic population is a growing national challenge Prevalence of US adults with three or more chronic conditions 2015-2030 30.8 M83.4 M 2015 2030 Hospitals often struggle to address polychronic patients' complex clinical and non -clinical needs during a single hospital stay. As a result, these patients often have extended inpatient stays and high readmission rates.

This report outlines two strategies that hospitals and health systems can use to simultaneously improve experience and quality outcomes for polychronic patients. Address commonly overlooked barriers to care The first strategy is to proactively screen polychronic patients for commonly overlooked clinical and non-clinical barriers to care. The second strategy is to expand inpatient -level support beyond the hospital's walls. More specifically, shifting acute care services to patients' homes to reduce readmissions, decrease length of stay, and improve patient outcomes. Two strategies to improve quality and experience for polychronic patients 2Extend acute care services beyond the inpatient setting Tactic 4: Flipped discharge Tactic 5: Hospital at home Tactic 1: Mortality risk screen Tactic 2: Patient Activation Measure (PAM) Tactic 3: Health system gold card Use action -oriented screenings to address overlooked barriers to care1 Source: Physician Executive Council interviews and analysis. advisory.com 8 \u00a9 2019 Advisory Board All rights reserved WF1431673Tactic in brief Calculate a 30- day mortality risk score before admitting emergency department (ED) patients to an inpatient unit. Link the mortality risk score to bundled interventions to ensure patients with the highest mortality risk proactively \u2014and consistently \u2014receive essential services that might otherwise go overlooked . Rationale Clinicians typically focus on patient acuity when admitting patients from the ED. However, acuity does not account for all mortality risk factors, leaving clinicians at risk of overlooking support that could improve clinical outcomes and reduce length of stay. Screening patients for mortality risk before admission ensures that clinicians proactively elevate support throughout a patient's hospital stay. Implementation components: Component 1: Calculate a mortality risk score for all ED patients at the decision to admit At the decision to admit, the ED physician completes an electronic questionnaire, which generates a patient's mortality risk score. The mortality risk score is a validated model that predicts a patient's likelihood of dying in the next 30 days on a scale of level 1 (highest mortality risk) to level 5 (lowest mortality risk). Component 2: Prioritize bed placement and hospitalist consult for patients at high risk of mortality Staff place patients with high -mortality risk on a unit with a high nurse -to-patient ratio (e.g., intermediate units, ICU). Hospitalists complete an initial consult for level 1 patients within 15 minutes of their arrival on the unit. Component 3: Deliver a standard bundle of interventions to patients at high risk of mortality A level 1 score initiates a standard bundle of interventions, regardless of diagnosis. The bundle includes rapid response team rounding , case manager screen, nutrition consult, palliative care consult, pharmacy services, and elevated discharge support. Tactic assessment This tactic requires an up-front investment to build the 30- day risk score into your health IT system. Once the digital infrastructure is in place, this tactic improves efficiency because it prioritizes clinician support for the most at -risk patients, saving clinician time and organizational resources.

Tactic 1: Mortality risk screen advisory.com 9 \u00a9 2019 Advisory Board All rights reserved WF1431673Component 1: Calculate a mortality risk score for all ED patients at the decision to admit Leaders at St. Joseph Mercy, a five -hospital health system in Michigan, noticed that some patients presenting with a low -acuity condition were actually at a high risk of mortality. As a result, these patients failed to receive necessary interventions until an underlying condition surfaced later in their stay. To identify high- mortality risk patients early, St. Joseph Mercy developed a validated model to screen patients for mortality risk at the decision to admission. When a patient registers at a St. Joseph Mercy ED, the health information system auto -populates a mortality risk questionnaire with current and past patient data. If an ED physician decides to admit a patient, he or she completes additional yes/no prompts in the questionnaire to generate a mortality risk score. On average, it takes the ED physician only 20 seconds to complete the prompts. The resulting mortality risk score calculates the likelihood of the patient dying within 30 days. Level 1 is the highest mortality risk, and level 5 is the lowest mortality risk. St. Joseph Mercy found that only 10% to 15% of patients receive a level 1 mortality score.

Hospital staff place level 1 patients in a unit with high nurse staffing to ensure they receive appropriate attention. Because so few patients receive a level 1 score (10% to 15%), hospitalists are able to prioritize them. Hospitalists round on level 1 patients within 15 minutes of bed placement, with many hospitalists opting to meet the patients in the ED for a warm handoff. Fast-tracking the initial hospitalist consult for level 1 patients enables the rest of the clinical team to initiate treatment as soon as possible.

When a patient receives a level 1 score, clinicians launch a bundle of time- bound interventions to ensure nothing falls through the cracks. For example, St. Joseph Mercy's CMO decided to make palliative care consults an opt -out rather than opt-in intervention for all level 1 patients. This change encourages hospitalists to consistently order consults to engage level 1 patients in shared decision -making about symptom management and end - of-life care.

For example, St . Joseph Mercy's Ann Arbor ED observed a 21% decrease in unplanned transfers from the ICU within the first 24 hours of admissions after using the mortality risk score to inform bed placement. Additionally, Ann Arbor experienced a 34% improvement in communication about medications for level 1 and level 2 patients after implementation.

Care plans for patients with a high activation level focus on behavior change, while care plans for patients with a low activation level focus on fundamental education. The goal is to proactively uncover a patient's barriers to self -management and elevate support accordingly . Rationale Clinicians often overlook patient activation as a factor that can drive non-adherence to care plans and poor clinical outcomes. Using a patient's activation level to tailor their care plan can increase adherence and can improve patient experience and quality of life. Implementation components: Component 1: Survey patients using the Patient Activation Measure The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) asks patients to indicate their level of agreement with 13 statements. The results place patients into one of four activation levels; from level 1 (disengaged, overwhelmed, and passive) to level 4 (stays on course, even under stress). Component 2: Tailor patients' care plans to match their activation levels Clinicians use a patient's PAM level to incorporate patient education and health care self-management steps into the care plan. For example, a clinician may discuss general healthy lifestyle behaviors with a level 2 patient but set concrete behavior goals with a more activated level 3 patient. Tactic assessment This tactic requires a financial investment to license the PAM from Insignia Health. The PAM is the most widely accepted tool to assess a patient's level of engagement. While clinicians traditionally use PAM in the ambulatory setting, health systems can leverage the survey in the inpatient setting to improve patient outcomes and strategically deploy clinician support. Patients engaged through the PAM demonstrate increased medication adherence, patient satisfaction, and self-management. Source: Physician Executive Council interviews and analysis. Tactic 2: Patient Activation Measure (PAM)advisory.com 14 \u00a9 2019 Advisory Board All rights reserved WF1431673Component 1: Survey patients using the Patient Activation Measure The PAM is an evidence -based survey that evaluates a patient's skill, confidence, and willingness to self-manage their health on a 100 -point scale. The score categorizes patients into one of four activation levels, shown below. For example, a level 1 patient might not believe they have a role in their health care, while a level 3 patient might recognize their role in self -management but need support identifying unhealthy lifestyle behaviors.

By administering the PAM and tailoring care plans accordingly, clinicians share the right level of information and recommendations with patients. Over time, the goal is to move patients to higher stages of activation and increase self -management.

Eligible patients receive a physical \"gold card\" to present when they seek medical care at any location within the system. The gold card triggers condition -specific pathways and expedites access to services across the continuum. Rationale Without robust support within and outside of the hospital, patients with chronic conditions struggle to manage their own care and are frequently readmitted. To better support patients with high utilization, health systems must proactively identify these patients and connect them to tailored, cross- continuum resources . Implementation components: Component 1: Enroll eligible patients in health system gold card program Clinical leaders review internal data to identify a subset of patients with a shared chronic condition and high ED and inpatient utilization . Qualifying patients receive a credit card- sized gold card that signals to clinicians in the health system that the patient qualifies for specialized services. Component 2: Create tailored pathways in the ED to elevate care for gold card members Clinical leaders create care pathways to appropriately triage gold card members when they present in the ED. Pathways include: discharge home with robust support, observation stay, admit to inpatient (with the goal of admission as a last resort). Component 3: Provide wraparound support to help gold card members manage care post -discharge Clinicians provide gold card members with a standard set of services that address the clinical and non-clinical challenges of managing their chronic conditions. Wraparound services include: enhanced patient education, transportation arrangements, and easy access to local pharmacies and primary care physicians. Tactic assessment This tactic requires organizations to integrate appropriate clinical protocols into existing workflows and develop partnerships across the continuum of care. Internally, organizations should also provide specialized training for ED staff on how to identify and support the target patient population. We recommend organizations start by piloting the program with one high -priority patient population, before expanding the program to other high- utilization or costly groups. This tactic is best suited for well-coordinated health systems taking on risk. Source: Physician Executive Council interviews and analysis.

They noticed a trend: COPD1patients with 3+ hospitalizations in a 6- month period accounted for a disproportionate amount of readmissions. Additionally, this subset of patients often presented with a variety of comorbidities (CHF,2diabetes, renal failure, etc.). Cone Health's gold card members receive a credit card- sized gold card with a unique identification number in addition to supplementary patient education about their condition.

For example, Cone recognized that anxiety and depression were common drivers of low care plan adherence.

For example, Oschner Health System, in New Orleans, Louisiana, created the Hypertension Digital Medicine Program to better support patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Program enrollees receive an electronic blood pressure device that transmits readings directly to the EHR . Clinicians combine patients' remote blood pressure data, patient -reported data on lifestyle behaviors, and EHR data to tailor patients' care plans without frequent office visits. Today , the Hypertension Digital Medicine Program includes over 3,000 active participants and has demonstrated increased medication adherence, BP1control, and patient satisfaction.

The goal is to provide comprehensive discharge support while transitioning medically cleared patients out of the hospital as soon as possible. Rationale Organizations often struggle to coordinate the clinicians and resources required for a timely discharge and smooth transition home. Consequently, many patients experience delayed discharges or rushed assessments that overlook the day -to-day challenges and environmental risks they face in their homes. By transferring medically stable patients home to conduct discharge steps, organizations can reduce length of stay while better equipping patients to manage their own health. Implementation components: Component 1: Conduct a geriatric assessment upon admission to identify patients eligible for flipped discharge Geriatric nurse consultant conducts a comprehensive geriatric assessment for all patients 70 years and older to determine if they would benefit from flipped discharge. The geriatric assessment includes criteria around cognitive health, medication history, and nutrition. Component 2: Create a tailored care plan before transferring the patient home Geriatric nurse consultant and hospitalist use the comprehensive assessment to create a tailored care plan, including plans for the patient's transfer home. Component 3: Transfer the patient home in hospital -provided transportation Once medically cleared, the patient takes hospital -provided transportation home before noon with a pre-packaged lunch and necessary medications. Component 4: Conduct final discharge steps in the patient's home Home care nurse meets the patient at their home the afternoon of their transition from the hospital and conducts discharge steps including a mobility assessment, in -home environment assessment, medication reconciliation, and final patient education. Tactic assessment Flipped discharge pilots demonstrate positive improvements in length of stay, medication reconciliation, and patient satisfaction. This tactic requires organizations to collaborate with a home health care team. While some hospitals primarily target geriatric patients, organizations should analyze their patient data to identify their top opportunities to reduce length of stay and improve care for patients with chronic conditions.

Tactic 4: Flipped discharge advisory.com 23 \u00a9 2019 Advisory Board All rights reserved WF1431673Component 1: Conduct a geriatric assessment upon admission to identify patients eligible for flipped discharge Leaders at Penn Medicine, a three -hospital academic medical center in the greater -Philadelphia area, initially set out to reduce readmissions for heart failure patients. However, when they realized the majority of their heart failure patients were geriatric, they decided to launch Supporting Older Adults at Risk (SOAR), a flipped discharge1program focused on reducing readmissions for all geriatric patients. When a geriatric patient is admitted to a Penn Medicine hospital , a geriatric nurse consultant (GNC) reviews the patient's medications, nutrition, and cognition. In addition to meeting clinical criteria, eligible SOAR patients must be 70 years or older, require a 48+ hour hospital stay, and live within the organization's geographic catchment area. If the patient meets eligibility criteria, the hospitalist, patient, and GNC collectively decide if the patient would benefit from flipped discharge. Volumes for SOAR range from one to two patients per day.

First, the GNC works with the care team to customize the inpatient care plan based on the geriatric assessment results (e.g., delirium, cognitive impairment). Then, the GNC works with the patient's caregivers to gain a detailed understanding of the patient's support network at home to help shape the home- based care plan. The following page illustrates the next two phases of flipped discharge: transition to home and in-home support.

On the morning of the patient's transfer home, their inpatient care team and a home care nurse have a hand -off call. The call covers medication regimens, functional needs, caregiving needs, and the plan for follow -up care. After the call, the patient receives a ride home with the appropriate medications and a pre- packaged lunch before noon.

A home care nurse reviews the patient's medicine cabinet and assesses mobility in the home. The patient's inpatient physician is available via phone or text to answer questions. If necessary, SOAR patients continue to receive care via recurring visits from the home care nurse (three to four visits per week) until they meet the clinical criteria for medical discharge . advisory.com 26 \u00a9 2019 Advisory Board All rights reserved WF1431673Flipped discharge improved Penn Medicine's quality metrics such as readmission rate and time to medication reconciliation. Additionally , SOAR patients report increased satisfaction and felt their needs were better understood and met. Although these are early results, they indicate the potential for significant quality and experience gains from early transfer home. Organizations most likely to benefit from this model are those with a stagnant length of stay and a large volume of elderly, chronically -ill patients.

Patients enrolled in hospital at home transfer to their homes immediately upon \"admission\" to receive comprehensive acute care in their home, including diagnostic testing and infusion therapy. Rationale Physicians frequently admit chronically ill patients from the ED because they require a certain level of acute care. However, for some patients, a hospital stay can put them at a greater risk for adverse outcomes such as hospital acquired infections and delirium. Providing select inpatient services in the home ensures organizations meet patients' acute care needs without exposing them to unnecessary risk. Implementation components: Component 1: Identify patients who qualify for hospital at home Clinicians from the ED, ambulatory clinic, or home health agency flag patients who are eligible for hospital at home and refer them to an inpatient physician for evaluation. Hospital -based physicians and staff determine whether the patient meets program criteria . Component 2: Transfer eligible patients home with a coordinated care plan Once a patient agrees to participate in hospital at home, they are transferred home with their family or in hospital -provided transportation. Component 3: Dispatch in- person and virtual care team members to deliver care A registered nurse meets the patient upon arrival home. A physician visits the patient daily, and a registered nurse visits the patient one to two times a day until discharge. Patients have access to video- based monitoring and a 24/7 phone number in case of emergencies. Component 4: Medically discharge patients when they meet clinical criteria for discharge Once apatient meets clinical criteria for discharge, the hospital at home physician discharges the patient from acute -level care and their primary care physician takes ownership of their care. Patients may receive additional home care services after discharge, if needed. Tactic assessment Hospital at home requires significant partnerships and supply chain investments.

To be enrolled in the program, patients must meet specific clinical criteria. In addition, Hopkins evaluates the safety of the patient's home as well as its geographic proximity to an ED. ED proximity helps hospitals assess the patients' safety in a potential emergency and the organization's ability to deliver medication and equipment to the patient's home.

Acute care begins \u2014and ends \u2014in the home Hospital at home programs often rely on experienced clinicians who are comfortable independently performing their job outside of the inpatient setting. When staffing their own programs, many organizations recruit nurses with critical care or ED experience and primary care physicians. Component 4: Medically discharge patients when they meet clinical criteria for discharge Once a patient meets clinical criteria for discharge, care reverts to the patient's primary care physician or outpatient treatment centers. Many organizations also provide patients with virtual access to the hospital at home team for the 30 days after discharge in case concerns or emergencies arise.
