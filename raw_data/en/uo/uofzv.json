The admissions team here at National University of Health Sciences knows that aspiring Acupuncture practitioners have a lot to think and learn about before they decide if, when, and where to pursue their degree. We hope this informational guide will bring you real insight into exploring an exciting career as an Acupuncture practitioner. Introduction to the Field What does an acupuncturist do? Western and eastern medicine both offer unique perspectives fundamental to health care today. You may be surprised to learn just how many oriental medicine practitioners are already working integratively at health care facilities across the United States. Acupuncture is increasingly being recognized as an effective treatment for a variety of conditions. In the recent years, [opioid epidemic](https://www.nuhs.edu/extras/opioids/opioid.html) has risen to a top concern in America. As doctors continue to limit opioid prescriptions, natural medicine is being recognized as a worthy alternative by the mainstream medical community. Several health care and government organizations, including The American College of Physicians, (ACP), The Joint Commission, State Attorneys General, as well as the White House, have highlighted complementary and alternative medicine, including acupuncture, chiropractic medicine, and naturopathic medicine as effective and first line of treatments for chronic pain. Beyond this specific crisis, there has been a growing shift to include acupuncture and oriental medicine in the main health care industry and many hospitals and treatment centers across the United States are incorporating integrative medicine practices. In fact, 42% of the hospitals offering complementary and alternative medicine provide acupuncture as an outpatient service to their patients. What benefit does an Herbal Medicine specialization provide? Herbal Medicine relies on a highly comprehensive and individualized diagnosis of a patient's Qi (or chi) energy. The weakness, excess, or imbalance of Qi affects key organ systems in herbal medicine and is the underlying cause of disease and disharmony. The herbal medicine practitioner uses a broad scope of therapies to restore balance to a patient's Qi, thereby encouraging health and healing. In addition to acupuncture, tai chi, tuina (meridian bodywork therapy), and qi gong (mind, breath, and physiological exercises) a practitioner of herbal medicine will employ Chinese dietary therapy as well as the full range of traditional herbal medicine. Herbal medicine encompasses the prescription of single herbs, complex herbal formulas, and patent herbal medicines in pill form. The goal of acupuncture is to promote healing through rebalancing the patient's Qi (or chi) energy. When the Qi is weak, excessive, or blocked, it can cause illness and disease. Acupuncturists assess a patient's symptoms or pattern of disharmony by using a set of diagnostic skills that involve four areas; questioning, palpation, visual inspection, and olfactory-auditory data collection. An acupuncturist determines the necessary treatment principle and strategy to prompt the patient back to functional harmony by discriminating the exact pattern of the body's physiological response to disease-causing factors. (Source: NCCAOM) The acupuncturist then employs several techniques in order to treat the patient: the stimulation of specific points on the body, by insertion of very fine, sterile, stainless steel needles to elicit a predictable physiological response. This stimulus may also be administered to the points using mild electrical stimulation (with or without needles), pressure techniques with the hands (acupressure), or the application of heat by various methods, such as Moxibustion. (Source: NCCAOM) How do Acupuncture health care providers practice? Acupuncture practitioners are able to: - Treat patients effectively and holistically with a wide variety of healing skills. - Run their own business or work as an associate in a group or integrative practice. - Those with specialization in herbal medicine are able to prescribe traditional herbal medicine to their patients, which gives them a wider scope of treatment options than acupuncture. - Become certified as acupuncturist by the [National Certification Commission of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM)](http://www.nccaom.org/applicants/board-examination-process/). Those seeking licensure as an acupuncturist physician or practitioner must pass national board examinations conducted by NCCAOM, as well as apply for licensure in the state where they plan to practice. The professional organization representing Acupuncture practitioners is the American Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (AAAOM). Career Outlook and Industry Statistics According to BLS.org, people across all age groups are becoming increasingly interested in alternative or complementary health care, which is why the demand for integrative medicine is growing in the United States. If you are considering a career in acupuncture, there has never been a better time to invest in an advanced degree in this field. Acupuncture and herbal medicine (AHM) practitioners can create lucrative careers with flexible work schedules that are rewarding on many levels. Careers in acupuncture often allow you to choose your frequency of patients, offering a more balanced work and personal life. AHM practitioners are also able to spend more time developing a collaborative relationship with patients, assisting them in maintaining their health, and promoting a healthy lifestyle. Today, acupuncturists can expect to earn between $60 to $120 per hour-long session, according to [acufinder.com](https://www.acufinder.com/), a trusted acupuncture resource and referral website. Did you know that the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes acupuncture and herbal medicine as an effective treatment for over 43 conditions under nine major health categories, from mental health disorders to gastrointestinal disorders? Acupuncture is increasingly becoming part of the main health care industry and many hospitals and treatment centers across the United States are incorporating integrative medicine practices, including acupuncture. 42% of the hospitals offering complementary and alternative medicine provide acupuncture as an outpatient service to their patients. Career Options for Acupuncturists Acupuncture graduates have a variety of different options after completing a degree, such as: - Have a solo practice as a holistic acupuncturist - Work at hospitals that include integrative practice opportunities - Join an established acupuncture practice - Work in an integrative healthcare clinic - Teach acupuncture and herbal medicine - Sail the world as a cruise ship acupuncturist - Work with an herb or acupuncture or supply company - Conduct research projects to advance the profession forward 6 Questions to Ask Before Selecting Your Program Once you decide that you are interested in a career in acupuncture, you'll be faced with the task of choosing a program that will best prepare you to become a successful practitioner. Selecting a school for your acupuncture program can be challenging. You should start by asking important questions like the ones listed below: Hidden Toggle Which school will best prepare you for the future of health care? Integration: Look for a school that gives you experience in \"integrative medicine.\" This means a program where acupuncture practitioners train to work in cooperation with other health professionals, such as MDs, DCs, NDs, etc. What we offer: National University prepares graduates for the future of health care by offering a campus dedicated to integrative medicine. You'll study and work side-by-side with students and faculty from its chiropractic and naturopathic medicine programs. This experience prepares you to understand and speak with a wider range of medical professionals when you graduate. Additionally, as one of only two schools in the U.S. to offer programs in chiropractic medicine, naturopathic medicine, and acupuncture all on one campus, our students have a rare opportunity to earn [multiple degrees](https://www.nuhs.edu/admissions/dual-degree-programs/) and save both time and money while expanding their skills and earning potential. Which school offers the most beneficial opportunities for clinical training? Geography: Consider a school located in a thriving health care job market which results in greater employment opportunities after graduation. Look for other universities, hospitals, veterans' clinics, science and health industries nearby as well as convenient public transportation (airports, trains, buses). Clinic Opportunities: Consider the clinical phase of the program. You should spend ample time observing and treating actual patients under the supervision of clinical faculty, learning how to write and maintain medical records, and gain the confidence and skills to succeed when you start your own practice. What we offer: National University is conveniently located [15 miles from the city of Chicago](https://www.nuhs.edu/about-us/our-profile/locations/illinois-campus/) and its diverse neighborhoods, with its rich tradition of herbal medicine shops and practitioners. The on-campus [Whole Health Center](https://www.nuhs.edu/patients/) affords students the opportunity to work with a variety of patients in a diverse clinic setting that includes outstanding facilities such as private treatment rooms and a large herbal dispensary. Prior to graduation, NUHS students also have the opportunity to work with specific populations. Our acupuncture students also get real on-the-job experience in a medical environment, working together with MDs to reduce pain for patients at one of the nation's busiest urban hospitals \u2014 [Cook County's John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital](https://www.nuhs.edu/academics/acupuncture/master-of-acupuncture/clinical-opportunities/). Which school provides the most comprehensive medical school education? Basic Sciences: Any program which combines western and eastern science in its curriculum, should include basic science courses such as anatomy, pathology, neurology, etc. Clinical Sciences: Review the clinical science coursework and practical training in the program. This part of an Acupuncture degree teaches students important skills in diagnosing patient conditions, performing physical exams, and utilizing acupuncture and other herbal medicine techniques. Students learn through practical training how to build successful doctor-patient relationships. What we offer: At National University, eastern traditional medicine meets modern western science. AHM students learn fundamental biomedical science and modern medical diagnostics including coursework in radiology, pathology, physiology, microbiology, and public health. NUHS offers one of few acupuncture programs in the world that incorporates the dissection of cadavers for acupuncture point and meridian studies as part of anatomy coursework. Which school delivers the most in-depth acupuncture instruction? Evidence-based: Understand the technique instruction, to be sure that the acupuncture techniques taught are backed by research proving their effectiveness. Look for a school that offers evidence-based instruction and technique. Hands-On: Understand how AHM techniques are taught. You want a school that will give you the opportunity for hands-on learning from the first year of your acupuncture medicine education. And you want a school that provides master teachers who are leaders in their field. What we offer: At National University, students get a full immersion in eastern medicine. You'll study the complete range of traditional diagnostic techniques such as tongue and pulse analysis. You'll learn point location and correct needle techniques and get rich exposure to oriental healing arts such as tui na, qi gong, moxibustion, and cupping. Which school invests in providing campus facilities to help students thrive? It is important to choose a school that invests in the success of their students and prepares them to confidently enter the health care industry. What we offer: National University prides itself on providing a campus that helps students excel. Our facilities include: - On-campus [Whole Health Center](https://www.nuhs.edu/patients/)clinic provides students the opportunity to work collaboratively with other health care students and practitioners in this integrative setting. - Large and well-stocked [herbal dispensary](https://www.nuhs.edu/academics/college-of-professional-studies/oriental-medicine/program-overview/nuhs-herbal-dispensary/)where students learn how to correctly choose and prepare effective herbal prescriptions, granular preparations, etc. - Top of the line [gross anatomy lab](https://www.nuhs.edu/academics/facilities/)where oriental medicine and acupuncture students learn western anatomy and eastern meridian theory through hands-on dissection of a human cadaver. - Life-size 3-D interactive [Anatomage Table](https://www.nuhs.edu/admissions/chiropractic-medicine/studying/facilities/the-anatomage-table/)offers students, faculty, and clinicians access to an advanced digital visualization system to augment anatomy education. [Training and Assessment Center (TAC)](https://www.nuhs.edu/academics/facilities/)where students are able to learn, practice and be assessed on their diagnosis and patient interaction skills. - A comprehensive [Learning Resource Center](https://www.nuhs.edu/student-services/learning-resource-center/), one of the largest medical libraries in the area that houses a huge collection of books, print and electronic journals, ebooks, bibliographic databases, and more. Which school supports your success? Tutoring and Academic Support: Check if the professors teach classes directly or use assistants. Ask if the school offers free peer tutoring (where senior students provide help in specific topics). Business Classes: Discover what business classes are included in the curriculum. When you graduate, you'll most likely be starting your own business, and you'll also need to understand insurance, billing, marketing, and business management procedures. Be sure the school you pick offers classes that give you these skills. Additional Education: Consider what extra courses are available to students on the weekend or online, that could augment your primary degree. Is continuing education reserved primarily for practicing physicians, or is it also available to AHM students? Does the institution offer an opportunity to enroll in dual-degrees or multiple programs so that you can earn more credentials with less time and money? Strong Alumni Network: Look for a school where alumni are involved, communicate with each other and current students, and where you can reach out to them for mentoring and career support. Accreditation: Look for a school that is accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine (ACAHM). That way, you can be certain that you'll be able to sit for a licensing exam conducted by National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM). What we offer: In addition to opportunities to earn multiple degrees on one campus, National University offers an array of [student support](https://www.nuhs.edu/student-services/support-services/) services that contribute to a successful educational experience.
