It can be used to treat both acute conditions like allergy or rash or chronic conditions such as stress or low energy. Homeopathic preparations are diluted forms of natural substances such as plants and minerals. Because of their dilution they are safe even for pregnant women and babies and have very little potential for side effects when used correctly. They give specific instructions to the body to help facilitate healing by directing its innate healing capabilities. How Homeopathy Works Most medications utilize the primary effect of the drug. When we use homeopathy we are taking advantage of the secondary drug effect of a natural substance. The primary effect is caused by the molecular reactions of that drug or natural substance and the secondary effect is the body's compensation reaction to it. If we use caffeine as an example, the primary effects are caused by caffeine increasing stress hormones such as adrenaline. Common effects will be an increase in alertness and heart rate. From when you take your first sip of coffee your body has already started its compensation reaction (secondary drug effect), counteracting the effects of the caffeine. This happens because your body wants to maintain homeostasis and doesn't want a substance to push things to a dangerous level where the heart rate goes too high, for example. Since homeopathic preparations are so diluted they utilize the secondary drug effect of substances without causing a primary drug effect. Homeopathic Remedies are Safe Because of their safety and usefulness, homeopathy is used extensively in advanced countries like Germany. The low cost and ease of administering remedies allows it to be a front line therapy in India. There are thousands of homeopathic remedies and the remedy needs to be specific not only to the condition but to how the constellation of symptoms is playing out in that individual person. It often takes a skilled practitioner in homeopathy to choose the correct remedy to help with a specific set of symptoms somebody is experiencing.
