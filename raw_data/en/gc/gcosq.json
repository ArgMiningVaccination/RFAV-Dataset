Pharmacology, Sh antou University Medical College, Shantou, China Chapter 1 8 The liver is the largest internal organ involv ed in metabolism and detoxification in humans. It metabolizes and stores nutrie nts (protein, glycogen, vitamins, lipids, cholesterol), it is responsible for the synthe sis of bile acids from cholesterol and the synthesis of many plasma proteins and it detoxifies xenobiotics, such as drugs and alcohol [1, 2]. These activities can be gr ouped into (a) synthetic functions, (b) metabolic functions, (c) detoxification. No t surprisingly, impairment of the normal function of the liver can lead to serious disruption of homeostasis and liver diseases are therefore characterized by high morbid ity and mortality. In traditional Chinese medicine, the heart is considered the 'Kin g' or 'Supreme Commander' over body functions, whereas the liver is considered as the 'General' or 'Long-range Planner'. These terms are paralleled in Western physiology, e.g. the liver plays a critical role in maintaining body energy ('Qi') and the bala nce between 'Yin' and 'Yang' [3, 4]. The 'planning' capacity of the liver can be translated to maintaining blood quality (detoxification, plasma protein synt hesis), digestion and metabolism of carbohydrates (glucose), and storage of important nutrients (vitamins, lipids, glycogen). Sometimes it is difficult to translate the terminology from Chinese traditional medicine to Western physiolo gy. In traditional Chinese medicine, the liver 'has its opening in the eyes'. In ' Neijing' , it is stated 'liver qi communicates with the eyes', suggesting that the eyes are clos ely linked to the liver [5]. This could be related to the fact that the eyes are nourish ed by liver (blood) and that the liver is the storage organ for vitamin A, a crucial vita min in vision, e.g. vitamin A deficiency leads to (night) blindness. Furthermore, the eye is an indicator for liver function: yellow colorization of the eyes may refl ect jaundice. Additionally, according to traditional Chinese medicine, the liver pl ays a central role in harmonizing the emotional flow and governing mental and sp iritual functions [6]. Likewise, intense emotions like chronic rage, complaining, despair, jealousy often adversely affects liver function. Thus, a healthy liver is indi spensable for normal body function, both from the Western and the Eastern perspective. In humans, the liver is composed of two liver lobes and has a dual blood supply: oxygen-rich blood is supplied by the hepatic artery that accounts for 25% of the liver blood supply, whereas 75% of the blood su pply comes from the gut via the portal vein [7]. The blood from the portal vein contains nutrients absorbed from the intestinal lumen, but also potentially harmfu l substances absorbed from the gut, e.g. toxins, pathogens, xenobiotics and gut-deri ved endotoxins. The liver is therefore the first organ exposed to toxic substances from the gut and therefore susceptible to damage induced by these noxious comp ounds. Fortunately, the liver is well-equipped to deal with these chal lenges: the liver is the primary site of detoxification of many toxic compound s and the clearance of pathogens and gut-derived endotoxins. Furthermore, the li ver has a remarkable capacity to adapt and withstand various forms of injury thro ugh regenerative repair. The equilibrium between cell death, proliferation and differe ntiation is crucial for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis throughout life. Within th e liver, various phenotypically distinct cell types are responsible for the maintenanc e of this delicate equilibrium. These cell Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 9 types include parenchymal cells (mainl y hepatocytes and stellate cells, Kupffer cells and lymphocytes (Fig. 1). Figure 1. The location and structure of various cell type s in the liver, which contains hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, and cells, NK and NKT cells, hepatic dendritic cells (DCs). Some of cells participate in inflammatory and immune responses. Reprinted with permission from Steven E. Shoelson \u00a9 2006 American Society for Clinical Investigation [8] . First, we introduce these cell types and their functions in the liver. Parenchymal cells (hepatoc ytes and cholangiocytes) Within the liver there are two types of po larized epithelial cells: hepatocytes and cholangiocytes (also known as biliary epit helial cells). In terms of mass and number, the hepatocyte is the predominant liver cell type, comprising around 70% of the total number of cells in the liver and approximat ely 80% of the total liver mass [2, 9, 10]. Cholangiocytes line the bile ducts and modu bile [11]. Both cell types, hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, are cruc ial for liver function and homeostasis. Damage to one of these cell types is the cause of most liver diseases leading to inflammation and fibrosis [12]. The hepatocytes are responsible for many liver-specific functions, such as intermed iary metabolism, detoxification of toxic compounds, synthesis of bile acids and many plasma proteins, and generation of bile acid-dependent bile flow. In the healthy liver, very few of the hepatocytes are progressing through the cell cycle, the vast majority remains in a quiescent state (G0) [13]. However, hepatocytes retain the ability to re-enter the cell cycle in response to a liver insult, e.g. after partial resection of th e liver [14] or severe liver injury [15]. In most liver diseases, in particular inflammatory liver diseases, it are mostly the hepatocytes that perish. Loss of hepatocytes occurs by cell death. The major types of cell death are apoptosis and necrosis alth ough alternative form s of cell death also occur, e.g. autophagy. Although apoptosis an d necrosis have clear definitions, it is 1 Chapter 1 10 increasingly recognized that they repres ent two extremes of a continuum. Indeed, intermediate forms of cell death like necro-apoptosis (necroptosis) displaying features of both apoptosis and necrosis have been described [16]. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is characterized by cell shrinking, membrane blebbing, DNA condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and fi nally the formation of apoptotic bodies. Mitochondrial morphology remains intact and the cellular content remains confined and does not spill into the circulation [17, 18]. The morphological events are accompanied by the activation of specific pr oteases, called caspases, in particular the downstream effector caspases-3, -6 and -7, which cleave cellular structures and proteins resulting in cell death. In contra st, necrosis, or 'passive' cell death, is characterized by cell swelling, rupture of the plasma membrane with subsequent spilling of cellular content into the ci rculation, resulting in inflammation and mitochondrial swelling. Nuclear morphology remains intact [19]. Autophagy, or cellular self-digestion (Greek for \"self-e ating\"), is cell death mediated by the lysosomal degradation of cellular compon ents. exact ca usal role of autophagy to liver damage is not clear. For example, autophagy could act both as an agonist and as an antagonist of cell death depending on the experiment al context. Although apoptosis is crucial for embryonic development and normal tissue homeostasis, including liver homeostasis, excessive apoptosis in liver di seases is detrimental. The predominant mode of hepatocyte cell death is dependent on the liver disease, e.g. necrotic cell death is the predominant mode of cell death in acute acetaminophen intoxication and many chronic liver diseases, whereas apoptoti c cell death is observed in acute (viral) hepatitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatiti s (NASH). Most liver diseases, however, display a mixed phenotype of cell death [22, 23]. Non-parenchymal cells Macrophages In the liver, macrophages can be broadly defined as either resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) or monocyte-derived macrophages [12], which are responsible for the elimination of pathogens (bacteria) and clearance of foreign compounds, e.g. apoptotic bodies by phagocytosis through a variety of receptors. Kupffer cells reside in the hepatic sinusoids, in close contact with other circulating immune cells, so they participate in local immune responses and are well-positioned to eliminate invading pathogens and remove obsolete cells (eryth rocytes) or cell fragments (apoptotic bodies). Macrophages are also the driving force of inflammation in many liver diseases. Upon activation by various triggers (e.g. bacterial products) the macrophages, including the Kupffer cells, release pro-inflammatory and reactive oxygen species (ROS). These secreted products influence not only the hepatocytes, but also stellate cells, portal myofibroblasts and ot her immune cells. In chronic liver diseases, Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 11 the continuous inflammatory state leads to a fibrogenic response , since the products released from Kupffer cells contribute to th e activation, proliferation and survival of stellate cells and myofibroblasts, in part vi a the activation of the transcription factor Nuclear Factor- B (NF-B) in HSCs and myofibroblasts [24]. On the other hand, macrophages also possess a latent capacity to revive damaged tissue by secreting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that de grade newly synthesized scar matrix. The protease activity of MMPs is inhibited by concurrent production of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) account for 5%-8% of the cells in the liver and are located in the space of Disse, the space be tween the sinusoidal endothelial cells and the basolateral surface of hepatocytes [25, 26]. In the healthy liver, HSC contain large quantities of retinyl-esters pa cked in big lipid droplets that serve as the main storage site of vitamin A in the body. In liver fibrogenesis, the key event is the transdifferentiation of these lose their vitamin A content. Liver myofibroblasts are derived ma inly from the activation of quiescent HSCs, but may also arise from other sources, e.g. portal fibroblasts [27, 28] and bone marrow-derived cells [29, 30]. Although the ex act initial events in the activation of HSCs are still not completely elucidated , various cytokines, growth factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved . Upon activation, the HSCs lose their vitamin A content and demonstrate increase d proliferation, contractility, matrix production and pro-inflammatory signal ing. The accumulation and enhanced density and cross-linking of hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) components produced by myofibroblasts leads to fibro sis and is characterized by increased matrix stiffness, hampered blood flow throug h the liver, portal hypertension and complications like variceal bleeding. Regr ession of liver fibr osis can be achieved when the disease-causing factor(s) can be eradicated. Activated HSCs either undergo apoptosis or revert to a quiescent phenot ype characterized by downregulation of markers of fibrosis such as type I (col1a1) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (-SMA) [31, 32]. Subsequently, other cell types in the liver contribute to the clearance of HSCs, e.g. apoptotic HSCs are phagocytized by macrophages and are removed by natural ki ller cells [33-35]. Therefore, removal and/or \"de-activation\" of HSCs/myofibrob lasts is increasingly recognized as an essential step towards the resolution of liver fibrosis. Natural Killer (NK) cells and Natural Killer T-cells (NKT cells) The immune system plays an important ro le in maintaining tissue homeostasis and dysregulation of this system may contribute to several liver diseases. In the context of liver diseases, NK cells and NKT cel ls are important. NK and NKT cells both contain a characteristic set of markers for NK cells cell, in addition, express T cell markers (like 1 Chapter 1 12 CD1) [7, 36, 37]. In acute or chronic liver inju ry, both cell types play an important role in the first-line innate defense against viral infection and tumor transformation, which is associated with many liver diseas e s [ 3 8 , 3 9 ] . T h e d i s t r i b u t i o n o f N K a n d NKT cells is different in the livers of mi ce, rats and humans. NKT cells account for 30-40% of total lymphocytes in mouse liver and only 5-10% of total lymphocytes in rat and human liver [40]. Hepatic NK and NKT cells have many similar functions after activation, such as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN- and IL-4) and the killing of virus-infected ce lls and tumor cells [7]. The major mechanism by which NK cells lead to hepatocyte cell death and liver injury is via the release of TRAIL and granzyme B, whereas NKT cells release predominantly FasL [41]. NK cells also appear to have a negative regula tory effect on fibrogenesis and have been reported to directly kill early-activated or senescent hepatic stellate cells [35, 42, 43]. This probably mediated by IFN- , released by activated NK cells, that inhibits stellate cell activation and amplifies NK cell cytotoxicity against stellate cells [44-46]. On hand, IFN- also a proinflammatory production of NK cells and NKT cells could be bene ficial for the survival of hepatocytes and allow hepatic regeneration, but could also promote fibrogenesis. Interestingly, experimental evidence suggests that IFN- that is specifically targeted to stellate cells suppresses liver fibrosis in sinusoids. They have a unique morphological phenotype that is characterized by open (non-diaphragmed) fenestrae and a lack of basement membrane [50]. This morphology facilitates an optimal exchange of nutrients, oxygen and waste pr oducts between the sinusoidal blood and space of Disse. LSECs are al so responsible for removing soluble macromolecular and colloidal waste products (smaller than 100 nm) [9, 51]. Furthermore, LSEC have the appropriate location, together with Kupffer cells, to play a role in the clearance of pathogens and viruses. Giugliano et al [52] reported the release of antiviral exosomes from the LSEC s that amplify the antiviral activity of interferons in hepatocytes. Additionally, differentiated LSECs that maintain their normal fenestration and function prevent HSC activation. In cocultures of LSECs and HSCs, the presence of LSECs maintains the quiescent state of HSC [53]. Once LSEC differentiation is lost, they promote HSC ac tivation and liver fibrosis. Therefore, differentiated LSECs have a function as ga tekeeper in the fibrotic process [50]. Liver diseases A number of different conditions (inflamm atory disorders and metabolic disorders) affect liver functions, which are associated to multiple cell types discussed above. Traditionally, liver diseases are categorize d into acute liver failure (ALF) and chronic liver failure (CLF) [54, 55]. The essential fe ature of ALF is the abrupt loss of hepatic function due to the loss of large numbers of hepatocytes [56]. This rare but sudden Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 13 syndrome in a patient with no history of liver disease, but causes severe complications (i.e. jaundice, coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, and even multi-organ failure) [57]. Viral hepatitis re mains the cause of a high proportion of cases of ALF, which is common caused by infe ctions of virus A, B, C and E, and leads a high rate of death world while. And vi rus hepatitis predominates in developing countries more than in developed countries [58]. It is not optimistic that of the 350 million hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers worldwide, one-third reside in China [59]. That means 780 000 people die every year due to complications of hepatitis B [60], the number in China is nearly a half reported by National Health and Family Planning Commission of China. Besides virus, to xins, drugs, immunological attacks and various chemicals could also cause hepatitis, and each of these stimulations could be possible to result in CLF. CLF, a progressive and slow deterioration, often occurs in people with incurable chronic liver disease or stable cirrhosis. CLF leads to metabolic disorders of various toxins and presents irreversible chroni c loss of liver function, which usually is accompanied by continuous inflammation [61]. Alcohol consumption has been globally identified as a major risk factor in liver diseases, such as alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) and ASH [62]. The characteris tic of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and AFLD are fat accumulation in the liver (steatosis ) and with alcohol consumption 20-30 g/day (AFLD) and without any evidence of chronic liver diseases and lower alcohol drink (NAFLD). Furthermor e, advanced stages of these two liver diseases are NASH and ASH [63]. The cons equence and final stage of various CLF are generally liver fibrosis and liver cirrhosis [64]. Actually, fibrosis is the liver's protective response to injury , and this intrinsic reaction wi ll protect the liver against further damage from the structure and functions of differential cell types. So the liver can be reversed by itself from fibrosis ev en cirrhosis to normal architecture when the insults removed or the causes treated. The successful reversion of fibrosis and cirrhosis should include the degradation of excess ECM [64], and (MMPs) asso main cont ributions to degrade excess ECM. But the objective situations usually do not look good. Accumulation of deposited extracellular matrix (types I and type IV fi brillary collagens), server liver injury and uncontrolled immune responses to inflamma tory, will finally cause irreversible liver fibrosis characterized by cellular activation of HSCs (see above). And therefore, this is one main topic focused in this thesis. Cirr hosis is defined as fibrous scarring of the hepatic parenchyma resulting in nodule formation and collapse of liver structures. Now it is fourth cause of morbidity and mortality in central Europe [65]. Collectively, these are among the key initiating risk fact ors for two types of primary liver cancer: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) an d cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) [66]. Additionally, in 1995, a third type of live r failure acute-on-chr onic liver failure (ACLF) was described for the first time [67]. The definition of this new entity is based on patients with 3 key syndromes: li ver cirrhosis presenting with acute decompensation, a high rate of organ failur e and a high short -term of mortality [68, 1 Chapter 1 14 69]. Unfortunately, the classification of AC LF is still not universal defined so far. However, the further improvement concerning of ALF according to its prognosis will be beneficial to clinical managements on these patients. Signal transduction in hepatic injury Although the liver has a high regenerative capacity, the loss of viable and functional hepatocytes may lead to liver failure, depe nding on the type and severity of the injury. The massive and acute loss of a large proportion of functional hepatocytes, as in acute liver failure or fulminant hepatit is, may not be compensated by hepatocyte regeneration because of an inability of the hepatocytes to regenerate in these conditions or because the loss of hepatocyte s is too extensive. On the other hand, in chronic liver failure there is a continuous, but more moderate loss of hepatocytes, which can be compensated by regeneration. However, in chronic liver injury, the continuous presence of an insult may result in sustained inflammation and fibrogenesis, eventually exceeding the re generative capacity of hepatocytes and leading to liver failure. In addition, the co ntinuous regenerative trigger may lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To unders tand the pathogenesis of liver diseases we will now first review some of the key signaling mechanisms involved in liver inflammation and liver fibrosis. Inflammatory cytokines, interferons and chemokines In acute and/or chronic liver injury, the cellular wound-healing response is accompanied by the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The release of these soluble factors contribute s to the wound healing response and the clearance of foreign substances and cell debris and is therefore beneficial. However, excessive and/or prolonged production of these factors may be detrimental to hepatocytes and also lead to uncontrolled ac tivation and proliferation of stellate cells. In fact, some of the released cytokines, such as TNF- , interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 play a role in the proliferative response of hepatocytes and induce the production of so-called acute phase protei ns that are important in maintenance of homeostasis. Other cytokines, like FasL, TNF- and other so-called receptor can induce apoptotic cell death in hepatocytes. Hence, TNF- plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response of the live r, since it has both proliferative and cell protective effects by activating the transcription factor NF- B and it has pro-apoptotic properties (when cells are unable to activate NF-kB) by activating death receptor pathways. Furthermore, TNF- controls the production of many other cytokines. The biological effects of TNF- are mediated by its receptors TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1) and TNF-R2. Signaling by TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 is achieved by recruitment of adaptor proteins that bind to the cytosolic domains of the receptors (like MyD88) and initiate signal transduction events [70]. IL-1 is another potent inflammatory cytokine that signals through th e IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1), leading to an inflammatory cascade. Increased levels of IL-1 contribute to the progression of several chronic inflammatory liver di seases, including NASH and Alcoholic Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 15 steatohepatitis (ASH). Interferons (IFNs, IFN- / and IFN- ) comprise a family of proteins, which interact with cells via distinct cellular receptors. Type II IFN (IFN- ) is produced mainly by macrophages, NK cells, and T lymphocytes [71], while type I IFN is produced by fibroblasts, epithelial cells an d hepatocytes [72]. IFNs have been tested as anti-fibrotic agents in patients with moderate fi brosis. It was demonstrated that IFN- displays anti-fibrotic effects and su ppresses proliferation and -SMA expression in HSCs. Furthermore, IFN- activates NK cells that in turn induce death of HSCs [73]. Additionally, IFN- can inhibit the repeated hepatoce llular injury and reduce liver fibrosis induced by Con A [74] Chemokines are small proteins (8-13 kDa) and are 4 different families: CC, CXC, CX3C, C) [75]. It ha s been shown that chemokines and their receptors play a seminal role in the path ogenesis of various acute and chronic liver diseases. Chemokines, by virtue of thei r capacity to attract inflammatory and immune cells to sites of inflammation, not only drive inflammation and immune responses, but also participate in fibr ogenesis and cancer [76]. CCL2 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1, MCP-1) is one of th e best characterized chemokines. In the chronically inflamed liver, CCL2 is secreted by many different cell types [77, 78], but mainly by Kupffer cells and HSCs, which contribute to the recruitment and accumulation of macrophages and monocyte s into the liver. During development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH, CCL2 and its receptor are upregulated in the liver, where it prom otes hepatic and systemic inflammation related to metabolic disorders [79-81]. Transcription factor Nuclear Factor- B (NF-B) NF-B is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is activated by a variety of stimuli, including cytokines (TNF- , Transforming growth factor (TGF)- ) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). NF- B is a key regulator of many cellular responses involved in inflammation and stress in chronic liver di seases (e.g. viral hepatitis, liver fibrosis and NAFLD) [82]. The -1) and p65 Additional giving rise to alternative homo- and heterodimers. Normally, NF- B is retained in an inactive form in the cytoplasm through association with one of the I B inhibitory proteins, including IKK- or IKK-, and this interaction blocks the ability of NF- B to translocate to nucleus. Upon stimulation of appropriate receptors, e.g. binding of TNF- to its receptor, the I B kinase (IKK) complex is phosphorylated and activated. The IKK complex is composed of a regulatory subunit (IKK- ) and two kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of I B. Phosphorylation of I B leads to its poly-ubiquitination and subsequent prot eolytic degradation. These events allow the translocation of NF- B from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where NF- B acts by inducing the transcription of target genes [83]. The target genes of NF- B include inflammation-related genes, like cytokines, including TNF- itself and chemokines, 1 Chapter 1 16 but also anti-apoptotic genes. Therefore, NF- B has a pivotal role in the inflammatory response. Theref ore, there is a tremendous, ongoing effort to identify and develop drugs that target NF- B activity. However, since NF- B is associated with pro-survival activity, the continuous ac tivation of this transcription factor in inflammatory disorders might also predispose for an increased risk for (MAPK) family, are involved in multip le signaling cascades that lead to hepatocellular cell death. It is a pro-apoptotic kinase and is involved in hepatocellular injury in inflammatory, metabo lic and fibrotic liver diseases. The liver expresses two isoforms, JNK1 JNK2, PDGF-mediated Smad 2/3 signaling [85]. In addition, the interplay between NF- B and JNK has been extensively investigated and reviewed [ 70, 86, 87]. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that NF- B generates its survival signals in part via inhibition of the prolonged activation of JNK by TNF- [70], and in turn, activation of JNK prolonged NF-kB-deficient cells [88]. Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) are essential receptors in the host defense against pathogens in the early innate immune resp onse. TLRs have the ability to recognize highly conserved structural motifs known as pathogen-associated microbial patterns (PAMPs), which include various bacter ial cell wall components, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN) and lipopeptides. LPS, the TLR4 ligand, induces inflammatory signals in multip le cell types in the liver. The activation of TLR4 on Kupffer cells leads to the prod in [92, 93]. Several therapeutic agents targeting the TLRs ar e now under pre-clinical and clinical evaluation. However, given the complexity of signaling and the multitude of TLRs, interventions in these pathways may act as double-edged swords either promoting or inhibiting disease progression. Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 17 Figure 2. Cascade of signals following liver injury CCL2 and CCR2: factor. Reprinted with permission from Antonella Pellicoro \u00a9 2014 Nature Publishing Group [12]. Liver injury leads to necrotic and/or ap optotic cell death of parenchymal cells. Phagocytosed cell debris leads to activa tion of macrophages and HSCs, which is amplified by the release of cytokines and reactive oxygen species. These pro-inflammatory mediators also recrui t T cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes, amplifying the inflammatory response. Incr eased gut permeability, e.g. during acute inflammation, leads to increased transloca tion of gut-derived endotoxins, via the portal blood, to the liver. In the liver, endo toxins and other bacterial products bind to CD14 and TLR4 receptors on Kupffer cells, triggering an inflammatory response, including the activation of stress-activated and mitogen-activated protein kinase mediators one of the key factors driving fibrogenesis. TGF- is mainly 1 Chapter 1 18 produced by inflammatory and immune cells and directly promotes liver fibrosis via stimulation of HSC transdifferentiation in to myofibroblasts, a process characterized by increased expression of -SMA and collagen type I. The growth factor PDGF also stimulates proliferation of myofibroblasts. Reversal of matrix deposition and scar accumulation is regulated by MMPs and its natural inhibitors (TIMPs). Upon removal or termination of the underlying triggers for liver injury (alcohol, fat, hepatitis viruses), the liver is, to some extent, capable to regenerate and resolve fibrosis [95-97]. Therapeutic drugs for liver diseases Liver diseases are difficult to treat by medication. Yet, several drugs are now prescribed for various liver diseases: fo r NASH and NAFLD, statins, such as pravastatin and atorvastatin, are the most pr escribed drugs. They act by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and thereby reduce cholesterol synthesis. These drugs improv e liver histology and serum markers in patients and are in general safe, with only rare examples of toxic side-effects [98]. In recent years, the anti-diabetic drug metformin is increasingly prescribed for NASH/NAFLD patients with good results [99] . In the treatment of HCC, sorafenib is commonly used for unresectable/non-ablat able or advanced-stage HCC. It is PDGF receptor) [100]. c acid is used in the treatment of cholestatic diseases [101]. Lamivudine, a deox ycytidine analogue that has a high oral bioavailability is active against hepatiti s B virus (HBV) [102]. The major mechanism of lamivudine is blocking viral DNA synthesis and inhibiting HBV replication. Finally, hepatitis C virus infection is treated by a cocktail of drugs that inhibit various HCV proteins, including the HCV polymerase and protease. Unfortunately, many of the currently available therapies are not ve ry effective (with the exception of the novel treatment for HCV [103]). Furthermore, most of these therapeutic interventions target the agents that cause the disease, but not target the already ongoing inflammation, cell death and/or fibrogenes is. In fact, there ar e currently no drugs available that directly target liver fibros is, while more general anti-fibrotic drugs have a significant risk for side effects [104], for instance pirfenidon e that may lead to gastrointestinal syndromes[15] (inhibiting TGF- expression and activation) or tyrosine kinase cAbl) [107]. For end stage liver failure, the only effective therapeutic option is liver transplantation. Since the supply of donor organs is inadequate to meet the growing demand, this is also not an optimal solution for many patients . Therefore, complementary and alternative medicines have gained increasing attentio n for the treatment of liver diseases. Herbal products for the tr eatment of liver disease An important group of complementary and alternative medicines are herbal p r o d u c t s . F o r t h o u s a n d s o f y e a r s , h e r b a l p r o d u c t s h a v e b e e n u s e d b y i n d i g e n o u s people worldwide to treat a plethora of illnesses. In the past few decades, these Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 19 natural products also caught attention in Western countries. Many cultures have used traditional medicine for the treatment of diseases, e.g. in China (traditional Chinese medicine, TCM), Japan (Kamp medicine), Korea (traditional Korean medicine), Indonesia (Jamu), India (A yurvedic medicine), North America (phytotherapy), and Europe (herbalism) [108]. The medical application of herbal products has fostered research into the chem ical and biological analyses of numerous prescriptions [109-112]. Simultaneously, it has initiated a successful approach to novel drug identification and development through the isolation and purification of active ingredients from herbal products [113] [114]. A few examples of herbal products that have been used in the treatment of liver diseases will now be discussed. Silymarin (Milk thistle) Silymarin, the extract of (Fig. 2). The major component silybinin (also called silybin) accounts for 90% of the herb's flavonoid content in most preparations. Silymarin is found commonly throughout Europe, Asia and North America. Its extracts were already used as early as the 4 th century B.C. and became a single-herb remedy for liver disease and ja undice in the 1960s [115, 116]. One of the reasons why silymarin became so popular is because of its postulated mechanisms of actions that include antioxidant activi ty, anti-inflammatory activities and hepatoprotective actions with little or no toxicity [117-119] . Studies in cell culture and animal models demonstrated that silymarin enhances the activity of ribosomal RNA polymerase in hepatocytes and decreases he patic injury by inhibiting glutathione depletion in hepatocytes and inhibiti the by Kupffer cells [120]. Furthermore, sylimarin has been shown to block proliferation of HSCs [121] and to inhibit TGF- 1-induced collagen secretion [122]. Several clinical trials have sh own the beneficial effects of silymarin in liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis, no n-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis B/C virus infection and liver cancer [123, 124] . The beneficial effects of silymarin on parameters of liver injury (AST, ALT) are thought to be caused by modulation of immune responses and improvement of an ti-oxidant defenses by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and increasing glutathione levels. Although silymarin shows low intestinal absorption after oral administration, dosages of 420 mg/day are well-tolerated and have shown significant therapeutic effects in the treatment of liver cirrhosis and viral hepa titis. Low doses of silybin (20 to 48 mg/kg/day) are used as an antidote for acute Amanita phalloides (deathcap mushroom) poisoning [118], which occurs frequently in Europe, especially in Germany. The main mechanism of this protec tive action is repressing the uptake of amatoxin (the toxin of Amanita phalloides ) via competitive inhibition of the transporter OATP1B3 and thereby decreasing the concentration of amatoxin in the enterohepatic circulation [125]. Although th e value of silymarin in the treatment of chronic liver failure is still unclear because of the lack of well-controlled clinical trials, it remains the best current ly available therapy for A. phalloides poisoning. 1 Chapter 1 20 Figure 3. The milk thistle ( Silybum marianum ) and the chemical structures of its four major flavonoid constituents. Taken from pere nnial herb that is widely cultivated in Southeast Europe and Western Asia (Fig. 3). It has been used for centuries in traditional medicine to treat cough, bronchi tis, gastritis and live r inflammation [126, 127]. It is available as over-the-counter me dication in liquid, powder and pill forms in the United States. Glycyr rhizin is the aqueous extract of licorice root. It is the conjugate of two molecules of glucuronic acid and one molecule of 18 -glycyrrhetic acid (GA) [128]. Other components of th e aqueous rhizin prevents or attenuates liver injury in several animal models of liver disease, as well as in in liver disease patients in clinical trials. Glycyrrh izin targets the hepatocyte membrane [130, 131] and this property is being exploited by developing hepatocyte-specific delivery systems incorporating glycyrrh izin [132, 133]. In Japan, cont ains glycyrrhizin, cysteine and glycine, is chronic hepa titis [134, 135]. The use of glycyrrhizin in acute and chronic hepatitis is based on it s hepatoprotective, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. In animal models, glycyrrhizin has been demonstrated to suppress the inflammatory response vi a PI3K-mediated inhibition of NF- B activation, resulting in diminished inflammatory cytokines like TNF- and inflammatory reactive oxygen species and prostaglandin E2 [136]. Glycyrrhiz in inhibits infiltration of inflammatory cells into the liver and reduced liver injury in the concanavalin A (ConA) model [137]. In the model alN)/lipopolysaccharide CD4(+)T and enhances IFN- and IL-10 expression in these cells via JNK, ER K and PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanisms. Moreover, glycyrrhizin inhibited ConA-ind uced phosphorylation of JNK, and PI3K/Akt in this study, suggesting that glycyrrhizin attenuates liver injury and fibrosis via modulation of the CD4(+)T cell response [140]. Of note, some studies Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 21 demonstrated that several nuclear receptors, e.g. glucocorticoid receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR), gamma (PPAR- ), are regulated by glycyrrhizin, which may also be pharmaceutical targets of glycyrrhizin. Moreover, glycyrrhizin was shown to lower AST and ALT levels in a long-term clinical study of HCV patients in Japan and the Netherlands [145, 146]. In glycyrrhizin exerts anti-inflammatory of PPARs, especially PPAR- , which corresponds to the severity of SAH-related inflammation. Figure 4. Glycyrrhiza glabra and Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an ancient, holistic treatment system established through empirical evaluation. It aims to restore energy (Qi) and balance (Yin and Yang) through the use of complex medicinal plants, fungi, animal products and minerals. TCM typically contains many components and therefore appears quite different from the therapeutic approaches of Western medicine. TCM is a holistic approach, using individualized herbal reme dies to target complex syndromes and to help the body regain balance and harmony [147]. Thus, in TCM, the entire human body is treated as a single unit and th e selected herbs are able to act in a complementary fashion. Supporting evide nce for TCM was documented already in 16 B.C. in the book Pen Tsao , describing more than 300 herbs for medical treatment. The most important basic theory of TCM is the Jun-Chen-Zuo-Shi principle of combining different medicinal compounds in a specific manner when preparing TCM formulations ( Fufang ). Fufang means that each component in a TCM formulation has its own biological target an d the combined action of all components on different biological ta rgets is the principle of Fufang . For instance, most herbal mixtures comprise 4 to 5 herbs of whic h 1 or 2 are pharmacologically active compounds present in high doses. The herb that targets the major symptom of the disease is called Jun (\"Emperor\" or \"King\"). The remaining components, Chen (\"Minister\"), Zuo (\"Assistant\") and Shi (\"Courier\"), have supporting functions, such as strengthening Jun's therapeutic effects, eliminating possible adverse or toxic effects of the Jun and/or Chen components or working synergistically with Jun [148]. 1 Chapter 1 22 It has been demonstrated that at least 42% of patients with liver diseases use some form of traditional medicine, 20% of wh om use herbal preparations [134]. The following section of the introduction de scribes some therapeutic examples of complex herbal medicines that are currently being investigated in clinical trials. Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang (TJ-9) Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang (TJ-9, Sho-saiko-to in Japanese), a classic herbal composite formula, is widely used in China and in Ja pan to treat liver dise ases. It consists baicalin, Saikosaponins, ginsenosides, wogonin, and gingerol (Fig. 4). It is administered orally in doses of up to 7.5 g to patients with chronic viral liver diseases and the concentration of each ac tive component is regulated [149]. In 1995, Oka et al [150] performed a prospective, random ized, non-blind controlled study in 260 patients, which demonstrated a significant beneficial preventive effect of TJ-9 on HCC development, in particular in patien ts that were HBs-Ag negative [119]. In addition, an anti-fibrotic effect of T J-9 in two rat models of liver fibrosis (diethylnitrosamine- and pig serum-induce d liver fibrosis) was demonstrated [151, 152]. More recently, Takahashi et al . reported their findings of TJ-9 treatment in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [153]. TJ-9 significantly alleviated necroinflammation and fibrosis in the liver in this mouse model of NASH. The beneficial effects of TJ-9 were (partly) ca used by increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR ) and reduced expression the components of TJ-9, saikosaponin-C the isomers of saikosaponin, induced apoptosis of lymphocytes, partly by increasing levels of c-myc and p53 mRNA an d decreasing levels of Bcl-2 mRNA [154]. Thus, TJ-9 may hold great promise for the preven tion and/or treatment of complex liver diseases. Figure 5. The seven herbal components of Kampo TJ 9 include bupleurum root (at the bottom), jujube fruit (left bottom), pinellia tuber (b ottom right), ginger (on the top), root (up left), scutellaria root (top right), and gins eng root (on the left). Taken form: http://kampo.ca/herbs-formulas/formulas/shosaikoto/ Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases Fuzheng Huayu (FZHY) Similar to TJ-9, Fuzheng Huayu (FZHY) is a complex preparation of Chinese herbal medicine consisting of six other medicinal herbs (Fig. is a pproved by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of China as an antifi brotic medicine [156] and it has also been reported to promote blood flow and reduce markers of liver injury and cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score) [157]. In clinical trials, FZHY was shown to significantly improve clinical symptoms and liver function, to reverse hepatic fibrosis and to decrease portal pressure in patients with chronic hepa titis B and liver cirrhosis [158]. In animal liver fibrosis, FZHY decreased -SMA expression, attenuated ECM deposition transduction [159, 160]. FZHY also induced apoptosis in activating p38 and inhibiting SAPK/JNK [161, 162], which is opposite to it s effect on hepatocytes. In addition, FZHY has been shown to have antifibrotic pr operties by increasing the production of IFN- by hepatic NK cells [163] and to ha ve anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties by reducing the expression of 2E1 and TNF-R1 [164]. FZHY has successfully comple ted phase 2 clinical trials in the United States [147, 165]. 1 Chapter 1 24 Figure 6.

Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 25 Ipomoea stolonifera Ipomoea pes caprae I p o m o e a S c a r l e t t O i H a r a I p o m o e a t r i c o l o r Figure 7. Members of the Convolvulaceae family. Ipomoea , a large genus of more than 500 species, full of rich colors, grows in the tropical and subtropical zones throughout the world. Most of these species can adapt to harsh environments, such as salty and dry coastal areas. Taken from http://toptropicals.com/ Ipomoea stolonifera (beach morning-glory) Ipomoea stolonifera (IS) is a coastal herb belonging to the Convolvulaceae (morning glory) family (Fig. 6). Like other herbal products, the exact composition of this herb can vary with location, season and even th e altitude where the herbs grow [166, 167]. Even within one genus, extracts of flower s with different colors may vary in their medicinal properties [168, 169]. I. stolonifera normally occurs in tropical and sub-tropical regions, along sandy dunes an d beaches, e.g. the Chaoshan area in Guangdong [170]. Traditionally , it has been used for the treatment of sunstroke, colitis, dysentery and fish puncture wounds, but IS has also been used for the treatment of inflammatory disorders, like rheumatoid arthritis [171]. The actual effective constituents of I. stolonifera are beginning to be elucidated, which is part of the work described in the thesis. In prev ious research, the n-butanol extract of I. stolonifera (BE-IS) was prepared and characteri zed [171]. This extract showed strong anti-inflammatory activity in the carragee nan-induced paw edema test in rats. In 1 Chapter 1 26 order to identify novel and active co mpounds, the BE-IS was subjected to chromatographic analysis and five major constituents were identified based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis: hesperetin and curcumin. Multiple activities for these compounds have been described, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but the therapeutic effectiveness of BE-IS and its five purified components in liver injury has not been elucidated yet. Summary Traditional medicine holds great promise: th e multicomponent nature of traditional medicines has great advantages in the ther apy of many diseases. However, there are also challenges: reconstitution of comp lex mixtures from synthetic, purified compounds may not always reflect the or iginal natural components and minor components may be 'missed'. On the other hand, processing of or iginal preparation to obtain extracts that can be administer ed easily (e.g. preparing extracts), may change the composition of the original prep aration or alter the chemical structure of the active ingredients. In addition, ther e may be batch-to-batch variation between different preparations depending on e.g. season or geographical location. A major challenge will be to identify the optimal composition of complex mixtures. It is often not clear which are the most potent active ingredients or which combination has major therapeutic effects. Therefore the comp lexity and reproducible preparations of natural products still provides significant scientific challeng es [172]. The strict regulation and standa rdization of all aspects of medi cinal plant preparation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) an d the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) hampers the registration and manufacture of herbal products. Another challenge is bridging the gap betw een experimental studies and clinical application. Although the past few decades have witnessed an enormous increase in knowledge from experimental studies, this ha s not been translated in an increase in clinical studies. The reasons for this 'translational gap' are mentioned above: the complexity of natural products and the difficulty in manufacturing specified and reproducible preparations of natural pr oducts. Nevertheless, the prospects for successfully treating patients with liver diseases with valida ted preparations of natural products have never been brighter. Traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of liver diseases 27 Scope of the thesis The aim of this thesis is to investig ate the butanol-extract (BE-IS) form Ipomoea stolonifera and five purified compounds of this extract on acute and chronic liver diseases, in particular inflammatory liver diseases and liver fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. In Chapter 1 , we provide an overview of the most important liver cell types and signaling cascades involved in inflammatory liver diseases and an overview of traditional medicine. In Chapter 2 , we evaluated the hepatoprotective effect of BE-IS and its five individual components on the inflammatory response and bile acid-induced cell death in primary hepatocytes in vitro . We demonstrate that each component of BE-IS displayed differential pr operties. Following this initial screen, hesperetin was selected for detailed investigation. In Chapter 3 , we evaluated the therapeutic properties of hesperetin in tw o mouse models of fulm inant hepatitis: the concanavalin A (Con A) model and D-galactosamine /lipopolysaccharide (D-GalN/LPS) model. We demonstrate a profou nd therapeutic effect of hesperetin in these models of fulminant hepatitis. Fo llowing promising effects of the BE-IS component esculetin on hepatic myofibroblasts in vitro , in Chapter 4 we evaluated esculetin for anti-fibrotic effects in a mouse model of liver fibrosis (CCl 4-induced hepatotoxicity). In Chapter 5 , a follow-up study of the anti-fibrotic effect of esculetin is presented, in which the optimal route of administration and duration of treatment for esculetin were determined. In Chapter 6 , the results of this thesis are discussed focusing on strategies for the treatment of inflammatory liver disorders and hepatic fibrosis and providing an outlook for the app lication of our findings in the treatment of human liver diseases. 1 Chapter 1 28 References [1] Chiang J.

Dept. Pharmacology, Sh antou University Medical College, Shantou, China Manuscript in preparation Chapter 2 42 Abstract Background: Ipomoea stolonifera (IS) is a Chinese herb that has potent anti-inflammatory properties in traditio nal medicine. Liver di seases are almost invariably accompanied by inflammation an d loss of liver function due hepatocyte cell death. Here, we analyzed the effect of the n-butanol extract from IS (BE-IS) and five compounds purified from BE-IS (scopole tin, esculetin, umbelliferone, hesperetin and curcumin) on acid-induced cell death in hepatocytes and macrophages. Methods: Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated from Wistar rats and treated with BE-IS and its 5 purified constituents to analyze the effects on cytokine mixture (CM)-induced inflammation and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA: 50 \u00b5mol/L)-induced cell death. The mouse macrorophage cell line RAW264.7 was treated with lipopolysaccharide to indu ce inflammation. iNOS and HO-1 mRNA used markers for infla mmation and oxidative stress, respectively. Apoptosis was quantified by caspase-3 ac tivity assay and determination of poly by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and its purified compounds nhibited CM-induced inflammation to variable extents. CM-induced iNOS mRNA significantly reduced by curcumin, hesperetin and BE-IS. HO-1 mR NA or PI3k signaling. BE-IS and its constituents do not induce necrotic cell death. Conclusion: Raw extracts of Ipomoea stolonifera and the purified compounds umbelliferone, hesperetin an curcumin have anti-inflammatory on rat hepatocyte s and macrophages. BE-IS is therefore a potential source for therapeutics to tr eat chronic inflammatory liver diseases. Raw extract from the Chinese herb Ipomoea stolonifera and its purified components 43 Introduction The liver plays a fundamental role in ma ny vital functions such as nutrient metabolism, detoxification, energy supply, vitamin A storage and plasma protein synthesis. Maintenance of these liver func tions is therefore crucial to maintain homeostasis and health. In many liver diseases, hepatocytes, the functional parenchymal liver cells, are continuously ex posed to potentially toxic factors such as cytokines as a result of infl ammation, reactive oxygen sp ecies (ROS) as a result of inflammation and/or metabolism of xenobi otics and bile acids as a result of inflammation and/or cholestasis [1, 2]. This exposure to toxic compounds may result in increased apoptotic and/or necrotic cell death of hepatocytes and loss of functional liver mass, compromising the important liver-spec ific functions and homeostasis [3-5]. The continuous loss of functional hepatocytes, accompanied by inflammation, may evolve in liver fibr osis, cirrhosis and eventually primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Alcohol abuse, obes ity, viral hepatitis, drug intoxication and genetic disorders are the most important causes of chronic liver diseases [6, 7]. Currently, effective therapy, aimed at prev enting or attenuating inflammation and loss of functional liver cells is lacking. Thus , there is an urgent need to develop novel and more effective therapies to improve hepatocyte survival and to decrease inflammation in acute and chronic liver diseases. Ipomoea stolonifera is a medicinal herb from the Ch aoshan area, Guangdong province, China. It has been widely used as a tr aditional medicine to treat inflammatory disorders, especially rheumatoid arthriti s [8, 9]. In previous research, we have investigated the n-butanol extract from Ipomoea stolonifera (BE-IS) in mice. It was observed that BE-IS possessed potent anti-i nflammatory activity in acute and chronic inflammation models [10]. Through classical chemical separation techniques, five active compounds have been purified from BE-IS: members of the class of coumarins, Scopoletin, Esculetin and Umbelliferone an d members of the class of flavonoids, Hesperetin and Curcumin (Fig.1). All these compounds possess anti-inflammatory effects both in vivo and in vitro (unpublished data). Although these compounds exhibit several bioactive properties [11-14], only a few studies have been conducted to evaluate its hepatoprotective effects in liver diseases. In the present study, we aim to evaluate the effect of BE-IS and its 5 purified components on primary hepatocytes, and to test their potential to protect hepatocytes against cytoki ne mixture (CM)-induced inflammation and bile acid-induced cell death. In addition, we tested the anti-inflammatory effects of BE-IS and its components in the murine macrophage-derived cell line (RAW264.7). BE-IS and its individual compounds showed a cytoprotective effect on hepatocytes via inhibition of caspase-3 activation and an an ti-inflammatory effect by repressing iNOS mRNA expression in both hepatocytes and RAW264.7 macrophages. BE-IS could also prevent LDH release from hepatocytes. He nce, this class of natural products demonstrate important cell protective and an ti-inflammatory actions in liver diseases 2 Chapter 2 44 that justify its evaluation in in vivo models and, possibly, in clinical trials. Figure 1Structures of the five purified comp ounds from the n-butanol extract from Ipomoea stolonifera (BE-IS). Materials and Methods Cell isolation and culture Primary hepatocytes were isolated from ma le Wistar rats (220-250g) by a two-step collagenase perfusion procedure as descri bed previously [15]. Experiments were performed following the guidelines of th e local Committee for care and use of laboratory animals of the University of Groningen. Hepatocyte viability was more than 85% as determined by trypan blue staining. 112500 cells per cm 2 were plated on Vitrogen\u00ae (Cohesion Technologies Inc, Pa lo Alto, CA, USA) coated plates in William's E medium (Life Technologies Lt d; Breda, The Netherlands) supplemented with 50mg/mL gentamycin (Life Technologies Ltd) and penicillin-streptomycin-fungizone (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium). During the attachment period (4 hrs) 50 nmol/L dexamethasone (S igma, St Louis, USA) and 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone/Thermo) were added to the medium. The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in DMEM Glutamax medi um (Life Technologies Ltd; Breda, Both hepatocytes and RA W264.7 cells were cultured at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2. Experimental design All experiments were started at least 4 ho urs after the attachment period. Cultured primary hepatocytes were first pretreated with the five purified compounds and BE-IS for 30 mins, and then challenged by a cytokine mixture (CM: 20 ng/ml murine Raw extract from the Chinese herb Ipomoea stolonifera and its purified components 45 TNF, 10 ng/ml human IL-1 and 10 ng/ml rat IFN- for 6 hrs or glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA: 50 \u00b5mol/L) for 4 hrs. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS Escherichia coli 055:B5, Sigma 1 \u00b5g/ml) was used to induce an inflammatory response in RAW264.7 macrophages. BE-I S and its individual components were added 30 min prior to the addition of LPS to RAW264.7 cells. Signal transduction pathways were blocked using (LY 294002 at 50 mm ol/L, Calbiochem). All inhibitors were added 30 min before adding stimuli. H 2O2 at 5 mmol/L was used as a positive control for necrotic cell death. Every experimental condition was performed in triplicate wells and each experiment was repeated at least four times using hepatocytes from different isolations. BE-I S was prepared as described previously [10]. Western blot analysis 20 microgram of total cell lysate protein was used for SDS-PAGE followed by semi dry-blotting to transfer protein to nitr ocellulose membrane (Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Following polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Cell Massachusetts, and mouse anti-GAPDH (1:10,000, Calbiochem, VWR, the Netherlands CB1001), Protein bands were using a Chemidoc XRS system (Bio-Rad). Protein band intensities were quantified by Image Lab (Bio-Rad). RNA isolation and quantitative real time PCR RNA was isolated using Tri-reagent (Sigma-A ldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed on 2.5 g of total RNA using random nanomers (Life technolo gies) in a final volume of 50 L. Real time detection was performed on the ABI PRISM 7700 (PE Applied Biosystems) using the Taqman protocol. This protocol includes an initiation phase of 10 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles (15 seconds at 95\u00b0C, and 1 minute at 60\u00b0C). 18S mRNA levels were used as an internal control. Relative gene ex pression was calculated using the Ct method. The primers 2 Chapter 2 46 Apoptosis and necrosis analysis Caspase-3 activity was measured as de scribed previously [16]. The arbitrary fluorescence unit was corrected for the amou nt of protein determined using a protein assay kit (BioRad, Veenendaal, the Netherlands). Cell necrosis was determined by measuring LDH released into the supernatan t of medium of cultured cells compared with LDH content from total cells. LDH acti vity was detected spectrophotometrically at 340 nm for 30 min. Statistical Analysis The data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. T-test and one-way ANOVA were used for analysis. Results were considered statistically different when the P values were equal to or less than 0.05. Results Anti-inflammatory properties of Ipomoea stolonifera n-butanol extract and its purified components Primary cultured hepatocytes were first challenged by a cytokine mixture (CM) to induce an inflammatory state in hepatocytes. Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) mRNA hepatocy te inflammation. The induction of iNOS was decreased significantly, but to different extents by BE-IS and its five components. In particular, curcumin (-98%) and etin expression was dose-dependently repressed by BE-IS up to 95% using the hi ghest concentration of BE-IS (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the the raw (Fig. 2C). Similar anti-inflammatory effects of BE-IS and its purified components were observed on the macr ophage cell line RAW264.7 (Fig.2D). Ipomoea stolonifera purified against bile acid-induced cell death The bile acid glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) at 50 mol/L induces apoptotic cell death of hepatocytes as determined by caspase-3 activity assay. Caspase-3 hrs after GCDCA BE-IS and its purified components except esculetin demonstrat ed a profound reduction of caspase-3 activation induced by GCDCA (F ig. 3A). In particular, hesp eretin proved to be very potent and the detailed investigation of this compound is described in Chapter 5 of this thesis. The anti-apoptotic effect of BE- IS was shown to be dose-dependent (Fig. 3B). The results obtained using the caspase-3 activity assay was confirmed using PARP-cleavage as another marker of apopto sis. Intact PARP (116 kD) is cleaved by caspase-3 into a lower molecular weight fragment of 89 kD. PARP-cleavage was Raw extract from the Chinese herb Ipomoea stolonifera and its purified components 47 almost completely prevented by BE-IS (Fig. 3C). Figure 2.

In fact, the raw extract BE-IS tended to decrease LDH release in GCDCA-treated cells, indicating that BE-IS was truly protective and did not induce a shift from apoptotic to necrotic cell death (Fig. 4A). Likewise , BE-IS and its components did not induce cell death in cytokine mixture-treated hepatocytes, again indicating that the anti-inflammatory effect was not due to mo dulation of cell viability (Fig. 4B). The protective effect of BE-IS is not dependent on the ERK1/2, p38 and PI3K pathways In order to find out whether specific kinase pathways are involved in the protection Raw extract from the Chinese herb Ipomoea stolonifera and its purified components 49 of BE-IS, inhibitors of three kinases, known to be involved in the regulation of cell death (ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase and PI3-kinase) were ad ded 30 min before GCDCA exposure. As depicted in Fig. 4C, none of the inhibitors had any effect on the anti-apoptotic action of BE-IS. Figure 4. (A, B) GCDCA and cytokine mixture do not in duce necrotic cell death as determined by LDH leakage and BE-IS and its constituents do not in duce a shift from apoptotic towards necrotic cell death. In fact, BE-IS appears to reduce the low le vel of necrotic cell death even further. (C) The protective effect of BE-IS is not dependent on the activation of ERK1/2, p38 and PI3K pathways. Doses of BE-IS used are 26.24, 52.48 and 104.96 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. The concentration of individual components is 50 mol/L. Experiments were performed with hepatocytes from 4 different hepatocyte Scopoletin (Sco), (*p<0.05 compared to GCDCA, #p<0.05 compared to control). Discussion In chronic liver injury, a vicious cycle of inflammation, oxidative stress and hepatocyte cell death occurs: chronic liver inflammation leads oxidative stress and to hepatocyte cell death and, in turn, produc ts of dead and/or damaged hepatocytes may drive inflammation. The continuous inflammation and wound healing response in chronic liver diseases may lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and, ultimately, primary hepatocellular carcinoma [18]. In chronic liver diseases, hepatocytes may die from either apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Apoptotic or programmed cell death is executed by caspases that mediate the dest ruction of intracellular substrates leading 2 Chapter 2 50 to cell death [19-21]. Any effective interven tion to treat chronic liver diseases must therefore be aimed at protecting the hepa tocyte against apoptotic and/or necrotic death and reducing inflammation and accomp anying generation of oxidative stress. Unfortunately, at present, no such in terventions exist in clinical practice. Natural products are increasingly considered in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, including chronic liver diseases. In general, natural products are complex mixtures of bi oactive compounds that usually act synergistically. Therefore, isolated compounds of these mixtures are frequently not or only partially effective compared to raw extracts of natural products. In previous research, we have investigated the n-butanol extract from Ipomoea stolonifera (BE-IS) in murine models of inflammation [10]. It was observed that BE-IS possessed potent anti-inflammatory activity in acute and chron ic inflammation models [10]. Five active compounds have been purified from BE-IS: the scopoletin, these compounds exhibit several bioactive properti es [11-14], only few studies have been conducted to evaluate its hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in liver diseases. In the present study we observed that the BE-IS and some of its purified components have strong cytoprotective and anti-infla mmatory properties. The BE-IS significantly reduced apoptotic of hepatocytes indu ced by the bile acid GCDCA. This effect was mimicked by the components hesperetin, scopoletin, curcumin and umbelliferone, but not by the coumarin esculetin. At present, it is not clear why esculetin differs from the other coumarins in terms of cytoprotection. Possible explanations include an intrinsic differe nce in anti-apoptotic potency between different members of the coumarin family or differences in uptake between different coumarins leading to different intracellula r concentrations. Hesperetin appeared to be the most potent cytoprotectant and was able to reduce apoptotic cell death to the s a m e e x t e n t a s B E - I S . O f n o t e , n e i t h e r B E -IS nor its purified constituents caused a shift towards necrotic cell death, indicating that these compounds are truly protective. Hesperetin, together with cu rcumin also appeared to be the most powerful anti-inflammatory component of BE-IS, both in hepatocytes and in RAW264.7 macrophages. The RAW264.7 cell line is a mouse macrophage cell line that is often used to represent macrophages. In the liver, the largest populations of macrophages are the liver-specific Kupffer cells. Phenotypically, Kupffer cells differ from other macrophage populations, alth o u g h t h e y d o h a v e m o s t m a c r o p h a g e functions like phagocytosis an d LPS-induced cytokine (TNF ) production. Therefore, our findings with RAW264.7 macrophages ne ed to be confirmed in Kupffer cells. Flavonoids like hesperetin a r e p o t e n t s c a v e n g e r s o f r e a c t i v e o x y g e n s p e c i e s . I t remains to be elucidated whet her the anti-inflammatory action of hesperetin is due to its ROS-scavenging potential or whethe r alternative mechanisms underlie its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions. Interestingly, curcumin and hesperetin are also the only purified co mpounds that are able to induce the anti-oxidant gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). HO-1 has been to be a protective and anti-oxidant gene Raw extract from the Chinese herb Ipomoea stolonifera and its purified components 51 [22] and, of note, a reciprocal regulation of the inflammatory marker iNOS and HO-1 has been observed in intestin al epithelial cells previously [23]. Thus, hesperetin and curcumin could contribute to cell protec tion and reduced inflammation by both direct scavenging of ROS (as flavonoids) as well as indirectly by inducing HO-1. Previously, we have shown that increased expression of HO-1 is protective against ROS-induced cell death, in part via its pr oduct carbon monoxide [22]. It is important to note that the strongest inducer of HO-1 is the raw extract BE-IS, although we did not evaluate the combination of hesperetin and curcumin. In the current study we used the bile acid GCDCA as inducer of apop totic cell death, but it is clear that the cytoprotective actions of BE-IS and the co mpounds hesperetin and curcumin need to be evaluated in models of ROS-induced cell death as well. The protective and anti-inflammatory actions of curcumin need to be interpreted with caution, since the major obstacle of its use in clinical development is the oral bioavailability and increasing the dosage of curcumin has been prohibited due to its toxicity, including the induction of dama ge to nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and the inhibition of drug-metabolizing glucuronosyl- transferase [24]. With the mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions of BE-IS and its constituents more re search is needed. None of the inhibitors of known signal transduction kinases lik e p38, ERK1/2 and PI-3-Kinase modulated the actions of BE-IS and its constituents on inflammation and cell death. In hepatocytes, p38, ERK1/2 and PI-3-kinas e all protect against apoptosis [16]. This would indicate that these pathways are not involved in the p r o t e c t i o n b y B E - I S , o r t h a t B E - I S a n d its constituents remove the immediate downstream apoptotic trigger of GCDCA, making it obsolete for hepatocytes to activate these protective pathways. All in all, we show that BE-IS and its co nstituents hesperetin and curcumin display potent cytoprotective and anti-inflammat ory actions. Since curcumin has been associated with toxicity in clinical trials, hesperetin could be the component of choice to evaluate in in vivo models of chronic liver diseases and eventually, in clinical trials. Therefore, we evaluated hesperetin in more detail in an in vivo model of inflammation, described in chapter 3 of this thesis. 2 Chapter 2 52 References [1] Szabo G, Csak T.

Therapeutic approaches targeting both hepatocyte injury and inflammation are not available. Natural compounds are consid ered as potential treatment for inflammatory liver diseases . Hesperetin, a flavonoid component of citrus fruits has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of hesperetin both in vitro and in models of fulminant hepatitis. Methods: Apoptotic cell death and inflammation were induced in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes by bile acids and cyto kine mixture, respectively. Apoptosis quantified by caspase-3 activity necr osis release. The concanavalin A (ConA) and D-galactosamine/LPS (D-GalN/LP S) were used as models of fulminant hepatitis. Liver injury was assessed by ALT and AST levels, liver histology and TUNEL assay and inflammation by hesperetin improved liver histology and protected injury in ConA- and D-GalN / LPS-induced fulminant hepatitis, as assessed by TUNEL assay an d serum AST and ALT levels. Hesperetin also reduced expression of the inflammato ry marker iNOS and the expression and serum levels of TNF and IFN- , the main mediators cell toxicity fulminant hepatitis. Conclusion: Hesperetin has anti-inflammatory an d cytoprotective actions in models of acute liver toxicity. Hesperetin therefore has therapeutic potential for the treatment of inflammatory liver diseases ac companied by extensive hepatocyte injury, such as fulminant hepatitis. The protective effect of hesperetin against fulminant hepatitis in vivo and in vitro 57 Introduction Hesperetin is a natural compound belonging to the flavanone class of flavonoids. It is the aglycone -7-rutinoside of ), a predominant flavonoid component of citrus fruits (Fig.1). It is no w well accepted that a low consumption of fatty foods and an increased intake of fruit and vegetables will reduce the risk of some life-threatening diseases and maintain a good health status [1]. World-wide, the dieteray intake of citrus fruit products, and hence flavanones, is increasing every year [2]. In Western countries, the intake of hesperetin is largely dependent on dietary habits [3], whereas hesperetin is al so known as a major active ingredient in the Chinese traditional medicinal herb Chenpi [4]. Because of the reported bioactivities, extensive research has been performed on hesperidin and hesperetin in various experimental models. These bioactivities include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects [5, 6]. Figure 1. Structures of hesperitin and hesperidin Most liver diseases are accompanied by inflammation and oxidative stress, regardless of the etiology of the underl ying disorder. Mild and time-restricted hepatic inflammation could be considered beneficial in the restoration of tissue homeostasis, e.g. by eliminating invadi ng pathogenic organisms and damaged or dead cells. However, excessive and uncont rolled inflammation leads to massive loss of hepatocytes as a result of apoptosis and/ or necrosis [7] irreversible damage to the liver parenchyma and loss of liver function [8]. Loss of hepatocytes and loss of liver function occurs in many liver pathologies, including fulminant hepatitis, reperfusion injury, (non-)alcoholic liver diseases, ch olestasis and viral hepatitis. All these conditions demonstrate high morbidity and mortality and liver transplantation is often the only life-saving treatment [9, 10]. The management of acute and chronic inflammatory liver disease is still a challe nge to modern drug development, because there are currently no effective treatments that improve liver function and/or 3 Chapter 3 58 regenerate or protect hepatic cells [11]. Ther efore, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that prevent liver injury via protection against hepatocyte cell death. In particular, the potential of herbal and dietar y supplements, like hesperetin has been largely unexplored in this regard. Although hesperidin possesses a wide rang e of biological activities, including hepatoprotective properties in liver injury [12-14], its aglycone-d erivative hesperetin has stronger bioactivity as a result of mo re efficient absorption from the intestine than hesperidin [15-17], [18]. Existing st udies are mainly focused on one specific in vivo or in vitro model [19, 20], but comprehensiv e reports on the effectiveness of different doses of orally administered hesperetin in multiple models of fulminant hepatitis are lacking. In viral and autoimmu ne hepatitis, activation of T-cells and macrophages is the initial event [21]. Experimental liver injury models were established that resemble fulminan t human hepatitis, including TNF - and IFN--dependent inflammatory liver injury models that allow the evaluation of hepatoprotective interventions, including medicinal plant components. In our study, immune-mediated liver injury was induced by the T-cell mitogenic plant lectin concanavalin A (Con A). Liver injury in this model is dependent on both macrophage-derived TNF and T-cell-derived IFN- . In this model the expression of various cytokines is strongly induced, including IFN- , IL-4, and IL-2 [22]. As a s e c o n d m o d e l , w e u s e d a n i n f l a m m a t i o n -induced model of fulminant hepatitis. Endotoxins like LPS are known as strong stimulators of macrophages, including Kupffer cells. TNF alone does not induce hepatocyte cell death. However, when hepatocytes are simultaneously of massive apoptosis of hepatocytes [23]. The aim of the present study was to investigate the hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of hesperetin in acute liver injury. We demonstrate that hesperetin is anti-inflammatory and cytoprot ective, in part by repression hepa titis and TNF expression in the TNF-dependent D-GalN/LPS model of liver injury. Methods Animals Male Wistar rats (220-250g) were purchase d from Harlan (Zeist, the Netherlands) Experiments were performed after approval by and following the guidelines of the local Committee for Care and Use of Labo ratory Animals of the University of Groningen. 6 week-old male BALB/c mice (20-22g) were obtained from Hunan SJA Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd (Changsha, China NO. 43004700009427). All animals received humane care according to the le gal requirements and guidelines approved by the ethics committee for the animal fac ility of Shantou University Medical College. All studies involving animals are report ed in accordance with the ARRIVE The protective effect of hesperetin against fulminant hepatitis in vivo and in vitro 59 guidelines for reporting experiments invo lving animals [24, 25]. All animals were maintained under controlled conditions an d had free access to standard laboratory chow and water. Hepatocyte isolation Hepatocytes were isolated from Wistar rat by a two-step collagenase perfusion procedure as described previously [26]. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining and was more than 85%. 112,500 cells per cm 2 w e r e p l a t e d o n Vitrogen\u00ae-coated plates in William's E medi um (Life Technologies Ltd; Breda, The Netherlands) supplemented with 50 \u00b5gmL gentamycin and penicillin-streptomycin-fungizone (Lonza, Ve rviers, Belgium). Duri ng the attachment period (4 h) 50 nmol L-1 dexamethasone (Sigma, St Louis, USA) and 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies Ltd) were added to the medium. Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2. In vitro studies Experiments were started after the attachme nt period of 4 hours. Monolayers of cultured primary hepatocytes were trea ted with different concentrations of hesperetin (10, 25, 50 \u00b5mol L-1) to analyze the effect rIFN-)-induced inflammation for 6 h. As in vitro model of cell death we used gl ycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA: 50 \u00b5mol L-1)-induced cell death for 4 h. GCDCA-induced cell death is independent of any inflammation and induces mainly apop tosis [27]. Signal transduction pathways the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY 294002 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA). All inhibitors and receptor antagonists were added to the cultured hepatocytes 30 minutes prior to the apoptotic or inflammato ry stimuli. Every experimental condition was performed in triplicate wells and each experiment was repeated at least four times using hepatocytes from different rats . Cells were harvested at the indicated time points using lysis buffer for protein assay or TriZol reagent for RNA isolation. Liver injury experimental models After 7 days of adjusting, the animals were randomly divided into 10 experimental groups. Control group (n=8): These animals were tr eated with the equivalent volume of PBS as used for the administrati on of Con A and D-GalN/LPS. Control hesperetin group (n=8): The mice were administered hesperetin 400 mg kg -1 p.o in 0.5% CMC-Na solution for 10 days. 3 Chapter 3 60 Con A group (n=15): The animals were admini stered the same volume of CMC-Na as used for administration of hesperetin fo r 10 days and were challenged with Con A (i.v.15mg kg-1). Con A + hesperetin groups: The animals rece ived various doses of hesperetin (100, 200, 400 mg kg-1) orally for 10 days before Con A injection (each group n=15). D-GalN/LPS group (n=15): The animals were administered CMC-Na for 10 days and intraperitoneally injected with D-GalN (700 mg kg-1)/LPS (5 g kg-1). D-GalN/LPS + hesperetin groups: Three doses of hesperetin (100, 200, 400 mg kg-1) were given to mice once per day for 10 days. D-GalN (700mg kg-1)/LPS (5 g kg-1) were administered group n=15). Con A from Canavalia ensiformis (Jack bean) Type IV, lyophilized powder (Sigma ( Escherichia coli 055:B5; Sigma L2880) and D-(+)-Galactosamine hydrochloride (Sigma G1639) were diluted in sterile endotoxin-free PBS. Mice were hesperetin (3', 5, 7-Tr Afar PBS containing 0.5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose CMC-Na (Aladdin) orally for 10 days once per day. Con A (15 mg kg-1) was injected intravenously, and D-GalN (700 mg kg-1)/LPS (5 g kg-1) was administered intraperitoneally. Animals were sacrific ed 8 h after the challenge. Blood was collected and the whole liver was harvested. The left lateral lobe was used for routine histology and the remaining lobes were frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80\u00b0C for RNA isolation and protein assays. Serum was separated by centrifugation (15 min at 4,000 rpm) and used for serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (A ST) determination and ELISA assays. Routine histological analysis Liver tissue was fixed in 4% paraformal dehyde, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned paraffin sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated following routine methods, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE). TUNEL assay Apoptotic cell death was determined on paraffin-embedded sections of liver tissue b y t h e p r e s e n c e o f f r e e 3 ' - h y d r o x y g r o u p s b y T U N E L a s s a y u s i n g D e a d E n d Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega, Beij ing, China). The assays were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. For ea ch liver tissue section, the number of TUNEL-positive cells in 3 random 20x-objecti ve high-powered fields (containing at least one portal triad and central vein each) was counted by an investigator blinded with respect to treatment group using an Olympus IX81 microscope (Olympus, Japan). The protective effect of hesperetin against fulminant hepatitis in vivo and in vitro 61 Serum biochemical parameters Activities of serum aminotransferases (ALT , AST) and total bilirubin (TBil) were determined by Bio-sinew kits (Chengdu, China) on Automatic Chemistry Analyzer (Accute TBA-40FR, Toshiba Medical System s Corporation, were assayed for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA ) as described by the manufacturer. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) RNA was isolated from mouse liver tissue using TriZol Reagent (TaKaRa, Japan). After using PrimeScript TM RT reagent with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, Japan), quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) of liver tissue was performed using SYBR Green reagent (TaKaRa, Japan) on PC R detection system (ABI 7500, Applied Biosystems, USA). Rat mRNA from hepa tocytes was isolated control Applied Biosystems, The Netherlands). Mice primers and rat primers and probes are described in Table 1. Gene expression in vivo was normalized with respect to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogena se (GAPDH) and 18S for hepatocytes shown relative to control values. Western blot analysis Protein extracts from liver were prepar ed by homogenization in RIPA lysis buffer (P0013B Beyotime, Jiangsu, China). 50 microgram of protein from each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filter membranes. Following blocking, membranes were probed with primary antibodies: mouse anti-iNOS rabbit monoclonal antibody 1: 2,000 (Cell Signaling Technology, USA), mouse anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Ty r185) rabbit monoclonal antibody 1:2,000 (Cell Signaling Technology, anti-SAPK/JNK rabbit monoclonal antibody 1:3,000 (Cell anti-GAPDH antibody 1:3,000 (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing). Al l primary antibody incubations were overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by detect ion using HRP-conjugated secondary mouse antibody 1:60,000 and rabbit antibody 1:80,000 (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing) at room temperature for 1 h. Total hepatocyte lysates were analyzed for Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (1:1,000 Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, Massachusetts, USA). Analysis of hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis Measurement of caspase-3 activity was as described previously [26]. The arbitrary fluorescence unit was corrected for the amou nt of protein using BioRad protein assay kit. Cell necrosis was determined by meas uring LDH release according to standard laboratory protocol. Briefly, 100 l medium was loaded in 96-well plates followed by 3 Chapter 3 62 addition of pyruvate and NADH. LDH acti vity was detected by absorbance at 340 nm for 30 min. The linear portion of the kinetic curve was calculated compared to a standard curve. Data and statistical analysis The data were expressed as mean \u00b1 stan dard error of the mean. One-way ANOVA and t-test were used to analyze the results. Results were considered statistically different when the P values were equal to or less than 0.05. Results Hesperetin has anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects on rat acid 50 hepatocytes vity peaking after 4 h exposure [23, 28]. This model of apoptosis was used because it is not accompanied by inflammation and GCDCA does not activate NF- B and therefore, any cytoprotective effect of hesperetin is independent of an effect on inflammation. Hesperetin was added 30 min prior to GCDCA and the effect on GCDCA-induced caspase-3 activity was investigated 4 hours after GCDCA exposure Hesperetin dose-dependently reduced hepatocytes (Fig.2 inhibition (-80%) was observed at 50 mol L-1 hesperetin. Therefore, this concentration of hesperetin was used in subs equent analyses. Hesperetin alone, at 50 molL-1, did not modulate caspase-3 activity. In concordance, GCDCA induced cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate PA RP, which was effectively inhibited by hesperetin (Fig. 2B). The anti-apoptotic e ffect of hesperetin was not accompanied by an increase in necrotic cell death as neither GCDCA, nor hesperetin nor the combination GCDCA and hesperetin induced LDH release from hepatocytes (Fig. 2C). To investigate the role of specific signal transduction pathways in the protective effect of hesperetin, we used several inhibitors of MAP Kinases and PI3K. Importantly, the protective effect of he speretin against GCDCA-induced apoptosis was not abolished by inhibition of either ER K, p38 or 25 and 50 molL -1, respectively) indicating that hesperetin also has potent anti-inflammato ry properties (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, hesperetin induced expression of anti-oxidant gene Hmox1 (HO-1) about 4-fold compared to cytokine mixture alone (Fig. 2E). The protective effect of hesperetin against fulminant hepatitis in vivo and in vitro 63 Figure 2.

Hesperetin attenuates Con A-mediated hepatitis To translate our in vitro findi ngs into an in vivo model, we first tested the effect of hesperetin on Con A-induced liver dama ge. The morphological observations are shown in Fig. 3A. Macroscopically, hesperet in reversed the dark surface color of livers with passive congestion induced by Con A (Fig. 3A). Microscopically, areas of active hepatocellular degeneration and necr osis are observed, presenting single or multiple foci of pale-staining groups of hepatocytes. In addition, congestion and inflammation (infiltration of mononuclear ce lls along with neutroph ils) of pericentral areas is observed (Fig. 3B). Due to the limited pe riod after Con A challenge, a normal 3 Chapter 3 64 Figure 3. Hesperetin dose-dependently protects agai nst Con A-mediated fulminant hepatitis.

These microscopic abnormalities were prevented or reversed by hesperetin (Fig. 3B). In fact, the histology of Con A-treated groups that received 200 and 400 mg kg-1 hesperetin was similar to normal liver histology. The number of infiltrating leukocytes in liver tissues of mice with Con A induced fulminant hepatitis are significantly decrea sed by hesperetin, especially in portal venous areas (Fig.3C). Serum ALT and AST were increased 75- and 6-fold, after Con A treatment. Hesp dose-dependently attenuated the Con A-induced increase of serum AST, ALT and TBil (Fig. 3D, E). The protective effect of hesperetin was para lleled by a significant dose-dependent decrease of serum IFN- levels (Fig. 3F). Con A treatment also increased TNF and interleukin-4 (IL-4) (Fig. 3F). Co-treatment with hesperetin reduced the serum levels of these cytokines as well, albeit to a lower extent compared to IFN- . IL-6 and IL-10 serum levels were hardly affected by Con A treatment and hesperetin has only minor effects on the serum levels of cytokines necrosis, Con A induced hepa tocyte apoptosis, as detected by TUNEL staining and wh ich was markedly reduced by co-treatment hesperetin 200 mg kg-1 Nos2 ) expression C).

Hesperetin protects mice from D-GalN/LPS induced liver injury Another well-characterized murine model of acute liver failure is LPS administration to D-GalN-sensitized mice. In this model, hesperetin showed a protective effect as demonstrated by the reversal of the darker surface of the livers as blood-filled on macroscopic appearance (Fig. 6A). In addition, hesperetin improved histology in HE-stained tissue sections. Hesperetin decr eased the extent of piecemeal necrosis around central veins and the loss of norm al morphology. Hesperetin co-treatment also decreased the occurrence of apoptoti c bodies, hydropic de generation, nuclear fragments, autolysis and hemorrhage (Fig. 6B ). The number of leukocytes infiltrated in liver tissue of mice with D-GalN/LPS in duced fulminant hepatitis are significantly decreased by hesperetin (Fig.6C). Serum ma rkers of liver injury (AST, ALT) were reduced by hesperetin co-treatment, but he speretin did not attenuate the increased levels of TBil (Fig. 6D, E). Remarkably, in this model hesperetin was most protective at 200 mg kg-1. Treatment with both 100 mg kg-1 as well as 400 mg kg-1 hesperetin resulted in less complete or no protection at all compared to 200 mg kg-1 hesperetin (Fig. 6A,B,C,D,E). ELISA assay on serum sa mples a clear reduction of LPS/D-GalN-induced TNF level by hesperetin at 200 mg kg-1, but not at 100 or 400 mg kg-1. The effect of hesperetin on the se rum levels of other cytokines (IL-6, IL-10) was less conclusive (Fig. 6F). 3 Chapter 3 68 Figure 6.

Moreover, the D-GalN /LPS-induced activation of pro-apoptotic JNK was reduced by 49% by hesperetin treatment (200 mg kg-1) (Fig. 7B). D-GalN/LPS-induced acute liver failure is characterized by a strong inflammatory response. Indeed, hepatic mRNA levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF , IL-6 were all strongly induced afte r D-GalN/LPS treatment and this induction was reduced by hesperetin by -61%, -68% and -75%, respectively (Fig. 7C). To better characterize the molecular mechanisms unde rlying the protection of hesperetin, selective genes were determined by qPCR . Both FasL and TLR-4 expression were increased in the D-GalN/LPS model and this increased expression was attenuated by hesperetin at 200 mg kg-1. The endotoxin receptor TL R-4 and FasL are on macrophages in the liver, incl uding Kupffer cells and immune cells and reflect increased inflammation. The effects of hesperetin on the expression of these markers indicate decreased inflammation (Fig. 7C). To determine whether hesperetin is also effective when administered after the challenge (therapeutic effect), we performed a proof of concept study in which hesperetin was given 1 hour and 3.5 hours after D-Gal/LPS challenge. In this pilot experiment, using Kunming mice, hesperet in significantly reduced AST and ALT levels compared to treatment with D-GalN/LPS alone (data not shown). 3 Chapter 3 70 Figure 7.

Discussion Use of herbal preparations can be traced back over centuries and has been described in ancient Egypt, China, India and Sumeri a [29]. It is an important component of complementary and alternative medical therap ies, together with dietary supplements [30] and many people consider herbal remedi es as natural and free of side-effects and beneficial for health maintenance [31, 32]. Therefore, the popularity of complementary and alternative medical therapies is increasing every year. Hesperetin is a bioactive flav anone in citrus fruits and its consumption is increasing worldwide [2], although a sy stematic evaluation of ora lly administered hesperetin for the treatment of liver diseases, in partic ular fulminant hepatitis is still lacking. In the present study, we investigated the prot ective effect of hesperetin on hepatic injury using both in vivo and in vitro models. We demonstrated that hesperetin protected hepatocytes against apoptosis in an inflammation-independent model of bile acid-induced apoptosis and reduced markers of NF- B activation like iNOS, indicative of inflammatory signaling in bo th macrophages as well as hepatocytes. Furthermore, hesperetin proved to be protec tive in two models of fulminant hepatitis, reducing both inflammation and cell injury. Virtually all liver diseases are acco mpanied by inflammation. Mild and time-restricted hepatic inflammation co ntributes to the restoration of tissue homeostasis. In contrast, continuous and un controlled inflammation leads to massive loss of hepatocytes and loss of liver function [8] as a result of apoptosis or necrosis [33]. Inflammation and hepatocyte death results in a vicious cycle: inflammation drives hepatocyte injury and death via in creased generation of apoptotic cytokines and reactive oxygen species by inflammatory cells, whereas debris of injured and dead hepatocytes drive inflammation. Because of this vicious cycle, any treatment for liver injury should ideally combine anti-i nflammatory actions on inflammatory cells and cytoprotective actions on hepatocyte s. Natural products are increasingly considered in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, we described the anti-inflammatory activity of the n-butanol extract from Ipomoea stolonifera in acute models of inflammation [34]. The n-butanol extract of Ipomoea stolonifera contains five major components, including hesperetin. In preliminary in vitro experiments, hesperetin de monstrated to have potent anti-inflammatory activity. Th erefore, hesperetin was chosen to be evaluated in this study for the treatment of inflammatory liver diseases. 3 Chapter 3 72 Hesperetin protected hepatocytes agains t bile is dependent on the mitochondrial pathway and is accompanied by the activation of mitochondria-specific caspase-9. Importantly, GCDCA does not induce an inflammatory response in hepatocytes, demonstrating that the cytoprotective effect of hesperet in is independent of any anti-inflammatory effect of hesperetin. Furthermore, the protec tive effect of hesperetin was independent of ERK MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase and PI3K signaling. Previously, we reported on the protective effect of the therapeutic bi le acid tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) on GCDCA-induced apoptosis, which is signaling [35, 36]. Therefore, hesperetin and TUDCA act via different mechanisms and the combination of hesperetin and TU DCA may be even more protective than either compound alone. In our study, we determined apoptosis by measuring caspase-3 activity and cleavage of the casp ase-3 substrate PARP. So far, in all our studies we always observed a strict correlation between caspase-3 activity and end-points of apoptosis, such as nuclear condensation. Importantly, the reduction of apoptotic cell death by hesperetin was not ac companied by an increase in alternative modes of cell death, such as necrosis as determined by LDH release. To further dissect the anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects of hesperetin, we also evaluated the effect of hesperetin on the cytokine-ind uced inflammatory response NF- etin inhibited the induction of Nos2 by cytokines in hepatocytes. Of note, the cytokine mixture alone or in combination with hesperetin did not indu ce any apoptosis in hepatocytes, again underscoring the independency of the anti -inflammatory and cytoprotective effects of hesperetin. Interestingly, hesperetin induced HO-1 expression, suggesting an opposite effect of hesperetin on iNOS and HO-1 regulation. A reciprocal regulation of iNOS and HO-1 was previously describe d in intestinal epithelial cells [37]. The induction of HO-1 by hesperetin could, in fact, contribute to the protective effect of hesperetin, since HO-1 is known as a protec tive and anti-oxidant gene [38, 39]. The in vitro effects of hesperetin were co nfirmed in two mouse models, the T-cell/IFN- -mediated model of Con A-induce d fulminant hepatitis and TNF-mediated model of D-GalN/LPS-induced fu lminant hepatitis [21, 40]. In these models, animals were sacrificed 8 h after th e challenge, permitting the monitoring of changes in hepatic mRNA expression and apoptosis [41, 42]. Apoptotic signaling is tran mainly via the \"death receptor\" superfamily, including cing ligand (TRAIL) [43]. LPS leads to rapid activation of macrophages and high expression of TNF in macrophages [44]. TNF cytotoxicity is particularly impo rtant in hepatic injury and this resistance is mainly dependent on intact NF- B-signaling [27]. Therefore, in models of acute TNF toxicity, NF- B signaling needs to be suppressed and this is usually accomplished by D-GalN or actinomycin D. In the D-GalN/LPS model of fulminant The protective effect of hesperetin against fulminant hepatitis in vivo and in vitro 73 hepatitis, we observed a very strong inflammatory response, accompanied by extensive liver damage and hepatocyte cell death. Both the inflammatory response and cell injury were strongly inhibited by hesperetin. At least part of the protective effect of hesperetin is due to suppression of inflammation as indicated by reduced leukocyte infiltration and reduced expre ssion of apoptotic cytokines like TNF and FasL and reduced expression of endo toxin receptor TLR-4 and the apoptotic ligand FasL. It has previously been shown that Fas/FasL interactions contribute to inflammation in chronic cholestatic liver in jury [45]. The reduction in hepatic TLR-4 and FasL expression could be the result of diminished expression of these receptors on inflammatory cells, and/or a reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells due to less cellular injury in the liver. On the other hand, we cannot exclude a direct cytoprotective effect of hesperetin on hepatocytes, as observed in GCDCA-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. Interestingly, in preliminary experi ments using Kunming mice, we also demonstrated that hesperetin protects against D-GalN/LPS-induced fulminant hepatitis when given twice at 200 mg kg -1 (1 h and 3.5 h) after challenge, indicating that hesperetin is also therapeu tically effective (data not shown). Although hesperetin protects against apoptoti c cell death, the dominant mode of cell death in our models of fulminant hepatiti s appears to be necrotic cell death. Although apoptotic cell death was convinci ngly demonstrated in both models by counting TUNEL-positive cells and measur ing caspase-3 activity, the extent of apoptotic cell death is probably limited compared to necrotic cell death in these models. Nevertheless, both indicators of apoptotic cell death were reduced by hesperetin, indicating that hesperetin also prevents apoptotic cell death in vivo . Therefore, in our models of fulminant he patitis, the main protective effect of hesperetin is probably via its action on inflammatory cells resulting in the attenuation of the inflammatory response , less production of inflammatory and apoptotic cytokines and less generation of reac tive oxygen species. It should be noted that the contribution of necrotic and apoptotic cell death varies between different liver diseases and that apoptosis is especially relevant in mild to moderate hepatitis like viral hepatitis, (non-)alcoholic steato hepatitis, whereas necrosis is dominant in fulminant hepatitis and acetaminophen intoxication. Several studies have convincingly demo nstrated signaling through the c-Jun N-terminal ated that hepatic injury was markedly decreased in mice lacking JNK2 [48] although JNK1 has also been implicated in TNF hepatitis [44]. Additionally, JNK is essential for deve lopment of hepatitis and is required for TNF expression in hematopoietic cells includ ing resident inflammatory cells in the liver (e.g. Kupffer cells and NKT cells) [49] . Administration of hesperetin attenuated hepatic activation of JNK as determined by Western blot analysis for phosphorylated JNK1/2 (Fig. 6B). It has been demonstrated recently that JNK is also involved in 3 Chapter 3 74 necrotic cell death and that inhibition of JN K attenuates necrotic liver injury [50, 51]. our study we observe activation (phosp horylation) of JNK and a reduction of JNK activation by hesperetin. Therefore, we conc lude that hesperetin can directly inhibit necrotic cell death via inhibition of JNK activation. JNK can be activated by numerous agents, including TNF , Fas/FasL, reactive oxygen species and bile acids. Therefore, in our models of fulminant hepatitis, with increased expression of TNF and other inflammatory cytokines, as well as generation of reactive oxygen species, it is very likely that JNK is activated via one or more of these ligands. In contrast to the D-GalN/LPS treatment, th e major contributors to liver injury in the Con A model are non-soluble membrane-bound TNF expressed on macrophages (Kupffer cells) [52] and IFN- , expressed in T cells like natural killer T (NKT) cells, which are particularly abundant in the liver . Indeed, high expression of several T-cell cytokines, including IFN- , IL-4 and IL-2 has been implicated in Con A-induced hepatitis. Tagawa et al. showed that Con A hepatitis is suppressed in IFN- -/- mice [53]. In hepatitis B virus-induced hepatiti s, NKT cells are recruited to the hepatic parenchyma and contribute to inflammati on by releasing cytokines like IL-4 and IFN- [54]. In addition to having a dire ct toxic effect on hepatocytes, IFN- may also sensitize liver cells to TNF -mediated toxicity. Of note, our data demonstrate that hesperetin significantly and dose-depen dently reduce serum levels and mRNA expression of IFN- and serum level of IL-4. These data support the conclusion that therapeutic administration of hesper etin can also be considered for immune-mediated liver injury and that hesperetin also affects T-cells. The anti-inflammatory action of hesperetin in Con A-induced fulminant hepatitis is underscored by the reduction of iNOS, a marker for inflammation [55]. This finding paralleled the in vitro observation, although in the Con A model we did not distinguish between hepatocyte and Kupffer ce ll expression of iNOS. It is likely that expression of iNOS in both cell popula tions is reduced. Preliminary experiments indicate that hesperetin also reduces iNOS expression in the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (data not shown). The protective effect of hesperetin against fulminant hepatitis in vivo and in vitro 75 Figure 8. Potential mechanism of hesperet in in fulminant hepatitis. In acute and chronic liver injury, activation and infiltration of inflammatory cells (K upffer cells, neutrophils) and death of functional hepatocytes occurs. Hesperetin protects hepato cytes from 'death receptors' and IFN- , produced by T cells like Natural Killer T (NKT) cells. Hesperetin has both anti-inflammatory effects on inflammatory cells and protective effects on hepatocytes and these effects are independent. The anti -apoptotic effects of hesperetin are in part due to reduced activation of the pro-apoptotic MAP kinase JNK. In Fig.8, we propose a potential mechanism of the protective action of hesperetin in fulminant hepatitis. It is important to stre ss that we propose effects of hesperetin on both the inflammatory and T-cell populati ons as well as on the hepatocytes. In summary, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of hesperetin in fulminant hepatitis based on both anti-inflammatory actions of hesperetin on inflammatory cells as well as direct cytoprotective effe cts of hesperetin on hepatocytes. Therefore, hesperetin has the potential to stop the vicious cycle of infl ammation causing cell death and cell death leading to more inflammation as observed in many inflammatory liver diseases. We propose that hesperetin is a promising candidate to be evaluated in clinical studies for the treatment of inflammatory liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, (non-)alcoholic steatohepatitis and fulminant hepatitis. 3 Chapter 3 76 References [1] Parr AJ, Bolwell GP.

Liver fibrosis is caused by overactive hepatic myofibroblasts, but is reversible when th e disease-causing insult is abrogated. However, no drugs are available that support resolution of hepatic fibrosis. Esculetin (6,7-dihydroxy-coumarin) is a natural comp has anti-inflammatory, suppresses the transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts. we studied the effect of esculetin on hepatic myofibroblasts and CCl 4-induced liver fibrosis in primary rat HSC d portal myofibroblasts (PMF) were exposed to esculetin. C57BL/6 mice were treated for 4 weeks with CCl 4 with esculetin co-treatment (5, 10 or 20 g/g) during the last 2 weeks. Results: Esculetin inhibited proliferation and expression of activation markers (Col1a1/ of in vitro even below levels observed in 2 week CCl 4-treated mice. Concomitant significant reductions were observed in mRNA and/or protein levels of TGF- , collagen type 1, fibroblast-specific protein-1, -Sma Esculetin did not change Pdgfr- and Ppar expression, but did enhance the hepatic ratios of MM P2-9-13/TIMP-1 and GSH/GSSG. Conclusion: Esculetin halts and partly reverses liver fibrosis under persistent CCl 4 exposure by suppressing profibrotic TGF- /Smad signaling and myofibroblast proliferation, while enhancing fibrolysis and the anti-oxidant capacity of the liver. Thus, multifaceted esculetin may be a releva nt candidate drug to treat liver fibrosisMultifaceted esculetin suppresses hepatic stellate cell activation and CCl 4-induced liver fibrosis 83 Introduction Liver fibrosis is the result of an uncontroll ed wound healing respon se to chronic liver injuries, such as viral and autoimmune he patitis and (non-) alcoholic fatty liver diseases. Liver fibrosis may progress to cirrhosis in which the liver architecture is irreversibly disturbed and predisposes for liver cancer. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) play a central role in hepatic fibrogenesis. In the healthy liver, HSC contain most of the body supply of vitamin A stored as retinyl esters in large cytosolic lipid droplets. Upon liver injury, HSC transdifferentiate in to hepatic myofibroblasts that loose their vitamin A and become highly proliferative, contractile and produce excessive amounts of extracellular matrix proteins (E CM), including collagens and fibronectins. In addition to HSC, ECM-producing myofibroblasts may portal erived mesenchymal stem cells [1, 2]. TGF- plays a pivotal role in the activation of fibrogenic myofibroblasts, mediated through the Smad pathway. Therapeutic resolu tion of liver fibrosis may be achieved by suppressing the activation and prolifer ation of myofibroblasts, reducing the synthesis of excess ECM and/or improving the balance of enzymes that modulate the ECM: matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) versus tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Despite a mult itude of studies focusing on molecular targets in these pathways, no efficient an d well-tolerated antifibrotic drugs are available yet. Ideally, an antifibrotic dr ug would affect different aspects of the process of fibrogenesis, e.g. organ infla mmation, myofibroblast activation and/or scar tissue formation. One such product may actually be present in nature. Esculetin (Esc), or 6, 7-dihydroxycoumarin, is present in many pl ants and medicinal properties have been assigned to stem bark of Fraxinus rhynchophylla [3] of this compound. Esculetin possesses multip le pharmacological has been shown to suppress cell proliferation, particularly of cancer cells [15, 16]. Furthermore, it acts as an anti-oxidant and inhibits apoptosis, e.g. of hepatocytes exposed to CCl 4 [17, 18]. Esculetin is a non-competitive inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase and 12/15-lipoxygenase, enzymes that produce leukotrienes and li poxins. Both enzymes have independently been show to promote fibrosis in various or gans, including lung [19] and heart [20-22] Hepatic lipoxygenase expression was assumed to be restricted to Kupffer cells [23, 24], but we [25] and others rece found that HSC also express 5-LO that 5-LO is induced upon sactivation transcriptionally and pharmaco logically, proliferation and reduced expression HSC acti vation markers collagen 1a1 and -Sma. 5-Alox knockout mice show resistance to hepa tic inflammation and develop markedly reduced fibrosis when exposed to hepatotoxic agents like CCl 4 [27]. Esculetin effectively prevents acute liver damage in mi ce [17] and rats [18, 28, 29] caused by a single dose of CCl 4. In chronic liver injury mode ls, esculetin is typically given 4 Chapter 4 84 simultaneously with the liver damage-cau sing agent/condition without or with a short pre-treatment with esculetin. Despite its potent hepatocyte-protective effect, its true value in treatment of liver fibrosis with hepatic myofibro blasts as the main target remains elusive. Here, we studied the direct effect of esculetin on primary rat HSC and its potential as an antifibrotic drug after CCl 4-induced liver injury in mice with established liver fibrosis. Materials and methods Animals and CCl 4-induced liver fibrosis Male C57BL/6 mice (Vital River Laboratories , Beijing, China) were housed in the SPF animal facility of Shantou Universit y Medical College under standard 12hr light/12hr dark cycle and fed standard rodent chow and water ad libitum. After 7 days adjustment, mice were randomly divided into eight treatment groups (CCl 4 groups n=10; control groups n=6). Hepatic fibrosis was induced as described before [30] by twice-weekly injections of CCl 4 (i.p.; 0.4 \u00b5l/g BW) diluted 1:3 in olive oil CP (Aladdin Chemistry Co. Ltd, Shanghai, Chin a) for 4 weeks (total nine injections). Esculetin treatment (Alfa Aesar, MA, USA; i.p. 5 g/g, 10g/g or 20 g/g BW in PBS) was started at week 3 (together with 5th CCl 4 injection), given once a day for 16 days in total, with continued CCl 4 treatment. Mice injected with CCl 4 for 2 weeks and 4 weeks were included for comparison. The la tter group received daily mock injections with PBS as control for esculetin treatment. Control mice received olive oil-injections for 2 or 4 weeks. Additionally, one group re ceived esculetin alone at the highest dose (20g/g) for 16 days. Mice were sacr ificed 48 h after the last CCl 4 injection. Body weight was determined before every CCl 4 injection. Blood samples were collected at sacrifice for biochemical analyses. The left lateral liver lobe was prepared for histological analyses. Remaining liver tiss ue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C for RNA and protein isolation. Isolation and culture of primary rat hepatic stellate cells and portal myofibroblasts Specified pathogen-free male Wistar rats (Harlan, Zeist, the Netherlands) were housed under standard laboratory conditions with free access to standard laboratory chow and water. Experiments were approved by the local committee for care and use of laboratory animals of the Univer sity of Groningen, the Netherlands. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) were isolat ed from 500-600g male rats as described previously [31]. Cell purity was at least 90% after isolation and 100% after 1 day of culturing. HSC were culture-activated for 7 days. HSC were passaged by trypsinization. Cells at passage 1 or 2 were used for experiments. Portal myofibroblasts (PMF) were isolate d from residues of portal tree of 220-250g male rat as described earlier [32]. Freshly- isolated PMF were passed after 5 days and Multifaceted esculetin suppresses hepatic stellate cell activation and CCl 4-induced liver fibrosis 85 passages 2-4 were used for experiments HS C and PMF were cultured in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's in 20% serum-containing medium for the indicated time points. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Reve rse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Total RNA was extracted from liver tissue us ing RNAiso Plus (Total RNA extraction reagent TaKaRa, Japan) and from HSCs an d PMFs using Tri-reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purity and concentration were analyzed by Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scient ific). 1 \u00b5g of total RNA was reverse transcribed using PrimeScript TM RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Perfect Real Time TaKaRa, Japan; for liver tissue) or using random nanomers (Sigma-Aldrich; for HSC and PMF). Quantitative reverse-transcri ption polymerase chain reaction assays were performed on the Eco Real-Time PC R System (Illumina USA) using SYBR Green 7700 (PE Applied Biosystems) using taqman probes. Cycle numbers at which th e sample fluorescence signal increases above a fixed threshold level (Ct value) were normalized to the endogenous control (Gapdh for liver tissue; 36B4 for HSC and PMF) and correlated inversely with initial mRNA levels. Relative quantification wa s performed using the ddCt method. Real time PCR primers and probes are given in Supplementary Table S1. Biochemical analyses ALT, AST, and LDH were quantified us ing the Bio-sinew (Chengdu, China) and Leadman (Beijing, China) kits and the IF CC recommend method on an Automatic Chemistry Analyzer (Accute TBA-40FR, Tosh iba medical systems corporation, Japan). Serum levels of mouse TIMP-1 were measured by quantikine ELISA (R&D systems, USA). Tissue hydroxyproline content wa s determined using the Chloramine-T Hydroxyproline Assay Kit (Nanjing Jian cheng Biotechnology Institute Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Tissue glutathione levels were determined using the GSH/GSSG assay kit (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China) according to the manu facturer's protocol. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis Liver samples were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (P0013B; Beyotime). Equal amounts of proteins (50 \u00b5g) were sepa rated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filter membranes. Following blocking, membranes were probed with 4 Chapter 4 86 primary antibodies: Beijing), followed by HRP-conjugated secondary mouse antibody 1:60,000 or secondary rabbit antibody 1:80,000 (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing) at room temperature for 1 h. Target proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence SuperSignal West Dura detection system (Thermo scientific, IL, USA). Signals were quantified by Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Gelatin zymography Gelatinase substrate gel electrophoresis was performed using 30% polyacrylamide gels containing 1% gelatin. Samples were prepared in 2x loading buffer consisting of 1 mol/L Tris, pH SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromophenol \u00b5g loaded sample. After electrophoresis, gels were incubated twice in renaturing solution (2.5% Triton X-100) for 30 minutes at room temperature and then for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C in a developing buffe r containing 50 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5, 200 1% Brilliant Blue R-250. MMP-2 and MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was quantified by Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Cell Proliferation Assay Activated HSC or PMF were seeded in a 96- well plate and grown for 3 days in the absence or presence of esculetin. Prolifer ation was assessed at day 3 allowing BrdU incorporation for 3 h using cell prolif eration ELISA kit (Roche, Almere, the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions and measured spectroscopically (The SynergyHT, BioTek Instruments, Inc.). Histology and immunohistochemical studies Liver samples were fixed in 4% paraform aldehyde and embedded in paraffin. 4-\u00b5m paraffin sections processed following routine methods. Masson trichrome and Sirius-red staining (Beijing Leagene Biotechnology Co.,Ltd.) were performed to , Boster, Wuhan, China).

Results Esculetin inhibits proliferation of primary rat HSCs and PMFs First, we analyzed whether esculetin direct ly affects proliferation and/or activation of the 2 main sources of hepatic myofibro blasts, portal myofibroblasts (PMF) and hepatic 1). Cult ure-activated primary rat PMF and HSC were treated for 3 days with or without es culetin (50 or 100 \u00b5mol/L). Both BrdU incorporation (Fig. 1A) and PC NA protein levels (Fig. 1B) were sharply decreased in PMF and HSC after esculetin treatment, suggestive of a potent suppression of cell proliferation. Messenger RNA (Fig. 1C) an d protein levels (Fig. 1D) of collagen1a1 and -Sma were slightly reduced after treatment with 50 \u00b5mol/L esculetin, but a clear reduction of these myofibroblast acti vation markers was observed at higher concentrations (100 \u00b5mol/L) of esculetin (F ig. 1D). No significant induction of PMF or HSC cell death was observed at these conditions as indicated by the absence of cellular LDH release during the course of the treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1). 4 Chapter 4 88 Figure 1. Esculetin inhibits proliferation and activati on of primary rat HSC and PMF. Primary HSC and PMF were cultured for 3 days in the absence or presence of esculetin.

Experiments were performed from at least 3 different HSCs and PMFs isolations. Esculetin halts progression and partly reverses liver fibrosis in CCl 4 treated mice Esculetin has been shown to protect hepatocytes against acute toxicity by a single high dose of CCl 4. To determine its efficacy as an an tifibrotic drug, we subjected mice to the chronic model of CCl 4-induced fibrosis, where mice were given CCl 4 injections twice a week for 4 weeks and esculetin trea tment was started from week 3 on a daily Multifaceted esculetin suppresses hepatic stellate cell activation and CCl 4-induced liver fibrosis 89 basis until sacrifice at the end of week 4. Body weight characteristics were comparable for all CCl 4-treated groups, showing an initial drop after the first CCl 4 injection after which body weight gain is observed during the consecutive CCl 4 treatments (Fig. 2A). Liver weight at sacrifice was similar for all experimental groups and comparable to the untreated controls (Fig. 2B). Serum transaminases (ALT, AST) were strongly elevated after 2 weeks CCl 4 treatment (Fig. 2C). After 4 weeks CCl 4, AST and LDH were not significantly elevat ed anymore, while ALT levels were 40% reduced compared to 2 week CCl 4-treated mice, but still significantly enhanced above normal levels. Albumin and total b ilirubin levels were comparable in all groups and not different from untreated cont rols (Supplementary Fig. S2). Sirius-red (Fig. 2D) and Masson trichrome (Fig. 2E) st aining progressively increased in livers after 2 and 4 week CCl 4 treatment, with evident perilobular fibrosis and marked bridging fibrosis after 4 week CCl 4 treatment. Hepatic hydroxyproline levels were significantly enhanced in 2-week and 4-week CCl 4 treated mice compared to controls (Fig. 2F). Esculetin dose-dependently re duced serum ALT levels in CCl 4 treated mice, but levels remained increased compared to untreated controls (Fig. 2C). AST and LDH levels were not elevated after 4-week CCl 4 treatment and esculetin did not change this. Sirius-red and Masson trichrome staining revealed that esculetin dose-dependently reduced hepati c collagen deposition in CCl 4-treated mice (Fig. 2D and E). The Sirius red-positive area dropped from 3.99% in 4 week CCl 4-treated mice to 1.44% in animals receiving the highest do se of esculetin, which was similar to the level after 2 weeks CCl 4 treatment (Fig. 2D). Even more pronounced, esculetin reduced the Masson trichrome-positive area from 8.45% to 3.39% after 4 weeks of CCl 4 treatment, which is significantly lower compared to mice treated for 2 weeks with CCl 4 (6.17%) (Fig. 2E). Similarly, esculetin dose-dependently reduced hepatic hydroxyproline below levels in livers from mice treated for 2 weeks CCl 4, marking the start of esculetin treatment (Fig. 2F). In line with the histological observations, mRNA by esculetin (F ig. 3A) and accompanied with a reduction in -Sma protein (Fig. 3B). Strong periportal staining was observed for -Sma in livers of 4 week CCl4-treated mice, wh ich was almost completely absent when co-treated with the highest dose of es culetin (Fig. 3C). Moreover, parenchymal staining of -Sma was observed in the initial stages of fibrosis after 2 week CCl4-treatment, which was not detected in mice subsequently treated for 2 weeks with CCl4 together with 20 \u00b5g es culetin/g body weight (Fig. 3D).4 Chapter 4 90 Figure 2.

We did no t observe compensatory expression of either of the enzymes in the esculetin-treated mice. Both Alox5 (16-fold) and Alox15 4 Chapter 4 92 Figure 4. Differential effect of esculetin on CCl 4-induced lipoxygenase expression. Alox5 and Alox15 mRNA levels were strongly increased after 2 week CCl 4 treatment after which both decreased at 4 week CCl 4 treatment, but remain elevated compared to untreated control. Esculetin did not affect Alox5 mRNA levels, but fully suppressed Alox15 expression. mRNA levels were strongly increased after 2 weeks CCl 4 treatment (Fig. 4), after which they decr eased at 4 weeks CCl 4 treatment to 4-fold and 23-fold enhanced levels compared to untreated controls, respectively. Esculetin treatment during continued CCl 4 administration did not change Alox5, mRNA levels (Fig. 4). In sharp contrast, esculetin fully suppressed Alox15 mRNA levels in some conditions (10 \u00b5g Esc/g body weight) even below levels ob served in untreated animals (Fig. 4). Esculetin suppresses Tgf- /Smad-signaling As expected, Tgf- expression was progressively induced after 2- and 4- week CCl 4 treatment (Fig. 5A).

CCl 4 progressively induced mRNA levels of Mmp2 and Mmp9 , while Mmp13 expression peaked at 2 weeks (29-fold), but remained significantly enhanced (14-fold) compared to controls after 4 weeks CCl 4 treatment (Fig. 6A). Esculetin only reduced Mmp9 mRNA expression (-52%), which was accompanied by reduced MMP9 activity (-25%; Fig. 6B). Most pronounced wa s the effect of esculetin on CCl 4-induced Timp1 expression (+3.2-fold; Fig. 6C). Timp1 mRNA levels were fully suppressed to control levels, which was accompanied by strongly reduced TIMP-1 protein levels in serum. Esculetin improves the hepatic GSH/GSSG balance in CCl 4 treated mice Reduced glutathione (GSH) le vels in the liver were decreased after 4-week CCl 4 treatment, which was accompanied by enha nced oxidized glutat hione (GSSG) levels (Fig. 7). This leads to a strongly decreased GSH/GSSG ratio, which was significantly enhanced in all esculetin-treated groups (Fig . 7), implying that esculetin significantly improves the hepatic anti-oxidant status under hepatotoxic CCl 4 treatment. 4 Chapter 4 94 Figure 6. Esculetin promotes fibrolysis by increasing the MMP2-9-13/TIMP-1 ratio.

Esculetin improves the hepa tic GSH/GSSG balance in CCl 4 treated mice. Reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione levels were quantified in total liver homogenates and used to calculate the GSH/GSSG ratio. CCl 4 induced a significant redu ction in GSH/GSSG ratio which was ameliorated by ###p <0.001 compared to control 4w. Discussion this study, we show that esculetin dire ctly suppresses proliferation and activation of hepatic myofibroblasts in vitro . Esculetin halts and in part reverses liver fibrosis (e.g. hydroxyproline content, Masson trichrome staining) during persistent CCl 4-induced liver injury. The TGF- /Smad signaling pathway was suppressed by esculetin, while PPAR and PDGFR- expression was not affected. Expression of metalloproteases (MMP2, 9 and 13) were reduced by esculetin, but remained elevated compared to untreated controls. In contrast, CCl 4-induced TIMP-1 expression was fully suppressed by escule tin. In addition, esculetin rescued the CCl 4-associated hepatic Thus, signaling, and maintains an anti-oxidant status during CCl 4-induced liver toxicity. Esculetin is a natural product and is a main constituent of medicinal plant extracts. A plethora of therapeutic properties have been assigned to esculetin, including hepatoprotective activities, esculetin has so far only been studied in mode ls of acute liver toxicity, such as t-butyl hydroperoxide [33] and high single-dose CCl 4 non-competitive inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase and 12/15-lipo xygenase. These enzymes are essential for leukotriene and lipoxin synthesis that are potent inflammatory signaling molecules. We and others have shown that rat HSC express Alox5 [26] and is under inhibitory control of receptor-alpha (ROR suppress HSC and activation [25]. In line, several recent st udies have shown that melatonin potently suppresses liver fibrosis in the chronic CCl 4-model in mice and rats [34-37]. Part of these effects may be exerted by the suppres sion of 5-LO. Long-term drug treatment with melatonin to treat liver fibrosis may, ho wever, not be an ideal approach as this 4 Chapter 4 96 pineal gland hormone controls circadian rh ythm and induces sleep [38-40]. Thus, we reasoned that esculetin, as a direct i nhibitor of 5-LO and a component of save medicinal plant extracts may be an attractive alternative. Hepatic expression of Alox5 and Alox15 was strongly induce by CCl 4 treatment with highest levels after 2 weeks, at which poin t the esculetin treatment started. Esculetin treatment did not change hepatic Alox5 levels, reminiscent of its effect on 5-LO enzyme activity and not on tr anscriptional re gulation, while Alox15 expression returned to levels observed in untreated animals. Remarkably, we were unable to detect Alox15 expression in freshly-isolated (qui escent) or culture-activated rat HSC (data not shown), suggesting that these ef fects occur in non-HSC liver cells, most likely including Kupffer cells [41]. It remains to be determined whether esculetin directly affects transcription of the Alox15 gene or whether this is a result of feedback mechanisms associated with reduce d inflammation and/or fibrosis. Esculetin has been shown to induce expression PPAR are involved in fibrogenesis and/or fibrolysis. In CCl 4 treated mice, esculetin did not change Ppar and Pdgfr- expression. Instead, significant suppression of TGF- expression and downstream Smad2/3 phosphorylation was observed, suggesting that this profibrotic pathway was most sensitive to esculetin. Most pronounced, however, was the strong suppression of CCl 4-induced TIMP-1. TIMP-1 is a generic inhibitor of MMPs and thereby prevents fibrosis resolution. CCl 4-induced expression of Mmp2 and Mmp13 were not changed by esculetin, while Mmp9 was only moderately reduced. Thus, the esculetin-increased MMP/TIMP-1 balance favors fibrolysis. Esculetin strongly suppressed proliferation, as well as collagen1a1 and Sma expression, of in vitro cultured HSC and PMF. These results are highly similar as effects observed with melatonin, SR1078 (ROR antagonist) and AA861 (5-LO antagonist), and suggest that these all act (in part) through inhibition of 5-LO. The anti-proliferative properties of esculetin are well-documented, especially in relation to cancer cells. Though this has not been specifically studied for the various forms of liver cancer (cells) yet, this feature may al so be beneficial for preventing progression of cirrhosis to liver cancer. Finally, we also found that esculetin prevents the CCl 4-induced reduction of the GSH/GSSG balance, thereby preserving the an ti-oxidant capacity in the liver. Most of the glutathione in the liver resides in he patocytes, suggesting that esculetin also has a cytoprotective effect on the major liver cell type, as has been documented before. It is important to note that the esculetin did not fully prevent CCl 4-induced hepatocyte damage as indicated by elev ated transaminases in the absence and presence of esculetin. Thus, the antifibrotic e f f e c t o f e s c u l e t i n c a n n o t b e e x p l a i n e d solely by protection of the hepatocytes. Multifaceted esculetin suppresses hepatic stellate cell activation and CCl 4-induced liver fibrosis 97 Recent reports revealed very si milar effects of melatonin and Fraxinus rhynchophylla extracts on CCl 4-induced liver fibrosis. Remarkably, the concentrations of esculetin present in the Fraxinus rhynchophylla extracts (given at 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/g body weight with 33.54 mg esculetin/mg Fraxinus rhynchophylla extract) were in the same r a n g e a s o u r s t u d y ( 5 , 1 0 a n d 2 0 \u00b5 g e s c u l e t i n / g b o d y w e i g h t ) . T h i s s u g g e s t s t h a t esculetin may be the most prominent antifi brotic factor in this plant extract. Taken together, this study reveals multiple antifibrotic properties of esculetin, including suppression of hepatic stella te cell activation, profibrotic TGF- /Smad signaling and induction of fibrolysis by enhancing the MMP/TIMP-1 balance. Moreover, the anti-oxidant capacity of the liver is improved by increasing the GSH/GSSG ratio. These results warrant follow-up studies with the long term application of esculetin before and at various stages of established fibrosis to further establish it preventive and therapeutic capacity in the treatment of liver fibrosis. Moreover, experiments to test the anti-fibrotic potent ial on human liver, e.g. using precision-cut human liver slices [47], are urgently needed. 4 Chapter 4 98 References [1] Popov Y, Schuppan D.

Fibrosis is a matrix production, including collagens, by hepatic myofibroblasts. Fibrosis is largely reversible, but when liver injury persists may progress to cirr hosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. No drug-based therapy is available to treat live r fibrosis. Esculetin is present in many medicinal plants and harbors hepatoprotec tive properties. Here, we analyzed the optimal timing and delivery-route to ameliorate CCl 4-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mice. Methods Kunming mice were treated for 4 weeks with CCl 4 with 1-week esculetin co-treatment either in week 2, week 3 or week 4. Esculetin was administered by i.p. injection (10 mg/kg for 7 consecutive days ) or by i.v. injection (6 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days). Animals were sacrificed 48 h after the last CCl 4 injection. Liver tissue was harvested for histological analy sis, protein and RNA isolations, and serum samples were collected for biochemical parameters. Results: CCl 4 strongly induced serum transaminases (AST and ALT) and hepatic Collagen 1a1 and a-SMA expression in mice . Esculetin most effectively suppressed CCl 4-induced AST and ALT when it was administered in the 2nd week of the 4-week CCl 4 treatment. Intravenous esculetin most effectively reduced Collagen1a1 and Acta2 (encoding a-SMA) expression; the earlier it was administered the stronger the suppression of fibrotic markers. Collagen deposition was reduced in mice treated with esculetin in the 2nd week of the 4-week CCl 4 liver toxicity model. Conclusions: Esculetin provides long-lasting protection against CCl 4-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mice and this natural compound is therefore a relevant drug candidate for the prevention and treatment of chronic liver disease. Short and early treatment with es culetin effectively ameliorates CCl 4-induced liver injury and fibrosis 107 Introduction Chronic liver diseases, such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and (non-)alcoholic liver disease ((N)ASH), invari ably lead to liver fibrosis [1-3]. Liver fibrosis develops due to an uncontrolled wound healing response to chronic injury and is characterized by the deposition of excessive amounts of extracellular matrix proteins, particularly collagens and fibron ectins, between hepatic cells. This impairs blood flow through the liver and disrupts the hepatic architecture resulting in reduced liver function and portal hyperten sion. Damage to the liver leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and reactive oxygen species. These conditions induce the transdifferentiation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSC) into migratory and pr oliferative myofibrobl asts that produce excessive amounts of extracellular matrix proteins and are characterized by high expression of \u0000smooth muscle actin ( SMA) [4, 5]. Both animal and human studies have shown that fibrosis is largely re versible and that, up on removal of the underlying cause, hepatic fibrosis resolves, reestablishing a near-normal liver architecture. However, upon continued liv er injury, fibrosis may progress to cirrhosis, where the excessive ECM deposition leads to irreversible scarring of the liver that can cause liver failure and predis poses to liver cancer [6, 7]. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a leading cause of liver-related mortality in patients with cirrhosis [8-10]. At present, liver transplantation is the on ly available treatment for liver failure and primary liver cancer. Thus, there is a need for drug-based therapies that ameliorate and preferably reverse liver fibrosis. A crit ical parameter for the clinical success of effective anti-fibrotic drug is not only its potency to prevent, suppress and/or reverse liver fibrosis, but also that single doses (o r short treatment periods) have long lasting effects. Esculetin, or 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin, is present in many different plants with Citrus limonia [12, 13]. Various therapeutic properties have been assigned to es culetin, including anti-antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities [14-16]. With respect to liver disease, esculetin has been shown to protect against ac ute [17, 18] and chronic [19] liver injury and it suppresses the development of liver cancer as well [20, 21]. Esculetin is a non-competitive shown that esculetin strongly su ppresses HSC proliferation and activation in vitro a s w e l l a s C C l 4-induced liver fibrosis in C57 BL/6 mice (Chapter 4). Esculetin was given daily intraperitoneally (i.p.) in the final 2 weeks of a 4-week CCl 4 treatment and completely blocked fibrosis progression as established after the first 2 weeks of CCl 4 treatment (Chapter 4). In this foll ow-up study, we aimed to determine whether 1) esculetin also ameliorates CCl 4-induced liver fibrosis in a different mouse strain 2) short term esculetin treatment reve als ation of esculetin, as used in our preceding study, is superior to intravenous (i.v.) application of this compound. 5 Chapter 5 108 In order to answer these questi ons, Kunming mice received 2 CCl 4 injections per week for 4 weeks to induce liver fibrosis. Es culetin was given i.p. or i.v. every day in week 2, or in week 3, or in week 4 of the CCl 4 treatment (Fig. 1). Mice were sacrificed 2 days after the final CCl 4 treatment at the start of we ek 5 and blood and liver tissue were analyzed for liver damage and fibrosis markers. Our data show that a 1-week esculetin treatment is most effective in preventing hepatocyte damage and liver fibrosis when given intravenously to mice early in a 4-week CCl 4 exposure protocol. Material and methods Animals, model of CCl 4-induced liver fibrosis and esculetin treatment regimes Male Kunming mice (18~22g, age 6-8 weeks) were provided by the laboratory animal center of the Shantou University Medical College and hosted in a SPF animal facility under standard 12hr light/12hr dark cycle and fed standard rode nt chow and water ad libitum. After 7 days adjustment, mice were randomly divided into eight treatment groups (See Fig. 1; one control group, seven CCl 4-treatment groups, six of which received 1-week esculetin treatment (i.p. or i.v.) in week 2, or week 3, or week 4. All groups contained 5 animals. CCl 4-treatment to induce liver fibrosis was performed as previously described [23] by twice-weekly injections of CCl 4 (i.p.; 0.4 \u00b5l/g BW) diluted 1:3 in olive oil CP (Ala ddin Chemistry Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China) for 4 weeks (total 9 injections). Esculetin treatment was performed either in week 2, or week 3 or week 4, applied either by i. p. injection (10 mg/kg for 7 consecutive days) or i.v. injection (6 mg/kg for 5 consecutiv e days). Sham control mice only received olive oil. Mice were sacrificed 48 h after the last CCl 4 injection. Blood samples were collected at sacrifice for biochemical analyses . The left lateral liver lobe was prepared for histological analyses. Remaining liver tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C for RNA and protein isolation. Serum (Alb) were measured using Flex reagent cartridge (Siemens Healthcare diagnostics Inc. Newark, USA ) specific for Integrated Chemistry System (Dimension RxL Max, Siemens). RNA Isolation and Q-PCR Total RNA of liver tissue was isolated, puri fied and reverse transcribed following the protocol of the manufacturer (TaKaRa, Japa n). Quantification of reverse-transcription polymerase chain was performed using SYBR green (TaKaRa) on the Eco Real-Time PCR System (Illumine USA), each sample in duplicate wells. Cy cle numbers at which the sample fluorescence signal increases above a fixed threshold level (Ct value) were normalized to the endogenous control ( Gapdh ) and correlated inversely with initial mRNA levels. Relative quantification wa s performed using the ddCT method. All Short and early treatment with es culetin effectively ameliorates CCl 4-induced liver injury and fibrosis 109 primers applied were synthesized by BGI in RIPA lysis buffer (P0013B; Beyotime). Equal amounts of proteins (50 \u00b5g) were sepa rated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filter membranes. Following blocking, membranes were probed with primary antibodies: mouse -SMA monoclonal antibody 1:2,000 (Sigma), and mouse anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody 1: 3,000 (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing), followed by HRP-conjugated secondary mouse antibody 1:60,000 or secondary rabbit antibody 1:80,000 (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing) at room temp erature for 1 h. Target proteins were visualized using the enhanc ed chemiluminescence SuperS ignal West Dura detection system (Thermo Scientific, IL, USA). Signals were quantified by Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Histology and immunohistochemical studies Liver samples were fixed paraform aldehyde and embedded in paraffin. 4-\u00b5m paraffin sections processed following routine methods. Masson trichrome and Sirius-red staining were performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Beijing Leagene Biotechnology Co. Ltd.). Statistical Analysis All data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Significance of differences between groups was tested by one-way AN OVA and t-test. Calculations were made using the software of GraphPad Prism 5. Results were consid ered statistically different when the p value <0.05. 5 Chapter 5 110 Figure 1. Overview of the experimental groups. Male Kunming mice were randomly divided into 8 groups (n=5). Control group (green bars) received olive oil as vehicle control. CCl 4-treated groups (blue bars) received CCl 4 (i.p. 0.4 ul/g b.w.) diluted 1:3 in olive oil and injected twice a week for 4 weeks (total 9 injections). Esculetin treatment groups (red bars) received esculetin administered i.p. (10 mg/kg for 7 consecutive days) or i.v. (6 mg/k g for 5 consecutive days) during the second, third and fourth week of CCl 4 challenge. Animals were sacrif iced 48 h after the last CCl 4 injection. Results Early esculetin therapy effectively suppresses liver damage caused by continued CCl 4 treatment. Chronic treatment with CCl 4 caused a strong increase in serum AST and ALT levels 48 h after the final (9th) CCl 4 injection in Kunming mice in comparison to sham-treated control mice (Fig. 2 A and B). Intraperitoneal (CCl 4+Esc p3) or intravenous (CCl 4+Esc v3) esculetin treatment in the 4th week did not significantly reduce the ALT and AST levels though trends towards a reduction in the transaminases were observed. In contrast, esculetin treatments, either i.p. or i.v., in the 2nd or 3rd week of the CCl 4 protocol significantly and strongly reduced ALT and AST levels in the serum of these mice. ALT levels were reduced by 61% (i.p) and 72% (i.v.) when mice were treated with esculetin in the 3 rd week, while the reduction of these liver damage markers was even more pronounced when the CCl 4-treated mice were co-treated with esculetin in the 2nd week (-73% for i.p. and -81% for i.v.; Fig. 2A) Similar data were obtained for AST (Fig. 2B), where both treatment regimens (i.p. and i.v.) given in the 2nd week completely prevented the CCl 4-induced increase at the end of the 4-week protocol. A 4-week CCl 4 treatment did not affect the serum albumin levels, which was also not further changed by the various esculetin treatments (Fig. 2C). Similarly, also serum LDH levels were hardly changed by CCl 4 and the esculetin co-treatments (Fig. 2D). Short and early treatment with es culetin effectively ameliorates CCl 4-induced liver injury and fibrosis 111 Figure 2.

Early intravenous esculetin therapy effectively suppresses fibrotic marker expression in CCl 4 treated mice. Acta2 (encoding -SMA) and Collagen 1a1 expression was strongly (2.2-fold and 14-fold, respectively) induced in 4-week CCl 4-treated Kunming mice compared to sham-treated animals (Fig. 3A, B). Intrav enous therapy with esculetin in week 2 significantly reduced expression of these markers of fibrosis, and Acta2 expression was even back to control leve ls. Intravenous esculetin treatment in week 3 or in week 4 did not significantly reduce Acta2 and Coll1a1 expression although a trend towards reduced expression was observed. Intrap eritoneal esculetin therapy suppressed Coll1a1 expression most effectively when give n in week 3 (-55%). A trend to lower Acta2 expression was also observed in this therapy group, although not reaching significance. Intraperitoneal esculetin treatm ents in week 2 or week 4 did no lower Acta2 and Coll1a1 expression level. Hepatic -SMA protein levels were strongly increased (4.5-fold) upon 4-week CCl 4-treatment and early treatment with esculetin in week 2, either i.p. or i.v., significantly reduced the level of this maker of fibrosis (-44% and -48%, respectively; Fig. 3C). Esculetin is a non-competitive inhibitor of 5 Chapter 5 112 lipoxygenases and previously we found that esculetin therapy in the final 2 weeks of a 4-week CCl 4 treatment period fully suppressed the CCl 4-induced Alox12/15 mRNA expression in C57BL/6 mice (Chapter 4). CCl 4 also strongly induced Alox12/15 expression in Kunming mice (27-fold), which was partly suppressed to a similar extent in all esculetin treatment grou ps by approximately 60% (Fig. 3D).

Based on the results described above, we se lected the groups that were treated with esculetin in week 2 for further histological analysis. Masson's trichrome staining for collagen showed that the 4-week CCl 4 treatment induced significant liver fibrosis in Short and early treatment with es culetin effectively ameliorates CCl 4-induced liver injury and fibrosis 113 Kunming mice, as compared to mice treate d with the vehicle al one (Fig. 4A and B). Collagen deposition was particularly detect ed in the pericentral area and periportal regions, resulting in bridging fibrosis. Some pericellular fibrosis was also observed. Esculetin treatment in week 2, either i.p. or i.v., significantly reduced collagen deposition in the 4-week CCl 4 treated mice (Fig. 4C and D). Some diffuse pericentral and periportal collagen was still observ ed, but bridging fibrosis was absent. Collectively, these data show that early, transient esculetin therapy significantly reduces liver injury and liver fibrosis de velopment in Kunming mice treated for 4 weeks with CCl 4. Figure 4. Early esculetin treatment decreases hepatic collagen deposition. Collagen deposition was determined by Masson trichrome staining (origina l magnification 200\u00d7) in control mice, 4-week CCl 4 treated mice; and mice treated in de 2nd week with esculetin either i.p. (CCl 4+Esc p1) or i.v. (CCl 4+Esc v1). 5 Chapter 5 114 Discussion In this study, we compared the hepatoprotective effect of a short esculetin treatment period at different time points during CCl 4 treatment. We show that a short esculetin intravenous treatment period for 5 consecut ive days (i.v.; 6 mg/kg each) in week 2 was most effective in suppressing serum liver damage markers, as well as liver fibrosis markers at the end of the CCl 4 treatment period of 4 weeks, when compared to esculetin treatment in week 3 or 4. Thus, early treatment with the natural compound esculetin has long-lasting ther apeutic effects on the development of CCl 4-induced liver fibrosis in mice. Esculetin is a natural compound found in ma ny medicinal plants [11, 24, 25]. One of its molecular actions is the inhibition of lipoxygenases , enzymes involved in the inflammatory and fibrotic cascade [26-30]. We have previously shown that esculetin directly inhibits hepatic stellate cell pro liferation and activation and arrests,-and in part reverses- the development of liver fibr osis when given in the final 2 weeks of a 4-week CCl 4 treatment of C57BL/6 mice (Chapt er 4). A concentration-dependent anti-fibrotic effect was observed for esculeti n when given in daily i.p. doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg. In this follow-up study, a 4 week CCl 4 treatment was applied to Kunming mice and esculetin was given i.p. for 7 consecutive days at 10 mg/kg or i.v. for 5 consecutive days at 6 mg/kg. The 4-week CCl 4 treatment of Kunming mice resulted in highly comparable elevation of liver damage markers AST and ALT as well as liver fibrosis markers as compared to C57BL/6 mice, confirming that this outbred mouse strain that is derived from Swiss albino mice and is commonly used in China as a laboratory animal is a good model to study CCl 4-induced liver toxicity. Indeed, similar observations have recently been reported by others, both using acute [31-34] and chronic CCl 4 models [35, 36]. The 2 week esculetin treatment in the 2nd part of the 4 week CCl 4 protocol in C57BL/6 mice did not affect Alox5 expression, while the CCl 4-induced Alox12/15 mRNA levels (+23-fold) were fully suppresse d to control levels in to C57BL/6 mice (Chapter 4). Alox 12/15 mRNA levels were similarly enhanced in 4-week CCl 4-treated Kunming mice (+27-fold), but only partly reduced (~50-60%) by a short esculetin treatment in this study. Remarkably though, very similar reductions in Alox 12/15 mRNA levels were observed in all trea tment groups, independent of application method (i.p. or i.v.) and moment of treatment (in 2nd, 3rd or 4th week of CCl 4 exposure). Although the Alox 12/15 mRNA level is merely a marker for the inflammatory/fibrotic signaling cascade and not for the level of activity as result of the esculetin-mediated inhibition, it does indicate that the length of the esculetin treatment determines the level of suppression of Alox12/15 expression and is independent of the timing within the 4-week CCl 4 protocol. In contrast, early esculetin treatment, either i.p. or i.v., ha d the most pronounced effect on hepatocyte injury markers (AST and ALT) and appear ed less effective when given at later moments in the 4-week CCl 4 protocol. This suggests that the hepatoprotective effect of esculetin requires a relatively long period to reach its full potential. A direct Short and early treatment with es culetin effectively ameliorates CCl 4-induced liver injury and fibrosis 115 hepatoprotective effect of esculetin has been reported in acute models of liver injury, including models of a single dose of CCl 4 or paracetamol in rats [18, 37-39], which is particularly relevant for therapeutic application in acute liver disease. The long-lasting hepatoprotective effect of es culetin observed in this study may be even more relevant as it may protect against ac ute challenges to the liver at later time points. The pharmacokinetics of esculetin ha ve not been analyzed in this study, but a recent study found that it quickly distributes to the liver and kidneys of rats after oral intake [40]. Plasma levels peaked already after 5 minutes upon oral administration and dropped to undetectable levels 3 h po st-administration, at which time point significant amounts remained detectable only in liver and renal tissue. In light of these results, it is now highly relevant to determine whether esculetin remains present in the liver and if so in which liver ce lls, in the period after the last dose. Although apparently equally protective against hepatocyte injury as i.p. administration, early i.v. administration of esculetin appeared to be more potent in suppressing markers of liver fibrosis ( Acta2 and Coll1a1 expression). This was not related to the total esculetin exposure, since the total exposure was actually more than 2-fold lower in the i.v. therapy group (5 days x 6 mg/kg=30 mg esculetin /kg bw in the i.v. group vs. 7 days x 10 mg/kg = 70 mg esculetin/kg bw in the i.p. group). Obviously, these differences warrant further investigation, but it suggests that the administration route of esculetin affects its therapeutic potential. In conclusion, we show that esculetin, a natural product of medicinal plants, has potent and long-lasting therapeutic effects on CCl 4-induced liver inju ry and fibrosis in mice, which warrants future studies on establishing the molecular mechanisms involved and translating this knowledg e to clinical studies in humans. 5 Chapter 5 116 References [1] Liedtke C, Luedde T, Sauerbruch T, Scholten D, F, et al.

In the final ch apter of this thesis, we will discuss the results of our studies relative to the curren t state of knowledge on liver inflammation and hepatic fibrosis. Liver inflammation Programed cell death is an essential proc ess in normal physiological processes and tissue homeostasis. However, dysregulation of cell death, in particular the apoptotic program is a sign of stress, injury or in fection and is linked to tissue damage and disease pathogenesis. In liver diseases, diff erent forms of cell death occur, depending on the liver disease (as discussed in Chapter 1 ). In addition to hepatocytes, cell death also affects non-hepatocytic types, However, hepatocyte death is a key event in the progression of liver diseases. Although hepatocyte cell death can be considered as a normal and beneficial ev ent to remove damaged or malignant cells, excessive and prolonged hepatocyte cell deat h leads to loss of liver function, chronic inflammation, fibrosis and, because of th e continuous regenera tion, hepatocellular carcinoma Therefore, the contribution of cell death to the progression of liver diseases is cell-, stage- and context-specif ic [6]. From animal studies it has been concluded that acute liver failure is ch aracterized by both severe apoptosis and necrosis; cholestatic liver and some drug-induced liver failure, like acetaminophen (APAP, paracetamol) into xication are characterized mainly by necrotic cell death [6-8] and cell death in NASH is characterized by moderate apoptosis, although human studies also demo nstrated necroptosis [9]. In many liver diseases both necrosis and apoptosis occur simultaneously, e.g. in ALD and NAFLD [10-14]. Massive cell death is a hallmark of acute live r diseases and leads to a dramatic loss of liver function. Therefore, spec ific interventions targeted to prevent or attenuate this massive cell death may be very effective in these acute conditions. Caspase inhibitors like IND-6556 and GS-9450 have been inve stigated and effe ctively block the apoptotic cascade and reduce liver injury in experimental models [15-18]. Unfortunately, inhibition of caspas e-dependent apoptosis may lead apoptosis, necropto sis or necrosis and therefore caspase inhibitors have not achieved widespread application in clinical hepatology [6]. Initially, cell death was consid ered to be the result of inflammation, e.g. as a result of the generation of reactive oxygen species, however, cell death can also precede, trigger or amplify the inflammatory respon se directly by disrupting epithelial barriers and triggering immune responses [1 9]. Hence, inhibition of inflammation is considered an effective strategy in reducing liver injury. Inflammation is a complex process in which numerous cell types, orga nelles and signaling factors are involved, General discussion and future perspectives 121 e.g. Fas/FasL, TNF/TNF-receptor, Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), B (NF-B), mitochondrial pathways etc. NF-kB has emerged as a central regulator of inflammatory activity. Inhibition of NF- B or NF- B target genes is considered an attractive strategy for anti-inflammat ory therapy and caffeic acid, curcumin, resveratrol and silymarin have been used as NF- B inhibiting interventions [20]. Alternatively, since TNF is both a NF- B-dependent gene in inflammatory cells as well as an inducer of NF- B in target cells, anti-TNF ther apy is also considered as an anti-inflammatory intervention. However, all TNF-antagonists currently used, e.g. Infliximab, have also been associated with dr ug-induced liver injury [21, 22]. This is probably due to the lack of target-cel l specificity of TNF-antagonists: TNF antagonists will also prevent NF- B activation in epithelial cells like hepatocytes and in these cell types, NF- B acts as a survival factor [23] . Interestingly, TNF-R knockout mice were protected from tosis and fibrosis [24]. In addition to TNF/NF-B antagonists, other compounds have been evaluated as anti-inflammatory agents in li ver inflammation. E.g. glycyrrhizin, used as inhibitor of b o t h D A M P a n d H M G B - 1 s h o w e d a b e n e f i cial effect in HCV and HCC [25-27]. Depletion of Kupffer cells is also effectiv e in the prevention of inflammation and subsequent liver injury [28-30]. To summa rize, therapy may be aimed to directly inhibit cell death of hepatocytes and/or in directly via inhibition of inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory interventions may have opposite effects in different cell types, therefore, cell-spe cific targeting may be necessary to achieve optimal results. In view of these considerations, the raw extract of Ipomoea stolonifera may be a promising candidate as discussed below. In Chapter 2, we demonstrate that the raw extract of Ipomoea stolonifera and its purified components profoundly reduce ca spase-3 activation in hepatocytes exposed to the hydrophobic bile acid glycochenodeox ycholic acid (GCDCA). Since activation of caspase-3 is a late event in the apopto tic pathway and invariably leads to cell death, the prevention of caspase-3 activation demonstrates a truly protective effect of BE-IS, the raw extract of Ipomoea stolonifera and its components. In addition to the cytoprotective effect, the anti-inflammator y properties of BE-IS and its components were also assessed. Hepatocyte inflammation was induced by a combination of three inflammatory cytokines (TNF , IL-1 and IFN- ). Our results provide evidence for the anti-inflammatory action of BE-IS and some of its components. Of note, the anti-inflammatory effect is independent of the cytopr otective effect, since the GCDCA-induced model of hepatocyte death is not related to inflammation [31]. BE-IS contains multiple bioactive componen ts and has been demonstrated to have therapeutic effects in the management of va rious liver diseases [32]. Very recently, we further investigated the sy nergistic effect and dose optimization of the five main components of BE-IS used in Chapter 2, in vivo and in vitro [33]. It was demonstrated that esculetin, curcumin and hesperetin are the principal constituents having synergistic effects. Combined, our findings demonstrate that BE-IS (or a selected combination of its main components) has a superior effectiveness over single-agent therapy with respect to cytoprotection and attenuation of inflammation. On the other 6 Chapter 6 122 hand, the single components should also be evaluated in more detail. E.g. curcumin has been demonstrated to be effective in attenuating inflammation via inhibition of TNF, NF-B and COX-2 [34-36] . Additional studies in relevant in vivo models will be needed to assess the potency of these natural compounds against liver inflammation. Liver macrophages (resident macrophages or Kupffer cells) and hepatic leukocytes (NK cells and NKT cells) play a crucial role in the first line of de fense against external and internal pathogens and irritants. These cells can rapidly produce copious amounts of cytokines after activation, which enables them to respond quickly and subsequently help to remove invading pathogens, toxins and food antigens. However, if this defense system is inadeq uately activated, severe inflammation, ultimately resulting in septic shock and mu ltiple organ failure may occur, with cells of the innate immune system contributing to and amplifying the liver injury [37-39]. Hence, it is hypothesized that drugs that affect immune function may be beneficial in the treatment of liver diseases. In the live r, various bacterial stimuli can activate Kupffer cells, e.g. lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the cell wall component of gram negative bacteria. LPS directly activates Kupffer ce lls and leads to the production of large amounts of cytokines, such as interleukins , chemokines etc. Of these cytokines, TNF plays a crucial role, since it plays a key role in liver inflammation and, under specific conditions, is also a potent inducer of apoptosis [40]. In Chapter 3 , we used two in vivo models, e.g. lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced and Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced fu lminant hepatitis, to analyze the anti-inflammatory properties of one of the purified components from Ipomoea stolonifera raw extracts, namely hesperetin. These two models differ with respect to the initiating mechanism and the main cell types and cytokines involved in the onset and perpetuation of fulminant hepatitis. E.g., unlike LPS-induced hepatitis, Con A-induced liver injury is dependent on T- cell mediated phenomena [41] and cannot be induced in athymic nude mice. Con A is therefore considered to be a model for human autoimmune hepatitis [42]. Con A is an activator of NKT cells. After Con A injection, NKT cells produce large am ounts of cytokines TNF and IFN , have a direct apoptosis [18]. and regeneration liver injury [44]. Moreover , NKT cells cause hepatocyte cell death by releasing pro-apoptotic FasL [45]. LPS or endotoxin is a cell wall product of Gram-negative bacteria and a very potent activator of macrophages and inflammation. Exposure of macrophages, including Kupffer cells, to LPS leads to increased generation of inflammatory cytokines like TNF , IL-1 and Il-6, as well as chemokines and reactive oxygen species. Uncontrolled exposure to LPS/endotoxin, as happens in sepsis, can lead to septic shock and death. Since LPS is also a potent inducer of IFN , Kupffer cells are also able to activate liver NK and NKT cells [46]. Our data provide compelling evidence for th e hepatoprotective effects of hesperetin General discussion and future perspectives 123 in LPS-induced and Con A-induced fulminan t hepatitis, which is underscored by its ability to reduce TNF -depended apoptosis via the JN K pathway and dramatically repress IFN expression. The clinical efficacy of anti-TNF therapy has been established in chronic inflammatory diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and rheumatoid arthritis [ 47]. Some studies have suggested that Con A-induced hepatitis can be inhibited by treatment with antibodies against IFN or IL-4 [48, 49]. In another study, LPS-induced hepatic injury in Propionibacterium acnes -primed mice was completely blocked by the combination of anti-IFN and anti-TNF therapy and only partially blocked by inhibition of on ly one pathway [42]. Therefore, hesperetin, which is able to inhibit both IFN and TNF holds great promise for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including liver failure. Hesperetin is abundant in citrus fruits and its daily consumption can be high [50, 51]. In chapter 3, we demonstrated the remarkably protective effect of orally in gested hesperetin in fulminant hepatitis. Given the bioavailability of hesperetin when taken orally and the proven safety and tolerability, hesperetin is a promising candid ate for the treatment of both acute and chronic liver diseases. Liver fibrosis Liver fibrosis is a dynamic and, at least to a certain extent, reversible process which involves many liver cell types and numerous mediators (described in detail in Chapter 1 ). Treatment of chronic liver diseases, including liver fibrosis has been hampered by the lack of effective therapeuti c interventions. Early liver fibrosis, with absence of extensive ECM crosslinking and ma rked angiogenesis can still reverse to near-normal architecture when the underlying cause is successfully treated or removed (e.g. viral eradication or cessation of alcohol abuse). Chronic inflammation inevitably leads to liver fibrosis and is characterized by injury and damage of hepatocytes, persistent activation of infl ammatory cells, including Kupffer cells and increased production of ECM by activated he patic stellate cells, regardless of the etiology. Many of these effects are caused by inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and oxidative stress, result ing in death (apoptosis, ne crosis) of the functional hepatocytes. Therefore, an effective treatment for liver fibrosis should block the action of these noxious factors and/or cell death of hepatocytes [52, 53], and should reduce the inflammatory state of macrophages, enhance the anti-oxidant status of hepatocytes and reduce steatosis through lip ogenic pathways [54-59]. Importantly, therefore, drugs that address more than on e single pathogenic pathway will be more efficient than drugs that target only a single pathway [60]. To determine the efficacy of escu letin as an antifibrotic drug, in Chapter 4 , we studied the direct effect of esculetin on cu ltured rat HSC, and subjected mice to the established chronic model of CCl 4-induced fibrosis, where mice were given esculetin treatment during the fina l 2 weeks of a 4 week CCl 4 treatment. This study revealed multiple antifibrotic properti es of esculetin, including suppression of profibrotic TGF- signaling and induction of fibrogenolysis by enhancing the MMP/TIMP-1 balance. Addition ally, the anti-oxidant capacity of the 6 Chapter 6 124 liver is improved by increasing the hepatic GSH/GSSG ratio. Indeed, many different aspects are involved in the process of fibrogenesis, e.g. organ inflammation, myofibroblast activation, scar tissue formation and fibrosis resolution. Therefore, in theory, molecular targets on any of this aspect will affect fibrosis progression. Ideally, the more targets, the be tter. In our study, esculetin seems to be such a promising anti-fibrotic agent that is multifaceted in various ways. HSC play a crucial role in hepatic fibrogenesis. amount of ECM is the key event in fibrogenesis. Thus, suppression of prol iferation and activation of hepatic myofibroblasts is a of anti-fibr otic therapy. Esculetin strongly suppresses HSC proliferation and the of markers of fibrosis ( collagen 1a1 and -Sma). Among different signaling events, the TGF- /Smad pathway is a key profibrotic pathway associated in liver fibrosis. In ou r study, esculetin significantly inhibits Tgf- expression and downstream Sm ad2/3 phosphorylation, while Ppar and Pdgfr- expression were not changed. An interesting option to accelerate the reso lution of fibrosis is to increase matrix degradation, a process that is controll ed by balancing the level of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their na tural inhibitors, tissue (TIMPs), in particul ar myofibroblast-derived TIMP-1 [61]. I n c r e a s i n g t h e a c t i v i t y o f M M P s a n d / o r antagonizing TIMPs will benefit matrix degradation as demonstrated by Iredale et al. and Issa et al. [3, 62] in seminal studies on the resolution of liver fibrosis in rats by decreasing the production of TIMP-1. In addition, it has been postulated that reduci ng TIMP activity in the liver may actually have the dual advantage of promoting matr ix degradation and inducing apoptosis of highly fibrogenic HSCs [63]. In our study, CCl 4-induced expression of Mmp2 and Mmp13 were not changed by esculetin, while Mmp9 was only moderately reduced. Most pronounced, however, was the strong suppression of CCl 4-induced TIMP-1 upon esculetin treatment. Thus, the escule tin-increased MMP/TIMP-1 balance favors fibrogenolysis. Our results suggest that the anti-fibrotic ac tion of esculetin acts, at least in part, through inhibition of lipoxygenases, e.g. 5-LO and/or 12/15-LO. This is in line with our earlier observations that activation of ROR by melatonin or a synthetic agonist (SR1078) suppresses 5-LO expression in HSC and thereby suppresses cell proliferation and expression of Collagen1a1 and Acta2 (encoding Sma) [64]. In a similar way, esculetin suppressed HSC pro liferation and expression of those fibrosis. Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are diox ygenases that hydroperoxides from polyun saturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid and arachidonic acid, to produce inflammatory lipid intermediates that directly or indirectly affect cellular function and survival [65]. Human and mouse express six LOX isoforms, which are defined by the site of oxygenation, either at carbon position 5, 12, or 15 [66]. Kupffer cells, the resident macrophages of liver, express Alox5 and Alox12/15 , while hepatocytes appear to be devoid of these enzymes [67-69]. Kupffer General discussion and future perspectives 125 cells participate in the initiation of the in flammatory cascade leading to liver fibrosis by virtue of various proinflammatory factor s, such as cytokines and leukotrienes, the latter being produced via the LOX pathway [7 0-72]. Thus, this pathway plays a direct role in HSC activation and possibly also modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the liver [71]. Although the exact role of LOXs in liver fibrosis need to be established, inhibitors of 5-LO and/or 12-15-LO have be en demonstrated to prevent hepatocellular injury during inflammati on and liver fibrosis [67, 73, 74]. As we found that esculetin effectively bloc ks the progression of liver fibrosis even under continued liver toxicity conditions induced by CCl 4, we next aimed to analyze its therapeutic potential in short treatment periods through 2 different administration routes, namely via intraperitoneal or intr avenous injections. A key consideration in the design of our study in Chapter 5 was that esculetin treatment was started while liver injury and the development of fibros is were already ongoing, most closely paralleling the situation in patients with (chronic) liver disease. Esculetin treatment was given only for 1 week, either in the 2nd, 3rd or 4th week of a 4-week CCl 4 protocol. Remarkably, short early treatment of escu letin effectively suppressed liver injury (serum AST/ALT levels) progre ssion of liver fibrosis. reducing (ALT/AST), HSC activation markers (Collagen 1a1 and -SMA expression), as well as collagen deposition. So apparently, escu letin provides a potent and long-lasting therapeutic effect against CCl 4-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mice. In the studies described in Chapter 4 and 5 , esculetin was administered either i.p. or i.v. is this is expected to exert the strong est therapeutic effect. Since esculetin is present in many medicinal plants, it also relevant now to determine whether it has similar therapeutic properties as a nutr itional supplement. Several studies have analyzed the safety and therap eutic properties of oral intake of esculetin. Long term (over months) dietary intake of esculetin is well-tolerated by mice and rats, with minimal side effects [75-77]. Moreover, Qin pi, the dried branch or stem bark of Fraxinus rhynchophylla that is rich in esculetin, is used in traditional medicine to treat patients with chronic bronchitis and bacillary dysentery in children [75]. In rodents, ingested esculetin is rapidly absorbed wi th peak plasma levels appearing within minutes after intake. Subsequently, escule tin rapidly disappears form the blood and accumulates in the liver and kidneys [78] . Thus, esculetin may hold promise in preventing livery injury and/or liver fibrosis as a nutritional supplement. Future perspectives Alternative and/or complementary therapy for the treatment of acute and chronic diseases has received increa sed attention and recognition over the past few decades. Various herbal extracts, as well as puri fied compounds from those extracts, show medical benefits in liver diseases and include phenolic compounds, terpenoids, alkaloids and flavonoids [79-81]. Thus, natural products that are contained in 6 Chapter 6 126 millions of botanicals and herbs are a rich source for drug development. Approximately 20% to 30% of patients with chronic liver diseases use herbal products [82, 83] and sales of e.g. sily marin reaches $180 million in Germany alone [84]. This thesis aimed to identify the therapeutic compounds from one such medicinal herb, Ipomoea stolonifera, and provide insight in th e mechanisms by which it suppresses fulminant liver infl ammation and liver fibrosis. First, a natural product needs to demonstr ate therapeutic potential in a particular disease, but also safety and effectiveness of traditional medicine products needs to be established, e.g. for hesperetin, esculetin and the raw extract of BE-IS in our study. Such compounds may be used therapeu tically when the disease is already established, but perhaps even more interest ing is their potential to prevent disease development altogether, as our studies on esculetin demonstrate. Ideally, such compounds should be included in the diet as a supplement to prevent liver injury and fibrosis. Future experiments should re veal such hepatoprotective action of esculetin when given as a dietary supplem ent before liver injury is induced. Although clear therapeutic actions have b een assigned to several herbal extracts, their composition is highly dependent on en vironmental conditions, such as climate, season and the location where the herb gr ows. Therefore, the same \"product\" can vary significantly from batch to batch [85, 86]. Consequently, the taxonomic identity of the source and the chemical identity, puri ty and stability of the constituents may vary. This is clearly unacceptable when used as a therapeutic and even as a dietary supplement. Standardization of the extrac ts and quality and safety control are therefore urgently needed, but not in plac e yet. Approval of each new submission must therefore be based on a thorough eval uation of its composition, its safety and toxicological profile, pharmacokinetics and metabolism and identification of its active ingredients [87, 88]. Ulti mately, the challenge will be in the identification of the active constituents of the extracts and th e controlled reconstitution of the most effective mixture of these purified components.

She was born in an inland city, and therefore, from her youth, she always dreamt to go South and see the sea. Her dream became true when she graduated from college and entered Shantou University Medical College for he r master in September 2008. Shantou is located on the coastline of the South Sea of China. During her three years of study, she was immersed into the culture of rese arch and science and also the first results (published papers) gave her more confidence to continue her studies. In 2010, fortunately, there was a fantasti c opportunity to join the sandwich PhD program in collaboration with the Univ ersity of Groningen. She grasped the opportunity with both hands and starte d a brand new life in Groningen, the Netherlands. In Groningen, she called he rself Jackey. Everybody knows her by this name and all like her very much because of the eternal smile on her face. She also enjoyed many amazing experiences, like tr aveling, dancing and fishing. She likes photography very much and all her emotions and feelings were recorded and presented, although sometime she was alon e. In 2013, she had the day of her life: marriage ceremony on July 29. She was so happy and excited to be a bride and get married to her right MAN, Yunsong Yan. This was definitely an unforgettable day in her whole life. Dedicated to her belief and with hard work , she finally finished all experiments in China and Holland, and was rewarded the doctorate degr ee from the University of Groningen. During the 4 years of her PhD, she focused her research on the investigation of natural compounds for the treatment of hepatic inflammatory disorders and liver fibrosis. Many studies were performed using mice and it was extremely hard time to raise and care for th e mice: \"Actually, you have to treat and care for them as your babies every day in order to have good results\" she said. These experiences could be very useful in the next step of her career. In 2015, she moved to Milan, Italy and lived together with her husband. It was really a new start for her as a wife and in Novemb er 2016, she will become mother. Her life will again change very much when the little girl comes. Good luck, Jackey! God bless you! A "}
