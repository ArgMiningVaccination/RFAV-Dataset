During a bird flu pandemic, a [lack of preexisting immunity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10114991/) to novel influenza strains increases morbidity and mortality. Audenz is a [milky-white sterile injectable emulsion](https://www.fda.gov/media/135020/download) prepared from a virus propagated in [Madin Darby Canine Kidney cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9874698/) for [intramuscular](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556121/) use. Audenz's initial U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [Approval](https://www.fda.gov/media/134855/download) was in January 2020 for use in persons [six months](https://www.fda.gov/media/134855/download) and older, and it received [Supplemental](https://www.fda.gov/media/135481/download) FDA approval in 2021. Clinical safety data for AUDENZ in adults have been collected from three studies: Study 1 in adults 18 through 64 years of age ( [NCT01776541](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01776541)); Study 2 in adults 65 years of age and older ( [NCT01766921](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01766921)), and Study 3, a placebo-controlled trial in adults 18 years of age and older ( [NCT02839330](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02839330)). Subjects in all studies received two doses of AUDENZ, administered intramuscularly 21 days apart. Limited adverse events were detected. The journal Vaccines confirmed on [December 11, 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/12/1468/htm), four studies (total N = 6,230) assessed the immunogenicity and safety of mammalian cell-based, [MF59\u00ae-adjuvanted](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/mf59), A/H5N1 vaccine (aH5N1c; AUDENZ) as two doses administered on Days 1 and 22 in children ( [NCT01776554](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01776554)), adults (NCT01776541; NCT02839330), and older adults (NCT01766921; NCT02839330). Overall, an age-related response was evident, with the highest responses observed in children <3 years old. In children, antibody titers met seroconversion criteria 12 months after vaccination. On March 23, 2022, a peer-reviewed study published by the journal [Vaccines](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/4/497/htm) reported, 'A cell-based process may be better suited for vaccine production during an HPAI pandemic; aH5N1c influenza vaccine (Audenz) elicited high levels of antibodies following two vaccinations administered 21 days apart and met immunogenicity criteria at Day 43 among both younger and older adults with a clinically acceptable safety profile. And the consistency of the three consecutive aH5N1c vaccine lots was demonstrated in a [phase 3](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02839330) study. Seqirus has a five-year [agreement](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seqirus-awarded-us-government-contract-to-develop-two-pandemic-influenza-vaccines-301391691.html) with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( [BARDA](https://aspr.hhs.gov/AboutASPR/ProgramOffices/BARDA/Pages/default.aspx)), a division of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Office ( [ASPR](https://aspr.hhs.gov/Pages/Home.aspx)) within the [U.S.](https://www.hhs.gov/) Department of Health and Human Services, to supply products.

Pandemic Influenza [Pandemic influenza](https://www.osha.gov/pandemic-influenza#:~:text=An%20influenza%20pandemic%20occurs%20when,person%2Dto%2Dperson%20worldwide.) occurs when a new flu virus emerges for which humans have little or [no immunity](https://www.seqirus.com/expertise/influenza/pandemic-response-solutions), allowing the virus to spread rapidly from person to person worldwide. For example, influenza A(H5N1) is known as the [Avian Flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/avian-in-humans.htm). Avian influenza A viruses usually do not infect people; however, rare cases of human infection have been reported. On December 3, 2022, the PAHO published [Epidemiological Update](https://www.paho.org/en/documents/epidemiological-update-outbreaks-avian-influenza-and-public-health-implications-3): Avian influenza outbreaks and public health implications. Human Cases with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza 2023 The [U.S. CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/chart-epi-curve-ah5n1.html) published: Past Reported Global Human Cases with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) (HPAI H5N1) by Country, 1997-2022. Update news regarding HAPI infections in people is posted at [PrecisionVacinations.com/Avian](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/avian-influenza-vaccine-2023). Influenza Risk Assessment Tool The Influenza Risk Assessment Tool ( [IRAT](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/monitoring/irat-virus-summaries.htm)) is an evaluation tool conceived by the U.S. CDC to assess the potential pandemic risk posed by influenza A viruses that are not currently circulating in people. Input is provided by U.S. government animal and human health influenza experts. This [summary table](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/monitoring/irat-virus-summaries.htm#table-summaries) for influenza A viruses that have been assessed using IRAT because the viruses represent a particular virus subtype or are of unique interest. Information about the IRAT is available at IRAT [Questions and Answers](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/national-strategy/risk-assessment.htm). Avian Influenza Tests Testing and detection of zoonotic influenza virus infections in humans in the EU/EEA were published by the ECDC on October 3, 2022. This [ECDC document](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/zoonotic-influenza-virus-infections-humans-testing-and-detection) guides public health and laboratory experts in identifying human infections with animal influenza viruses as early as possible to provide early warning and inform risk assessments and public health measures.
