Pasteur was not able to keep his own body in good health and he suffered from paralysis of the mouth in his later years; he also lost, from disease, members of his own family. I have always believed in \"Healer, heal thyself first! Then you have the authority to teach others how to heal themselves. If I had not been able to keep my own Afghan hounds, goats and horses in good health, I would never have possessed my absolute faith in herbal medicine and nature rearing and would not have written my herbal books, which gives over one hundred new and proven herbal treatments. I have also watched my beliefs concerning the inability of vaccination to prevent canine disease come to be sadly; and overwhelmingly, proved correct. Disease rate among modern dogs has not been lowered by mass vaccination; it is greatly on the increase. Vaccination has produced numerous carriers of virulent diseases, or the treated dogs themselves, often given triple vaccinations nowadays, often develop all three of these very ailments-and die a speedy death. The plague diseases of former days have not been controlled by vaccination; they owe their decline to those few benefits which man has derived from modern medicine: from improved sanitation and housing. That vaccination has an insidious effect on general canine health has been noted by observant dog breeders. It is one of the causes of chronic skin disease, especially of the mange form. Also, greyhound owners have noted that vaccination has an adverse effect on the speed of their racing dogs. Mr. James Baldwin, the well known greyhound authority and breeder also of German shepherd dogs, wrote in Dog World concerning an anti-distemper vaccination movement among Irish and English greyhound breeders, resulting from the adverse effects on the natural speed of their dogs, and in support of this, he published a long statement from a greyhound man, whom he described as being \"one of England's most successful and experienced greyhound trainers that there has ever been\"giving his proof that vaccination made swift dogs slow. The famed homeopathic doctor, Dorothy Shepherd, MD, condemning vaccination, has written: \"The more I follow up clinical histories, the more I am inclined to agree with opponents of vaccination, that vaccination instead of being a blessing has proved to be a wolf in sheep's clothing and has produced more misery, more ill health in its wake than almost any other method of treatment.\" There follow the opinions of two eminent doctors concerning distemper immunization; first, I quote J E R McDonough, FRCS, the bacteriologist, in The Nature of Disease, Volume I, pp 75-76: \"Immunization with an attenuated virus cannot prevent distemper. The author has treated many dogs, which have developed distemper despite two or three injections of the preventative agent .... He is of the opinion that fits, chorea, hysteria, etc, in dogs, have become more frequent since the use of distemper vaccine. Successful prevention will never be achieved by inoculation. \" 2 And the other doctor, Dr W J Murphy \u2014 who before becoming a physician was a graduated veterinarian for fifteen years \u2014 expresses the opinion (which is absolutely my own opinion, and is now also the opinion of large numbers of dog breeders and owners): \"No serum no r virus for distemper is necessary nor can it accomplish any good for an ailment that has a natural tendency to get well of itself.\" A quote from George Muir, Montreal, Canada: \"All those with whom I have since discussed the subject and who were in favour of inoculation maintained that the injections could not in any way affect the dog. Then they proceeded to contradict themselves by adding one or more of the following reservations: Don't inoculate during teething. Don't inoculate unless the dog is in perfect condition. Don't inoculate during fall season (in Canada) as weather is so changeable. After inoculation, don't allow contact with other dogs for 7 days. After inoculation, make sure that the dog is in no way subjected to draughts, etc \"Now why should all these reservations be made if the inoculation has no effect on the victim? The common-sense deduction to be made is in my opinion- inoculation reduces the natural disease resistance of a healthy animal--even although administered by experts; and who, in his own opinion at least, is not an expert?\" I was discussing my dislike of inoculation and serum with an important London veterinary surgeon, whose claim was that he inoculated more dogs in a year than perhaps any other veterinary surgeon. He told me that I was being \"foolish, backward, failing to keep pace with modern times,\" etc, in my attitude toward such \"wonderful discoveries as vaccine and serum.\" This veterinary surgeon possessed one dog, one dog only, a Cairn terrier bitch. This one dog belonging to the great supporter of inoculation developed distemper around the time of whelping. Her distemper attack became seriously complicated and not one puppy survived. Yet, during my distemper work, in London, I reared a litter of Afghan puppies in daily contact with the distemper cases that I was treating there. This same veterinary surgeon informed me that it was an act of madness to attempt to rear puppies under such conditions (there were eleven cases of distemper being treated on the premises) and that I would certainly lose every puppy. However, despite the fact that the puppies were seriously handicapped by the mother having been poisoned and the puppies having to be hand-reared, not one puppy developed distemper. Natural Rearing Newsletter May 1995, Vaccinations, Part 1 by Marina Zacharias P 7: As I start to write this I must admit that it is probably one of the most controversial subjects I will ever have to tackle. By now most of you know my own decision was made many years ago to go with a natural form of immunization rather than with the more generally accepted vaccination. Plainly stated, there is no such thing as a 100 percent effective form of protection against disease! Putting it simply, all animals have a unique means of survival with the ability of the body to recognize foreign substances (proteins) and eliminate them. This is maintained by the production of antibodies by certain of their blood cells, often in response to infections. The body thus gains \"immunity\" to the infection--if it survives. Today, immunologists recognize that the immune response is a very complicated 3 process involving many systems in the body. These systems work in specific ways and are interdependent. The immune response has been loosely classified into two types-specific and non-specific. The non-specific response appears to be the first line of defense and is usually invoked when catching diseases naturally. This primary response involves natural substances and natural microorganisms available throughout the entire body. They are able to destroy unwanted microorganisms and toxins. The specific response involves blood antibodies that are produced in response to certain infections. They are effective only against a particular infective agent. A vaccine is aimed at stimulating this specific antibody response. The injection of a very large dose of the disease agent is used (compared to that obtained through natural infection) without regard to the varying reaction of different individuals. It is hoped that antibodies to these agents are produced, that will protect against future infection, leaving the individual with as few symptoms as possible. It is hoped that the benefits to be gained will outweigh the risks. It would seem then that the allopathic approach to immunization concentrates only on the specific. Recent research, however, suggests that this secondary response occurs only when the primary response has been inadequate (i.e., only when sufficient microorganisms have entered the body and got past the body's initial line of defense). The holistic view regards disease as a function of the total state of health in the body and concentrates its efforts on the first line of defense -- the non-specific response. The naturopathic view is that the microorganism is never wholly responsible for disease. Many individuals with microorganisms present all the time only succumb to disease when their state deteriorates through overwork, toxins, poor nutrition, chemical changes from mental and emotional stress, etc. Similarly, if the state of the body changes for the better (even if the microorganisms are still present), the disease state can be cured. This basic division in the theory of immunization is widely misunderstood by the vast majority of people. Today in North America, conventional medicine recognizes and accepts only allopathic vaccination as the legal method of immunization. The homeopathic form of immunization, called a nosode, has not as yet received acceptance under the law as a safe alternative to the allopathic injection method. Despite 200 years of worldwide usage and recent scientific proof that homeopathy is a viable alternative, the powers that be refuse to acknowledge its efficacy. After all, everybody knows that \"if you can't see, feel, measure it, it just don1t exist. As the power of the large pharmaceutical companies has grown (along with their wealth), there has been an ongoing battle to discredit and, if possible, totally deny an individual's right to choose any other form of health care. Herbal, homeopathic, nutritional, etc, all have come under attack for their removal from the American marketplace. For example, on September 1, 1994, a petition signed by 42 self-styled quackbusters, was filed with the FDA which basically demanded the removal of all homeopathic remedies.
