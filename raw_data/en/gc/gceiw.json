Young children will need three doses of the Pfizer infant COVID-19 vaccine at least eight weeks apart to complete their primary series. Moderna's infant COVID-19 vaccine, which has been available for a few months, only requires two doses at least eight weeks apart. \"Other than the number of doses in each primary series, there is no substantial difference between the two vaccines. However, we want to make sure that parents have full information to help in their choice of vaccine,\" said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's Chief Medical Officer of Health. \"If your child hasn't yet been vaccinated, there are plenty of appointments for both infant vaccines across the province. Your child should receive the same vaccine to complete their primary series.\" The primary series for moderately to severely immunocompromised children includes an additional dose of vaccine - three doses in total for Moderna's and four for Pfizer's. Public Health recommends that these children receive the Moderna infant COVID-19 vaccine because with one less dose than Pfizer, they will be protected earlier. However, it is safe for moderately to severely immunocompromised children to receive either Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. Young children who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and getting the Moderna infant COVID-19 vaccine should wait at least four weeks between the first and second dose and eight weeks between the second and third dose. Young children who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and who are getting the Pfizer infant COVID-19 vaccine should wait at least four weeks between the first, second and third dose and eight weeks between the third and fourth dose. Appointments can be booked online at [https://novascotia.ca/vaccination](https://novascotia.ca/vaccination) or by calling 1-833-797-7772. Vaccine scheduling by phone is available Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Quick Facts: - there are about 34,000 children aged six months to four years in Nova Scotia - the Province has adopted the National Advisory Committee on Immunization's (NACI's) recommendations on Pfizer's infant COVID-19 vaccine - children who have been infected with COVID-19 should wait eight weeks between infection and starting or completing their vaccine series - children aged six months to four years are recommended to wait at least 14 days before or after the COVID-19 vaccine to receive other routine pediatric vaccines - children will be considered fully vaccinated 14 days after their last dose Additional Resources: NACI's recommendations on Pfizer's infant COVID-19 vaccine for children aged six months to four years: [https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-pfizer-biontech-comirnaty-3-mcg-covid-19-vaccine-children-6-months-4-years.pdf](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-pfizer-biontech-comirnaty-3-mcg-covid-19-vaccine-children-6-months-4-years.pdf) More information on who is considered immunocompromised: [https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/immunocompromised/](https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/immunocompromised/) "}
