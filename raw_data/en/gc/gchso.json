Even after the vaccine's production, how long does immunity against the [COVID-19 Vaccine](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/what-to-do-before-during-and-after-getting-the-covid-19-vaccine/) last is evident among the masses? Increased spreading of the virus with a high mortality rate, no ideal medicinal protocol and the emergence of several variants are still the most difficult tasks in managing the pandemic. As several aspects of COVID-19 are still uncovered, research is still going on the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness. A Hope comes from the recent studies done in May 2021 that suggest the immunity from COVID-19 vaccines lasts at least a year, possibly a lifetime or may improve over time. Nothing can be claimed with full assurity as of now, this is a topic of ongoing research and we are getting newer updates and results every now and then. In May 2021, two recent research studies were held that provided evidence that the immunity from the COVID-19 vaccine is long-lasting. In the first study, blood samples of 77 mild COVID-19 patients were taken and the antibodies in the blood against the SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus) were noticed. It is found that the antibodies in the blood declined rapidly in the first four months, then slowly degraded in 7 months, but even after 11 months, the antibodies were still detectable. This study provides evidence that COVID-19 infection triggers the immune cells located in the bone marrow to keep a memory of coronavirus and can create protective antibodies when needed. This evidence helps in believing the potential long-term immunity both from infection and vaccination. Another study suggests that COVID-19 vaccines produce antibodies in the blood and initiate memory B cells cloning that provide immunity against the COVID-19. It also protects against the COVID-19 variants. This study provides evidence that the vaccine not only produces antibodies in the blood but also increases the number of memory B cells and other white blood cells which are responsible to fight infection. It memorizes the characteristics of any foreign body and triggers an immune response when the body encounters a similar foreign body again. The data suggest that immunity in convalescent individuals will be very long-lasting. Also, the convalescent individuals who receive available mRNA vaccines will produce a good number of antibodies. These should be protecting against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, as the researcher wrote. Immunity is the ability of the body to kill and stop the spread of any foreign invader or pathogen (virus, bacteria or fungus). It is of two types: Innate Immunity is the body's inborn capacity to fight against diseases and it is the body's natural immunity - the first line of defence against any disease. Adaptive Immunity is a learned response. The immune response developed in the body against the specific foreign body after the first encounter. Vaccines use this concept of immunity and prepare the body to fight against the disease one has been vaccinated for. During vaccination of COVID-19, it induces immunity against COVID-19 by the production of antibodies specific to the COVID 19 virus. These studies and their relevant evidence with a connection of bone marrow and immunity give hope in producing antibodies that may result in the body being able to fight against different variants of SARS-CoV-2 i.e Coronavirus. The memory B cells that were found detectable in the studies even after 11 months might enhance the immunity from the COVID-19 vaccine and there will be no need for boosters. With the help of these studies, scientists can now move in a definite direction to aim for, which will probably give the best immunity against the COVID-19 in masses. With recent research regarding COVID-19 and its vaccination, it has been seen that the result of the immunity from the COVID-19 vaccine will last longer than the months. The chances of prolonged immunization against the virus are high. Antibodies against Covid 19 can be detected in your body for months and even if the antibody counts decline, there is no need to worry. Because your white blood cells keep a memory of the invader's protein and multiply rapidly to produce more white blood cells and antibodies whenever a COVID 19 virus infects your body again. It is important to receive a full course of vaccination to achieve this kind of immunity. It is also stated by researchers that even if you have recovered from a previous COVID 19 infection and your body has generated antibodies in the blood, you must get both doses of vaccination as recommended by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfares, India. As vaccination provides more power to your body to fight various strains of COVID 19. After being vaccinated, It is important to follow [social distance](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/covid-19-how-can-social-distancing-help/), [wear a mask](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/make-your-double-masking-effective-dos-donts/) and avoid crowded places. It is necessary to take precautionary measures not to get infected in the first place.
