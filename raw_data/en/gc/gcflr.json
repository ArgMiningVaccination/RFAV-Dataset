Wellness through proper diet and Lifestyle Proper lifestyle of body, mind and spirit is essential for healing and wellbeing. Each of us is a unique expression of nature. We have a purpose to fulfill and relationships to create and cultivate. The Chinese character for life denotes a rice pot, the rice cooking inside and the lid moving up and down. When, whether in body, mind or spirt, we lose attunement with our true nature, symptoms arise. Dis-ease begins when the rice pot lid gets stuck somewhere and is not released. Symptoms can be interpreted as a call to realign with life. Treatment can help to restore a person to their natural state of happiness and well-being. Health is the result of a balanced expression of oneself. It is the capacity for autonomous action. It is the capacity to navigate life mindfully, without harming oneself or others. Wellness is about the day to day. Treatment done in the context of proper lifestyle creates and maintains a sense of harmony. Proper lifestyle means ahmisa (non-harming) on all levels. For the body it appears as proper breathing, movement and a simple cleansing diet. For the mind it is elimination of negative thoughts and concentration on positive ones. For the spirit, attunement to inner peace and joy. "}
