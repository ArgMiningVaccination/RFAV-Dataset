SAMPLE SIZE DETERMIN ATION Samples size determination and power calculations are detailed in the main SAP. 4. POPULA TIONS (A NALYSI S SETS) FOR A NALYSIS The ysis set used for the explora tory anal yses are described in Table 2. Table 2: Analysis Sets Analysis Sets Description Per Protocol Efficacy Analy sis Set (PP E) All vaccinated participants who are SARS -COV - 2 seronegative at baseline and who have no major protocol deviations (listed in Appen dix 4 ofmain SAP) expected to impact the efficacy outcomes. All a nalyses of exploratory rVE endpoints will be performed based on PPE Analy sis Set. Follow -up time and COVID -19 cases within 14 day s after booster vaccination are excluded from the anal ysis. 5. STATISTICA LANAL YSES 5.1. General Considerations Unless otherwise indicated, all analyses will pool data across ages and independent of comorbidity status for evaluation without stratification. The rVE analysisof booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S will include efficacy data collected during the entire study , i.e.,with an onset date of the event (or censor ingdate) up to the database cut-off or until study discontinuation of the participant.JNJ-78436735 Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL -FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 8 Status: Approved , Date: 23 June 20225.1.1. Study Phases Abaseline (or reference) value will be defined as the value of the last available assessment prior to the vaccination . Study day or relative day is defined as follows: Study Day = visit date -date of Day 1 + 1 ; if visit date >= date of Day 1 (date of first vaccination). Study Day = visit date -date of Day 1; if visit date <date of Day 1 (date of first vaccination). 5.1.2. Phase Definitions For phase definition srefer to main SAP (EDMS RI M-462169) ; Section 5.1.2. 5.1.3. Scope of A nalysis of the Relative Vaccine Efficacy The rVE analysis isplanned to compare heterologous to homologous vaccination with same dose level ,and within each cohort thetwo higher dose level s (i.e., Ad26.COV2.S 5\u00d71010vp and 2.5\u00d71010vp)to the lower dose level (i.e., 1\u00d71010vp). The analysiswill include efficacy data collected during the study until database cut -off or study discontinuation of the participant. 5.1.4. Correlates of Risk A nalysis If feasible and data are available, further exploratory anal yses ma y be conducted to investigate the effect of the immunogenicity responses in various assay s on the probability of experiencing a COVID -19 event (eg., moderate to severe/critical ; FDA harmonized; Asymptomatic/und etected cases) using correlates of risk analysis. Correlates of risk analysiswill be detailed in a separate document. 5.2. COVID -19 case and SA RS-CoV-2 Infection Classification Initial COVID -19 classification isbased on a programmed algorithm (see section 5.2.2 ). Following algorithmic assignment, all COVI D-19 episodes and/or SARS -CoV -2 infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic/undetected) will be assessed (case by case or with a sample approach as explained in the Clinical Severit y Adjudication Charter ) independentl y by a Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee (CSAC, see Section 5.5.1 ). This committee will independently evaluate the severit y of the COVID -19 cases, confirm the onset date as proposed by the algorithm or adapt the onset date based on clinical judgement through objective findings. Severity classification will be based on the highest degree of severit y during the observation period. CSAC determination of severit yis considered the final classification. The process of adjudication is described in Case classification details are described in section 5.2.2 . of this SAP.JNJ-78436735 Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL -FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 9 Status: Approved , Date: 23 June 20225.2.1. Identification of COVID -19 Cases for Adjudication All COVID -19 episodes and/or SARS -CoV -2 infections from the start of the study will be identified using a programmed algorithm described in the section 5.2.2 . Fatalities that occur within the study for which COVID -19 could be a contributory or anunderl ying cause of death will be sent for adjudication, including fatalities not identified by the programmed algorithm. In addition, cases may be flagged for adjudication using other sources such as the Global Medical Safety database. All cases identified b y the algorithm ( Tier I-V)a will be sent for adjudication for review . Participants identified by the algorithm as asymptomatic/undetected infections based on a PCR positive result during their participation in the study and/or based on having seroconverted during their time on study will be sent for adjudication only when the algorithm captures the presence of COVID -19 s ymptoms at any point up to 7 day s prior to the onset of an algorithmic asy mptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection or prior to seroconversion. Cases will be considered ready for adjudication at the time of case resolution and when the data have been cleaned. Case resolution is defined as two consecutive negativ e RT-PCRs and two consecutive days without symptoms. Alternatively , a case can be considered resolved when 30 days have elapsed since its onset. In either situation, a case is considered valid for adjudication when the critical factors related to the case definition have been cleaned. Cases that have not resolved and/or been cleaned may be adjudicated when necessar y to comply with regulator y filing requirements (e.g., interim analy sis or Biologics License Application (BLA)). 5.2.2. COVID -19 Case Classification Rel evant Definition s Definitions relevant to COVID -19 case classification are listed below. Episode (of COVI D-19): An episode of COVID -19 is defined as the period of the onset of (COVID -19) symptoms up until resolution of the episode. The severity of a COVI D-19 will be determined based on the maximum severity observed across the episode. Onset of (COVI D-19 ) symptoms: This is the date when any sign(s)or symptom (s)suggesting possible COVID -19. It will becalled Day 1 of an episode . It is the earliest date the first symptom of an episode entered on the electronic Clinical Outcome Assessment ( eCOA )or on the CRF if entered by the site (\"If a parti cipant records in the eCOA or informs the site that he/she experienced any signs or symptoms suggesting possible COVID -19, this will be considered COVID -19 Day 1 (day of onset of signs and symptoms). \" CTP) or the AE onset date if linked to COVID -19.The COVID -19 Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) narrow scope is used to select AEs linked to COVID -19. [Day 1 will be derived based on the first symptoms that are entered in the eCOA before the first swab is taken. In case there are multiple days with symptoms entered in the eCOA before thefirst swab, Day 1 is the earliest Day of aTier definitions: Tier I: severe cases, Tier II moderate cases with at least one flag=Y (SpO2 <=93%, heart rate medically attended/MA -COV), Tier 3: moderate cases with >=3 symptoms, Tier IV: moderate cases with <=2 symptoms, Tier V: mild cases.JNJ-78436735 Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL -FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 10 Status: Approved , Date: 23 June 2022all consecutive Days with signs or symptoms that are at least mild. Days without symptoms within 7 day s before the first swab will be ignored in the evaluation of consecutive day s.] Resolution of an episode: Resol ution of the COVID -19 episode isdefined as having 2 consecutive SARS -CoV -2 negative nasal swabs and 2 consecutive day s with no COVI D-19 - related signs or symptoms. [The date taken will be the first of the 2 consecutive negative swabs, OR the first da y with no COVID -19 related signs or s ymptoms, whichever comes last. For this determination, all sources of information will be used (eCOA, eCRF or an AE linked to COVID -19). In case of missing days, it will depend on if those are before or after the first day ofthe two consecutive SARS -CoV -2 negative nasal swabs. If before days with missing data have no consequence. If after, it is assumed that if days with missing data are after a day with no symptoms ,the subsequent days also were without symptoms. If days with missing data are after a Day with sy mptoms, the assumption depends on the data of subsequent Days. If there are no more than 2 Days without data and the next Day does have (at least mild) symptoms, the missing day s will be assumed to also have had sy mpto ms. In all other cases it will be assumed that days with missing data were without symptoms and the rule to determine the resolution of sy mptoms will be applied .] Molecularly confirmed case: Events for which at least one SARS -CoV -2 PCR positive test was obtained b y the nasal swab PCR test . A suspected COVID -19 case is a case which meets any of the symptomatic COVI D-19 definitions according to the CSAC without a document edPCR positive result (an y source) or a positive serology test. 5.2.3. Assigning Case De finition The case definitions for mild, moderate, and severe/critical COVID -19 are provided in the CTP Section 8.2. This section provides guidance on how these will be applied. Information on s ymptoms is to be collected from the eCOA (see Appendix 5of the CTP) and from the eCRF (including AEs linked to COVID -19). If the sources of information contain discordant data, (i.e., on a single calendar Day one source records the symptom and another source does not record that same symptom) the symptom is consider ed to have been present on that day. A sign or symptom is considered as absent or present for a COVID -19 episode: any sign or symptom is considered present if observed in the eCOA or eCRF for the COVID -19 episode, and absent if not. Signs or symptoms occu rring at any time during the episode are used for the application of the case definitions. Application of the criteria is independent of duration; if a sign or symptom is present at any time, the sign or sy mptom is considered to be present. [Note that for a suspected COVID -19 case to be tested, at least one symptom of suspected COVID -19 must be present for 24 hours, and not otherwise explained (Section 8.1.1. of the CTP: \" New onset or worsening of an y 1 of these symptoms, which lasts for at least 24 hours, nototherwise explained \"). For case classification the information from the eCOA and eCRF is taken independent of duration or alternative explanations.JNJ-78436735 Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL -FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 11 Status: Approved , Date: 23 June 2022Fever will be assessed independent of anatomical site of assessment (oral, armpit, ear, or rectal). Thedefinitions of mild, moderate , and severe/critical are mutually exclusive, where the most severe category takes priority . 5.2.4. Symptomatic COVID -19 Case Derivation Some symptoms lead to suspicion of a COVI D-19 episode and are used as triggers to proceed with home-collection of the nasal swabs for SARS -CoV -2 testing. The list of symptoms used as triggers for testing are provided in Section 8.1.1 of the CTP. A triggering symptom may lead to a (confirmed) positive SARS -CoV -2 test, even though the case may fail to reach the mild case definition during the episode. These cases are not considered symptomatic. In other words, symptomatic COVID -19 cases are those that are at least of mild severit y as defined below. The derivations for mild, moderate, and severe/critical are given below. 5.2.4.1. Mild COVID -19 Case Derivation A case will be considered of mild COVID -19 severity if one (or more) of the following symptoms is observed , if not satisfying the definition of a moderate or severe/critical disease severity [ black, terminology from eCOA or blue, terminology from the eCRF ]: Fever ( 38.0 \u00b0C or 100.4 \u00b0F)or eCRF Sore throat / Sore throat Loss of appetite / Malaise Feeling generall y unwell (run down) / Malaise Fatigue (tiredness) / Malaise Physical Weakness / Mala ise Headache / Headache Muscle aches/pains / Myalgia Gastrointestinal mptoms Cough / Cough Chest congestion (mucus in chest) Runny nose Wheezing Skin rashJNJ-78436735 Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL -FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 12 Status: Approved , Date: 23 June 2022Eye irritation /discharge Chills Uncontrollable bod y shaking/shivering /Shaking chills or rigors Decreased sense of smell / Anosmia (olfactory or taste disorders) Decreased sense of taste / Anosmia (olfactory or taste disorders) Red or bruised looking feet or toes/ Chilblains/pernio (red or bruised looking feet or toes) 5.2.4.2.

Asymptomatic or Undetected SA RS-COV- 2 Infection 5.2.5.1. Definition If a participant does not fulfil the criteria for suspected COVID -19 based on signs and sy mptoms which would classify them as mild, moderate, or severe b y the definitions, AND has a SARS -CoV -2 positive RT -PCR or molecular test result from any available respiratory tract sample (e.g., nasal swab sample, sputum sample, throat swab sample, saliva sample) or other sample OR determined b y seropositivity for the SARS -CoV -2 N protein, then, the participant will be considered to have experienced asymptomatic or undetected COVID -19. A positive RT -PCR for SARS -CoV -2 will need to be captured in the eCRF. 5.2.5.2. Classification Asymptomatic infections or undetected cases will be classified using a similar algorithmic approach. Cases will then be reviewed and classified by the CSAC .JNJ-78436735 Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL -FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 15 Status: Approved , Date: 23 June 2022Relevant definitions for programmed algorithm Identification of potential asymptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infections via PCR: Cases with a positive PCR will be reviewed for the presence of signs and/or symptoms of COVID -19employ ing the definitions of onset and resolution of section 5.2.2 . In the absence of signs and/or symptoms, the case will be classified per algorithm as as ymptomatic. Identification of potential asymptomatic or undetected SARS -CoV -2 infections through seroc onversion: SARS -CoV -2 seroconversion by N-serology with onset Day >14is based on the available data from Day 71, Month 6. I f positive at an y timepoint while the subject was seronegative at baseline (and at Day 15for the PPE analysis after day 14), a subject is considered to have seroconverted. If Day 14is missing or not available, the subject is considered to be negative on that day. SARS -CoV -2 seroconversion by N-serology from Day 1 to Day 14, is based on the available data on day 14. If positive at d ay 14while the subject was seronegative at baseline or missing, a subject is considered to have seroconverted between day 1 and day 14. A seroconverted participant is a subject with serological conversion without an earlier SARS -CoV -2 positive RT-PCR or molecular test result from any available respiratory tract sample . Upon algorithmic classification , cases will be evaluated as being an \"Asy mptomatic SARS -CoV - 2 infection\" b y the Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee as follows: Asymptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infections or seroconverted participants as assigned via the programmed algorithm will be reviewed for the presence of possible COVID -19 signs and symptoms from baseline up to 7 days prior tothe first positive PCR or up to the day of the first positive serology test. If no presence of signs/s ymptoms, the algorithm will be accepted and no further review by the CSAC and the case classified as As ymptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection. If at least one sign or symptom is present, those cases will be sent to the CSAC for review for a possible undetected s ymptomatic COVI D-19 illness. oIf reviewed by the CSAC as asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, cases will be classified as as ymptomatic infection. oSeroconverte d cases reviewed by the CSAC as symptomatic will be classified as serologically confirmed COVID -19(by N-serology ) and evaluated according to the accepted/reviewed severity and onset date. oPCR positive cases reviewed by the CSAC as symptomatic will be classified and evaluated according to the accepted/reviewed severity and onset date .JNJ-78436735 Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL -FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 16 Status: Approved , Date: 23 June 20225.2.6. Endpoint Selection for A nalysis Unless mentioned otherwise all clinical endpoints will be anal yzed based on the assessme nt of the CSAC, supported by the algorithmic approach as explained above. Cases that are adjudicated as not a case b y the CSAC are excluded from the analysis. Furthermore, for any s ymptomatic case to be included in this analysis there needs to be at least one SARS -CoV -2 positive RT-PCR or molecular test result from any available respiratory tract sample ( e.g., nasal swab sample, sputum sample, throat swab sample, saliva sample) confirmed by the central laboratory . Supplementary anal ysis will include: An analysis based on the algorithmic classification as assigned above (limiting to centrally confirmed cases) An analy sis based on any documented positive PCR irrespective of the source (central confirmation, local site, Covance, external to the study ) accordin g to the accepted/reviewed severit y and onset date by the CSAC An anal ysis will be done including suspected cases adjudicated by the CSAC. 5.3.

Analysis Method Exploratory analysis will be done on the PPE analy sis set including only baseline seronegative subjects. The analysis will focus on the Omicron variant, as this is presumed to be the dominant variant during the observation period. Analy sis will be performed i f there are at least 6 cases available for the anal ysis of interest. i) Calendar -Based Time Scale Method: For the exploratory efficacy endpoints, follow -up time will be expressed on a calendar time scale, and is defined as time since study start (i.e., 08 August 2021) to adjust for changing incidence over time. Follow -up time will begin on the date of administration of the first dose of Janssen COVID - 19 vaccine (within study COV2008) , expressed on a calendar time scale as time since study start, JNJ-78436735 Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL -FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 18 Status: Approved , Date: 23 June 2022although follow -up time and events occurring within 14 days post vaccination with first dose of Janssen COVI D-19 vaccine will be ignored .

Symptoms of Infection with Coronavirus -19 (SIC) The SIC is a disease -specific patient -reported outcome (PRO) instrument that is completed b y the participant, self-administered. The SIC has a total of 30 items assessing signs and symptoms of COVID -19. The first 25 items, the participant indicates \"yes\" o r \"no\" if they have a s ymptom and if \"yes\" report a severity from 0 (none) to 10 (worst possible). The second part has the participant enter their temperature, and the third part has the participant record \"yes\" or \"no\" (absence or presence of additional signs and symptoms). The analy ses are conducted b y part 1, part 2 and part 3, scored separately for PPE analy sis set. SIC Anal ysis: Part 1 (25 symptoms): Each symptom is present or absent (0), and if present rated on a 10 point scale from ranging from 0 (N one) to 10 (Worst possible). The symptom score is the mean score of all items on the SIC for each day, during the COVID -19 episode. The symptom duration is the period from the first day of symptoms till the last day with symptoms in Day s (calculated as la st day with s ymptoms - first day of symptoms + 1). The symptom area under the curve (AUC )is the area under the curve for the complete COVID - 19 episode. The peak symptom score is the maximum of all the symptom scores during the COVID -19 episode. Part 2: F ever/ temperature : Fever will be scored (fever score) as the maximum recorded temperature for each day during the COVID -19 episode. Fever will be coded as 'Present' if the fever score is 38.0 C or 100.4 F and 'Absent' otherwise. The total fever days is the number of day s with fever present during the COVID -19 episode. Fever duration will be the period from the first day with fever till the last day with fever in Days (calculated as last day with fever -first day of fever + 1). The peak fever is the m aximum fever score during the COVID- 19 episode. The fever AUC is the AUC of fever score during the total of fever days of the COVID -19 episode. (For the AUC if there is a single missing day between days with fever the missing day will be ignored, i.e., int erpolation will be used in the calculation of the AUC.) The fever score will also be coded using FDA grades for fever. Part 3: Each of the 3 specific sy mptoms is either present (1) or absent (2). JNJ-78436735 Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL -FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 26 Status: Approved , Date: 23 June 2022The specific symptom score is the mean of all scores during the COVID -19 episode. The specific symptom duration is the duration of specific symptoms during the COVID -19 episode from the first day with a specific symptom till the last day with a specific symptom in Days (calculated as last day with a specific sy mptom -first day of a specific sy mptom + 1). The total specific reported symptom score is the mean of all scores during the COVID -19 episode at which a subject has reported at least one specific s ymptom. Note 1: For Part 1, total scores will be calculated based on the number of assessments completed by the participant per day and in cases where more than 75% of the items needed to calculate the score is not collected (reported as no answer to the part 1 Yes/No possibility AND no severit y rate), then the value for that score will be set to missing. For example, if a participant has responded to 7 or more out of the 25 symptom scale questions the score will be the mean of the available questions. I f the parti cipant has only completed 6 or less of the questions then the sy mptom score will be set to missing, unless a subject has only provided responses 'Yes' to all of the answered questions (then it is assumed that the subject only noted the pertinent symptoms for that day). In case of missing severity rate and the answer was 'y es' the rate will be imputed by '5'. 5.4.3. SARS-CoV-2 Viral G enome Sequence Analysis SARS -CoV -2 viral genome sequence analysis will be performed using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) using the SWIFT Biosciences to evaluate the presence of poly morphisms and variations at the amino acid level. Sequence results will be presented onl y for the spike protein and is focused on a predefined list of amino acid positions of interest. Data are transferred as the consensus sequence from the sample (i.e. no minorit y variants or mutation frequencies are transferred for this analysis). A separate virology report will be prepared. Time Points and Samples Samples for viral sequencing are taken throughout the T&E schedule. An attempt is made to sequence the sample closest to the onset of symptoms, but sequencing is triggered at the discretion of the virologist considering the SARS -CoV -2 viral load levels and the limitations of the sequencing assay s. Definitions Polymorphisms, ie genetic variations, are defined as amino acid changes from the SARS -CoV -2 Wuhan -Hu1 Reference Sequence. Wild type: If at certain position the amino acid in the participant sequence matches the reference sequence, that is no genetic varia tion is present at that position, the virus is considered to be wild type at that position.JNJ-78436735 Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL -FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 27 Status: Approved , Date: 23 June 2022Positions & Genetic Variations of Interest Amino acid level: In the SARS -CoV -2 spike protein, based on changes in the N-terminal or receptor binding domains, and ch anges any other variant OtherNOT any other variantJNJ-78436735 Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL -FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 29 Status: Approved , Date: 23 June 20225.5.

The analysis of the exploratory vaccine efficacy endpoints will evaluate therVE measures and the associated 95% CIs will be estimated. The anal ysis will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model, using the calendar- based time scale. If feasible, the model may stratify forage groups, co- morbidities, site or a higher -level geographical region, to account for potential differences in geographical exposure. 5.5.1. Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee The Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee will review all cases in the study , except for cases alread y adjudicated as severe, as a supplement to the algorithm described in the Section 0, as well as those requir ing medical intervention (such as a composite endpoint of hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and ECMO, linked to objective measures such as decreased oxygenation, X-ray or CT findings), including onset of cases, taking into account allavailable relevant information at the time of adjudication. More details will be provided in the revised charter of the Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee. Depending on an algorithmic selection the cases will be sent for adjudication on a case by case basis or on a sample approach, as explained in5.2.1 . Readjudication will occur if new information becomes available. The last adjudication for a given case will determine the status of the case for analysis.

VAC31518 ((JNJ-78436735 [Ad26.COV2.S]) ) Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL U.S. 11 Status: Approved , Date: 15Dec 20215.6.2. Adverse Events 5.6.2.1. Definitions Solicited AEs shown in the tables are extracted from the investigator assessment pages (CE) of the CRF. For unsolicited AEs, only the AEs within the 28-day period following vaccination will be presented in the safet y tables except for SAEs and AEs of Special Interest (AESI) which will be captured and tabulated in the outputs covering the whole study period. All other collected unsolicited adverse events will be presented through listings. By definition, solicited administration site symptoms are considered to be related to the study vaccine. The severity of AEs will be classified as grade 1 to 4. Solicited events that are graded less than grade 1 are notconsidered AEs. If grade is not present , grading is assigned based on the grading list in Appendix 11. Respiratory tract infections due to SARS -CoV -2 infection will be tabulated and listed separatel y. Respiratory tract infection snot due to SARS -CoV -2 infection will be reported as AE sby System Organ Class and Preferred Term if they occur between the time of vaccination through the following 28 days. Respiratory tract infection srecorded as AEsin the eCRF will be excluded from AE anal ysis if the molecular test result for that event is positive for SARS -CoV -2.In general, an y (S)AEs caused by molecularly confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection will be removed at the analy sis level from the (S)AE listings and tables and presented separatel y. This study defines thrombosis with thrombocy topenia syndrome (TTS) as an AE of Special Interest (AESI), cf. protocol sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.7.1. Suspected AESI s will be adjudicated by a committee to determine whether they fulfill the definition(s) for TTS (and consequentl y, whether they are confirmed AESI s). If additional information (e.g. adjudicated cases, associated lab tests) become savailable in the clinical database, additional statistical analy ses may be specif ied in the DPS. 5.6.2.2. Analysis of Adverse Events Number and percentage of participants with at least one particular AE (unsolicited/solicited) will be tabulated. Solicited AEs will be summarized by class (administration site/sy stemic) and Preferred Term. Unsolic ited AEs will be summarized by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. For solicited AEs, the following tables will be provided: summary ;by worst severit y grade;at least grade 3;related (systemic only);time to onset (in day s);and duration (in day s) for most frequent events and body temperature. Note : Duration is defined as number of days from the start of the event until resolution of the event. The time to first onset is defined as (date of first onset - reference date + 1). The reference date is the start date of the vaccination period.VAC31518 ((JNJ-78436735 [Ad26.COV2.S]) ) Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL U.S. 12 Status: Approved , Date: 15Dec 2021For unsolicited AEs, thefollowing tables will be provided: summary table (including SAE, fatal outcome, and discontinuation) ;all events ;most frequent ;at least grade 3;permanent stop of vaccine ;related ;and SAE.

Thesewill be used to identify participant s who will be reported in 3 above and will be presented in participant narratives . Anti-PF4 data may be presented as table or listing as appropriate. Details onTTS is specified in section 8.3.7.1 of the CTP. The list of thrombotic events to be reported to the sponsor as an AESI is provided Appendix 14of the CTP. AEs meeting the criteri awill be flagged as such in the SDTM database. Listings and/or participant narratives will be provided as appropriate for those participants who die, discontinue study vaccinations due to an AE, or experience a severe AE, a serious AE (SAE), or an AESI . 5.6.2.3. Phase allocation of A dverse Events Solicited events are alway s allocated to the respective Post Dose period. Step 1: Allocation of events to the periods: Adverse events in the SDTM database are allocated to periods based on their start date/time. If the start date/time of an event falls between (or on) the start and stop date/time of a period, the AE is attributed to that period (treatment -emergent principle).VAC31518 ((JNJ-78436735 [Ad26.COV2.S]) ) Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 U.S. 13 Status: Approved , Date: 15Dec 2021In case of partial start or stop dates (i.e. time and/or day and/or month and/or year missing), the events are allocated to the periods using the available partial informatio n on start and end date; no imputation will be done. If, for instance, the AE start date only month and year are available, these data are compared to the month and year information of the periods. This rule may lead to multiplication of the event as a con sequence of its assignment to multiple periods. In case of a completely missing end date, the date is imputed by the cut-off date of the analysis for participants still ongoing in the study, and by the end date of the last period for participants who disco ntinued or completed the trial. In case of a completely missing start date, the event is allocated to the first active treatment phase (post dose 1 period), except if the end date of the AE falls before the start of the first active treatment phase (post d ose 1 period). Step 2: Combination of events: Overlapping/consecutive events are defined as events of the same participant with the same preferred term which have at least 1 day overlap or for which the start date of an event is 1 day after the end date of the preceding event. Overlapping/consecutive events may be combined into one AE or not, according to the following rules: 1) If overlapping/consecutive events start in one of the following periods -Screening or post dose extension (i.e. non -active perio ds) -followed by an AE in -post-dose period (active period) -they are allocated to their respective periods and are considered as separate events. 2) In case overlapping/consecutive events start within a single period, they are considered as one and thesame AE. The individual events which contribute to this AE are retained as individual records in the ADaM database but are assigned the same onset, period, and total duration. All related attributes to the AE/phase/period should also be consistent with th e new event. 3) In case overlapping/consecutive events start in both an active period followed by a non active period, they are allocated to the active period only and are considered as one and the same AE. The individual events which contribute to this AE are retained as individual records in the ADaM database but are assigned the same onset, treatment period, and total duration. All related attributes to the AE/phase/period should also be consistent with the new event. 4) In case an active period is follo wed by another active period, and the overlapping/consecutive events start in both periods, they are allocated to their respective period and are considered as separate AEs. The same rule applies for 2 non -active periods. Remarks: 1. Events can onl y be co mbined into one and the same AE if their start and stop dates are known. 2. In case the completely missing end date is imputed (for period allocation), this date is also considered as a complete date. 3. Time is not considered when determining overlap of e vents.VAC31518 ((JNJ-78436735 [Ad26.COV2.S]) ) Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL U.S. 14 Status: Approved , Date: 15Dec 20215.6.2.4. Missing Data Missing AE data will not be imputed. Participants who do not report an AE will be considered as participants without an adverse event. An AE with missing severity or relationship will be considered as the reported AE, but will be consid ered as not reported for the severit y or relationship. For example, an AE with missing severity will be considered as an AE reported for the analysis of any grade, but will be considered as not reported for the analy sis of at least grade 3. 5.6.3. Additional Safe ty Assessments (if applicable) Not Applicable 5.6.3.1. Clinical Laboratory Tests Protocol -Required Safet y Laboratory Assessments are documented in Appendix 2 of theCTP. A listing of all laboratory values (abnormal or graded, when available )will be made, restricted to participants with at least one laboratory abnormality . An abnormalit y (toxicity grade or abnormality based on normal ranges) will be considered as emerging in a particular period if it is worse than the baseline value. If the baseline is missing, the abnormality is alway s considered emerging. A shift from 'abnormally low' at baseline to 'abnormall y high' post baseline (or vice versa) is also emerging. Ifa laboratory test result is censored (no numeric value is available, but only a verbatim term) ,a numeric value will be imputed by a value exceeding the cut -off value with one unit. (<x: subtract 1 unit from x, >x: add 1 unit to x; <3.45 is imputed with 3.44). Ifno toxicity grades are defined for a test, the abnormalities (abov e/below normal range) will be used. In determining toxicity grades, the following rules are applied: Worst grades/abnormalities are determined over the whole observational period for each trial period separately, including all post -baseline measurements of that period. The abnormalities 'abnormally low' and 'abnormally high' are considered equally important, i.e. if a participant has as well an abnormally low as an abnormally high value post-baseline, both abnormalities are shown in the tables. (This means that the sum of the percentages can be more than 100%) The grading scale for some parameters in the grading table contains gaps (zones where no toxicity grade definition exists) . In these cases, laboratory results falling in these gap zones will be allocat ed to the adjacent worst -case grade. If a lab value falls within the grading as specified in the grading table but also within the local lab normal limits, the value is considered normal. No distinction will be made in grading for sample test results obtained under fasting and non- fasting conditions . If limits under fasting and non-fasting conditions differ, the limits of the condition (fasting/non -fasting) of scheduled visits as planned in the CTP will be used. The same applies to samples obtained und er a different condition (e.g. samples of withdrawal visits).VAC31518 ((JNJ-78436735 [Ad26.COV2.S]) ) Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL U.S. 15 Status: Approved , Date: 15Dec 20215.6.3.2. Vital Signs and Phy sical Examination Findings Physical examination findings will be summarized at baseline. A listing of the abnormalities will be made. Vital signs including body temperature, pulse/heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) will be summarized over time, using descriptive statistics. Abnormalities emerging after vaccination will be tabulated by worst abnormalit y grade using the FDA table in appendix 10. A listing of participants with pyrexia/ fever according to the FDA grading table will be provided. In addition, temperature measurements (whether obtained from the diary or from on-site assessments) will be allocated to predefined temperature intervals (from 37.5\u00b0 C to 40\u00b0C, in half degree increments <38;38to <38.5 ;... >40 ,and tabulated. 5.6.3.3. Other Safety Parameters Not Applicable. 5.7. A nalyses Not applicable 5.7.1. Immun ogenicity 5.7.1.1. Immunogenicity Analysis of immunogenicity the PPI and NI analy ses sets. Selected immunogenicit y analyses may also be done on the FAS. Within each Cohort (Cohort 1 (Ad26.COV2.S primary vaccination); Cohort 2 (BNT162b2 primary vaccination) ), data will be analyzed by vaccine group , and by vaccine group and participant seropositivity status at screening. Data will be presented b y scheduled time point. Selected results will be presented in the same output with both cohorts. For the PPI analysis, samples taken outside of the allowed window will be excluded from the tables and graphs (but will be included in the listings and clearl y marked as results not included in the PPI anal yses). For the FAS analy sis, samples taken outside of the window will be included. 5.7.1.2. Parameters Planned h umoral and cellular immune assay s are listed in the CTP section 8.1. 4. However, not all assay s might be available for all immunogenicity analyses covered by this SAP. Further information on which assay s will be analyzed in each of the analyses, will be included in the corresponding DPS document (s). 5.7.1.3. Handling of Missing and/or Unquantifiable Immune Response Data Missing immune response data will not be imputed. Values below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) or limit of detection (LOD) will be handled as follows:VAC31518 ((JNJ-78436735 [Ad26.COV2.S]) ) Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL 2021-Calculation imputed with LLOQ (or LOD) /2. -Calculation of fold increases from baseline or other reference timepoint : o values <LLOQ (or LOD) are imputed with LLOQ (orLOD) . Values above the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) will be handled as follows: -Calculation of geom etric m ean >ULOQ are imputed with ULOQ. -Calculation of fold increases from baseline or other reference timepoint : o Values >ULOQ are impu ted with ULOQ. 5.7.1.4. Handling of changes in assay status throughout the study conduct In case of changes in assay status, from \"qualified\" to \"validated\", the LLOQ and ULOQ are likely to change as well. If this should happen, then the SDTM database will contain records pertaining to the assay in the qualified status and records pertaining to the validated status, and the LLOQ and ULOQ values will also differ. The statistical analysis will use the LLOQ and ULOQ values associated with the validated assay and will retrospectivel y apply these on all the data pertaining to the assay , including the data obtained while the assay status was \"qualified\". This may imply that data received, statistically analyzed, and presented at an earlier time may change. Graphical displa ys will show the eventually used LLOQ and ULOQ values. Graphs and tables will have an additional footnote that reflects the assay status. Immune Response Anal ysis 5.7.1.5. NI Analysis -Success Criterion and Statistical method Formal NI testing in Cohort 1 will be conducted as a \"within -participant s\" analysis, in which participants' VNA data are considered matched pairs across the two time points.

Sensitivity NI Analysis(cohort 1 objectives) -Statistical method A sensitivity analysis, for the primary objectives 1a, 1cand 1din cohort 1, will be conducted by pooling the 28 days post-dose 1 VNA data across the three study arms and comparing itto the 14 days post booster VNA data in the study arm of interest . That is, for primary objectives 1a, 1cand 1dby pooling all VNA data in Reference group 1 (R1) and comparing it to each of the groups 1, 3 and 4 (see section 5.7.1.5.1) , respectively. VAC31518 ((JNJ-78436735 [Ad26.COV2.S]) ) Statistical Analysis U.S. 23 Status: Approved , Date: 15Dec 2021For each vaccination group 1,2 and 3, the pooled and each vaccination group 14 days post booster VNA data will jointly constitute repeated measures data collected at two time points, Day 0 and Day 15 which are correlated by design. Day 0 refers to the day the primary vaccination (coho rt 1)was collected. Each vaccination group repeated measures data will be analyzed using appropriate statistical model that accounts for the correlation of the repeated measures data. For the analysis of each vaccination group repeated measures correlate d binary response VNA data, Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) (Liang and Zeger (1986) ) method will be used. This approach provides a non-likelihood based or quasi -likelihood approach for modeling correlated responses by specify ing one of a variety ofpossible working correlation matrix structures to account for the within -participant correlations .PROC GENMOD in SAS will be used to fit the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model. The random effects model will include the binary response variable as the dependent variable, day as fixed effects and subject as the random (repeated measures) effec t. Unstructured variance -covariance matrix will be used in the model and the model will fit the probability that the response variable is equal to '1'. Within each vaccination group, Day 15 minus Day 0 responder ratedifferences will be estimated by transf orming the model LSMEAN (in SAS) estimates on the logit scale to probability estimates. The associated 2-sided confidence intervals (95% CI for primary objective 1a and 97.5% CI for primary objectives 1c and 1d) will be determined using the bootstrap Perce ntile Confidence Interval method. A bootstrap sample of 10,000 will be generated with replacement from the original data to accomplish this. NI will then be declared if the within each vaccination group, lower limit of the 2 -sided confidence intervals (95% CI for primar y objective 1a and 97.5% CI for primary objectives 1c and 1d) of the responder rate (Day 15 -Day 0) difference is greater than - 10% (see DPS for some guidance in coding). Similarly , for the analysis each vaccination group repeated correlated continuous VNA data, Mixed Effects model method will be used. The random effects model will include the continuous log VNA (log10scale) variable as the dependent variable, day as fixed effects and subject as the random (repeated measures) effect. Unstruc tured variance -covariance matrix will be used in the model. PROC Mixed (in SAS) will be used to fit the model. Within each vaccination group, Da y 15 minus Day 0 mean differences (log 10scale) and associated 2-sided confidence intervals (95% CI for primary objective 1a and 97.5% CI for primary objectives 1c and 1d) will be determined from the appropriate L SMESTIMATE (in SAS) of the vaccine day fixed effect in the model. The GMRs (booster /primary ) and associated confidence intervals will then be estimated by back transforming the differences in means (log10scale ) and associated confidence intervals, respectivel y. NI, within a vaccination group, will then be declared if the lower limit of the 2 -sided confidence interval (95% CI for primary objective 1a and 97.5% CI for primary objectives 1c and 1d) of the GMR ( booster /primary ) is greater than 2/3 (see DPS for some coding guidance ).

The ratio of binding (S-ELISA /MSD ) to neutralizing antibodies (VNA ), will be calculated for each time point , and per matching variant between binding and neutralizing antibody assays. Values <LLOQ will be imputed with LLOQ for the calculation of the ratios. In addition, the ratio of the fold increase from baseline in binding antibodies (S-ELISA/MSD ) to the fold increase from baseline in theVNA will be calculated for each post-baseline time point. Values <LLOQ will be imputed with LLOQ for the calculation of the fold increase ratios.

For the graphs, original values will be display ed on the log10scale, with values <0.022% VAC31518COV2008 U.S. 28 Status: Approved , Date: 15Dec 2021(only for visual representation; calculations will be based on the actual values). The graphs that show individual participant's data will visually differentiate between positive/negative samples (e.g. differ ent s ymbols and/or different colors). The reported values are percentage of cells expressing the cy tokine(s). 5.7.1.7. Immunogenicity against the vector For immunogenicit y against the Ad26 vector backbone (Adenovirus neutralization by neutralization assay ),the following statistics will be calculated: geometric mean and corresponding 95% CI of the actual values, and number and percentage of participants with a positive sample. If only one time point is available, then actual values at that single time point will be shown as a dot plot. I f multiple time points are available, then GMT plots over time, combining the regimens in one graph (without individual participant dots) will also be generated. In addition, participant profiles will then also be created. 5.7.1.8. Antibodi es binding to the SA RS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein For antibodies binding to the SARS -CoV -2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, the number and percentage of participants with a positive sample at Day 1, Day 29, Day 71, and Day 181will be tabulated .A positive or negative result will be obtained from the assay (qualitative assay). In contrast to the other immunogenicit y anal yses, this analysis will be performed only on the FAS. The definition of the PPI analysis set incorporates the N-serology sample positivity assessment: immunogenicit y samples obtained after a positive N-serology sample will be excluded from the PPI anal ysis. 5.7.2.

Interim , and Planned Analyses This SAP applies to all planned analyses of this study per CTP section 9.5 (primary analysis and final Anal ysis) in addition to the immunogenicity interim analy sisthat may be conducted on Cohort 1 data. 5.8.1. Interim Analysis When at least 330 participants (see CTP Section Error! Reference source not found. ) from Groups 1 to 3 in Cohort 1 have been enrolled and completed the Day 15 visit , it is estimated that immunogenicit y data can be obtained from at least 110 participants in Group 1to potenti ally VAC31518 ((JNJ-78436735 [Ad26.COV2.S]) ) Statistical Analysis U.S. 29 Status: Approved , Date: 15Dec 2021conduct an interim analysis. The planned primary non-inferiority testing of Cohort 1 -Group 1 may be performed on the available data from the Cohort 1 -Group 1 participants. Scope of the Interim Analy sis: The interim analysis will consist of a statistical immunogenicit y analy sis of Cohort 1 -Group 1 participants only. Hypotheses 1a and 1b will be tested, in the hierarchical manner as outlined in Error! Reference source not found. (see CTP): Hy pothesis 1b will only be tested if all success criteria of Hy pothesis 1a 2b and 2c) be tested at the primary anal ysis. In addition, limited safety/reactogenicity statistical outputs will be generated in a blinded manner, for all available participants (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, all groups). The same outputs will be generated in an unblinded manner by the independent Statistical Support Group and will be shared only with the IDMC. The unb linded outputs may also be used to respond to questions or requests from Health Authorities. In this case, appropriate channels of communication will be used to keep the Sponsor blinded. Alpha Spending: An O'Brien -Fleming adjustment will be used whereby the type I error for the NI test at the interim analysis will be 0.0003 (one-sided). This alpha is calculated based on an estimated interim analy sis sample size of 110 Cohort 1 -Group 1 participants (~33% of the total sample size). If immunogenicit y data is available for more than 110 Cohort 1 -Group 1 participants at the time of the interim analysis, then the nominal alpha level of the interim analysis will be kept at 0.0003, but the alpha level at the primary anal ysis will be recalculated. The recalculati on will be based on the O'Brien -Fleming adjustment and will take into consideration the alpha spent at the time of the interim analy sis and the actual information fraction that was available at the time. Procedures to maintain the study blind: This interim analysis will be conducted b y an independent Statistical Support Group. Only group - level unblinded immunogenicity statistical outputs and blinded safet y/reactogenicity statistical outputs will be available to the Sponsor. In order to keep the blind at the laboratory , all available Cohort 1 immunogenicity samples, from all groups, will be shipped and analyzed, if operationally feasible. In case a selection of samples is needed for operational reasons, the selection will be made in advance by theindependent Statistical Support Group and this selection will include, next to the Cohort1 -Group 1 samples, also at least 20 samples of Cohort 1 -Group 2 and at least 20 samples of Cohort 1 -Group 3. 5.8.2. Planned Analysis The primary and final analy ses of Cohort 1 may be performed before the analy ses of Cohort 2.VAC31518 ((JNJ-78436735 [Ad26.COV2.S]) ) Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 CONFIDENTIAL U.S. 30 Status: Approved , Date: 15Dec 2021The primary analysis of safet y and immunogenicity in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 will be performed when all evaluable participants in the respective cohort have completed the visit that takes place 28 days after study vaccination ordiscontinued earlier. The analy sis will include immunogenicit y VNA, S-ELISA , N-serology ) for all evaluable participants through Day 15, and all available safet y data. The sponsor will be unblinded for the respective cohort at the time of this primary analysis, but the blind will be maintained at the participant and study site level up to study end. The final anal ysis in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 will be performed when all included participants in the respective cohort have completed their last visit or discontinued earlier. 5.9.

Appendix 5 Prior and Concomitant Medications The anal ysis of concomitant therapies will be done using the WHO drug code d terms . Based on their start and stop date, concomitant therapies will be reported in each applicable phase. If a concomitant therap y record misses components of its start and/or stop dates (time, day and/or month and/or y ear): In case of partial star t or stop dates, the concomitant therapy records will be allocated to periods using the available partial information, without imputations. If, for example, only month andyear are available, these will be compared to the month and the year of the periods, and theconcomitant therapy record will be allocated to the period(s) where these date parts match. This rule may lead to assignment to multiple periods. In case of a com pletely missing start date, the concomitant therapy will be considered as having started before the trial. In case of a completely missing end date, the concomitant therapy will be considered as ongoing at the end of the trial. There will be special attention to any systemic use of analgesics/antipy retics, started during 8 days following vaccination (00:00 of day of vaccination + 7 day s). Following CMCL ASCD (ATC/DD codes) will be used for this: PRODUCTS, -STEROIDS) and M01B (ANT IINFLAMMATORY/ANTIRHEUMATI C AGENTS IN COMBINAT ION). The classes will be added in a footnote in all related tables and listings. For the use of analgesics/antip yretics which are taken on the day of vaccination an exception is made in case the time is before vaccination . In this case the concomitant medication is also allocated to the post-dose period.VAC31518 ((JNJ-78436735 [Ad26.COV2.S]) ) Statistical Analysis Plan VAC31518COV2008 35 Status: Approved , Date: 15Dec 20216.6.
