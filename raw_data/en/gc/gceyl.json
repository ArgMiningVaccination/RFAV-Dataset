The center is located in the Southern High Plains and is centrally located in the largest crop area in New Mexico. The center is comprised of 156 acres of land, which has an approximate 0.8% slope to the southeast. The center is located at 34.60o N, -103.22o W, at an elevation of 4,435 feet above sea level. The Olton clay loam soil at the center is representative of a vast area of the High Plains of New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle. Research at the center began in 1948, originally as dryland field research. Irrigation studies were initiated in 1960, when an irrigation we ll was developed. Water for irrigation is derived from the Ogallala Aquifer. Since 2005, the center has improved its irrigation delivery by developing two center pivot irrigation systems and subsurface and surface drip irrigation systems.

Scott1 1New Mexico State University, Agricultural Science Center at Clovis, NM Objective To evaluate grain yield components of dryland grain sorghum varieties submitted for testing in the New Mexico Corn and Sorghum Performance Trials. Materials and Methods The grain sorghum variety trial was planted June 14, 2019 in 30 -inch rows under center pivot irrigation. Soil type is an Olton silty clay loam and elevation is 4,435 feet. Individual plots consisted of two, 30 -inch rows 20 feet long. There were three replications for each entry, planted in a random complete block. Individual plots were planted at a rate of 29,000 seeds/acre. Plots were planted with a John Deere Max Emerge planter fitted with cone metering unit s. On April 16, the planting area was fertilized with 50 lb N/ac, 8 lb/ac Sulphur, 20 lb/ac of P 2O5,and 3 qt/ac of chelated Zinc. At plant herbicide applications included Atrazine (1.5 pt/ac), (10 oz/ac), and, Glyphosate (32 oz/ac). Huskie herbi cide was applied on 12 June at 1 pt/ac, as well as Atrazine and Warrant at 1 pt/ac, and 1.5 qt/ac, respectively. Two insecticides were applied, Sivanto, at 10.5 oz/ac, and Onager at 20 oz/ac on August 30. No irrigation was applied. Precipitation during t he period after planting until harvest was 19.0 inches. The plots were harvested on October 11, 2019 with a WinterSteiger combine. Individual plot weights were recorded using a Harvest Master HM 800 Classic Grain Gage, which was also used to determine pe rcent moisture and test weight (lb/bu). Reported yields are adjusted to standard 14.0% moisture and bushel weight of 56 pounds. Statistical Analysis All data were subjected to SAS\u00ae procedures for test of significance difference between varieties. Mean separation procedures ((protected (P<0.05) least significant differences)) were used to determine where differences exist. Results and Discussion Yield data for the 2019 grain sorghu m trial are presented in Table 1, Grain yields, for the 23 varieties in the trial, ranged from 140.7 to 101.9 bushel/acre with a trial average of 120.1 bushel/acre. 17 New Mexico 2019 Dryland Grain Sorghum Performance Test - Agricultural Science Center GX19981 139.6 * * 0 11-Aug * Dyna-Gro M69GB38 135.8 7608 0 * 7227 14.9 * 60.8 * 26.3 * 5.0 0 12-Aug *** Golden Acres 2730B 125.1 * 7005 121.2 6784 12.3 58.7 AG 118.7 6645 11.9 61.3 Golden Acres 3020B 117.2 6561 13.4 Dyna-Gro GX17973 117.0 6554 12.2 60.9 * 114.3 6399 13.2 57.0 18.7 3.3 0 33S40 101.9 5706 11.5 59.46 21.7 6.0 0 1-Aug Trial 120.1 6727 13.1 59.2 22.8 4.9 0.0 5-Aug LSD (P > 0.05) 19.0 1064.8 1.9 3.1 2.7 1.9 0.0 4.8 CV 9.6 9.6 8.8 3.2 7.3 23.9 0.0 <0.0001 <0.0001 *** Highest numerical value in the column. * Not significantly different from the highest numerical value in the column based on the 5% LSD. 18 Performance of Dryland Forage Sorghum Varieties B. Niece1, A. Mesbah1, A. Scott1 1 New Mexico State University, Agricultural Science Center at Clovis, NM Objective To evaluate dry matter and green forage yield and nutritive value of dryland forage sorghums submitted for testing in the New Mexico Corn and Sorghum Performance Trials. Materials and Methods All 13 forage sorghum entries were planted on June 4, 2019 into 30 -in rows under center pivot irrigation. Soil type is an Olton cla y loam and elevation is 4,435 ft. Individual plots consisted of two, 30 -inch rows, 20 feet long. Plots were planted with a two -cone planter at a rate of 50,000 seeds/acre. Prior to planting, the planting area was fertilized with a pre -plant mixture of 7 8 and 20 lbs/acre of nitrogen and P 2O5, respectively. Micronutrients of sulfur and chelated zinc also were applied pre - plant at rates of 8 lbs/ac and 3 qt/acre, respectively. Fertilizers were incorporated into soil immediately after application. Glyph osate, Atrazine, and Verdict herbicides were applied to plots for weed control prior to plant at rates of 32 oz/acre, 1.5 pt/ac, 10 oz/ac, respectively. Huskie, Atrazine, and Warrant were applied for weed control on July 10 at rates of 1 pt/ac, 1 pt/ac, an d 1.5 qt/ac, respectively. Sivanto and Onager were applied on August 30 at rates of 10.5 oz/ac and 20 oz/ac. Precipitation during the period after planting until harvest of the plots was 11.5 inches. Plots were harvested on October 24, 2019 with a tra ctor-drawn commercial forage chopper and forage material was collected in a large basket where plot weight was determined. After plot weight was recorded, approximately 500 grams of freshly cut forage were placed in brown paper bags for later estimation o f moisture content and nutritive value. Samples were dried for 72 hours prior to dry matter determination. Statistical Analysis Varieties/hybrids were assigned randomly to plots in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications. Data were subj ected to SAS\u00ae procedures for test of significance for differences (P < 0.05) among entries and mean separation procedures (protected least significant difference) were used to determine where differences occurred. Results and Discussion Data for the fo rage sorghum performance trial are presented in Table 2. Highest yielding varieties exceeded 22.8 tons of green forage. Mean wet forage yields for the 13 varieties were 15.2 tons/acre, the varieties differed (P < 0.05) with respect to yield. 19 New Mexico 2019 Dryland Forage Sorghum Performance Test - Agricultural Science Center at Clovis Results Moisture Brand/Company Hybrid/Variety Sorghum Maturity Dry Green at NDFD Milk/ Milk/ Name Name Type Group Forage Forage Harvest NDF 48hr Ash TDN NEl Ton Acre % % % %Mcal/lb lb/t lb/a Sorghum Partners SP1880 FS MF 6.2 8.1 55.3 68.9 6.9 61.8 0.632 2937 18153 6.8 61.3 0.627 8.0 61.4 0.627 2946 13639 Sorghum SP2774 FS 69.2 6.4 66.6 0.686 3290 14728 Dyna-Gro 63.0 0.645 3000 60.7 64.1 0.657 3137 SP3904 65.5 0.672 3168 63.1 0.646 3028 1.63 0.018 132 2207 LSD P > 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.050 0 0.05 CV 9.1 6.9 1.9 5.1 4.0 2.6 5.3 1.5 1.660 3 9.4 B.

Materials and Methods All 24 forage sorghum entries were planted on May 29, 2019 into 30-in rows under center pivot irrigation. Soil type is an Olton clay loam and elevation is 4,435 ft. Individual plots consisted of two, 30 -inch rows, 20 feet long. Plots were planted with a two -cone planter at a rate of 75,000 seeds/acre. Prior to plan ting, the planting area was fertilized with a pre -plant mixture of 120 lb/ac, 30 lbs/ac, and 20 lb/ac of nitrogen, P 2O5 and S respectively. Micronutrient zinc was applied pre -plant at rates of 3 qt/ac. Fertilizers were incorporated into soil immediately after application. Total irrigation amount was 7.5 inches applied from June to September at varying rates during the growing season. Monthly amounts were 1.00, 3.80, 2.65, inches for June, July, and August respectively. Atrazine, Brawl and Glyphosate herbicide was applied to plots for weed control at plant at a rate of 2 pt/acre, 1.5 pt/ac and 40 oz/ac respectively. Huskie, Atrazine and Brawl were applied on July 10 at 1 pt/ac, 1 pt/ac and 1.5 qt/ac, respectively. Sivanto at 10.5 oz/ac, and Onager at 20 oz/ac were applied on August 30 and September 24 Precipitation during the period after planting until harvest of the plots was 11.5 inches. Plots were harvested on September 17, 2019 with a tractor -drawn commercial forage chopper and forage material was collected in a large basket where plot weight was determined. After plot weight was recorded, approximately 500 grams of freshly cut forage w ere placed in brown paper bags for later estimation of moisture content and nutritive value. The Irrigated Forage Sorghum tests at Clovis were harvested and fresh weights were obtained. However, a drying oven fire consumed all the subsamples used for es timating dry matter and nutritive value parameters. Hence, no DM yield or quality results are reported for these Statistical Analysis Varieties/hybrids were assigned randomly to plots in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications. Data were s ubjected to SAS\u00ae procedures for test of significance for differences (P < 0.05) among entries and mean separation procedures (protected least significant difference) were used to determine where differences occurred. Results and Discussion Data for the fo rage sorghum performance trial are presented in Table 2. Highest yielding varieties exceeded 28.7 tons of green forage. Mean wet forage yields for the 24 varieties was 20.6 tons/acre, and varieties differed (P < 0.05) with respect to yield.

On February 6, the planting area was fertilized with 18 lb N/ac, 3 qt zinc and, 60 lb/ac of P 2O5. Additional nitrogen was applied pre -plant (103 lb N/ac) and May 17 (90 lb N/ac). Sulphur was applied pre -plant (25 lb/ac). Immediately after planting 90 lb/ac of N and 3 lb/ac of P 2O5 were applied. Pre -plant herbicide applications included Atrazine, Bala nce Flexx, LV 6, and Glyphosate at rates of 1 pt/ac, 3 oz/ac, 1 pt/ac and 32 oz/ac respectively. At plant herbicide applications included Atrazine (1 pt/ac), Glyphosate (32 oz/ac), and Verdict (10 oz/ac). Diflexx Duo and Warrant herbicides were applied on 1 July at 32 oz/ac and 2 qt/ac respectively. Onager miticide (16 oz/ac) was applied on 1 July. Two insecticides were applied on July 30 (Prevathon, 20 oz/ac; Oberon, 8 oz/ac). One fungicide application on 30 July included Stratego Yeild at 5 oz/ac. Total irrigation amount was 15.2 inches applied from May to August at varying rates during the growing season. Monthly amounts were 1.6, 2.0, 5.75, and 5.0 inches for May, June, July, and August, respectively. Precipitation during the period after planting unt il harvest was 10.7 inches. Plots were harvested on September 5, 2019 with a tractor -drawn commercial forage chopper and forage material was collected in a large basket where plot weight was determined. After plot weight was recorded, approximately 500 grams of freshly cut forage was placed in brown paper bags for later estimation of moisture content and nutritive value. Samples were dried for 72 hours prior to dry matter determination. Dry forage was ground with a Thomas -Wiley Mill to pass a 1 mm scre en and ground material was sent to the University of Wisconsin for quality analyses via near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) and Milk 2006 technology. Statistical Analysis Varieties/hybrids were assigned randomly to plots in a randomized comple te block design with 3 replications. Data were subjected to SAS\u00ae procedures for test of significance for differences (P < 0.05) among entries and mean separation procedures (protected least significant difference) were used to determine where differences occurred. Results and Discussion Data for the forage corn performance trial are presented in Table 2. Highest dry matter yields were above 7.7 tons/ac for the trial. Average dry matter yield was 7.3 tons/acre and significant differences existed among va rieties for both dry and green forage yields. 25 New Mexico 2019 Forage Corn Performance Test - Agricultural Science Center at Clovis Results Moisture Brand/Company Hybrid/Variety Dry Green at NDFD Name Forage Harvest CP Starch Ash TDN NEl Ton Acre t/a t/a % % % % % % % Mcal/lb lb/t lb/a Dyna-Gro D55VC80 7.7 66.6 0.686 3250 24947 Blue River Organic Seed 74B75 5.7 5.6 3093 22417 Blue River Organic Seed 70N16 3149 22076 Masters Choice, Inc.

Scott1, 1 New Mexico State University, Agricultural Science Center at Clovis, NM Objective To evaluate ensilage production potential through dry matter harvests and nutritive value of cool - season, small grain varieties submitted for testing at the Agricultural Science Center at Clovis. Materials and Methods This variety trial was planted on November 21, 2018. All 31 entries were planted into conventionally tilled flat bed plots. Soil type is an Olton clay loam and elevation is 4,435 ft. Individual plots consisted of 11 rows, 6.25 inches apart and 8 feet long. Plots were planted at a rate of 100 lb/acre with a pl ot drill. On September 29, 2018, the planting area was fertilized with a pre -plant mixture of 35, 30 and 5 lbs/acre of Nitrogen, Phos and Sulphur respectively. On February 28, 2019 an additional application of Nitrogen and Sulphur were applied at rates of 73 lb/ac and 13 lb/ac respectively. All fertilizer applications were based on soil test results and recommendations. Herbicides applied during the study period included Affinity BroadSpec (0.6 oz/ac), Lo -Vol 6 (12 oz/ac), and Prowl H2O (3pts/ac) on March 25, 2019. One application of Govern (1pt/ac.) was applied on 3/25/2019 . Plots were center pivot irrigated throughout the season. November and December irrigation consisted of 1.5 inches of water to aid in establishment. Adequate precipitation through th e fall and early winter required normal irrigation; and 9.2 inches of water was applied after the post - planting watering event. These irrigations occurred in January (0.60 in.), February (1.0 in.), March (1.2 in.), April (2.8 in.), and May (3.6 in.). Thes e small grains were managed for a one -cut, silage oriented harvest in spring of 2019 (Table 1). Harvests began on May 2, 2019 with the earliest maturing species (rye and triticale) and continued through May 24. Plants were harvested at boot stage (Feekes scale: 10.0 -10.3; Zadoks scale: 45 -53) for maximum forage quality. Although yield is maximized at later growth stages, cutting earlier at boot to early head stages allows for a balance of good yields and optimum nutritive value. Considering the high nutr itional needs of dairy cattle in the region and the common practice of double cropping with corn or sorghum, an early cutting of forages was deemed most appropriate for the area. All plots were harvested with a sickle bar mower set at a height of 2 inches , and total plot weights were obtained to estimate yield on both a green forage and dry matter basis. Canopy height and lodging data were collected at harvest. Statistical Analysis Species/varieties were assigned randomly to plots in a completely randomi zed block design with 3 replications. Data were subjected to SAS\u00ae procedures for test of significance for differences (P < 0.05) among entries and mean separation procedures (protected least significant difference) were used to determine where differences occurred. Results and Discussion : Yield data for 2018 -2019 are presented in Table 2 . Total precipitation and irrigation amounts were less in 2018 -2019 (15.49 in.) than in the previous year (19.51 in.). Yields from the 2018 -2019 season were slightly lower than 2017 -2018 and averaged 13.3 tons/acre for green forage. 27 Table 2.

Materials and Methods The microbial community structure and functions were monitored in 2017 and 2018 at the New Mexico State University Agricultural Science Center (ASC), Clovis, NM. The study had a randomized complete block design in which eight cover crop treatm ents and three replications were tested in winter Triticum aestivum )- sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor )-fallow rotation. The cover crop treatments were three sole cover crops: pea ( Pisum napus L.), four mixtures including pea + oat (POmix), pea + canola (PCmix), pea + oat + canola (POCmix), pea + oat + canola + hairy Hordeum vulgare L.) (diverse -mix), and a fallow (no cover c rop). The size of the individual plot was 40 ft \u00d7 60 ft. The experiment was established under no -tillage management in 2015 in the field that was previously under conventional management of irrigated corn and sorghum for several years. Soil samples were c ollected from 0 to 6 -inch depth of all phases of crop rotation at the time of wheat harvest (July 2017 and 2018). Three soil cores were collected diagonally from each plot using core sampler, composited, thoroughly homogenized, and all visible plant materi als (roots, stems, and leaves) and crop residues were removed by hand. The soil samples were transported to the laboratory, and approximately 20 -g subsamples were used for soil water estimation, and 100 -g subsamples were stored in a -20C freezer for soil microbial community analysis. The rest of the samples were air -dried and ground to pass through a 2 -mm sieve for the soil enzyme activity analysis. In a laboratory, gravimetric soil water content was estimated by oven drying 20 -g soil samples at 105\u00b0C for 24-hrs. Soil microbial community structure was characterized via ester -linked fatty acid methyl ester (EL -FAME) analysis, and soil microbial activity were analyzed by measuring soil enzymes. Results Cover crops affected soil microbial community; abundance of Mycorrhiza was significantly different between cover crop treatments with the highest value under oats and diverse -mix (6.83 nmol g-1 soil) and lowest value under fallow (3.71 nmol g-1 soil). Saprophytic and total fungi were also significantly different between cover crop treatments. The abundance of saprophytic fungi was highest under diverse -mix and lowest under fallow. The fungal sum was 33 47.8 nmol g-1 soil under oats and 47.7 nmol g-1 soil under diverse mix, which was significantly greater t han 34.0 nmol g-1 soil under fallow. Among cover crops, pea, canola, POmix, PCmix, and POCmix remained intermediate of oat and diverse -mix. The abundance of the saprophytic and total fungi was 19.9% and 24.7% higher in 2018 than in 2017, respectively, irre spective of cover crop treatments. The abundance of gram -positive bacteria (mostly beneficial bacteria that are more abundant in natural grasslands) was more abundant under diverse -mix of cover crops than other treatments. The abundance of actinobacteria r anged from 11.4 nmol g-1 soil to 14.5 nmol g-1 soil, and no difference was observed between years, while gram -negative bacteria were 25.7% greater in 2018 than in 2017 (Table 1). Gram -positive bacteria to gram -negative bacteria ratio was significantly diff erent between sampling years, but not between cover crop treatments. It was 26.5% lower in 2018 than in 2017, regardless of cover crop treatments. Total fungi to total bacteria ratio were not significantly different between cover crop treatments and sampli ng years, indicating the same proportion over the years. Soil protozoa community was significantly different between sampling years that their abundance doubled in 2018 than in 2017. Soil enzyme activities also varied between cover crop and fallow treatme nts. The combined enzyme activity was the greatest under diverse -mix (185 mg PNP kg-1 soil h-1), which was statistically similar to enzyme activities under POmix but significantly greater than the fallow. The combined enzyme activity under pea, oat, canola , PCmix, and POCmix remained in - between diverse -mix, POmix, and fallow. Combined enzyme activity under diverse -mix was significantly greater than enzyme activity under fallow in 2018 while other cover crop treatments such as pea, oat, canola, POmix, PCmix, and POCmix remained intermediate of diverse -mix and fallow. There was no difference in enzyme activity between cover crop treatments in 2017. Soil microbial growth and activity were related to cover crop biomass and species composition (Figure 1). Table 1.

Objective The aim of this study was to examine the effect of cover crops on soil CO 2 emissions in limited -irrigation cropping systems in the semiarid environment of the SHP. Materials and Methods The study was conducted at the New Mexico Sta te University, Agricultural Science Center, Clovis during 2017 and 2018. The study had a randomized complete block design with eight treatments and three replications. Treatments consisted of fallow (no cover crop), oat, pea, canola, pea + oat mixture (POm ix), pea + canola mixture (PCmix), pea + oat + canola mixture (POCmix), and six species mixture of pea + oat + canola + hairy vetch + forage radish + barley (SSmix). Cover crops were planted in the last week of February using a no -till drill (Great Plains 3P600, Moline, IL) and terminated by applying herbicides in the third week of May each year. The monoculture seeding rate for oat, pea, canola, barley, hairy vetch, and forage radish was 40, 20, 4, 40, 10, and 4 lbs/acre, respectively. The seeding rates we re 50, 33, and 16.5% of the monoculture rates for two species, three species, and six species mixtures. The individual plot size was 40 ft \u00d7 60 ft. Before cover crop planting, the field was fallowed following sorghum harvest in October of the previous year , and cover crop residues were maintained after cover crop termination until winter wheat planting in October in both years. Cover crops did not receive irrigation or fertilizers. Winter wheat was planted in October 2017 and 2018. At planting, winter wheat received 62 lbs/acre N and 11 lbs/acre sulfur. Winter wheat received limited irrigation (7 to 10 inches) at critical growth stages. Sorghum before cover cropping received 86 lbs/acre N and 13 lbs/acre sulfur each year. Cover crops and fallow fields did not receive any irrigation during the CO 2 measurement period. Soil CO 2 emissions were measured weekly during April (early growth stage of the cover crops) through the first week of October (before wheat planting) each year using a Soil Respiration Chamber (SRC -2) connected to an Environmental Gas Monitoring System (EGM - 5; PP Systems, Haverhill, MA) (Figure 1). Before measurements, 4 -inch-deep \u00d7 4 -inch diameter PVC rings were installed between cover crop rows (row spacing 10 inches f or cover crops and 30 inches for sorghum) at the center of each plot. The rings were removed during field operations and reinstalled immediately after each field operation. Any living plant inside the chamber was hand clipped and removed before each sampli ng to avoid CO 2 contributions from aboveground plant parts. However, root and heterotrophic respiration could not be separated in this study. Therefore, CO 2 measured included emissions from all soil processes. During each measurement, an SRC -2 Figure 1 36 chamber was placed into a PVC ring for five minutes, and gas accumulated in the chamber headspace was measured directly into the EGM -5 analyzer connected to the chamber. Soil temperature and water content at 0 -5 cm depth were measured using probes (Stevens Water Monit oring Systems, Portland, OR) attached to the EGM -5 analyzer. Daily precipitation and air temperature were recorded from a weather station near the study site. Results Total precipitation received during the study period (April to October) accounted for 7 0% of the annual precipitation. In 2017, 503 mm of precipitation was received during this period compared to 417 mm in 2018. Soil temperatures varied among cover crop treatments (Table 1). There was also a temporal variation in soil temperature that it dec reased in May 2017 following precipitation, increased from June to August, and then declined. In 2018, soil temperature increased from May to August and decreased after that. Soil water content increased immediately following precipitation events in both years. Soil water content was higher under fallow than cover crops from April to August 2017. In 2018, soil water content was higher under oats than other cover crops from May to July, but lower in August. Soil water content w as higher with fallow than cover crops in 2017 (Table 1). Soil CO 2 emissions differed among measurement dates and cover crops, with a significant cover crop \u00d7 measurement date interaction in both years, except for cover crops in 2018 (Table 1). In 2017, CO 2 emissions were greater with pea and PC than other cover crops in June and August to October. The flux was lower with fallow for most of the measurement dates. In 2018, CO 2 emissions were greater with POC in June and with fallow, PC, and SSM in July and A ugust than other cover crops. Lower emissions occurred with peas in May and August and with oat in July. Averaged across measurement dates, the CO 2 emissions were greater with pea than fallow, canola, and PO in 2017, but cover crops did not affect gas emis sions in 2018 (Table 1). Multiple regression analysis showed that soil temperature and moisture have a great role in how much soil carbon is released as CO 2 (Figure 1). Daily soil CO 2 emissions increased with an increase in temperature it decreased with an increase in soil water content. Table 1.

Musfiq -US-Salehin, Abdel Mesbah, and Mexico State University, Agricultural Science Center, Clovis, NM Objective To evaluate the effects of compost and different rates of synthetic N fertilizers on soil N dynamics and crop yield in dryland sorghum Materials and Methods The study was conducted at the New Mexico State University Agricultural Science Center at Clovis, NM in 2018 and 2019. The study plots were established in a no-tilled dryland a randomized complete block design of five treatments and four replications. The fertility management treatments were randomized within each block. The size of an individual plot was 30 ft \u00d7 30 ft. The fertility management t reatments were 0, 20, 40, and 60 lbs/acre N application as liquid Urea -Ammonium nitrate (UAN: 32 -0-0) and 6 tons/acre compost application. (N) treatments are labeled as N0, N20, N40, N60, and Compost. Treatments were applied a few days before planting sorghum in both years. Liquid UAN was used with a 30 ft long liquid sprayer - boom mounted behind a tractor, and the compost was applied with a hand spreader. The experimental field was in winter wheat -sorghum -fallow rotation since 2014 and fallowed for 11 months before the planting of sorghum each year. Grain sorghum (Pioneer 86P20) was planted in mid-May in both years and harvested in the third week of October in 2018 while it was harvested in September last week in 2019. In both years, planting wa s done by a John Deere 4 -row planter with 30 inches row spacing and approximately 8 inches spacing between the seeds at a rate of 30K seeds/acre. Seeds were planted about 2 inches deep into the soil. Hand harvesting was done for 10 ft of 2 rows for grain y ield. Composite soil samples were collected from 0 -4 and 4 -8 inch depths of study plots before fertilizer application and planting of sorghum each year. Soil samples were collected again from individual plots at the time of the sorghum harvest. The at -harvest soil samples were collected from randomly selected five spots within each plot, homogenized, and composited by depth (0 -4 and 4 -8 inch). All soil samples were stored at 4\u00baC in a refrigerator before laboratory analysis, which was done within a month of soil sampling. Laboratory analysis included inorganic N, and potential N mineralization (PNM) in 72 -hr of aerobic incubation and total soil N by dry combustion. Labile N content by hot KCl extraction was also measured in soil samples collected in 2019. Results Soil inorganic N and PNM at sorghum harvest were not significantly different between treatments, soil depths in both study years (2018 and 2019) (Table 1). Soil inorganic N was in the range of 0.54 to 1.89 mg kg-1 in 2018 and 0.76 to 1.02 mg kg-1 in 2019, whereas the PNM was in the range of 0.35 to 2.90 mg kg-1 and 0.60 to 1.01 mg kg-1 in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The LON was measured only in 2019, and it was not significantly different between treatments, but it was significantly different bet ween soil depths. Labile N was 33.1% higher in 0 to 4 -inch depth than 3.43 mg kg-1 in 4 to 8 -inch depth. The ranges of Labile N in different treatments were 3.87 to 39 5.19 mg kg-1 and 2.00 to 5.19 mg kg-1 in 0-4 and 4 -8 inch depths, respectively. Total soil N (TSN) varied between soil depths and treatments only in 2018. The control treatment had 5.76% and 5.51% higher total N than N20 and N40, respectively. Grain yield, biomass yield, biomass N, and grain N were not significantly different between treatments in 2018 and 2019 (Table 2). Biomass N ranged from 0.79 to 1.44 % of dry matter in 2018, and in 2019, it was from 1.74 to 2.24 % of dry matter. Grain N was from 1.55 to 1.82 % dry matter in 2018 and 0.70 to 1.05 % dry matter in 2019. Grain and biomass N increased with increasing N fertilizer rate, although the effect was not statistically significant, suggesting that it could increase the quality of sorghum than yield itself.

Allan, Sultan Begna, and Sangu Angadi New Mexico State University, Agricultural Science Center, Clovis NM Objective The main objectives of the research were to evaluate the effects of cutting heights, row spacing, and cover crop treatments on these indicators. Materials and Methods The study was conducted at farmer's field west of Clovis on a 60 -acre field under a hal f- circle of an irrigation pivot. The study had five treatments and four replications. The treatments included a cover crop [cereal rye ( Secale cereal L.) and Austrian winter Pisum sativum L.) mixture], two row -spacing [narrow (38 and wide (76 cm)] , and two corn silage cutting height [short stubble (SS - 6 inch) and tall stubble (TS - 18 inch)] treatments. The cover crop treatment had a narrow row spacing and short silage cutting height (38SSCC). The experiment was done in a half -circle of the irrig ation pivot and spread across all seven spans of the pivot. Spans 1 -3 had 38SSCC treatments, 4 and 6 had a narrow row spacing treatments, and span 5 and 7 had wide row spacing treatments. The cutting height treatments were nested within each row - spacing tr eatment in spans 4 to 7. Corn was planted in the second week of May using a John Deere commercial planter. The corn variety '9678VT3P' was used for both years of the study and planted at 21,500 seeds/acre. Soil fertility management was based on a soil test at the beginning of the experiment. Liquid blended urea and ammonium nitrate fertilizer (187 lbs/acre) was applied each year for the corn, and no fertilizer was applied for the cover crop. The field was irrigated on critical growth stages of corn with lim ited water available for irrigation in the study area. The cereal rye and Austrian winter pea cover crop mixture (70% rye+30% pea) was planted in October last week, at the seeding rate of 40 lbs/acre and were chopped for silage in April second week. Weed c ontrol on the cash crop was done by using herbicides Glyphosate and Keystone NXT at 2.34 L and 3.27 L ha-1 in May and Glyphosate and Status at 2.34 L and 4.68 L ha-1 on June each year. Laboratory analysis included soil pH, EC, total N, soil organic carbon (SOC), potentially mineralizable carbon (PMC), and 72 -hr C mineralization. Soil pH and EC were measured in a 1:1 soil to water ratio. The SOC and total N measured using a dry combustion analyzer, soil available P (Olsen), and K was analyzed at a commercial laboratory. Soil PMC content was measured by aerobic incubation of 20 g soils for two weeks in a quart -size Mason jar modified to hold a 1.5 cm long butyl rubber stopper. The CO 2 produced in a jar was measured in an infrared gas analyzer (LI -COR Inc., L incoln, NE). Effects of cutting height, row spacing, cover cropping treatments on labile SOC and N components were analyzed using PROC MIXED procedure in the Statistical Analysis System (SAS version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc. 2013) for randomized experiments. Results The baseline soil analysis for pH, EC and SOC showed slight alkaline pH with low organic matter content. There was no significant difference between soil properties even in the third year of the project. Soil pH was in the range of 7.8 - 7.9, soil EC in the range of 0.20 - 42 0.29 ds m-2, available P 45.7 - 60 mg kg-1, available K 279 - 357 mg kg-1, total N 1.29 - 1.48 g kg-1, and 11.9 - 13.3 g kg-1 and not significantly different between treatments (Table 1). The little or no difference between treatments is not unexpected given the semiarid climatic conditions (high temperature and minimal precipitation) in eastern New Mexico. The short term soil C mineralization varied with cropping practices and cover cropping treatments in the first and third years but not in the second year (Figure 1a). In the first year, 72 - hr C mineralization was significantly greater in treatment with tall stubble and wider s pacing treatment whereas it was significantly greater with cover cropping and narrow spacing in the third year of the study. All other treatments were not significantly different in either year. The PMC followed the same trend as 72 -hr C mineralization in the third year of the study that cover cropping treatment had more PMC than all other treatments (Figure 1b). However, the response was not consistent in the first and second years. There was no difference between treatments on PMC in the first year. In th e second year, the PMC was significantly higher in narrow row spacing with tall stubble treatment than short stubble and wide row - spacing treatment. By estimating the response rate of PMC to 72 -hr C mineralization, we demonstrated that later can serve as a quick measure to measure microbially available carbon and their activity in soils (Figure 2). The 72 -hr C mineralization could help in the rapid estimation of soil health. Table 1. Baseline and third -year data on soil properties under various treatment s.

Puppala1 1New Mexico State University, Agricultural Science Center at Clovis, NM Objective To develop a variety that can yield high, produce three or more kernels per pods, resistant to diseases, maintain red skin and taste of Valencia with high oleic chemistry. Material and Methods The experimental trial was planted on June 4, 2019, in 36 -inch rows under center pivot irrigation. The study site was on a commercial peanut grower's field in Portales, New Mexico. Soil type is an Amarillo -Acuff -Olton, and elevation is 4006 feet. Individual plots consisted of two rows, 36 - inch rows with 500 feet long. There were four replications for each entry, planted in a randomized complete block. Individual plots were planted at a seed rate of five seeds/foot . Plots were planted with a John Deere Max Emerge planter fitted with cone metering units. About 2 tons of compost was applied over the field in April 2019. The previous crop was a CRP grass. The irrigation amount was roughly 1.5 inches per week except at planting when 3 inches of water was applied. The total irrigation amount, including precipitation received during the growing season, was roughly 20 inches. Peanuts were dug on October 12, 2019, and left for a week for drying. Peanuts were thrashed wit h a Lilliston big thrasher. Individual plot weights were recorded after drying the samples to 8% moisture. The plot yield was converted to pounds per acre and the results are reported in Table 1. Peanut quality, as measured by Total Sound Mature Kernels (TSMK), was graded using 500 grams of pods. Statistical Analysis Data for each variable were analyzed using the PROC MIXED model in SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute). An LSD t -test was used for mean separation involving entries (Steele and Torrie, 1989). Resul ts and Discussion Three advanced breeding lines, namely CR -27, CR -47, and CR -19, showed higher pod yield compared to the check cultivar, Valencia -C (Table 1). All these materials were high oleic except the check Valencia -C. The grade ranged from 70 to 74 percent. The net re turn was higher for the breeding line CR -19 ($813.94), followed by CR -47 ($757.14) and CR -27 ($720.46). The average yield for the trial was 3365 lb/ac. 45 Table 1.

Puppala1 and S. Sanogo2 1New Mexico State University, Agricultural Science Center at Clovis, NM Entomology, Plant Pathology and Weed Science, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM Objective To minimize the impact of soilborne pathogens on Valencia peanut by treating seeds wit h commercially available organic seed treatment products. Materials and Methods The experimental trial was planted on June 3, 2019, in 36 -inch rows under center pivot irrigation. The study site was on an organic peanut grower's field in Lingo, New Mexic o. Soil type is an Amarillo -Acuff -Olton, and elevation is 3986 feet. Individual plots consisted of two rows, 36 -inch rows with 20 feet long. There were four replications for each entry, planted in a randomized complete block. Individual plots were plant ed at a seed rate of five seeds/foot. Plots were planted with a John Deere Max Emerge planter fitted with cone metering units. The details of the seed treatments are provided in Table 1, along with the application type (seed treatment or liquid) and the rate of application. The list of treatments evaluated included a chemical (Dynasty) product for comparison. About 2 tons of compost along with chicken manure at the rate of 50 lb/ac was applied over the field in April 2019. The previous crop was a CRP gra ss. The irrigation amount was roughly 1.5 inches per week except at planting when 3 inches of water was applied. The total irrigation amount, including precipitation received during the growing season, was roughly 25 inches. Peanuts were dug on October 1 8, 2019, and left for a week for drying. Peanuts were thrashed with a small plot thrasher. Individual plot weights were recorded after drying the samples to 8% moisture. The plot yield was converted to pounds per acre and the results are reported in Table 2. Peanut quality, as measured by Total Sound Mature Kernels (TSMK), was graded using 500 grams of pods. Statistical Analysis All data were subjected to SAS\u00ae procedures for a test of significant difference between varieties. Mean separation procedures ((protected (P<0.05) least significant differences)) were used to determine where differences exist. Results and Discussion Peanut pod yield data along with TSMK for the 2019 seed treatment study are presented in Table 2. The average pod yield for the tri al was 1406 lb/ac. The highest pod yield was recorded when the peanut seeds were treated with Cilus plus (1626 lb/ac). A preparation of Bacillus velezensis, commercial in Europe. Application of Cilus plus resulted in an increase of 363 lb/ac or 28.7% compared to the Untreated Check (1263 lb/ac). The chemical check Dynasty (1406 lb/ac) which was significantly not different from the organic seed treatments Trilogy (1478 lb/ac.), AKX 618 (1408 lb/ac), and Mycostop (1466 lb/ac.). By treating the Valencia peanut seeds with organic products a grower can benefit anywhere from $ 236 with AKX -602 to $ 315 with Cilus. Estimatednet result will give a true picture based on the cost of the prod uct and the rate of application. We plan to repeat this study again in the 2020 growing season. 47 Table 1.

Puppala1 and A. Scott1 1New Mexico State University, Agricultural Science Center at Clovis, NM Objective To evaluate commercial cotton varieties suitable for eastern New Mexico. Materials and Methods The cotton variety trial was pl anted on May 3, 2019, in 30 -inch rows under center pivot irrigation. Soil type is an Olton silty clay loam, and elevation is 4,435 feet. Individual plots consisted of single, 30 -inch rows 30 feet long. There were four replications for each entry, planted in a completely random block. Individual plots were planted at a seed rate of 5 seeds/foot. Plots were planted with a John Deere Max Emerge planter fitted with cone metering units. On May 14, the planting area was treated with herbicides Caprol @ 1.6 pt/ac and Prowl H2O @ 2 pt/ac as pre -emergence application. After planting on June 15, 2019, herbicides Panther SC (3 Oz/ac), and Brawl (1 pt/ac) were sprayed irrigated. Fertilizer applied was 28 -0-0-5 N:P:K + Sulphur at the rate of 30 gallons per acre . Growth regulators applied were, Prevathon 20 Oz/ac, Pix 24 Oz/ac, Prep @ 20 Oz/ac and Def 6 2 pt/ac. The total irrigation amount was 4.5 inches applied over the growing period. Precipitation received during the growing period was 19.0 inches. The plots were harvested on November 22, 2019, with a cotton stripper. Individual plot weights were recorded. For fiber quality, each individual plot was hand -harvested with 25 bolls randomly picked within a plot. The fiber samples were sent to the Louisiana State U niversity ginning lab after calculating the lint percent from 25 boll samples. Statistical Analysis All data were subjected to SAS\u00ae procedures for a test of significant difference between varieties. Mean separation procedures ((protected (P<0.05) least significant differences)) were used to determine where differences exist.

This system may improv e long term sustainability and profitability of irrigated agriculture in the region, while reversing the degraded soil quality and ecosystem over time. Objectives: - To assess the effect of circular buffer strips on wind speed experienced by corn at soil surface. - To evaluate the effect of circular grass buffer strips on corn physiological processes. - To evaluate growth, and yield of corn with and without circular grass buffer strips. Materials and Methods A long-term project was initiated at the New Mexico State University Agricultural Science Center, Clovis (34.60 N, 103.22 W, elevation 1331m). A mixture of native warm season and cool season grasses (seven species) were planted on August 8, 2016 on a quarter section of a pivot. The quarter facing southw est direction was selected as it is the pre -dominant wind direction CBS (Fig 1a). A Quarter section of nearby pivot facing the same direction without CBS served as control (Fig 1a). Outer most strip in the pivot was 30 ft wide grass strip, which alternated with 60 ft wide crop strips. Encouraged from preliminary results in 2017 and 2018, the trial was continued in 2019. Pioneer 1151 cultivar of corn was planted on 05/08/2019 with 0.76 m row spacing. Each crop strip in CBS had 24 corn rows. A total of 270 mm of irrigation was applied to corn in CBS and control. Grass strips of CBS received two irrigations of 51 mm each, one on 15th March 2019 to initiate grass growth and second on 25th May 2019 because it was extremely dry. In August 2019, as the corn was gro wn above grass height (benefit of CBS is minimum on corn), grass was swathed and baled. Wind sensors were installed at a 1.5 m, 9.1 m, and 16.5 m distance from the edge of first grass strip and the outer edge of control pivot. They were installed close to soil surface to monitor the effect of grass buffer strips on wind speed. Physiological (photosynthetic rate, water potential, and chlorophyll florescence) and agronomic measurements (plant height and biomass) were taken at V -4, V-6, V-8, and tasseling stag e at 2 -weeks interval. In addition, agronomic measurements were also taken at R3 and maturity. Physiological measurements were taken at noon, on a fully opened corn leaf. LI -COR6400 portable photosystem was used to measure leaf photosynthetic rate. A conti nuous source fluorometer (Model OS 30p, Opti -Science) was used to measure fluorescence. A pressure bomb apparatus was used to measure leaf water potential. Both physiological and agronomic measurements were taken at various distances from the outer edge in both CBS and control. In CBS, all these observations were taken only in the first crop strip. For biomass sampling, 4 plants from different rows were harvested, chopped and fresh weight was recorded. Samples were oven dried at 6 5 C for 72 h. Dry biomass weight was recorded 55 when a constant dry weight s were obtained after drying for three days. At maturity, 10 plants were hand harvested for biomass. To assess the effect on large plots and integrate effects on different locations in the edge, 12 passes of 8 rows wide were harvested in CBS pivot and control pivot. In CBS, each crop strip had 3 passes, two sharing edges with grass strips and one in the middle (Fig 1b). The seed yield was adjusted to a standard seed moisture content . Results and Discussion The first corn strip in CBS experienced lower wind speed at the soil surface than control (Fig 2). This indicates that grass buffers can reduce impact of wind on plants, soil, and soil evaporation. Moderation of wind by grass buffer had a positive effect o n corn growth and development. Leaf water potential, chlorophyll florescence, and photosynthetic rate of corn at tasseling (considered as the most drought -sensitive growth stage of corn) was higher in CBS than control (Table 1). This suggests that corn in control pivot experienced higher -level of water stress than CBS, even though both received same amount of irrigation. The growth and development of corn was better in CBS, especially near the outer edge. At 1.5 m from the outer edge, corn plants produced 3 2% more biomass and were 16% taller in CBS than control (Table 2). Overall, CBS produced 15% higher corn biomass than control. Attributing to improved physiological response and growth, corn yield was 9%, 20%, and 15% higher at outside, middle, and inside edge (8 -row passes) in CBS. Results indicates that alternate grass buffer strips improved corn growth, yield, and water use efficiency (higher yield with same amount of irrigation and rainfall) by minimizing wind stress which is known to increase evapotran spiration demand, especially in hot and dry conditions. In addition, perennial grass buffer strips were used by birds to lay eggs (Fig 4). Thus, by converting under/un -utilized part of partial pivots may not only improve agricultural productivity but also can increase water use -efficiency and wildlife activity. a b Fig 1. (a) Location of CBS and control pivot at ASC, Clovis. (b) Three harvest passes (each having 8 rows) of corn strip in CBS. Since, there were 4 corn strips, a total 12 passes were harvested. Similar number of passes were harvested in control pivot. 56 Table 1.

Material and Methods This was an incubator study conducted at NMSU Agricultural Science Center in Clovis NM (34\u00b0 35' N, 103\u00b0 12' W and elevation of 1348 m above mean sea level). Design: Split plot design. Treatments: Main different g uar cultivars (Kinman, Monument, Judd 69, Matador, Lewis and Santa Cruz ). Results and Discussion Temperature improved the final seed germination in all cultivars. Most of the cultivars recorded highest germination in 19\u00b0 - 25\u00b0C temperature range. The germination percentage was decreased both at above and below this temperature range. A drastic decline was observed in germination percentage in most of the cultivars when temperature decreased from 22 \u00b0C to 19 \u00b0C. At the lowe st temperature (13 \u00b0C), Kinman had germination percentage above 75%, while other lower than 45% germination. Kinman showed consistent germination percentage at all temperatures from 16 to 28 \u00b0C. Matador recorded lowest germination percenta ge at lower temperature ranges (13 to 19 \u00b0C), but as temperature increases, germination percentage of Matador surpassed the germination percentage of Monument, Lewis and Santa Cruz and reached 95% at the highest temperature (28 \u00b0C). This shows the germinatio n potential of Kinman at lower temperature and suggest high variability present among available guar cultivars. In general, seed vigor index was increased with increase in temperature. Kinman had higher seed vigor index at lower temperature ranges (16 to 1 9\u00b0C) and Matador had lowest seed vigor index at temperature range of 13 to 22 \u00b0C. The mean germination time also showed some interesting trend. The mean germination time was decreasing with increase in temperature. At temperature range of 13 to 19 \u00b0C, Kinman was the fastest while Monument and Matador were the slowest cultivars and they took longer time to germinate as compared to other cultivars. Further increase in temperature, changed the mean germination time of Monument drastically and it was fastest to g erminate at the highest temperature (28\u00b0C). This illustrate s that Kinman could prove a better cultivar for the areas having cooler temperatures. 59 Fig.1 Evaluating the effect of temperature and cultivars on seed germination percentage, seed vigor index and mean germination time (MGT ) of six guar cultivars grown in a dark growth chamber at temperature range of 13 \u00b0C - 28\u00b0C. 60 Crop Growth Stage Based Deficit Irrigation Management in Guar Crop Sangu Angadi , Jagdeep Singh , Sultan Science Center, New Mexico State University, Clovis, NM Objective To examine the effect of critical stage based deficit irrigation on in -season biomass, seed yield and harvest index under pre-irrigation and no pre-irrigation conditions . Material and Methods Experiment location was NMSU Agricultural Science Center in Clovis NM (34\u00b0 35' N, 103\u00b0 12' W and elevation of 1348 m above mean sea level). Design: Strip block design with three factors . Treatments: Main plot: 1) Pre -irrigation. 2) No pre -irrigation. Main plot: Four in season irrigation treatments [Fully irrigated (FI), Irrigation water stress at vegetative stage (Vst), Irrigation water stress at reproductive stage (Rst) and R ainfed /Dryl and (RD)]. Sub plot : Guar cultivars (Kinman and Monument ). Date of sowing: July 3 and June 12 in 2018 and 2019 respectively . Spacing: Row to row distance was 30 inches . Seed rate : 8 lbs/acre . Replications: 4 (Four replica of each treatment) Results and Discussion Seed yield under pre -irrigation treatment recorded 27% more and 9% less than seed yield under no pre -irrigation treatment in 2018 and 2019 respectively (Table 1). The harvest index (HI) was recorded lower in pre -irrigated plots in both years. Th is indicates that guar was not able to contribute the pre -season irrigation into seed yield formation effectively (Table 1). We did not observe any significant differences for final seed yield between Rst and Vst treatments. Fully irrigated treatment recor ded the highest seed yield in both years, although not significantly different than other stress treatments, excluding RD in 2019. This shows the drought tolerance of guar. Overall, both cultivars performed similarly, and Kinman had higher seed yield than Monument. Application of pre -irrigation improved the aboveground biomass significantly in 2018, while effect of pre -irrigation in 2019 was not significant. The fully irrigated treatment had higher 61 aboveground biomass and rainfed treatment recorded the lowe st aboveground biomass in both years. The Rst treatment had higher aboveground biomass than Vst treatment throughout the season in 2018. During 2019, the Rst treatment recorded higher aboveground biomass in the initial vegetative growth stage. Afterwards, Vst treatment surpassed the Rst treatment and recorded higher aboveground biomass at the end of crop season. There were significant differences recorded for the aboveground biomass of cultivars. Kinman recorded higher biomass than Monument. This might be d ue to non -branching and early maturing habit of Monument (Figure 2). Table 1.

Materials and Methods The experiment was conducted for three years (2016 to 2018) at the New Mexico State University Agricultural Science Center , Clovis (34.60 N, 103.22 W, winter canola ( Brassica napus L.) were planted under a center -pivot irrigation system in rotation with wheat. Field was disked and ploughed to prepare it for planting and to incorporate wheat residue. The experiment was planted on September 20th, 12th, and 12th of 2016, 2017, and 2018 respectively using an eleven -row drill (John Deer Maximizer). The plot size was 9.1 m \u00d7 1.7 m with one pass per plot. Crop was planted at 15 cm row spacings at a 4.5 Kg ha-1 seed rate . Split block design with split -split arrangement was used with - Dormant period irrigation (DI: applied, and NDI: not applied) as main plot treatment - Growth -Stage Based irrigation ( Irr - fully irrigated , VStss - no irrigation during vegetative growth , RStss - no irrigation during reproductive period , RD - rainfed) as sub -plot treatment. - Three winter canola cultivars (Riley, Hekip, and DKW -46-15) as sub -sub plot treatment Irrigation treatments were started after crop was well established. A total of 99 mm, 33 mm, and 33 mm of irrigation was applied for establishmen t in 2016 -17, 2017 -18, and 2018 -19 respectively (Table 1). To evaluate seasonal growth of winter canola, aboveground b iomass samples were collected several times during the growing season. An area of 0.25 m2 was hand harvested and oven dried at 65 C for 7 2 h. Dry biomass weight was recorded when a constant dry weight was obtained after drying for three days. At maturity, a n area of 1 m2 was hand harvested to calculate harvest index. Plant samples were oven -dried, weighted, and then were thresehed using a plot combine (Model Elite Plot 2001, Wintersteiger, Reid, Austria ) to obtain seed yield. Harvest index was calculated as the ratio of seed yield to total dry plant biomass. For final seed yield, an area of 9.2 m2 was harvested using the above -mentioned plot combine . The seed yield was adjusted to a standard 10% seed moisture. Results and Discussion Applying irrigation during dormant period significantly increased aboveground biomass in 2016 and 2017 but did not had similar effect in 2018 (Table 2). Relatively higher biomass in DI increased canola's capacity to intercept photosynthetic active radiatio n (PAR). This advantage of DI over NDI was of greater magnitude in first two years than the third year. In 2018 -19, NDI plots were on the downhill side of field slope. Therefore, these plots were better placed to receive more rainwater (runoff). Winter can ola was able to recover from early vegetative -stage water 64 stress -like condition. Biomass accumulation was increased in VStss, once the irrigation was resumed after flowering. Attributing to improved growth, VStss produced 8%, 11%, and 20% more seed yield t han RStss in 2016 -17, 2017 -18, and 2017 -18 respectively (Table 2). Dormant irrigation did not influence oil content (OC) and harvest index (HI) (Table 3). Compared to Irr, harvest index was significantly reduced in RStss and RD in all three years. While, H I for VStss and Irr treatment was similar in 2017 -18 and 2018 -19 (Table 3). Out of three cultivars, Hekip performed better during three seasons. Winter canola seems to be performing well in southern High Plains and can prove a viable option in the face of water scarcity. Farmers can further reduce water inputs by restricting irrigation during vegetative stage without much yield loss. Table 1.

Forage corn is the main row crop for dairy industry, but production system removes most of the vegetation out of field living soil exposed to wind and water erosion. With wide row spacing of 30\", 3 to 6\" silage cutting height and long fallow period, the system is inefficient to conserve soil and w ater resources and hence corn silage system is unsustainable. Recent observations are also suggesting that bottom portion of the stem in corn is of lower quality and it lowers overall quality of forage. We hypothesized that increasing corn cutting height a nd decreasing row spacing has the potential to conserve soil and water and also improve forage quality without affecting forage yield significantly. Objective: On-farm demonstration /research to evaluate effect of increased forage corn cutting height (6 vs. 21\") and reduced row spacing (15 vs. 30\") on forage yield, forage quality, soil quality (soil organic matter components), soil moisture, wind dynamics and economics. Materials and Methods The second year of the project was established in spring of 201 8 in dairy producer's (co - operator, Heritage Dairy Farm) field near Clovis, NM in a half -circle of a center pivot (6o acres). The field has seven spans encompassing two corn row spaci ng, two forage corn (silage) cutting height. The experimental design is a split -plot design with four replications (span 4, 5, 6 and 7); row spacing and silage cutting height as main and sub -plots, respectively. Corn was planted on May 12 and 17, in 2017 a nd 2018 respectively. In 2017 corn was planted into no -tilled field (previous crop canola) , while in 2018 was into previous corn field using commercial planter (model DB60, John Deer Planter, Moline IL, USA). The corn variety '9678VT3P' was selected for th e trial for both years. It was planted at 22 ,000 seeds ac-1 in both years. Liquid fertilizer blend (32 -0-0) was pumped through sprinkler at a rate of 5.35, 6.58 and 5.59 tons in June 16, 24 and July 27, 2018 resulting in total equivalent of 187 lbs ac -1 of nitrogen. Herbicide Glyphosate and Keystone nxt at 32oz and 1.4 qt ac -1 in May 13 and Glyphosate and Status at 32 oz and 2 oz qt ac -1 in June 24, 2017 were applied for weed control. The field operation follows producer's management practices. Crop was ir rigated although the availability of irrigation water was limited (13 inches in total). Soil samples were taken in May 18, 2017 before fertilizer application and after final harvest in fall of both years . Samples were taken by a graduate student (partially funded by this grant) guided by supervisor (Co -PI) with the GPS grid mapping approach prepared earlier. Samples processing/analysis for soil organic matter components (such as mineralizable carbon, nitrogen, available phosphorus, and inorganic N (NH4 and NO3) taken in October of 2017 and 2018 after forage harvest. Soil quality, forage 67 yield and quality were assessed each year. A strip of 20 ft wide in the center of each plots of varying length depending on the span size (ranging from 1983 ft to 3680 ft) wa s harvested using producer's commercial forage chopper and collected in a separate truck. Plot weights were determined by weighing the truck with and without forage from the plot. Two samples of about 500 grams were collected from each plot harvest and pla ced in paper bags and plastic bags for estimation of moisture content and nutritive value. After fresh weights were recorded, samples were dried to a constant weight at 65C. Dried and fresh weights were used to estimate forage biomass production per acre. The dried samples were ground to pass through a 1 -mm screen using a Wiley Mill (Thomas Manufacturing) and submitted to the certified Laboratory in University of Wisconsin to estimate nutritive values using near -infrared spectroscopy and Milk 2000 technolo gy. A cover cropping (Rye -winter pea mixture, variety Elbon and Austrian, respectively) treatment was also added in the section of the field (span 1, 2 and 3) in conjunction with short cut/stubble height and narrower spacing after forage harvest for compa risons with other treatments mentioned above. The rye -pea mixture (65:35 %) was planted at 41 lbs ac -1 rate. Cover crop was planted in November of 2017. Once cover crop was established sensors were set for wind and soil moisture dynamics monitoring. Senso rs (wind and soil temperature) for microclimate observations were set in December of 2017 and 2018 and monitoring of wind, temperature and periodical soil moisture readings (with portable soil moisture reader) under the different corn cutting/stubble heigh t-row spacing combination treatments including cover crop treatment is underway. Since the project is being conducted in producer's field it involves a lot of coordination. Collection of production records (such as seeding rate, seed type, irrigation even ts, and nutrient and pesticide applications) is going on and a process to continue until the middle of 2019 the time most of the data and information will be compiled and analyzed for publication . Data Analysis Forage yield and quality data were analyze d using SAS procedure on combined two years' data (SAS 9.3, SAS Institute Inc.). Statistical analysis was performed on the basis of split -plot design (row spacing as main and silage cutting height as sub -plot factors). To detect differences between row spa cing treatments and their interactions with silage cutting heights types, PROC GLM procedures were used. Significance was considered at P < 0.05, and Fisher's protected LSD was used to separate means. Results and Discussion Forage yield and quality resu lts involving row spacing and silage cutting heights are presented in Table 1. Significant difference was detected between 15\" than 30\" row spacing for dry and green forage yield, moisture at harvest, starch content and milk production per acre (Table 1 ). The two row spacings, however, were not significantly different for the other measured parameters. 68 Dry forage yield was higher with 15 than 30\" row spacing (7.7 vs. 6.0 t/ac) which was also reflected in milk production per acre (25179 vs. 19720 lbs/ac; an increase in milk by 22%). Similarly, significant difference s were detected between 6\" than 21\" silage cutting heights for dry and green forage yield and moisture at harvest and milk production per acre. Dry forage yield production per acre were reduced by 20 % with silage cutting height of 21\" compared to the 6\" (6.2 vs. 7.6 t/ac). This was also reflected in milk production per acre as well. However, cutting height had no significance effect on milk production per ton. In general, a significant improvement in forage quality was observed with increasing silage cutting height (reduction in fiber by 6 to 8%, increase in starch by 11% and reduction in nitrate by 39%). In a separate trial conducted at NMSU -Agricultural Science Center at Clovis in 2017 involving three silage cutting heights (6, 13, 21\") and five corn varieties revealed similar reduction in dry forage yield with the highest silage cutting height. However, yield reduction with 13\" cutting height was only 5% suggesting the possibility of raising cutt ing height to 13\" with minimum yield loss. In the long run, tall stubble (with higher silage cutting heights) in conjunction with narrow row spacing is expected to leave more plant residue in field potentially resulting in better soil coverage, improvement in soil conservation and moisture retention, carbon sequestration, and in overall improvement and sustainability of forage corn production and hence dairy farming systems and rural economies in New Mexico.

This information can be useful for developing optimum silage corn harvesting h eight recommendations that could be used as a strategy/ tool for farmers to harvest silage corn sustainably , conserve soil and water resources . Materials and Methods The study was conducted at NMSU -Agricultural Science Center at Clovis in 2018. Based on soil test results recommended fertilizer was applied at rate of 18 (N), 60 (P 2O5) lbs ac-1, 3qt ac-1 (Zn) in February16 and 122 (N), 22 (S) lbs ac-1 as pre -plant and 30 (N) and 5.5 (S) lbs ac-1 at plant. Herbicide mixture Atrazine, Balance Flex, Diflex, Gly phosate was applied pre -plant at 1 pint, 3 oz, 5 oz, and 40 oz ac-1, respectively. Additional herbicide mixture of Diflex and Brawl at 8 oz and 1.3 pint ac-1 was applied for weed control in June 20, 2018. Insecticides Onager (16 oz ac-1) in June 20 and Prevathon (20 oz ac-1) and Oberon (8 oz ac-1) in August 1, 2018 were applied for insect control. The experimental design followed a randomized complete block design with three replications . The study involved f ive corn varieties [9678VT3P, 1151AQ, D58QC72, P1449xr (brown mid rib, BMR) and 1197P ]. Corn was planted in May 19, 2018 at the seeding rate of 27,000 seeds ac-1. For plant portions/sections contribution to biomass yield and quality determination, a 1m length of row of whole plant samples were harvest ed at 6\" height from soil surface for each plot of each variety. Whole p lant samples were then brought indoor and cut/partitioned into four portions (H7, H16, H32, and AE) for each plot and variety. Besides these four portions , ear/cobs were kept separate and considered as additional plant portion. Plant portions H7, H16 and H32 represents below ear and AE represents above the ear portion of the plan. Forage sample were harvested in September , typical time period when silage corn is commonly harvested. Afte r fresh weight were recorded, sample portions were choppe d and a subsample of known weight from each sample was dried to a constant weight at 65\u00b0C. Dr y and fresh weights were used to estimate plant portions biomass and contributions to total forage biomass yield per acre. Dry subsamples were ground to pass through a 1 -mm screen using a Wiley Mill (Thomas Manufacturing) and submitted to a certified laboratory (Ward Laboratories, Kearney, NE) to estimate forage quality using near -infrared spectroscopy Data Analysis Forage (dry - and green -biomass) yield and quality data of the different plant portions were analyzed using SAS procedure. To detect differences between variety and their interactions with plant portions , PROC GLM procedures were used (SAS 9. 3, SAS Institute Inc.). Significance was considered at P < 0.05, and Fisher's protected LSD was used to separate means. 70 Results and Discussion Forage (dry- and green -biomass) yield and quality results involving plant portion and variety are presented in Tables 1. Plant portion \u00d7 variety interaction effect was not significant for forage yield , quality and milk production . Varieties were not significantly different for most of the measured parameters. However, s ignificant difference was detected between the different plant portions for forage yield, quality characteristics, and milk production (Table 1). Corn ear/cob contributed the highest (58%) to total forage yield (10.8 t/ac) while the least contribution (5%) came from the bottom H7 plant portion. This w as also reflected in milk production (Table 1). Moisture content in plant parts was the lowest in ear/cob while the highest moisture content was recorded in plant portion H32 followed by H16 and H7 (Table 1). Forage quality of ear/cob and above the ear pla nt portions were significantly higher than below ear plant portions indicating the significant importance of ear and above ear plant portions in the overall corn forage quality and hence feed value in animal feed ration. Similarly, fiber and nitrate conten t of plant portions of below the ear are significantly lower than corn ear/cob and above the ear plant portions further enforcing the insignificant importance of this plant portions in animal feed value. This suggests that raising silage corn cutting heigh t to as high as H7 to H13 (5 to 11 % reduction in yield) can be used as a strategy to sustainably harvest silage corn with minimum forage yield loss and improve d forage quality that can and potentially conserve soil and water resources in forage corn produ ction systems. In the long run, tall stubble (with higher silage cutting heights of at least 13\") in conjunction with a corn variety of producer 's choice is expected to leave more plant residue in the field potentially resulting in better soil coverage, improvement in soil conservation and moisture retention, carbon sequestration, and in overall improvement and sustainability of forage corn production and hence dairy farming systems in New Mexico. The study will be repeated i n 2019. 71 Table 1. Forage corn biomass yield, quality and milk production of the different p lant parts at NMSU -Agricultural Science Center, Clovis 2018.

NM dairy owners employ approximately 1 employee/100 cows: predominantly hired, immigrant labor with l imited experience in working in agriculture. Dairying is vastly becoming a highly technical, highly automated industry characterized by extended periods of very low margins. Highly skilled and technically proficient labor is an absolute must for optimal pe rformance. However, limited educational opportunities exist for training and educating the next generation of owners, managers and employees to prepare and refine a skilled and able dairy workforce to continue to provide wholesome dairy products for New Me xico, the nation and the world, while sustainably managing animals, employees and the environment. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE: Given the unlikelihood of re -establishing an on -campus dairy herd for training and education, NMSU Dairy Extension established in 2008 t he U.S. Dairy Education and Training Consortium (USDETC) together with the Univ. of Arizona and Texas A&M Univ. The USDETC, located in Clovis, NM utilizes Clovis Community College facilities and commercial dairy operations in the New Mexico and Texas bord er region to teach the next generation of dairy owners and managers during a 6 -week, hands -on, capstone summer class advanced dairy herd management (ANSC 468). Students are instructed by leading faculty in the nation. The program is an intensive combinatio n of classroom instruction, laboratory training, on - farm practice and allied industry input. Many of the students leave Clovis with internships and job opportunities in hand. Area dairy producers, center to the success of the program, fully recognize and s upport the unique value, freely allowing students access and insight to their operations. REACH: Reach of the program in 11 years: 498 students from 51 different universities. A survey of former students was conducted in 2017 to determine the impact of th e consortium on their careers (62% response rate). Of the 213 respondents, 99 were currently still enrolled at a university, 111 were employed and 3 were not employed. Of the students enrolled at a university 37% were undergraduate students, 30% were worki ng towards advanced degrees and 30% were obtaining a veterinary degree. Of those employed, 87 students had obtained a BS, while 11 completed their MS, 2 students were Ph.D.'s and 9 students had graduated with a DVM degree. Key finding: of the students who had entered the job market 34% had found employment on a dairy, 33% were employed in a dairy related position (allied industry), 5% were in a non -dairy livestock positon, 6% were in a non -dairy ag position and 21% were employed outside of agriculture. In s hort: 4 out of 5 former USDETC students are employed in agriculture, 2 out of 3 students are employed in the dairy industry, and 1 out of 3 students are working on, or managing a dairy. IMPACT: When asked \"What impact attending the consortium had on their current status\", 92% replied important, very important or extremely important. When asked about the impact the classes and experiential learning experiences had on their course work and subsequent careers, 44% replied extremely helpful, 35% very helpful a nd 15% helpful. When asked to rank the consortium classes as compared to other courses taken, 55% gave the consortium an A+ and 36% an A. When 73 asked for comments, the hands -on experience and access to exceptional faculty were the student's main responses. In short: the USDETC has proven to be a positive alternative, or complementary education opportunity for students who do not or have limited access to dairy courses or the related experiential learning experiences at their home universities. NEXT: with th e Dairy Consortium as a capstone dairy course, NMSU's College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences in June of 2017 reinstated an undergraduate minor in Dairy Science. As the Dairy Consortium continues to grow opportunities for expansion are being considered to in addition to the open -lots of the Southwest, add learning experiences in the barns of the Midwest and the free -stall operations of the West. All with the goal to provide the next generation of dairy owners and managers with excellent educational opportunities.

NM dairy owners employ approximately 1 employee/100 cows: predominantly hired, immigrant labor. A large majority of dairy employees have or had little or no experience wor king in agriculture or with large animals or large equipment. Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing AFF) ranks among the most dangerous industrial sectors with an incident rate of 5.7 non -fatal occupational injuries per 100 FTE's and a rate of 23.2 fatal work injuries per 100,000 FTE's (BLS). In addition, about one -fifth of fatalities in 2016 were to foreign -born workers and roughly two -thirds of fatal work injuries were foreign - born Latino or Hispanic workers. Effective training and education of both current a nd future dairy employees is imperative for both safety and performance. However, limited educational opportunities exist to train and certify a skilled and able dairy workforce. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE: Beginning in 2011 -12 with the development of two dairy s afety awareness training DVD's in English and Spanish to accomplish multiple goals: 1. being able to document employees are trained on dairy safety issues, 2. improve job performance through understanding the \"why\" of work - and safety -procedures and 3. to prevent safety incidents through heightened safety awareness. To date approximately 6,000 copies have been distributed worldwide, and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) subsequently translated the DVD's into a number of other languages for placement of refugees on dairies. The remaining question: what is the training effectiveness of viewing a DVD? Delivery of training content became center in training effectiveness evaluation. In collaboration with Dr. David Douphrate, UT School of Public Health, San Antonio Campus, small interactive video/audio vignettes were created in Articulate 360 and subsequently loaded on an IPad for individualized training purposes (m -learning). REACH: As part of two DOL Susan Harwood projects a total of 2,090 dairy employees in 7 states on 60+ farms were trained using mobile technology on iPads. The large majority of trainees were foreign -born with the majority from Mexico (52.4%), and 27.4% from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. About 88% male and 12% female. Average age 34.4+12.0. About 6% had not received any education, 28% had attended (some) elementary school, 24% (some) middle school, 29% (some) high school, and 13% had received (some) higher education. As anticipated, reading comprehension was a challenge, making the video/audio delivery method critical. We realized soon that many of the Central American trainees didn't speak any English or Spanish, but communicated in a Mayan language (K'iche). Training effectiveness evaluation (Kirkpatrick Four - Level Training Evalua tion) analysis suggests that participants rated the m -learning training favorably (level -1). Pre -test to post -test scores changed from a 74.2% to a 92.5% (level -2). Interview results at about 3 -6 months post -training (level -3) indicate workers were applyin g the knowledge gained from the training in their work activities, as well as reporting safety hazards when identified. Findings suggest the utilization of m -learning techniques is an effective means to deliver safety awareness training content to dairy wo rkers in remote and challenging work environments. IMPACT: NMSU Dairy Extension has now provided safety awareness training to about one -third of the NM dairy workforce. We have added safe animal handling with live demonstration to our 75 training tools, training which is picking up traction. In 2016 as a result of a several highly publicized dairy fatalities in the Northwest, Idaho Dairymen's Association (IDA) took the lead in adopting our program with significant processor and co -op suppo rt. We were asked to help recruit and prepare a dairy safety specialist for IDA. The person was hired in July of 2017, and is currently providing safety awareness training for Idaho dairy producers. Recognizing we were missing about 1 out of 3 -4 workers du e to language issues, we just completed full translation and voiceover of all video materials into K'iche, a menu option to be added to the iPad library. As part of the NMPF FARM - Workforce development effort we have been charged with the development of a Dairy Safety Manual, which is at the date of this writing (Feb 2019) is nearing completion. Sparked by consumer questions, National Milk Producers Federation representing the majority of the U.S. milk supply formed (Nov. 2017) a Dairy Safety Task Force l ooking at national adaptation and implementation of the program. Continued content development: safe feeds and feeding (2018) , safe young stock handling, safe hospital care and safe maternity care are the next items on our list. In Feb. 2018 a 5 -yr. leade rship development project was initiated, addressing the needs of frontline supervisors and middle managers to learn more about managing people vs. managing cows. In two separate groups, approximate 50 middle managers have now completed the 13 -week training program of this project. NEXT: Another project to be initiated in March 2019 is geared to evaluate the understanding of dairy workers of TB as a zoonosis, with the goal to develop appropriate educational tools for dairy workers. TB has been a reoccurring issue in the NM -West TX dairy shed over the last decade or so and even though most of the DNA seems to trace back to Mexican feeder steers, there is the potential of transmission, a persistent health risk both for humans and cows.

Each year in the United States, 2 million people are infected with antimicrobial resistant organ isms resulting in 23,000 deaths and 70 billion dollars in medical costs. As resistance becomes more common, cost is expected to continue to rise in order to fight infections. To combat resistance, the Obama administration generated The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria aimed at better surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, better diagnostic testing, and the development of new vaccines and antibiotics, among other things. Antimicrobial drug resistance is of great concern fo r both animal and human health. Using antimicrobials to treat illness is a key element used by veterinarians and physicians alike to combat bacterial diseases. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is charged with evaluating both the effectiveness and saf ety of these compounds. During the process of approving new animal drugs, a slaughter withdrawal period is established for each drug. The slaughter withdrawal time is the number of days between the last time an animal is treated and when the animal can be slaughtered for meat to go into the human food supply. To date, the slaughter withdrawal time has been based upon the duration of time when a drug is still in the animal tissue. There has been little to no consideration as to what management practices migh t be needed to minimize the risk of antimicrobial drug resistance. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE: This research project is to evaluate whether a voluntary extended withdrawal time could potentially reduce the level of bacteria resistant to an antibiotic (the specific antibiotic used for this study will be ceftiofur) that are being shed at time of slau ghter. The ultimate goal of the project is to identify viable management options for producers to reduce the potential exposure of consumers to resistant bacteria and to develop strategies that result in voluntary adoption of those management options. Over all, the goal is to ensure cattle are released to slaughter with levels of antibiotic resistant microbial populations comparable to their resistance level before being given an antibiotic. A decision -making tool will subsequently be created and made availa ble for dairy farmers and veterinarians to use for the development of antimicrobial stewardship programs. Additionally, developing a stewardship protocol beneficial to farmers, ranchers, and veterinarians is important for food safety. REACH: Lab work and data analysis has been completed and manuscripts have been submitted for publication. Expectations are we will be able to present take -home messages to producers in the spring of 2019. FUNDING: USDA NIFA Funding through Texas A&M University. "}
