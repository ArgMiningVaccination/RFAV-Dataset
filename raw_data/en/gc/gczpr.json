Acupuncturists must comply with all applicable standards for professional practice. These informal guidelines are not to be considered a substitute for the formal recommendations, guidelines and standards contained in the 11 publications referenced below. Guidelines: Universal Precautions Universal precautions are an approach to infection control. According to the concept of Universal Precautions, all human blood and certain human body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Hepatitis B Virus, and other blood-borne pathogens. Universal precautions must be used in the care of all patients. The Acupuncture Board has the authority to adopt and enforce regulations with respect to minimizing the transmission of blood-borne pathogens in health-care settings. I. Protective Attire A. Gloves Medical gloves should be worn when touching blood and body fluids, mucous membranes and non-intact skin of all patients. Gloves should also be worn when handling surfaces soiled with blood and body fluids. Gloves shall be changed after contact with each patient or moving from a contaminated to clean body area Non-sterile gloves may be used for examinations and other non-surgical procedures Rubber utility gloves are used for housekeeping chores that involve potential contact with blood, instrument cleaning and decontamination procedures Do not use any chemical such as petroleum-based hand lotion that may affect the integrity of the glovesZ Medical, sterile, and non-sterile gloves may not be washed or disinfected for reuseg B. Protective Gowns. Laboratory Coats or Uniforms Protective gowns or aprons made of materials that provide an effective barrier should be worn during invasive procedures that are likely to result in the splashing of blood or other body fluids Protective clothing shall be changed at least daily or when visibly soiled Personal protective equipmenUclothing shall be removed prior to leaving the work area and placed in an appropriately designated area or container for storage, washing, decontamination or disposal~ C. Protective Eyewear or Face Shields Protective eyewear or face shields should be worn for procedures that commonly result in the generation of droplets, splashing of blood or other body fluids or the generation of bone chips~ http://www .acupuncture.ca. gov /pubs_ forms/infectcontrol_guidelines.shtml 1/13/2014 Infection Control Guidelines -Acupuncture Board Page 2 of4 II. Barrier Precautions Protective barriers reduce the risk of exposure of the health-care worker's skin or mucous membranes to potentially infective materials. Universal precautions are those intended to prevent parenteral exposure of health worker's mucous membranes and non-intact skin to blood-borne pathogens.2 Examples of protective barriers include gloves, gowns, masks, and protective eyewear, as indicated above. Universal precautions apply to blood and other body fluids containing visible blood.-~ Universal precautions do not apply to feces, nasal secretions, sputum, sweat, tears, urine and vomitus unless they contain visible blood. The risk of transmission of HIV and HBV from these fluids and materials is extremely low or nonexistent.\u00a3~ 1 The type of protective barrier should be appropriate for the procedure being performed and the type of exposure anticipated. Ill. Hand Washing and Care of Hands Hands must be washed before and after treating each patient and after bare-handed touching of inanimate objects likely to be contaminated with body fluids. At a minimum, soap and water should be used between patients. Alcohol-based hand rubs may be used for decontamination if the hands are not visibly soiled. Hands should be washed: 1. Before and after treating each patient 2. Before glove placement and after glove removal 3. After barehanded touching of inanimate object likely to be contaminated with blood or body fluid Health-care workers who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis should refrain from all direct patient care and from handling patient-care equipment until condition resolves.;). IV. Use and Care of Sharp Instruments and Needles Compliance with the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act is required by all health care personnel as set forth by OSHA. Employers must maintain a log of occupational injuries and illness under existing recordkeeping rules. At minimum, the log must contain the following:11 The brand and type of device involved in the incident The location of the incident The description of the incident Used needles should never be recapped or manipulated using both hands or by any other technique that involves directing the point of the needle towards any part of the body. After they are used, needles should be placed in puncture-resistant containers for disposal. These containers should be located as close as is practical to the use area. 2 V. Sterilization and Disinfection of Instruments Before sterilization or high-level disinfection, instruments should be cleaned thoroughly by scrubbing with soap and water or detergent solution or with a mechanical devise ultrasonic cleaner. The use of covered ultrasonic cleaners is recommended to increase efficiency of cleaning and to reduce the handling of sharp instruments. Utility gloves should be worn when handling contaminated instruments. Single-use disposable instruments must be used for only one patient and discarded appropriately. Single disposable instruments are neither designed nor intended to be cleaned, disinfected or sterilized for reuse. VI. Housekeeping and Laundry 1/13/2014 http://www .acupuncture.ca.gov /pubs_ forms/infectcontrol_guidelines.shtml Infection Control Guidelines -Acupuncture Board Page 3 of4 Environmental surfaces that have become contaminated with patient material shall be cleaned and disinfected after treatment of each patient and the completion of daily work activities. Countertops and other surfaces should be cleaned with disposable toweling and appropriate cleaning agent. After cleaning, surfaces should be disinfected with a suitable chemical germicide that is approved for use as a hospital disinfectant. Environmental surfaces such as walls and floors should be cleaned daily or when visibly soiled. Soiled linen should be handled as little as possible and with minimum agitation to prevent leakage.~ Visible material should be removed and the area decontaminated with a suitable chemical germicide that is approved as a hospital disinfectant and is tuberculoid when used at the recommended dilution. Gloves should be worn during the clean-up procedures.g VII. Infected Waste Universal Precautions Policies for collecting, storing, decontaminating and disposing of infected waste are generally determined by institutions in accordance with state and local regulations. Infected waste should be disposed of according to the regulations. g VIII. Immunization and Infection Control Mandatory immunizations should be made available to all health-care personnel. OSHA bloodborne pathogen standards mandate that vaccines for Hepatitis B be made available to all health-care personnel at the employer's expense. OSHA standards and guidelines for post-exposure evaluation and follow-up should be followed.\u00a7 Current infection control guidelines include: 1. Personnel health and safety education 2. Maintain records on job-related illnesses and exposures 3. Immunization of health-care personnel 4. Prophylaxis and follow-up after exposure 5. Personnel restriction due to infectious illness and special conditions All health-care workers must adhere to the 1998 CDC infection control guidelines and to the 1991 OSHA standards, including HBV vaccination and the use of universal precautions in all health-care settings. Adherence to proper infection control procedures, including vaccinations as indicated, is a minimum standard of care.~ References 1.
