I've been living with type 2 diabetes for over 10 years and have tried many treatments and therapies, but none of them provided lasting solutions. After just one session with MantraCare, my blood sugar levels were noticeably lower and more manageable than before. I also felt a greater sense of energy and well-being that I haven't felt in years. The staff at MantraCare are knowledgeable and friendly, and they put me at ease during my appointment. They provided detailed information about the effects of diabetes on my body, as well as the diet and lifestyle changes necessary to maintain healthier blood sugar levels. They also recommended specific supplements to further support my health and wellness. All of this advice was invaluable, and I'm truly grateful for their care and professionalism.

Insulin is a hormone that aids the movement of glucose from meals into your cells for energy. The body's production of insulin or its use of insulin might be insufficient at times. Glucose is able to get into cells and remain in the blood as a result. Blood sugar levels rise as a consequence. There are three primary types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes. [Type 1 diabetes](https://diabetesmantra.com/type-1-diabetes/) is caused by the immune system's attack on the cells that manufacture insulin, a hormone that aids in the utilization and storage of glucose. [Type 2 diabetes](https://diabetesmantra.com/type-2-diabetes/) occurs when the body's ability to use insulin is lost. [Gestational diabetes](https://diabetesmantra.com/gestational-diabetes/) is a disease that pregnant women get when their bodies aren't able to create and utilize insulin properly during pregnancy.
