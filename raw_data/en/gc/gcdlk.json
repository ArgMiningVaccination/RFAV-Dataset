I 1 145-5 alias: JONE MENGELE, born on 16 March 1911 in Guenzburg, alias: Doctor JOSE MENGELE, born on 16 March 1911 in Guenzburg, alias: HELMUT GREGOR, born on 6 August 1911 in Termeno (Province Trento!Italy), alias: HELMUT GREGORI, born on Doctor FAUSTO RINDON, alias: S. JOSE ALVERS ASPIAZU, detention pending trial is ordered. He is strongly suspected of having killed people, having attempted this and having instigated and aided and abetted the killing of people, motivated by thirst for blood and other base motives, in a malicious and cruel way, and with generally dangerous means, between 24 May 1943 and 18 January 1945 in Auschwitz (Oswiecim/Poland) and other places through several independent acts partially in joint acts in numerous cases the exact number of which has not yet been ascertained. These charges are based on the following facts: 2 ;1. ,'-h I ... 2 145-5 In the years 1940 to 1945 the former National Socialist Government of the German Reich operated a concentration camp with several additional camps within the city limits 'of the town Oswiecim in occupied Poland in the area of Upper Silesia; for a time the concentration camp was divided into three camps that were independently: administered and designated as Auschwitz I\u00b7\u00b7 to Auschwitz III. Among other functions the camp Auschwitz served as extermination camp. In the camp countless people were killed who, according to the National Socia\u00ad list conception at that time, were considered inferior, in particular Jews, Slavs and Gypsies. The extermination on a massive scale took place mainly in the. camp Auschwitz\u00ad Birkenau, and specifically in such manner that, under the pretext of a shower, the people destined to die were brought into specially prepared chambers where they were suffocated in a very painful way through hydrocyanic acid fumes of the poison-gas compound Cyclon B. The execution of these measures as well as the command and the guarding of the camp devolved on the Schutzstaffel (SS), a military organization of the National-Socialist German Labor Party. As a rule, only the ones unfit to work were destined to die through gassing. [he ones persecuted on racial and political grounds who appeared fit to work were forced to work in the camp as well as at construction sites and in businesses in the surrounding area, sometimes under inhuman conditions. The suspect MENGELE, as SS-Hauptsturmfuehrer [Captain] and SS camp\u00b7\u00b7physician, is charged with having killed, deported and imprisoned people of the concen- . ,.- 3 3 145-5 tration camp Auschwitz on account of their race, sometimes in a sadistic and bestial way, motivated by pleasure in killing and by arrogance towards Jews, Poles, Gypsies, and other groups of people he considered inferior. On the basis of knowledge obtained through the judicial preliminary inves- tigations, he is accused of the following detailed charges: 1. The suspect JOSEF MENGELE is strongly suspected of having cooperated, as SS camp \u00b7physician, in the massive extermination of Jewish people, and -specifically in such manner that, at the arrival of the so-called RSHA [Reich Security Main Office] transports in the concentration camp Auschwitz, he, together with SS officers of the camp command and other SS physicians, sorted out on the railway platform the children, the elderly and the senile people, those who were ill, inca~acitated and weak, and women who were discernably pregnant, as not fit to work, destining them to a very pai~ful death by suffocation through hydrocyanic acid fumes in the gas chambers of the extermination camp; and further by supervising at the gas chambers when men of the medical ranks of the SS threw the granulated hydrocyanic acid compound Cyclon B through the funnels into the chambers in which the people destined to die stood closely packed together, or by throwing in the compound himself. .f The suspect MENGELE allegedly participated especially often and eagerly in these \"arrival or platform-selections.\" It is not possible, not even in approximation, to assess the number of selections supervised by him and the number of people who were selected to die. According to submitted testimonies, however, it can be presupposed that he carried out arrival selections at least at the following times: 4 , 145-5 1.

The suspect JOSEF MENGELE is strongly suspected of having participated actively and decisively, as SS camp physician, in the so-called camp selections and selections in the barracks for ill prisoners; during these selections he singled out those prisoners who, since their arrival in the camp, had become unable to work because of hunger, privation,exploitation of labor force, illnesses, epidemics,maltreatment or because of other reasons and whose immediate recovery could not be expected, but also those prisoners who had contagious or merely unpleasant illnesses -for instance skin rashes - 13 1 3 I . ~ , 1 i 145-5 some to be killed by injections or by shooting, some to be killed by very painful suffocation through hydrocyanic acid fumes in the gas chambers, in order to make room in the camp for prisoners who were able to work. In numerous cases, he allegedly personally killed those prisoners who had been selected by him or other S~ physicians in the above described way, by injecting phenol, gasoline\" Evipan (a sleeping drug and anesthia), chloro- form, air or other substances into the blood stream, especially into the heart chamber, sometimes under the pretext and semblance of a treatment, or he allegedly ordered and supervised the killing of these prison~rs by men of the SS medical ranks; sometimes also, in cases of camp and medical barracks selections, he allegedly supervised men of the SS medical ranks at the gas chambers as they threw the granulated hydrocyanic acid compound Cyclon B ,\" through the funnels into the chambers in which the people, destined to die stood closely packed together, or himself threw the compo'und 'in. Because of their \"everyday occurrence\" and their uniformity, the number and scope of these camp and medica,l barracks selections carried out by the sus- pect MENGELE, can be ascertain~d with as little precision as the number of people killed. Nonetheless, at least the following cases can be established concretely: 1. On 25 May 1943, on the:JCcasion of a quarantine of the Gypsy Camp B II e in Bfrkenau ordered by him, he allegedly destined to death by gas~ing 507 .f male and 528 female gYP:-3ies suspected of having typhoid fever. 2. On 25 or 26 May 1943. during a selection in the infections disease barracks 32 of the Gypsy Camp, he allegedly spared the \"Reich German\" Gypsies while he sent about 600 others to be gassed. 14 4 , I I 145-5 3. On 26 May 1943 he allegedly carried out a selection of those who had typhoid fever in the medical barracks of the central camp. 4. During one of the selections in Camp B II b in Birkenau in the summer of 1943, he allegedly destined to death by gassing, among others, a female prisoner after she had recovered from a gunshot injury. 5. At a selection in the fall of 1943 in the women's concentration camp, at the request of the suspect, every block had to provide twenty emaciated female prisoners (so-called Moslems) who were subsequently killed. 6. In November 1943 he allegedly carried out selections in tfie block of the detail assigned to work outside the camp. 7. Between 3 and 22 December 1943 he allegedly carried out at least one selection in the medical barracks for prisoners of the women's concen\u00ad tration camp. 8. In December 1943 he allegedly destined to death all occupants, without any exception, of block 11 of the women's concentration camp in Birkenau . 9. During a typhus-delousing action in the women's concentration camp Bir\u00ad kenau at an unspecified time, he allegedly proceeded in such a way that first he sent all, that is apout 400, occupants of a block to be gassed, then had the block disinfected, the women of the adjacent block placed in the initially cleared block after singling out the ones suspected of having typhus and disinfecting the remaining prisoners and proceeding in this way until all those who were suspected of havi~ typhus had been singled out to be killed by gassing and all other women and all buildings nad been disinfected. 15 145-5 10. In December 1943/January 1944 he allegedly carried out a major selection in the women's concentration camp at Birkenau during which he allegdly destined .to death approximately 7000 women. 11. In January 1944 he allegedly selected in the surgery block of the . medical barracks for prisoners in the women's concentration camp. 12. On 8 January 1944 he allegedly singled out a third of the occupants of the Birkenau camp to be killed. 13. In February 1944, he allegedly singled out all, that is about 500 ill people of block 17 in the women's concentration camp to ~e killed. 14. In the period between 2 and 12 J~ly 1944, under his direction, the so- called \"Theresienstadt family camp\" in the camp section B II b in Bir- kenau was allegedly liquidated in such a way that first; on 2 July 1944, he singled out 3080 Jews as fit to work, after which on 11 July about 3000 and on 12 July the remaining, that is about 4000, occupants of the camp were allegedly gassed. 15. In July 1944 at a selection in the women's concentration camp at Birke- nau, he allegedly destined to death by gassing at least several hundred people. 16. At the end of July 1944, he allegedly picked out several hundred pri- soners in the C camp to be killed. : I .1 17. The suspect JOSEF MENGELE is strongly suspected of having participated in the so-called liquidation of the Gvpsy Camp (of the section B II e I ! .; in the camp Auschwitz-Birkenau) on 31 July/2 August 1944, by carrying out, ; I together with other SS physicians, a selection on the basis of which 1408 Gypsies were transferr~d to the concentration camp Buchenwald, I while the remaining 2891 Gypsies were killed by gas in the above de- scribed way. I I 16 t-'-\" 145-5 During this disbandment of the Gypsy Camp, a Gypsy girl of about four years of age who turned to MENGELE with the words \"Uncle Doctor\" and did not want to leave him, allegedly, on a sign from the suspect ML~GELE, was seized by her leg by a German Kapo (prisoner-foreman) and her head hurled against the wheel of a truck such that the skull of the child was smashed. During the liquidation of the Gypsy Camp he allegedly personally shot two Gypsy boys between about 10 and 14 years of age. He allegedly drove two piepel (boys who serve the prisoner functionaries) in his car to the crematory where th.ey were killed, because they had hidden themselves during roll call and therefore the number of prisoners ascertained was incorrect. Also during the liquidation of the Gypsy Camp, the suspect MENGELE tried to transfer seven pairs of twins to the research block 10 of the\u00b7 central camp with the purpose of pseudomedical experiments. When he didn't succeed in this for organizational reasons, he allegedly shot tqe fourteen Gypsies in the crematory and subsequently held an autopsy on th~m. Already before this in the \"nursery\" of the Gypsy Camp, 17 pairs of twins and 12 handicapped children from the Gypsy Camp had allegedly been killed by the suspect ~~GELE himself or on his orders and imm~diately afterwards dissected by him in the crematory. .1 18.In August 1944 he allegedly, among other selections, made a selection in the camp section B II a in Birkenau. 17 .j r ; [7. 145-5 19. In 1944, for a time, he allegedly carried out ~lmost daily\"selections in the prisoners' medical barrack 12, as well as in block 24 of the women's concentration camp at Birkenau. One of the ways he al'legedly expressed his contempt for Jews -especially painful for them -was to car,ry out selections on their highest holy days. Thus he allegedly 20. selected Jewish children on the Friday before the Jewish New Year cele- bration of 1944 in the camp section B II e-in Birkenau. 21. On the day of the Jewish New Year celebration of 1944 he-allegedly des\u00ad tined to death by gassing 328 children in the camp section B II d in Birkenau. 22. On the day of the Jewish Yom Kippur in 1944 in the camp section B II e in Birkenau he allegedly mounted a bar between the posts of a soccer goal at the height of approximately 1.45 to 1.50 meters and destined to death by gassing approximately 1000 children who did not reach this height. 23. In the fall of 1944 he allegedly carried out a selection in the sauna on the occasion of the transfer of the weaving-detail to the camp section B II b. 24. At the end of October/November 1944 the suspect allegedly carried out a selection in the tuberculosis block 29 of the women's concentration camp. 25. In October 1944 he allegedly sent all occupants, without exception, of the medical block 28. situated near the \"twin block\" in Birkenau, to be killed by gassing. 18 I 145-5 26. On 13 October 1944 he allegedly destined to be gassed 170 women from the prisoner's medical block 22 in the women's concentration camp in Birkenau. 27. At a selection among Jews who had arrived the day before from Plaszow, on 23 October 1944, he allegedly singled out at least 235 people to be exterminated. 28. At another selection on 23 October 1944, in the women's concentration camp at Birkenau, he allegedly removed the:female witness FABRYKANT, who had already been singled out to be killed, from the group of Jews who were destined to die, but took away her child and sent it with the other Jews to the gas chambers. 29. In the year 1944, for a time, he allegedly carried out almost daily selections at roll calls in the camp section B I a in Birkenau. t In addition to the central camp Auschwitz and at the Birkenau camp, he allegedly also made selections 30. in the Buna-Monbwitz camp while prisoners were marching off to work 31.in the medical block for prisoners in the Fuerstengrube sub camp. III. The suspect JOSEF MENGELE is strongly suspected of having carried out medical experiments on living prisoners, motivated by ambition and career .1 aspirations, for the purpose of scientific publications, while, because of the way the experiments were directed, intending the death of the prisoners, at least however, based on his knowledge as a physician and his medical education, willingly sanctioning ~heir death which did indeed ensue in numerous cases; he further allegedly killed deportees and prisoners in 19 : : .. ~ . .... ., 9 .I i. ~ 145-5 order to carry out anatomical investigations on their corpses. It is almost impossible to determine the exact number of murde~s and attempted murders that were committed in the course of this. The following groups of experiments can be distinguished: 1. According to the result of the judicial preliminary investigations, the research of twins took a prominent place among the pseudo-experiments of the suspect JOSEF MENGELE.A profiling in this area mattered especially to the National Socialist regime of that time, in particular with respect to their endeavor to increase the birth rate, for instance, through medi- cal manipulation to increase twin births. Besides statistical studies and body measurements, the pairs of twins were subjected to injections, spinal cord taps, surgical operations and blood examinations, though these were not indicated on medical grounds nor was it clear what results were to have been obtained through those experiments. Also, an exchange of blood was repeatedly made between the individual twins of a pair. It is not possible, not even approximately, to determine exactly how many twins and triplets the suspect MENGELE experimented on in this way, nor how many casualties resulted from this research. At times, as many as 200 pairs of male twins were allegedly kept on reserve for the experiments of the suspect JOSEF MENGELE. iI Some of these pseudo-experiments allegedly took place in the research block 10 of the central camp Auschwitz, some also at other places, : I dissections took place mainly in one of the crematories. ~ I I 20 'I '\"''I c..v I 145-5 The judicial preliminary investigations have resulted among other things in a strong suspicion with respect to the following individual ~ases: A. As a result of operations on the body, carried out by the suspect JOSEF MENGELE himself or on his orders, these allegedly died, among others: , \" , a) in the summer of 1944 an estimated more than 100 perso'ns, among whom GABOR FRIED, b) two cousins of the female witness GUTTENB.ERGER, c) on 4/5 July 1944 the son, on 15/16 July 1944 the daugh~er of the female witness SCHICK, after the suspect MENGELE allegedly, on 4 July 1944, had carried out blood research on them, d) the children, at that time seven years old, of the female witness C2ENGERI, together with about 14 other pairs of twins, e) a daughter of the female witness ROSENBAUM, f) Hungarian twins whom the suspect M&~GELE subjected to surgical opera- tions on the head, g) around September 1944. a woman of about thirty years of age after a camphor injection, h) around September 1944, a woman of about thirty years of age from Szombathely, whose twin sister likewise was killed by the suspect MENGELE or on his orders, for the purpose of a simultaneous autopsy, i) in the year 1944, Hungarian twin sisters at the age of about thirty, after injections administered by a female assistant on the orders of MENGELE, j) in the summer of 1944, EDITH SOMOGYI after an intravenous injection, 21 --. \" 2 1 145-5 k) In the fall of 1944, after injections, a Hungarian pair of twins, still children, whose mother was also in the camp. B. After blood transfusions, there allegedly died, among others: a) a female pair of twins from Hungary of about 35 to 40 years, b) a male pair of twins, c) a woman ~eported from Beregszas [Beregovo], likewise d) twins who allegedly died of weakness after excessive drawing of blood. C. For the purpose of carrying out dissections, the suspect-MENGELE allegedly killed or ordered to be killed a) in the summer of 1944 about 100 children by shooting them through the back of the head. b) in July 1944, a group of about 40 children whom he drove himself with a truck to the crematory for the purpose of autopsy; c) a pair of twins from the Gypsy C..amp B II e, whom he killed personally for a dissection to be ~arried out by himself, d) an infant pair, born in the camp. whom he killed by injections, e) a pair of twins born of a French woman, f) one of the triplets of about one year of age from Munkacs [Mukacevo], whom he fillegedly dissected alive while anaesthetized, g) the about six-year-old twins HEINZ ~d DIETER SCHMIDT, h) in Ju~y 1944, a Hung~lrian pair of twins (boys of about six or seven years of age) whom the suspect allegedly killed near the laboratory by shooting them through the back of the head at a distance of two to three meters and subsequently personally dissected, I 22 ......... --~ I ..., ,. ~.. \". .. .'? \u00b7.;;r ~'-145-5 i) in a further case, after the death of a twin child of pneumonia, the other healthy twin was allegedly killed for the purpose of a comparative dissection, as, in fact, regularly, on occasion of the natural death of a twin, in principle the second twin was also killed for the purpose of comparison. D. Finally the suspect JOSEF MENGELE allegedly destined twins for whom the series of experiments was finished and whom he did not intend to dissect, to be killed in the gas chambers, by injectlons or by shooting; killed .for these reasons, among others: a) in the summer of 1944, fourteen twins were allegedly killed with Evipan and chloroform injections by the suspect MENGELE, b) in August 1944, 33 twins were allegedly shot to death in front of the incinerators of the crematory. 2. In the same way as with twins,. the suspect MENGELE subjected midgets to measurements and research. Several of them he allegedly killed or ordered to be killed in order to carry out dissections on the corpses. 3. The su.spect JOSEF MENGELE is strongly suspected of also having carried out experiments on other prisoners in addition to twins, involving blood transfusions and the drawing of blood, sometimes after treatment with drugs. For this purpose, about fifty young women were allegedly constantly held in reserve for him in the prisoners' medical block in the women's concentration camp in Birkenau during the sUmmer of 1944. Many of these previously healthy women allegedly died after blood transfusions, but also from weakness because of excessive drawing of blood, a state of 23 23 145-5 affairs that the suspect at least willingly sanctioned. The gaps caused by death were filled with new, healthy women from the camp. 4. After the outbreak in the camp of the noma epidemic. in particular among children in the Gypsy Camp, the symptoms of which amount to an extreme form of stomatitis, the suspect MENGELE together with prisoner ~ysicians carried out therapeutic experiments on prisoners who had the illness. After discontinuing the experiments, at least some of these pris6ners, . and indeed also those who had been cured, were allegedly killed by the suspect MENGELE or on his order~, in part at least in order to perform dissections. 5. The suspect JOSEF MENGELE is strongly suspected of having-carried out experiments on prisoners involving the conduction of electrical currents through the human body in order to test its resistance. These experiments were allegedly carried out in the Birkenau camp and in the medical block tor prisoners in the Monowitz camp. t. Of the prisoners in Birkenau who were abused for the purpose of these experiments, a considerable number allegedly died during experimenta- tion, among whom a Hungarian girl about 17 years old; the suspect MENGELE allegedly destined the surviving prisoners to be killed by . i I gassing. B. From the total of 70 to 80 prisoners in the Monowitz camp who were : I subjected to such experiments by the suspect MENGELE in the spring of 1944, between 20 and 30 prisoners allegedly died during experi-i I mentation. The fate of those who survived the experiments in Mono-I wi tz , :\" is unknown. \" I 24 24 I 145-5 6. The suspect MENGELE is strongly suspected of having exposed a group of Polish nuns to extreme X-ravs for research purposes, resulting in serious burn injuries. Whether these nuns died, and in case they did, how many died as a result of the treatment, is unknown. The suspect at least willingly sanctioned the possibility that they would die. 7. At the end of June 1943 the suspect MENGELE allegedly infected the then healthy witness Doctor CZEL~Y with typhus organisms for research purposes, whereupon the witness became seriously ill. As at this time many prisoners died of typhus, i~ particular because of deficient hygiene and medical care, he at least willingly sanctioned the possibility that the witness would die. 8. In the year 1943 the suspect MENGELE allegedly carried out phlegmon- experiments on a series of women and children in block 10 of the central camp Auschwit?, by causing, through injections, artificial phlegmon in- fections, resulting in excruciating pains for the victims_. Because of his experience as a physician, in these cases likewise, he. knew death was possible and, though he may not have wanted it, he still sanctioned the death which indeed occurred to several of the people abused in these experiments. In the monthsof September and October of 1943, one of the wo- men whom he abused for these purposes was the female witness GARFINKIEL, .1 who was injected with phlegmons in the hips and under the arms for research purposes in the described way; in her case, despite high fever and tempora- ry unconsciousness, it did not result in her death because of her strong constituti6n~: though the suspect, by virtue of his education and experience as a physicioan, knew death to be possible and, though not wanted, still sanctioned this possibility. 25 145-5 9. The suspect MENGELE allegedly applied noxious solutions to the ~ of an unknown number of prisoners for purposes of research. A. At the end of 1944, he allegedly carried out experiments on the newborn infant of the female witness JANTSCH, whereupon the eyes could not be recognized as -such anymore as they became a single.:~ed\u00b7 lump. To the mother hi' said: \"What harm can it do to turn a blue eye into a black eye?\" As the suspect, in virtue of his education and experience as a physician~ knew death to \"be possible and, though not wanted, still sanctioned the possibility; the child die\"d on 28 January 1945. B. In the second half of the year 1944, the suspect MENGELE allegedly killed an unknown large number of people in order to make preparations of their eyes for the purpose of demonstrations. He allegedly dis- . patched with the camp mail a wooden crate with jars full of such preparations. IO.The suspect MENGELE is strongly suspect en of having carried out experi- mental marrow transplants on living prisoners, hence at least willingly sanctioning the possibility of their death. Two cases of survivors of these experiments have become known: A. In the late summer of 1944, the witness FRIED was operated on his right shinbone twice a week for the above described purpose. Marrow was regularly drawn through a tube inserted into the chiseled shinbone. The witness ~;urvived the operations. 26 r' I I I . :. ~:?. I c..-.; 145-5 '. B. In November 1944, the female witness WESZI had tubes drawn through her right shinbone in the same way. For about eight to ten days she had a high fever. Then the ,right leg was amputated below the knee. After this failed experiment, the female witness would normally have been killed as a cripple-now unfit to work. That this did not happen is probably due to the fact that, at the end of November 1944, the gassings were stopped because the Red Army was drawing near and the evacuation of the camp ~as imminent. 11. In the year 1943 the suspect MENGELE allegedly operated on the genitals of several hundred male prisoners, probably carried out castrations or sterilizations and crippled them artificially in such a way that they I were severely limited in their capacity to move and, for the largest part, soon died or were selected in the camp to be killed as unfit to work, all of which the suspect had foreseen and willingly sanctioned . 12. The suspect MENGELE is strongly suspected, in addition to the above- . mentioned cases, of having killed a statistically indeterminable number of people, or to have ordered them killed, for the purpose of dissection and to obtain \"living fresh\" material. The following incidents have been substantiated by testimonies of witnesses: A. In the year 1943, MENGELE caused a number of female prisoners to be shot to death at the \"black wall\" in the courtyard between block 10 and block 11 in the central camp. Cut-off breasts and muscle parts r from the thighs ~ere allegedly used in the hygienic laboratory as culture material for the experiments of the suspect MENGELE. 27 27 IV. 145-5 B. The suspect MENGELE had the SS-Oberscharfuehrer [Technical Sergeant] JOSEF KLEHR, a medical officer, administer a lethal injection to a male prisoner of about thirty years and took the~leen from the corpse of the prisoner. C. In the year 1944 he allegealy dissected a still alive Gypsy boy of about three to four years of age, after previous drawing of blood. In addition to the cases of systematic mass extermination, killing of ill occupants of the camp and egotistical lethal medical research and pseudo\u00ad experiments, the suspect MENGELE, asSS camp physician, allegedly killed deported people B:nd camp occupants on impulse, ~rrogating to\u00b7himself the power of life and death over them, out of the sheer pleasure in killing. Such excessive acts are: 1. At an unspecified time, the suspect JOSEF MENGELE allegedly shot with his service pistol at least one prisoner of unknown nationality, because he was in the camp street without authorization. 2. At an unspecified time, the suspect MENGELE allegedly invited the female witness FRIED~~-ENGLAENDER, another female prisoner and two pairs of female twins between 10 and IS years of age, for a \"pleasure drive\" with the truck in the camp. Before the drive he allegedly gave candies to the twin girls.After all had left the truck in the neighborhood of the crema\u00ad tories, MENGELE allegedly killed the four girls by sh~ them through the back of the neck. -.. 28 28 I r\u00b7;. I , .: I I 145-5 3. When the actor HERSKOVIC, who was imprisoned in Auschwitz, 'declared in the presence of the suspect MENGELE that he was not afraid to die, MENGELE allegedly said to the report officer, who was present, the SS Unterscharfuehrer (Sergeant) KURPANIK: \"Since he is so begging for it, shoot him!\", whereupon KURPANIK allegedly drew his pistol and shot the prisoner. ,4. In the year 1943 the suspect MENGELE allegedly personally shot to death a girl of about 16 years of age, who had fled to the roof of a house out '. of fear of dying in the gas chambers. 5. In the second half of 1943 he allegedly personally shot to death two Gypsy children who had hidden in the camp. 6. At an unspecified time, MENGELE allegedly threw the new-born boy of the Jewish woman SUSSMANN from Vienna into the fire alive, whereupon the child died. 7. The suspect MENGELE allegedly took the new-born child from a Russian woman, seized it by the head and flung it on the pile of corpses. 8. In May/June 1943 he allegedly killed a Polish woman from Posen by a phenol injection, because the woman who just had given birth, did not let him kill her baby. 9. At the beginning of October 1943, the suspect allegedly killed a new- born male child, carried in the ~rms of the. female witness HAUSWIRT, by injecting it with phenol, in block 25 B of the women's concentration camp. 10. In January 1944, on the orders of the suspect MENGELE, a new-born child was allegedly killed in block 17 of the prisoners quarter of the camp Auschwitz-Birkenau. 29 145-5 11. In May 1944 the suspect allegedly killed by injection an infant a few days old, while remarking that there was no place here for new-born children. 12. In JUly 1944 the suspect MENGELE alelgedly caused the death of a prisoner by ordering a guard-of the canine squadron to set his service dog on the prisoner, whereupon the prisoner, out of fear of the dog, ran into the electrically charged barbed wire of the camp fence, where he was killed through electrocution, a possibility which the suspect had, ,at least willingly sanctioned. 13. During the summer of 1944 the suspect MENGELE allegedly shot a Kapo with a pistol, enraged that the Kapo of the \"laboL\u00b7.detail\" permitted prisoners who had already been selected to be killed by gassing to rejoin the ones who were fit to work. 14. Likewise, he allegedly singled out the witness Professor Doctor LEWIN at a camp selection to have him killed through gassing, because Profes- sor LEWIN had not recorded the p~isoners who were unfit to work on the list of the prisoners who were to be gassed; Professor LEWIN was not killed, however, only because a Rottenfuehrer (Corporal) of the SS saved him in the end from being gassed. 15. Around Octo,ber 1944 in the C-camp, the suspect MENGELE allegedly ~truck down a child of about twelve to fourteen years of age who was crying during the morning roll. call, with an object he was holding in his hand; he struck in such a way that the child collapsed and died; where the suspect at least willingly sanctioned the death of the child, even if it had not died as a result of his blow. 30 .... .of .. \"71\"'\\ MENGELE in a large number of cases allegedly forced pregnant women to lie down on the floor on their backs, whereupon the suspect allegedly kicked them with his boots in their abdomen until the abortion of the fetus took place. Even if the women survived this treatment, the suspect MENGELE, in using this improper method of abortion, at least willingly sanctioned the possibility of their death. 17. In August/September 1944, the suspect MENGELE allegedly drew a large quantity of blood from the female witness BOJTAR and her cousin ERNA BOROS to punish them both for leaving the barracks assigned to them during a \u00b7\"block curfew\", despite the prohibition against it; here the suspect at least willingly sanctioned the possibility of the death ~f the prisoners. While the female witness BOJTAR survived, the prisoner BOROS died after the drawing of blood. 18. In January 1944, on the occasion of the \"letter action\" of SS Untersturm fuehrer [Second Lieutenant) HARTENBERGER of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), in the Auschwitz-Monowitz camp, the suspect is further charged with having ordered to shoot Jewish prisoners who refused to write what he dictated to their relatives, saying that they Bad arrived in an agreeable labor camp and were treated wel~;the relatives should follow them. These acts are crimes according to the Paragraphs 211, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27,49, 53, 54 of the German Penal Code. The criminal acts with which the suspect MENGELE is charged do not fall under the statute of limitations according to German Law. (Paragraph 78 of the Penal Code) 31 .. 145-5 The strong suspicion of criminal acts is based on the testimonies of the witnesses: OLGA ADLER,.

There are grounds for arrest pursuant to paragraph 112, section 2, number 1, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, because it has been estab- lished on the basis of certain facts that the suspect has fled and is hiding himself. The present residence of the suspect in unknown. Allegedly. he is staying in a South American country. 34 34 I -I r I 145-5 The previous warrant of arrest of the District Court Freiburg im Breisgau, dated 2S February 1959 -file number 22 Gs 28/59 - and the warrant of arrest of the District Court Freiburg im Breisgau, dated 5 June 1959 are cancelled.

From the length 6\u00a3 the leg bones, we calculated that his stature before death was approximately 174 centimeters. Studies of the bones of the upper extremities indicate that he was right-handed. Pathologi~al and radiological studies reveal an old.' J -healed fracture of the right hip, a healed fract~re at the ~ase of the right thumb, a heeling fracture of the right I , ~houlder blade (scapula), and: an old, rigJ1t colI.: -bone. There a::# arthr i tic changes throughout the skeleton. In addi tion, ,there is a bony defect of the left cheek bone. Examination of the upper ja\\v reveals\u00b7 ~he presence of three *olars containing silver a~al9am fillings. The lower _\\ jaw ~ontains teeth, , replaced \\-Ii th removable, partial dentures made of what appears to be chrome alloy and acrylic. In addition, there is skeletal evidence indicating that the upper central ihcisors were widely spaced prior to their removal. Puge 2 of 5 1 : 7 . We h~ve reviewed me~ical, dental, investigativ~, and other biogr~phical information on Josef Mcngele provided by several governmental and private institutions and compared this data with our findings. We h~ve also reviewed the photographic skull-face superimposition analysis and .. photographic comparison studies of west G.ermon forensic scientists. In addition, we have received the report of the handwriting analysis of the QuestioneH Document Based on ~Ae above, it is the opinion of the undersigned tha\u00b7t the exhumed remains arc definitely not those of Wolfgang Gerhard.

Stay of Proceeding An investigative proceeding against the SS HauP1sturmfuehrer [Captain] JOSEF MENGELE, born on 16 March 1911 in Guenzburg/Schwaben, at the SS Garrison physician concentration camp Auschwitz Eor violating the RStVO [German Highway Traffic Regulations] will not be bit~t~. Reasons: On 21 June 1943 around 1600 hours, the defendant drove with the motorcycle 5S 16314 from the hospital barracks of the concentration camp Auschwitz, py way of the Officers,' residence and the community camp, to the prisoner of war camp in Birkenau. After the defendant had turned into the street to the POW camp at the Krupp factories. a tractor with 2 trailers, driven by the motorist HANS GRABASCH, advanced in the direction of the defendant. The motorist GRABASCH drove on the left side of the street because he was on the point of overtaking a truck with 2 trailers. GRABASCH was not able to carry out his overtaking maneuver~ however, because a truck of the Waffen SS had passed him and the truck and had caused such a big~_ whirl of dust that he could not see anything anymore. Though the overtaking maneuver was stopped and the speed lowered, the tractor of GRABASCH collided with the motorcycle of the defendant. The defendant was injured and parts of his uniform as well as the motorcycle were damaged. 30 152 I I I I I I I 1 I J I I I I 1 I I I 145 0 SS Hauutsturmfuehrer MENGELE's guilt with respect to the traffic accident could not be established. According to his description, he allegedly had already stopped the motorcycle when the tractor hit him. The motorist FRANZ GRABASCH who was heard as a witness, could not say for certain whether, at the moment of [HWR] I 3 a I 2 b [initials illegible] the collision, the motorcycle was in motion or not. Though the testimonies , of the defendant and the witness correspond in so far as both state that .the defendant was thrown onto the rai1w~y track at the right side of the road. this does not necessarily mean that this was caused by a traffic offense of the defendant; on the contrary, it can also be attributed to ,the colliding of the tractor with the stationary motorcycle. Moreover, the witness GRABASCH had had to admit that he, all of a sudden, during his overtaking maneuver, did not see anything anymore because of the whirl of dust. Under these circumstances the defendant is not to blame. Forwarding the files and checking the traffic performance of the driver FRANZ GRABASCH are to be dropped as, up to now, there have not been any investigative proceedings against him be- cause of a traffic accident and it is to his credit that he wanted to speed up in the interest of improved armaments.

With prudence~ perseverance and energy, he has carried out all the tasks set him, often under very difficult conditions, to the complete satisfaction of his superiors and has shown himself to be able to cope with every situation. In addition to that, he, as an anthropologist, has most zealously used his little off duty time to educate himself further and, utilizing the scientific material that was at his disposal due to his official position, had made a valuable contribution in his work to anthro- pological science. Therefore, his performance can be called outstanding. 36 J 145 0 In his attitude towards his superiors he shows the impeccable demeanor of an SS officer.

While carrying out his duty as physician in the most;conscientious way, he got infected with typhus while fighting the epidemic:in Auschwitz. On account of his special performance, he was awarded the Cross of Military Merit II Class, with black. In addition to his medical knowledge, Dr. M. is specially knowledgeab~e in anthropology.

After attending the elementary school in Guenzburg for four years, I became a student at the local Gymnasium where I obtained the certificate of maturity at Easter 1930. Subsequently I studied medicine in Munich and Bonn. In the summer of 1932 I took the preliminary medical examination in Bonn and then I studied medicine ana natural sciences in Vienna and Munich. In the fall of 1935 I received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from the Philosophy faculty, Section II of the University of Munich and in the summer of 1936 I passed my medical state examination before the Examina\u00ad tion Board of the University of Munich. I obtained my medical'certification on 1 September 1937. In the summer of 1938 I received \u00b7the degree of Doctor in Medicine from the Medical faculty of the Universit~ of Frankfurt am Main. After finishing my studies, I first worked for four months as a medi\u00ad cal assistant at the Medical University Clinic in Leipzig, and, starting from 1 January 1937, at the University Institute for Genetics and Eugenics in Frankfurt am Main. Since 1 September 1937 I have been an assistant physician at the above-mentioned Institute.

What information must the ancestor table contain? The ancestor-table must contain all the forebears of the SS member, or his wife or fiancee back to those ancestors who were born at least by 1 January 1800. In the case of SS officers the informations should go back to 1750 if possible. The following is to be indicated \"for each ancestor: 1. Name (for females maiden name only) and all first and middle names 2. Place, year, month and day of birth (after *) 3. Place, year, month and day of death (after +) 4. Religion (after R.) 5. Profession (after Prof.) 6. Place, year, month and day of marriage (after 00) A separate ancestor table should be submitted for the wife or fiancee. Children should be listed on\u00b7the reverse side of the ancestor table. 2. How to fill out the ancestor table. First of all, the SS member (or his wife) should enter all the required information about himself _. preferably using a typewriter -otherwise ink. Then, in space 2, he should provide all the information about his fater and in space 3 about his mother. Space 4 is for information concerning the paternal grandfather, space 5 for information about the paternal grandmother. Spaces 6 and 7 are for data concerning the maternal grand- 42 227 145-9 parents. Similarly, spaces 8 through IS are for information about the great-grandparents, while spaces 16 through 31 are for the great-great- grandparents and ~paces 32 to 63 for the All information such as names, profession and religion of the parents of the ancestors in question should be entered from any available documents even if there are no specific documents relating to these parents or the 1800 limit has already been passed. Note especially that the parents of an ancestor always must be entered in the two spaces just above the ancestor's space. Any information not derived from documents (guessed ot passed down orally) \u00b7should be entered in pencil . Reasons for missing information or remarks such as \"undetermined\" or the like do not belong in the ancestor table. They should be entered in the space provided for remarks on the reverse side of the ancestor table, with the indication of the ancestor's number. \"3. Procuring documents for the information in the ancestor table. For the SS member himself (or his wife) and for all ancestors, the following documents must be presented as proof for the correctness of the ancestor table: 43 1. Birth certificate or baptismal certificate 2. Marriage certificate or document. A death certificate is desirable. First, the SS member should compile all the information he can get from his family on a separate sheet. He then should request the appropriate documents, pointing out explicitly that they are needed as proof of Aryan descent for the 55 Reichsfuehrung. The registry offices are responsible for the period after 1876, the pari~officesare responsible for the years prior to that time. Documents from other countries are issued by the respective German consu-. lates; these can be obtained through the Foreign Office, Berlin W 8, Wil- helmstrasse 74. All known dates should be given exactly in the request. If a date can not be determined exactly, the local training leader should be asked for assist- ance. The fee for each document is 60 cents [Pfennige]. This fee may be waived if inability to pay can be proven and if it is certified by:the authorized office. 4. Inclusion of documents. Documents and evidence pertaining to the information in the ancestor table should be included when the table is submitted. The documents for each ances- tor table are to be placed in a separate envelope.The name, address, rank, S5 No., 55 Unit and VB No., if applicable, should be entered on the enve- lope. On each document, in the upper right hand corner, the number under which the ancestor in question appears in the ancestor table should be marked in penCil, for instance: Birth certificate of maternal grandmother with \"7\", marriage certificate of paternal grandfather and grandmother with \"4/5\". The ancestor table has to be shown to the appropriate training leader before being sent to the Race and Resettlement Main Office. He has to 44 145-9 compare the entries in the ancestor-table with the documents. Ancestor tables which are improperly filled out or _do not go back far enough (1 January 18oo!) will not be forwarded to the Race and Resettlement Main Office. The applicant will get-his documents back.after examination by the Race and Resettlement Main Office. 55V R 2 55 Vordruckverlag W. F.

FINDINGS: On June 15, 1985 a forensic document examination was conducted in Sao Paulo, Brazil of the Xerox copy of the medical records of Josef MENGELE. This examination resulted in the following conclus\u00ad ions. 1. Examination of the SCHWARZtiELLER signature on the original medical records of Irene SCHOENBEIN and the SCffiiARZWELLER signature on the Josef MENGELE Xerox copy, revealed that both signatures were made by one and the same person. 2. Comparative examination of the MENGELE signature on the Xerox copied medical records to other known MENGELE signatures from documents provided by the Berlin Document Center, revealed that all the signatures were made by one and the same person. 3. A study of the area surrounding the !~NGELE signature on the Xerox copy, as well as the signature itself, revealed very sharp and consistent tonal quality with no indication of montaging or signature transfer. The examination failed to reveal any evidence of alteration or text substatution. 1 : I I ! , 4. From the examinations conducted, it must be concluded that the Xerox copy of the Josef MENGELE medical records accurately reflects the same text that appeared on the original document.

At this time I am still too much over~ome by the closer details of this event and some other things have taken pri?rity; so for the moment I am limiting myself to a brief notification, along with the most important information. with- out going into particular detail as to time and place. Then, upon receiving a reply to this letter, along with the confirmation of the old or listing of a new place to which our correspondence is routed, I shall furnish you a more detailed a\"ccounting of what happened. As in every year, I spent a vacation of three weeks a~ the seashore with my family. And \"Uncle\", .!!. ~ called him -and that is what he was to our childr. spent the fina~ days of his life there with us. One evenipg. while he was bathing in the ocean, he\" suffered a stroke while swimming and, ~fter apparently suffering a paralysis on one side of the body was able to make clumsy swimming motions with one arm. When this happened he was somewhat further away from me and closer to my family who were in the process of \" getting out of the water and closer to the beach because an undertow seaward was becoming apparent. Our 12 year old boy shouted: \"Uncle, get further out of the water because the water is e::certing a pull into the ocean!\" In this context the boy was surprised by the strange motions being made by a man who normally va! an e::ccellent swimmer. He drew my wife's attention to this, whereupon she called to me: \"Look after Uncle. he appears unable to get out!\" and concentrated on getting the children to safety. I swam over to him as quickly as I could. grabbed him under the arms in mid riff while the latter was making only clumsv swimming motions with one arm and. -1-\\ ~., c. .. while supporting h~ and working with all possible momentum with ~ue'arm and legs, attempted to get h~ to the beach. Since it was ~possible to stand in this spot and the current was very much against us, it was a very difficult strug~le. Meanwhile, my wife and. our 14 ye~r old daughter had run for help. How\u00ad ever, in the meantime, I had draggea the affected individual into vater that was hip~deep; be had meanwhile\u00b7 become un~onscious. At this point my son and another fellow on whom my daughter bad called for help, arrived on the scene and pulled him completely to the sandy beach. My daughter had approached a 'group of people sitting some distance away 'and had urgently asked for a surfb~ard. . . It so happened that the man there was a physician, and when he heard that it was a matter of saving someone who was drowning he ran back alone with her~ He immediately a ttempted resuscitation in the conventional method and also started to massage the heart. Meanwhile, the wife and daughter ran to the nearby beach restaurant and called for the rescue squad, which shortly reached the scene. However, it was all~~'no avail and too ,late. Fighting h~roically , . to his last breath, just as he had done throughout a tumultuous life, that is how our friend departed from us for always on a subtropical ocean beach. All the further details I can hint at here only very briefly. Since I myself had 'also been transpo~ted to the rescue station, where I received medical attention and was put in bed, the responsibility\u00b7 and care for every thing' else .1 that needed to be done became the sole responsibility of my wife: ba~g the deceased placed into police custody until the body was finally released during the night, its transport to the nearest town, attendance at. the judicial inquest, etc. All this was connected with innumerable obstacles and dangers resulting from the great difference in.!.8.!.:.. During a severe storm that led the driver of the police car to fear that. a toppling tree would kill hIm, she returned to the small village only at 0500 the foliowing morning and, due to the excit~ent, found herself virtually unable to fall asleep. -2-Then, by 0800, she ha=.,~~ ~be at .~ ''':\" ('. -,,? \\ . 1 I I I J , the registrar's office when it opened in order to have a death certificate issued. Since neither one of us was in condition to operate a motor vehicle she took the bus back into town where, ~ven during the night, she had already initiated all that was necessary in a funeral home.\u00b7 It is customary here that the deceased normally are buried within one day, hence the rush. Unfortunately, despite all efforts on her part, she was unable to comply with Uncle's wish that he had only recently expressed, to be cremated. In this country, which is still predominantly Roman Catholic, strict regulations to this effect still apply. When the deceased h~s not left behind an officially certi- fied written request to this effect, only a close blood relative, with the approval of the remaining relatives, can obtain such a permit. Now, during his last visit, Lange had suggested to\u00b7me that in the event of Uncle's death, he should be interred in a double grave alongside Lange's mother (whom he had known) in a small locality nearby. In order to forestall bureaucratic difficulties he had already t,'erbally prepared the cemetery administ tor of the fact that an older, sickly relative potentially... The fact that this individual possessed a good memory of persons and names in the end almost doomed everything to failure. In fact, it is customary here to once more lift the cover of the casket one more time prior to burial in order to say farewell to the deceased. When the administrator read the death certificate, he said: \"Well, that is life. He talked to me about someone else coming here, and now he is lying here himself! tr And following that he prepared to open the lid of th, casket in order to see the deceased once more. For anyone who can imagine to some extent all that had occurred thus far will be able to understand that the hysterical fit that my wife feigned in order to prevent the lid of the coffin being opened was only half simulated. Enough! Our friend, lying in a beautiful coffin and amply surrounded by flowers was in- terred properly and with all decorum. Since possibly in the future it may be desired to rebury. cremate or transfer the remains. which might necessitate -3-,..., ~ , L. --/ assistance on the part of the Lange children, I would suggest that a loose \\ and friendly contact with them be attempted and maintained. Utilization of an intermediary, such as Uncle had recommended, \u00b7by way of my mother-in-law, might well serve the purpose of bridging the.gap. '~e just received news from her. Even though rheumatic pains are restricting her mobility, she would . be glad to act as intermediary for ~ncie, whom she esteems and whose fate is known to her, even thouqh she is not aware of his real name. A personal visit on your part to her (should you at some time consider it useful) would not cause any problem. On the other hand, an unfriendly daughter with whom she resides, is totally uninitiated. We immediately. looked after Uncle's belongings that remained behind. All papers, writings, books, -even every last slip of paper and all easily moveable valuables are in our possesssion and under lock and key. At the moment time does.not permit us to carry out even a superficial survey that would, among i other things serve the purpose of separating and burning a good part of it. All this will take a more extende4 period of time. Instinct would lead me, presumably you as well; to recomm~nd an tmmeuiate burning of such items. On the othe~_~nd, L ~ also fully a~are of the responsibility. The fate of this individual is so remarkable that r hesitate to preclude future descendants in the family from receivinq an inheritance benefitinq their mentality. -even if the present qeneration does not attach any importance to it. As far as you yourself are concerned, at this time there is little to be done or to assist with. In any case, he burned all of the mail he received and made copies of his own that are available. The rest consists of an unsurveyable pile of notebooks or poorly leqible but briefly written diaries, unfortunately containinq much too little of literary value, and everythinq intermixed with unimportant cash receipts, newspaper notices, notations about household items, etc. Consequently, some careful screeninq will be required to separate the wheat from the chaff. -4-~, , , ~ j I , \" l .. i c .. Since I am pretty well familiar with pll private matters ana iarge~y am in agreement with the deceased's political views, you need not worry about my temporarily looking after t~ings. ~y desire will always be to see to it that nothing remains behind that in one way or another some time in the future could receive a negative interpretation. Today we met with Ge and Gi at the house and we discussed the dissolution -,: . of the household. We decided to await yo~r reply to this letter of mine before any final decisions are made ~s to the final disposition of the property. At this time, partly because the sons receive good income, they are not in a bad financial position and intend to purchase a larger house. On the other haud, I assume that they would not want to live in Uncle's house. They are pre- pared to sell it and make the proceeds available to you. The value is approximately $15,000 in u.s. currency. To the extent that I am familiar with the situation this will turn out to be a long drawn-out affair with additional ~enses, since we want to make it impossible for squatters -\"intrusos\" -to move into the property whom it would then be difficult to evict. In addition, a deserted home gets immediately demolished 'and destroyed by, bad elements. Th~ we have no choice but to keep\u00b7 on board the relatively ~~ensive household maid, to continue paying her salary and living expenses and to be glad, under ,the cir- cumstances, that she remains in place. The \u00b7~elevision set, phonograph, etc. are already in my hands and a de\u00ad cision as to their disposition will have to be made; as to the furniture, all . of which is old, clothing, and household items a similar decision needs to be made. Part of the fu~iture perhaps might be used in the sale of the property, the remainder most likely could only be given away. We would appreciate recei~ from you a decision and response as soon as possible. The remainder of Uncle's dollar reserves, the golden watch of his brother are now, as before, being safeguarded in the safe deposit box in our bank. Together with a precise compilation of ~~enses everything will be turned over -5- -' . . ~ should one of you come over here. I could imagine that R., for instance, might come over for a vacation in order eo wander with US through the beach landscape through which Uncle walked with us on his last day. In this connection, how~ver, I wish to emphasize that at thi~ time such a trip on your part or by anyone else would not make much sense. We also believe to be in agreament with your thinking if we plan to continue secrecy now as before. This is 1~tended not only to avoid personal unpleasantness but also to compel the opposition to continue wasting money and effort on something that has already been superseded by events. Perhaps it might be worth while to attempt simplifying our mailing contacts. In this connection lam thinking of your recommendation to Uncle a year ago in connection with an individual living nearby who also receives . letters from overseas, something like that or something similar. In the future, should you have any notification for us that is urgent, or should you desire to have an exchange of views verbally, we now have had a telephone installed at home. The number is 531 6197 and for the most part my wife is at home starting at 1400 (1800 your time). If one wishes to find out the prefixes for country and city, it would be easy to call us from house to house or a neutral place where a telephone is available. At the time of Lange's death my wife, by simply dialing a number (which we obtained from Eino and which has since been changed) was able to talk ~ediately and with all clarity with .1 the children. I doubt that I have left out anything of importance and thus will conclude. We wish to express out condolences to all relatives and remain in old friendship, with best\u00b7 regards sepecially to you, but also from family to family, yours,.

By the end of next week that day will be o:ming around again, 16 March - \"our day\" on which mst certainly all three of us will be especiall)' think.in:J of each other. I am sure that you inmadiately noticed fran the first line that we have JOOVed, specifically as of 1 March. . Through a classified ad in the Frankfurter Zei~ Ro. [Mengele's son] has succeeded jn finding a very interesting position here in Berlin. As a result of his extensive experiences in Saudia Arabia he had a great advantage over the n\\lm&OUS other applicants, since Berlin-consul.t (that is the nane of the finn) constructs industrial facilities that are ready to be occupied in the Eastem block, Algeria, Lybia and, anong others, also in Saudi Arabia. '!he position is practically tailor-made for him. Ro. is in charge of the contracting depart:nent. nus time it appears that a really solid, generous, and financially strong finn is involved. Ro. heads for work early in the norning in a virtual state of euphoria and returns only late (yesterday it was after 8 p.m.) tired, but nevertheless still in a good ItYXXi. '!here hardly could be any better indication. Tawrrow he is flying to sane negotiations in Cologne. And on SUrxiay or Monday possibly to Yugoslavia! If only he had decided sooner to lrtUrk within a finn, but perhaps he had set his sights a bit too high. For us Berlin means enonnous change in every respect. When CCJ'l'PCiI'ed to Freiburg the city makes a rather brutal inpression on me. Ro. is well IOO'tivated by his work. As for me, the situation is sanewhat different, since at this tine I do not knc:w anyone. I am now searching for a job at least a few hours a day, because to sane extent I \"have a bit of cabin fever.\" OUr Ines [Mengele' s granddaughter) has ccrce along in great shape (see photos!). Today she is, exactly 7 nonths \"old.\" Now let me begin to convey to you the \"length\" statistics: She has grown an entire 19 en (72 em) and now weighs double her weight on 8 Aug 78, specifically 8,000 grams. The hair growth still leaves sanething to be desired, but the few hairs that have grown in the meantine are considerably lighter in color than the first ones. One month ago the first two little teeth appeared in the lower jaw. In the upper jaw as well little teeth are visible just below the gum. Everyone admires Ines f eyes. They really are enontcUSly large and of a particularly dark shade of blue. Wherever she laughs she carpletely pulls up her nose in doing so,' which is why we call he \"nose bear.\" More recently she has been displaying a great interest in her feet. Frequently, when I approach her little bed (she already outgrew the -.~. . . .. .\" traditional basket a long time ago), she grasps a little leg and then puts the foot into her JIDUth. She is now able by maneuvering arx1 swinging arowXl to turn over fran lying on her stanach to lie on her back, arx1 for the past three days she has also\" managed to do the same in reverse and does it pretty well. If one sits her down upright on a finn foundation then she is able to admire her surroundings for \"a few minutes fran this entirely new perspective. Her fwmy sounds, which she makes alnnst the entire day, are gathering many different meanirxJs, and shortly before mealtime they becane really energetic. Even thoogh she has already travelled alozq with us on a number of occaSions -just three weeks ago to Livingno in Italy for skiing -she is definitely sensitive to changes in location and livin:J ooOOitions, expressed in the last few days by noticeable unrest. New she is gradually getting assimilated. At present we are bein:J honored every other day with the presence of different craftsmen; today the kitchen furnishings are being delivered and the telephone will be booked up. Around here all house restoration ~rk is tied in with considerable difficulties, since eveI}'thing in the older buildings is CX>nstructed in a very primitive way. Yet we want to make it all sanewhat canfortable\" so that we can feel at ease here. New I am going to tum over the typewriter to Ro, since this letter must get to the post office without delay. All my love on the occasion of the 68th birthday and, until the near future, [The writing inriediately above was typewritten by Mengele I Mus's [the Bosserts): Here my best wishes and news were to have been added. The letter remained lying around for some time since initially we had to absorb the sad news. A tragic fate has come to an end; only with difficulty are we able to realize it. It is certainly one consolation for us, that is the victory of humanity and friendship that overcame all obstacles and this security up to the last moment. \" Dear friends, we think of [you] in this hour, and we want to thank you remote from any sentimentality and bombast also in the name of him, who accepted this as a matter of course [and] who also sometimes found it difficult just to be simply human. We ask of you never to forget this friendship and to preserve it for us if possible. You have gone through difficult hours, espeCially because of the particular circumstances\". The grave digger probably was probably not so wrong -that one should always inquire about onels own grave and not about that intended for others. We thank - 2 -, you for all your trouble and admire your skill and the perfect execution of all necessary measureS. There are'a few personal items that the \"heir\" would perhaps have liked. I am thinking especially of any literary remains which may exist. Everything else should certainly go to those who also had the work and \u00b7the trouble, as a small acknowledgement, so to speak. The last route --and you have recognized this correctly I would like to take personally with him one more time. For this reason I shall come in September or December of this year. I shall coordinate the exact date with you. For the time being I cannot get away since I am blocked for going on leave for five months. Almuth writes about my new job. We hope that all is well with you and that you are leading a happy life. From the bottom of our hearts we wish you all the best and remain, with best regards. yours, s/Ro.

Dr. Cantu traveled to Brazil as part of an American forensic science team to assist in_the examination of evidence relating to a body suspected to be the NAZI wa~ criminal, Dr. Josef Mengele. Chemical and physical examinations were performed on the questioned ~nk entr~es appearing on specimens Ql through Q14 \"and the results were compared with those from inks in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' standard ink\"libra~y.

A t{LJz1L-----_----. Dr. David A. Crown Examiner of Questioned Documents cc: Mr. Gideon Epstein, US INS Dr. Antonio Cantu, FBI '. .:/ , i I I ObserVl!tioDS on the purported Skeleton of Josef Mengele 14 January 1986 -15 January 1986 Donald J. Ortner, Ph.D. Curator Department of Anthropology Smithsonian Institution Washington, D.C. 20560 u.s.A . ' Revised 19 August 1986 -.. i 2 Introducti on At the request of the Office of Special Investigations, Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice 1 spent one and a half \"days (14 January -15 January 1986) in Sao paulo, Brazil studying the purported remains of Dr. Josef Mengele for evidence of skeletal pathology that might be helpful in resolving some of the remaining questions related to a positive identification of the remains. While in Sao Paulo I had the full support and cooperation of Dr. Romeo Tuma, Chief of Federal Police, State of Sao Paulo and Dr. Rubens Maluf, Director of the Instituto Medico-Legal of Sao Paulo. Dr. Stephen Dachi, Consul General of the U.S. Consulate, Sao Paulo and Mr. Frederick Kaplan, a political officer at the U.S. Consulate, provided invaluable cooperation. Observations on the skull and mandible Both the sk'Ull and mandible were located at another laboratory in Brazil where a clay restoration of the soft tissue was being attempted. Therefore I was una~le to study the skull and mandible first hand. For this reason my observations are limited to features observable on x-ray films or photographs. The chief lesion of intereSt is the lytic focus on the left zygomatic bone. Interpretation of this defect is complicated by the fact that there clearly is considerable postmortem bone loss at this site. X-ray films reveal a very irregular but roughly circular opening in the . . bone. In at least one film there appears to be two or\" three layers associated wi'th the defect and the opening becomes progressi vely smaller in the deeper layers. Tissue immediately adjacent to the defect in each layer has what appears to be a thin x-ray dense margin. However, the typical response of bone to chronic inflammatory drainage, including a relatively thick zone of compact bone and thickened spongy bone, is not apparent in the x-ray films. The morphology seen on , j J , 3 x-ray film and photographs, including the very irregular shape of the border of the defect, is more compatible with a diagnosis of postmortem bone destruction. Conversely, arguing for the possibility of a fistula communicating between the maxillary sinus and an external surface, is the suggestion of a cir'cular pattern of what appears to be the exposed trabeculae surrounding the defect. The presence of some postmortem damage and the destructive histological procedures used as part of the forensic analysis may make resolution of this issue impossible. The possibility, however, of chronic maxillary sinusitis associated with destruction of adjacent bone tissue and a fistula for draining the chronic discharge certainly cannot be ruled out on the basis of my study of the photographic and x-ray film evidence. Observations on the vertebral column and ribs The cervical (neck) vertebrae (CI-C7) are all present and are in a fairly complete state of preservation. The diarthrodial (gliding) joints show minimal arthritic lipping. There is some evidence of porous degeneration particularly on the left diarthrodial joint of the C4-CS vertebrae. The amphiarthrodial joints (between the vertebral bodies) tend to have porous arthritic degeneration on the posterior surfaces that is particularly severe in the C4-C5 joint. Amphiarthrodial joints from C4 to C7 show considerable evidence of arthritic lipping. All of these degenerative arthritic changes are suggestive of moderate to considerable physical activity and might have resulted in chronic neck pain during life. The diarthrodial joints of the thoracic (chest) vertebrae (TI-T12) show minimal evidence of degenerative arthritis although these joints are missing from T7-T8 through T12. With the exception of the' T5-T6 joint, the amphiarthrodial joints show minimal evidence of arthritic change. The amphiarthrodial joint surfaces from TS\u00ad TS through Tll-T12 show evidence of bone destruction of varying severity from -,.... ... ' ....,,0 4 Schmorl's nodes that sug.gest abnormal stress to the disks of these vertebrae. The lower thoracic vertebral bodies also exhibit arthr.itic\u00b7 lipping that is particularly severe in the joints of T3-T4, T5-T6. and T8-T9. From the T5-T6 joint through T12, the costovertebral joints show moderate evidence of porous arthritic degeneration that might have been associated with pain on heavy breathing. The vertebral bodies of T4 to T7 are slightly eccentric with a deviation to the right that might have produced a slight twist to the right in the middle chest region during life. The diarthrodial joints of the lumbar vertebrae (L1-L5) exhibit postmortem damage but moderate arthritic lipping is apparent particularly on L3-L4. The joint between L1 and the sacrum shows severe arthritic degeneration. The amphiarthrodial joirits of L1-L2 and L2-L3 are porous and slightly concave. A lateral x-ray film of these vertebrae shows a sclerotic response in association with the porosity that is suggestive of a long-standing chronic inflammation. The L3-L4 amphiarthrodial joint shows slight ossification of the car~ilaginous disk. These degenerative changes are . , suggestive of a traumatic event leng before death and might have been associated with ~chronic low-back pain. , . . ~~ With the exception of degenerative changes on the joints surfaces of the ribs (costovertebral joints) corresponding to those seen on the thoracic vertebrae, the ribs show very ,li ttle of significance. There does seem to be a well developed bony ridge . in the intercostal region of the ldwer ribs that is suggestive of considerable physical activity and would correspond to the overall evidence of muscularity and physical activity seen in the rest of the skeleton. Observations on the pectoral ~jrdle and upper extremities The sternum, particularly the sternoclavicular joint surfaces, shows evidence of trauma and unusual degenerative arthritis. Both joints on the manubrium have a v-1 5 shaped depression (Figure 1) that is, on the right, at least, suggestive of a compression fracture many years before death. The particularly severe abnormality on the right could be part of the same pathological process resulting in the abnormal morphology of the pro;cimal clavicle. The left clavicle appears to be normal. The right clavicle\"shows evidence of a well-healed, greenstick fracture at mid shaft (Figure 2). The proximal end of this bone is abnormal with a morphology suggestive of subnormal growth in the superior portion of the growing end\" and relatively normal growth inferiorly (Figure 3). The effect is an abnormal angulation of the proximal joint. This abnormality could be associated with the trauma that resulted in the fracture of the midshaft and the compression fracture of the corresponding joint of the manubrium. The abnormality of the manubrium and proximal clavicle should be apparent on an A-P chest x-ray taken during life. The pathological conditions of the right clavicle and manubrium probably occurred during childhood or adolescence and, while painful at the time of injury, mi~ht easily be forgotten or overlooked in any later medical history. The right scapula exhibits an unhealed but long-standing infraction (partial fracture) of the inferior, lateral, scapular spine (Figure 4). The fracture line is clearly visible but the broken edges show some evidence of remodeling (healing). The scapula has been sectioned through the infraction revealing the extensive sclerotic response of both the spongy bone and the compact bone on the contralateral cortex associated with the site of the infraction (Figure 5). The failure of the infraction to unite is unusual but may have been due to the interposition of soft tissue during and after the traumatic event. The degree of the sclerotic response in the spongy bone and the added thickness of the contralateral compact bone provides clear evidence that there was sufficient time for the development of some evidence .1 6 of bony callus across and adjacent to the defect (e.g., Ortner and Putschar 1981, p. 79, Figs. 85\":86) had it been possible for this to occur. The remodeling and extensive sclerotic response is, in my opinion, indicative of at least one year and probably many years since the jraumatic event. Both scapulae .show evidence of moderate degenerative arthritis on the periphery of the glenoid cavity which provides further evidence of considerable physical activity during life. Observations 00 the pelvic e-irdle and lower extremity The right innominate has multiple .lesions suggestive of a crushing traumatic injury perhaps complicated by infection (Figure 6). All lesions are healed with the degree of remodeling indicating considerable time since the traumatic event. There is a circular depression about 1 1/2 cm in diameter below and posterior to the anterior inferior iliac spine. This depression could be the result of a compression fracture followed by remodeling. Another possibility is a lytic (destructive) focus resul ting from infection and possibly arising as a complication of trauma. There is a bony ridge beginning just posterior -to the anterior inferior iliac spine and extending in an antero-posterior axis approximately five to six cm. This ridge has the appearance of bony callus following infraction. Extensive remodeling of the ridge is indicative of considerable time (more than a year) since the event that stimulated production of the ridge. Inferior to the ridge is a bony projection about one cm in diameter and extending anteriorly about three to four cm. This projection appears to arise in the area of the origin of the Rectus Femoris muscle. The projection extends in an anterior and slightly superior direction and most likely is the result of ossification of the tendon and muscle fibers (myositis ossificans) of the Rectus Femoris following trauma to the tissue in this area of the innominate. -~~ ~10 _.. ..J I 1 I , , J 'I Myositis ossificans is ~ot an uncommon complication of trauma to muscle tissue. It is usually associated with injuries in adolescents or young adults (Resnick and Niwayama 1981, p. 3152) but can occur in later life. The anterior and slightly superior axis of the projection -raises the possibility that the right leg might have been fixed ina flexed position for a few weeks following the trauma. If Mengele were mobile and active four weeks following his motorcycle accident, the probability is that the injury to the hip region is associated with another traumatic event early in life. It will be important to clarify this aspect of Mengele's biography and medical history if at all possible. Fixation of the right leg in a flexed position for several weeks would probably be a condition that associates at that stage of his life would remember. In the context of the possibility of another traumatic event -associated with the pathology in the hip, the lytic focus on the ilium could be evidence of a healed infectious focus. This possibility would resolve one of the remaining problems relative to the skeletal evidence for the osteomyelitis recorded in Mengelers medical history. On the right femoral head, posterior to the fovea, the articular surface is elevated with an irregularly shaped area of bone (Figure 7). There is a corresponding area of degenerative arthritis in the acetabulum. This pattern of articular surface change_ is not typical of purely degenerative arthritis and is suggestive of arthritis following severe trauma to the joint. The area around the right hip contains bone lesions indicative of at least one severe traumatic event. The well-established nature of the lesions indicates that the trauma had happened one or more years earlier in life and probably during adolescence or early adulthood. There is the possibility of more than one traumatic event and also of an infectious complication of the trauma. Healing clearly took place and there is no evidence -. JI 8 that any of the lesio~ were active at the time of death. Photographs made available to me at the time of my initial involvement with this case suggested the possibility of a healed lesion resulting from periostitis on the anterior proximal_shaft of the left femur. ExamiJlation of the specimen, however, clearly indicated that this abnormality was a postmortem\" change (Figure 8). References Ortner, D. J. and Walter G. J. Putschar 1981..

De Mello, the Associate Director of Institute of Legal Medicine. The exhumed remains, thought to be those of \"Doctor Josef Mengele\" were buried under the name of \"Wolfgang Gerhard\" in February, 1979. A team of three Forensic Scientists, representing the United States Department of Justice (Exhibits A & ~), was sent to Sao Paulo, Brazil, at the invitation of the Brazilian Govern\u00ad ment, to observe, consult, assist and participate in the exam\u00adination of the exhumed remains for the purpose of the identifi\u00ad cation. A second team of three u.S. Forensic Scientists, repre\u00ad senting the Simon Wiesenthal Center (Exhibits B & e), arrived at Sao Paulo on June 15 to conduct the same examination. The first official meeting of the International Forensic Scientists was held at the Institute of Legal Medicine, Sao Paulo, in the afternoon of Saturday, June 15, 1985. There, we met the West German and the Brazilian Forensic Scientists and a plan was developed to proceed with the investigation and exam\u00adination of the case. The Berli~ documents, consisting of two files on Josef Mengele, from the late thirties and early forties (Exhibits D-1, E, F, F-1) were made available to us by the United States Government. The Brazilian Government provided us with the investigative information regarding the events leading to the death of Josef Mengele in February of 1979 and the exhumation of the body on June 6, 1985. A second exhumation was carried out by the officials of the Institute of Legal Medicine on Sunday, June 16, 1985, to recover additional human parts and evidence. The first session on the examination of the skeletal re\u00ad mains began at approximately 10:00 a.m. on Monday, June 17 and continued on a daily basis through Thursday, June 20, 1985. It was reported to us that during his stay in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and until his death, Josef Mengele lived with two fami\u00adlies, the Stammers and the Bosserts who testified before the International Panel of Forensic Scientists in the afternoon of Wednesday, June 19, 1985 (Exhibits G & H). 1 J J I I , I Each forensic scientist and each team worked independently at first and subsequently reviewed each other's work and com\u00ad pared findings and conclusions. As scientific measurements are specific and precise, our observations and interpretations tended to coincide with those of our respective colleagues in most instances. The preliminary report released in Brazil, on June 21, 1985, was signed by all scientists from the United States, representing the .Justice Department and the Simon Wiesenthal Center (Exhibit I), to indicate that all were in agreement that, \"the skeleton was that of Josef Mengele within a reasonable scientific certainty.\" The two u.s. teams met for four days in August of 1985 at the Office of the \"Chief Medical Examiner in Wilmington, Delaware, to review, in detail, their findings and conclusions. At that meeting representatives from the u.s. Department of Justice presented additional medical and investigative infor\u00ad mation. Based on the new information and all prior knowledge developed during our stay in Brazil, we reaffirmed, at the conclusion of our meeting in Delaware, that \"the skeleton was that of Josef Mengele in all reasonable scientific certainty.\" Other meetings have since been held and information has been exchanged among the u.s. Scientists. This final report consists of the following: 1. The scientific findings of the examination of the human skeletal remains and other physical evidence recovered during the exhumation on 6 June 1985 and the re-exhurnation on 16 June 1985 at Nossa Senhora do Rosario Cemetery. 2. The medical, dental, historical, documentary and investigative information on Dr. Josef Mengele and Wolfgang Gerhard, made available to us by several governmental agencies and private institutions as well as individuals. It is important to note that no documented medical and dental records or x-rays had been available on Josef Mengele since 1945. On March 21, 1986, additional dental evidence became available for examination by Dr. Lowell Levine in Sao Paulo, Brazil. 3. Our discussion and op~n~on which are based on comparison of the items included in the above two categories. 2 I.. GENERAL CONDITION The examination of the skeletal remains began on June 17, 1985 at approximately 10:00 a.m. The skeleton, when first inspected was laid out in anatomical order (Exhibit D-2) in a fairly large examining room of the Institute of Legal Medicine. The inspection reveals a completely skeletonized human remains. The bones are dry and retain no residual soft tissues, except for a few small segments of scalp (Exhibit D-3), nor do they present any strong decompositional odors. They vary in color from light to dark, mottled brown. Postmortem damages to the bones consist of two kinds: a. MINOR EROSIONAL DAMAGE: largely limited to the extremities and processes of the postcranial bones. This damage is consistent with the his\u00ad tory of burial of several years in a wooden coffin under moist environmental conditions. b. EXHUMATION DAMAGE: This damage consists of breakage which occurred during the excavation of the skeleton. It is characterized by fresh fracture margins. It is most apparent in the cranium which displays extensive fragmentation of.the facial bones (Exhibit D-4). It is also seen in the vertebral column where some post\u00aderior vertebral elements have been separated from the centra. The sacrum also displays this type of damage as do several ribs. After our initial examination, several bones, four teeth, and a number of small bone fragments, recovered from a re\u00ad exhumation of the grave conducted on June 16, were added to the skeleton. With these additions, the skeleton is complete except for the following small bones of hands and feet: 1. Left hand: a. Trapezium b. Trapezoid c. eight phalanges 2. Right hand: four phalanges 3. Left foot: six phalanges 4. Right foot: nine phalanges NOTE: See skeletal chart following Chapter II. 3 7C:;\"l __ t .. -I f I I , .. II. FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY A. AGE AT DEATH: 1. GROSS OBSERVATIONS: The following general age changes are observed in this skeleton: a. Cranial Sutures: The basilar suture is closed. The cranial vault sutures, examined ectocranially, display early closure of the coronal and lambdoid and advanced closure of the sagittal. Dental wear is moder\u00ad ately advanced. b. the c. Sacrum: All sacral segments are united. Sacrococcygeal union is complete. d. Sternun: Manubriocorporal union is complete. The xiphoid and corpus segments are completely fused. e. Ribs: The ribs display deep cupping of the costo\u00ad chondral junctions, and moderately advanced ossification of the costochondral cartilages. f. Scapulae: The scapulae display the atrophy, buck\u00ad ling, and pleating characteristic of advanced age. Lipping of the clavicular facet is strong. The base of the scapular spine is strongly de\u00ad marcated. g. Vertebral osteophytosis: moderately ad\u00ad vanced. lipping throughout the entire vertebral column. This is particularly marked in the cervical and lumbar regions. 4 h. Osteoarthritis: There is moderately advanced os\u00ad teoarthritic lipplng of the articular margins of the major joints. The above changes are consistent with an age estimate of 55 to 75 years at the time of death. 2. MICROSCOPIC AGE DETERMINATION: Microscopic age determination was accomplished by using Kerley's method (1965)~ Two thin segments were sawed from the midshaft of the left femur (Exhibits D-5 & D-6). The right femur was not utilized because the . right hip was pathological. The sections were ground by hand to a thickness of approximately 100 microns and mounted on microscopic slides (Slides A and B). These slides were then examined microscopically under polar\u00ad ized light. (See charts following Chapter II) When the profile chart method was used, the age estimate for Slide A was 70.5 \u00b1 5 years and that for Slide B was 68 \u00b1 5 years. The average for these two estimates is 69.25 years of age at the time of death. In the original study, the actual age of 86.7% of the specimens fell within \u00b1 5 years, and all 125 specimens within flO years of the microscopic age estimate. A third slide (\"C\") was processed and examined at the University of Maryland from a small segment that was brought for that purpose. Using the microscope there that is adjusted for the estimation of age, the estimated age by the profile method was 68 years. The revised regression formula for osteon fragments provided an estimated age of 67.2 years \u00b1 7 years. The close agreement of all slides and methods suggest an estimated age at the time of death of 64-74 years with 69 being the most probable year. B. DETERMINATION OF SEX: 1. MORPHOLOGICAL SEXING: The innominates display the highly arched sciatic notch, relatively large aceta\u00ad bulum, subtriangular pubis and acute subpubic angle characteristic of males. The pelvic diagnosis of sex is confirmed by the crani\u00b7al morphology which includes a well-developed glabella, strong supraorbital brow ridges, large mas\u00ad toid processes and a prominent, external occipital pro\u00ad tuberance typical of males. 5 1 I , 1 2. METRIC SEXING: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. a. Metric sexing was ac~omplished by discriminant function analysis, using the Giles-Elliott formula i6 (Giles 1963) which uses 5 cranial measurements and which has a reliability of 84.9%. The results of this analysis are shown below: Measurement mm Glabello-Occipital Length 182 , Basion-Nasion Length 103 Bizygomatic Breadth 139 Basion-Prosthion Length 91 Nasion-Prosthion Height 72 DF score =5398.25 Section Male DF constant 9.875 7.062 19.062 -1.000 4.375 The results of this analysis confirms the morpho\u00ad logical diagnosis of this skeleton as that of a male. b. LONG BONE HEAD DIAMETERS: The vertical diameters of the left humeral'and femoral heads were 52 and 55 mrn, respectively. Both values are well beyond the upper limits observed in females in Dwights (1904-05) data for European whites. C. DETERMINATION OF RACE: Race was determined by cranial discriminant function analysis, using the Giles (1965) equations based upon 8 cranial measurements. The results are shown below: DF constant Measurement mrn WN WI 1. Glabel1o-0ccipital 146 -1.56 3. 103 -4.41 -0.29 6 DF 6. Basion-Prosthion Nasion-Prosthion Nasal Breadth WN 139 -0.10 91 DIAGNOSIS: Caucasoid WI 1.75 0.10 -0.16 -0.84 In addition to the diagnosis of Caucasoid provided by the discriminant function analysis, it should be pointed out that the skeleton displayed many other morphological and metric traits characteristic of whites and none, inconsis\u00adtent with this diagnosis. D. STATURAL ESTIMATION: Antemortem stature was estimated by using the Trotter\u00ad Glesser regression equation for predicting height from the combined lengths of the femur and tibia. As the right femur displayed some shortening associated with old pathology, only the left bones were used. The results are shown be\u00ad low: cm Maximum Femoral Length = 49.1 Maximum.Tibial Length = 35.7 Total = 84.8 Based upon the above value, antemortem stature is cal\u00adcula ted as:\u00b7 est S.E. est 173.5 \u00b1 2.99cm For this estimates the .95 probability range, based on a deviation of \u00b1 2S.E. est is, 167.5 to 179.5 cm 7 J A second estimate of stature was made by using the Fully technique which is derived by combining the skeletal heights of all bones contributing to stature to which is added a factor compensating for soft tissues. This yielded an estimate of: est S.E. est 172.4 \u00b1 2.05 cm For this estimate the .95 probability range, bases on a deviation of \u00b12S.E. est is, 168.3 to 176.5 cm SUMMARY 6 em) COMMINGLING: None.

In his 1938 SS physical examination, Mengele's head cir\u00ad cumference (lfKopfumfangn) is recorded.as 57 centimeters. Since this is the only available direct measurement of Mengele's head size, it is of interest to compare it with the skull from Embu. Several factors must be considered in making such a comparison. For example, in regard to the recorded head circumference, we need to know with what care and degree of precision it was taken and which technique was used. The physical examination in which Mengele's head circum\u00ad ference was recorded was made by an SS physician, Dr. W. Schwarzweller. It was performed prior to World War II, when recruiting standards for the SS were still extremely high and much emphasis was placed upon physical and, particularly, \"racial\" fitness. It thus seems reasonable to suppose that the measurement was taken with care. Also, as the applicant himself had some graduate training in physical anthropology, it is likely that he might have been quick to correct any error in technique on the part of his fellow physician. As it is cus\u00ad tomary to round circumferential measurements to the nearest centimeter, the recorded value of \"57 cm\" implies an accuracy of \u00b1 0.5 cm so that we may assume that the actual value was between 56.5+ and 57.4+ centimeters. The measurement under consideration is roughly equivalent to the standard tailoring measure of \"hat size\": a tape is passed around the subject's head at the level of the maximum circumference of the cranial vault. German anthropometrists of the period followed the practice recommended by Martin (1928): Horizontalumfang des Kopfes: Umfang annahernd den Nullpunkt des Bandma~es mit der linken Hand auf der Glabella fest, ftihrt es mit der kammt. 16 1 .\" This differs from that specified by most non-German . anthropometric protocols (e.g. Hrdlicka 1939, Hooten 1946, Olivier 1963, 'Hertzeberg ~ al 1963) in that in the latter, the tape is passed over the forehead at a level just superior to the qlabellar eminence (Garrett & Kennedy 19'71) and thus do not include the supraorbital ,ridges. A review of the literature failed to reveal any studies comparing the two techniques, but one would expect that head circumferences measured according to Martin's method, by including the supraorbital ridges, would yield slightly larger values. Viewed from above, the huma~ head is roughly ovoid in form. Contributing mostly to the overall size and shape of this ovoid is the bony cranial vault of the skull. Overlying the bone is the scalp, which contributes its thickness to head circumference. Scalp thickness, which has been measured by a variety of techni\u00ad ques (see below), may vary with age, sex, nutritional status and, also, from one region of the head to another. The sub\u00adject's hair is included in the measurement but its effect on the circumference is negligible unless it is exceptionally abundant or \"springy\". Judging from his photographs submitted as part of his physical examination, Mengele's hair at this time was cut to medium length and in his report, Dr. Schwartzweller classified it as \"schlichtweitwellig\" (sleek-wavy). Hair of this amount and form would not contribute significantly to the head circumference value, so its effect will be ignored in the following analysis. Table I summarizes the data from three anthropometric sur\u00ad veys (Grunhofer & Kroh 1975, Jurgens et al 1970, 1972) on West German military populations of the post-World War II period. Assuming that there has been no significant secular change in head circumference dimensions among German males since Mengele was measured the recorded value of 57 cm was very close to the average. Table I also provides comparative data for 1,985 mili\u00adtary men from 17 South American and Central American countries who were measured while attending the Inter-American Air Forces Academy in the Canal Zone between 1965 and 1970 (Dobbins & Kindrick 1972). In keeping with their smaller body size, the head circumference means for these men slightly over 2 cm smaller than their German counterparts. Mengele's recorded head circumference of 57 cm coincides with the 90th percentile value of these Latin American subjects or, stated differently, only about one in ten males of the general Latin American population would have a head circumference of this value or over. This fact is of interest since it suggests that Mengele, if he wished to stage his disap\u00ad pearance by substituting a body in the Embu grave, would have had some difficulty of procuring one closely matching his known head circumference from the local population. 17 1 J , TABLE I HEAD CIRCUMFERENCES OF GERMAN AND LATIN AMERICAN MILITARY MALES (Post-World War II) SURVEY Aviators 20 Yr Olds 25-40 Yr 01ds MEAN S.D 57.04 1.44 57.00 1.60 57.30 56.1 57.1 58.1 1970, 1972. Latin American data: Dobbins & Kindrick 1972. Among the measurements taken on the Ernbu skull, two are of interest in this analysis. These are Glabella-Opisthocranion Length (GOL) and Maximum Cranial Breadth (XCB) which are defined as follows: 1. Glabella-Opisthocranion Length (GOL): The maximum midsaggital length of the cranial vault. Measured with the spreading calipers between glabella (g), the anteriormost midline point on the frontal bone and opisthocranion (\u00a3E), the point on the occipital bone most distal to glabella in the midline. 2. Maximum Cranial Breadth (XCB): The maximum trans\u00ad verse breadth of the cranial vault. Measured with the spreading calipers between the right and left euryon (eu), the .lateral-most point of the parietal bone. - The Embu skull had been buried for six. years when examined in 1985 and, therefore, had undergone the slight shrinkage normally observed in most bones during skeletonization (Broca 1868, Czekanowski 1907). In an extensive series of experiments during which skulls were measured during the several stages of skeleton\u00ad ization, Todd (1925, 1926) found the the GOL measurement was reduced by 0.9% during skeletonization and the XCB measurement by o 8 percent .. 18 The thickness of the scalp over various anatomical landmarks has been measured directly on cadavers (His 1895, Kollmann & BUchly 1898, Rhine & Moore 1982); in the living by radiographic studies (Edelmann 1938, Gerassimow 1955) and, more recently, by ultrasound measurement (Helmer, 1984). Data from the latter study will be used here because the ultrasound technique not only provides more precision in the measurement of skin depth but also, the study gives data on German male subjects in the same general age of Mengele at the time his head circumference was measured. The scalp thicknesses of interest in the present analysis are those over the anatomical landmarks used in taking the cranial measurements from which the estimate of antemortem head circum\u00ad ference must be derived. Thus the thickness of the scalp over the anterior and posterior landmarks, glabella and opisthocranion, must be added to the cranial length measurement (GaL). Similarly, the cranial breadth measurement must be increased by amount equi\u00ad valent to the thickness of the scalp over the right and left euryon landmarks. Helmer'\u00b7s scalp thickness data for these land\u00ad marks in a series of 13 German males in the 20-29 year age range is shown below: TISSUE THICKNESS IN MM POINT 95% confidence Mean ---limits Glabella (g) Opisthocranion (op) Euryon (eu) 5.7 5.5 6.0 5.5-6.5 4.5-6.0 5.5-6.8 From the above data, it is possible to estimate the ante\u00ad mortem (am) values of these dimensions from their postmortem (pm) values. Thus, for Glabella-Opisthocranion Length, the formula is: GOL,am = GOL,pm * (l+%sk) + (g+op) mm = 182 * 1.009 + 11.2 mm = 194.8 rom and, XCB,am = XCB,pm * (1+%sk) + (2*eu) mm = 146 * 1.008 + 12.0 mm = 159.2 mm where, am and pm denote antemortem and postmortem values %sk = % shrinkage during skeletonization g = scalp thickness at glabella op = scalp thickness at opisthocranion eu = scalp thickness at euryon 19 ! , I I i I From the above estimates, antemortem head circumference can be calculated by means of a multi~le regression equation predic\u00adting head circumference from head length and breadth. The equa\u00adtion used here was derived from data of the 1967 anthropometric survey of 2,024 United States Air Force (USAF) flying personnel (Webb Associates 1967). This study was selected because its sub\u00adjects were young Caucasoid males (median age = 28.3 yrs.), who were commissioned officers or officer candidates at the time they were measured. Also, as all were either rated pilots and navi\u00ad gators or had been selected for flight training at the time they were measured, they had previously passed the demanding physical examinations required for aviation flying personnel. Most were college graduate$ or had several years of college and came from the middle- to upper-middle class socioeconomic background from which the USAF largely drew its flying officer personnel during this period. Thus, in respects to race, age, health, educational and socioeconomic background, they represent a sample of young males similar in these respects to Mengele who was 27.7 years old at the time of his SS physical examination, a university graduate and who was from a similar socioeconomic background. Addition\u00ad aily, intercorrelational data facilitating the calculation of the multiple regression equation is available for the USAF Flying Personnel study (Churchill 1978). The multiple regression equation derived from the USAF Flying Personnel data is: CIRC = A(GOL.am) + B(XCB,am) = 57.30 \u00b1 0.58 cm The last term in the above equation (\u00b10.58) is the standard error of the estimate. This statistic expresses the probability of error inherent in the predictive equation. Thus, about 95% of the subjects with the calculated cranial length and breadth measure\u00ad ments of the Embu skull would have head circumferences within a range of \u00b1 2 standard errors of the estimate. This range is: 57.30 \u00b1 (2*0.58) cm or, 56.14 -58.46 cm SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 1. Mengele's head circumference was recorded as 57 ern in 1938. Assuming the measurement was rounded (as is customary) to the nearest centimeter, this implies an actual measurement of 56.5+ to 57.4+ cm. 20 2. Comparison with head circumference data on German post-World War II military populations the measurement of 57 cm places Mengele very close to the average for German military males (57.08 \u00b1 1.54cm). 3. Corrected for postmortem shrinkage and soft tissue thickness, the living head dimensions of the Embu individual are esti\u00ad mated at 159.2 mm for Maximum Breadth and 194.8 mm for Maximum Length. 4. From a multiple regression equation derived from USAF anthro\u00ad pometric data, the living Head Circumference of the Embu in\u00ad dividual is estimated at 57.30 \u00b1 .58 cm. 5. The above estimate is consistent with Josef Mengele's recorded head circumference of 57 centimeters. 21 , BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES ..

FORENSIC RADIOLOGY This report is based upon the radiographs (Exhibit M) of the skeleton exumed at Embu. The Brazilian case is 4096-85. The radiographs have numbers of 396 and 381. Some films were not numbered. The difference in the num\u00ad bers is that films numbered 381 were not dated and were taken prior to films labeled 386. Radiographs were taken under the direction of Dr. Luis Bulelho de Melo. ~ll of the films were examined by me. However, there are two panorex films and one AP of the femur which were not duplicated. The panorex films were taken by the den\u00adtal team. These two panorex films are not included in my report. However the skull films show the findings. ~ll of the films were reviewed including those of ex\u00adcellent quality and of poor quality_ ~ll of those of poor quality have repeat examinations with much better techni\u00ad que. Unless otherwise specified, the films were taken on 14 June 1985. Some of the bones are mislabeled as to right and left. This involves mainly the clavicles and hand. These discrepancies were discussed with the.~thropologists. The radiographs will be reported as they are labeled. Some of the discrepancies are noted. SKULL FILMS FROM JUNE 14, 1985: There are two sets of an ~P, lateral and submental vertex_ The petrous bone is superimposed by the lower half of the orbits. The facial bones, zygoma, nasal, ethmoid, maxillary bones are absent. There is a 15mm occipital exostosis present. The mastoids and visualized sinuses appear normal. The frontal sinus and part of the ethmoids are absent. MAXILL~, RIGHT ZYGOM~, PART OF THE FRONT~ SINUS AND N~S~L BONE: There are two right teeth and one left. The left zygoma shows a 14mm x 10mm irregular oval defect with three linear dense lines corresponding to the defect seen on the gross specimen. Periosteal bone decay is not seen on any of the films. The anatomical specimen shows this and the anterior maxillary wall to have a rust color. A similiar stain was seen on the clothes of the victim. X-rays of the clothes show similar circular lines present. 25 -ENTIRE SKULL (AFTER THE FACIAL BONES HAVE BEEN RECON\u00ad STRUCTED AND THE UPPER AND LOWER BRIDGE AND TEETH HAVE BEEN REPLACED): Frontal bossing is present. A 3mm diastoma is pre\u00ad sent in the maxillary bone. Again noted is the circular artifact of the left zygoma. There is a segmental frac\u00ad ture of the right zygoma which is post mortem. AP & LATERAL CERVICAL SPINE: Seven cervical vertebrae are present. There is slerosis about the disc spaces with osteophyte formation present. Similar changes are noted in the joints of Luschka and the apophyseal joints, particularly in the mid and lower cervical spine. C3, 4 and 5 spinous pro\u00ad cesses are absent. THORACIC SPINE (TWO FILMS AP & LATERAL, JUNE 14, 1985): There are twelve vertebral bodies and one posterior element present. Tl and T2 are the only ones with trans\u00ad verse processes. Tl has the entire spine. T2 has part of the spine. practically all of the pedicles and posterior spinous elements are absent. \u00b7Some small spurs are scat\u00ad tered throughout the spine. There is sclerosis in the vertebrae about one of the disc spaces. Several Schrnorl's nodes are present. LUMBAR SPINE -AP, LATERAL & OBLIQUES: There are two lumbar spine fi~s as well as a second fi~ and some large film of the sacrum. The lumbar spine films include an AP, lateral and both obliques. There is sclerosis of the vertebral bodies adjacent to the L2 disc spaces. There are osteophytes present at L3 and L4 anter\u00adiorly and laterally. SACRUM & LATERAL OF THE SACRUM ON JUNE 14, 1985: This time the sacrum is glued together. The film, number 234567890, includes the lumbar spine and the sym\u00ad physis pubis. On this film, the sacrum is fragmented secondary to postmortem fractures. Most of the posterior spinous elements are absent as well as a portion of .the T2-3 anterior vertebral bodies. The lateral portion of the sacrum is also present. INNOMINATE BONE: The superior and inferior pelvic rami have postmortem fractures. Healed fractures are not seen. On the right, there is a small healed posterior lip fracture of the acetabulum and a vertical fracture extending through the 26 i \"Z:~ ... = _' I .....,; acetabulum but not into the anterior or posterior columns. Callous.formation is seen. This corresponds to the gross specimen consisting of a posterior lip and partial anter\u00adior column fracture. An 18 x 28mm exostosis is present extending laterally above the right acetabulum. Small elliptical area of .sclerosis is seen within the callous formation of the right acetabulum. The left acetabulum has an exostosis approximately 8 x lOmm inferiorly. AP PELVIC BONE AND AP HIPS: Slight irregularity of the right articular surface of the hip is present. Minimal degenerative changes are noted. The pelvis is that of a male. FEMURS: The proximal articular surface of both femurs show slight irregularity of the cortex with a small osteophyte present. Exostosis are present at the attachment of both greater tuberosities. Changes are greater on the right than on the left. The distal articular cartilage is relatively unremarkable. There is some spurring present at the attachments of the tendons of the condyles. The right femur is shorter than the left by 1 cm. AP AND LATERAL LOWER LEGS ON ONE FILM: Film was taken on June 14, 1985. An artifact is present overlying the right femur in the subtrochanteric area. The distal lateral malleolus is absent. No abnor\u00admalities are otherwise identified. AP OF THE PATELLAS: No significant abnormality is identified. There is some slight irregularity to the surface of the patella distally. FEET: RIGHT FOOT -ONE FILM, AP & LATERAL: . The 2nd through 5th middle and distal phalanges and the three proximal phalanges are present. In the head of the 1st metatarsal are two small cystic changes medially. There is slight widening of the lstmetatarsal at the neck. The articular surface appears relatively unremark\u00ad able. The first proximal phalanx shows a small spur laterally and a portion of the cortex absent medially. These changes are along the distal cortex. 27 1 J I I FIVE VIEWS OF THE LEFT FOOT TAKEN ON JUNE 14 AND 18, 1985: All of the proximal ph~langes are present. The first distal phalanx is present. There are what appears to be two middle phalanges present. No significant bony abnor\u00ad malities\"are present. RIGHT AND LEFT RIBS: Bilaterally, 12 ribs are present with portions of them absent. There are multiple fractures present which are postmortem. STERNUM INCLUDING A PORTION OF THE COSTAL CARTILAGE WHICH IS ATTACHED. DISTALLY TO THE STERNUM AND IS \"U\" SHAPED AND PARTIALLY CALCIFIED: The left fossa for the sternoclavicular joint is smaller than normal with moderate osteophytes present an\u00ad teriorly. The articular surface is slightly irregular. CLAVICLES AND SCAPULA: There are two large films that include both the small and four smaller films including multiple views of the scapula. There is asymmetry between the sternal ends of both clavicles with the left having some degenerative changes. The acromial process of the left clavicle is present. There is an area of sclerosis with a lucent line seen on the base of the spine. SINGLE FILM OF THE RIGHT AND LEFT ARMS, FOREARMS, AS WELL AS TWO FILMS SHOWING CONE DOWN VIEWS OF THE PROXIMAL AND DISTAL PORTION OF THE RIGHT HUMERUS: On the left side, the head of the radius is absent. No sclerosis is present. Portions of the distal articular surfaces of both humeri are absent. These are postmortem changes. LEFT HAND AND FOUR VIEWS OF THE FIRST METACARPAL PHALANX AND 5TH METACARPAL PRESENT: Only five of the carpal bones are present. The second through fifth distal phalanges are absent. There is a healed fracture of the neck of the first metacarpal. The articular surface shows minimal irregularity. On the entire hand film, the first metacarpal is upside down. There is a small cystic area present in the region of the neck of the fourth middle phalanx. The margins are scler\u00adotic and sharp. There is a slight ground-glass appearance to it. Minimal degenerative changes are present on the distal articular surfaces of the third and fourth middle phalanges. 28 RIGHT HAND: There are four carpal bones plus 11 phalanges and metacarpal bones. Most of the heads and bases of the phalanges are present. At the second excavation, more. phalanges were found but these were not radiographed. X~RAYS OF THE CLOTHES: . The clothes had a brown pigment on them symmetri\u00ad cally located. Radiographs of these areas show circu- . lar rings of metallic densities. This is similar to the findings on the zygoma.

Lateral Right Tibia and Fibula The upper halves are not well seen because the film is over exposed. The lower portions are better visualized and appear normal. 30 IV. FORENSIC ODONTOLOGY: Among the skeletal remains at the Institute of Legal Medicine are a detached maxilla and a mandible. Further examination reveals that the maxilla was originally frac\u00ad tured in the course.of the exhumation. The dental description: 24--no incisal tooth All missing teeth except third molars are replaced by removable partial dentures of chrome colored metal and acrylic. (Exhibits D-10, D-l1, D-12, D-13 & D-14) 31 37 o Remarkable features: 1. An extremely wide incisive canal (Exhibits D-14 & D-1S) and ~~ost non-union of the hard palate. (Exhibit D-16) 2. An antral defect of the left side of the zygoma and maxilla is seen. (Exhibits D-4 & D-17) 3. The mesial amalgam rest seat area appears to be re\u00ad lieved to accommodate the rest of the partial denture on #3, upper right first molar. This suggests the restoration and/or root canal was done after the par\u00adtial was made. (Exhibit D-lO) Comparison: Only the 1938 SS physical dental examination re- cord is available for comparison.

ON MARCH 21, CONSUL GENERAL, POLOFF, AND BRAZILI.AN FEDERAL POLICE AGENT ANTONIO GAMA ROOT PAULO NEIGHBOR\u00ad HOOD OF SANTO AMARO. GAMA DID NOT REMEMBER TREATING ANYONE FITTING THE DESCRIPTION OF JOSEF MENGELE. HE DID ALLOW US, HOWEVER, TO EXAMINE ALL OF HIS DENTAL CHARTS. WE FOUND THE CHART OF PEDRO HOCHBICHLER WHO RECEIVED TREATMENT OF AN UPPER POSTERIOR TOOTH ON DECEMBER 6, 11, 13, AND 18, 1978. GAMA SAID HE NEVER KEEPS X-RAYS BUT RETURNS THEM TO HIS PATIENTS TO TAKE BACK TO THEIR REGULAR DENTISTS. 2. HOCHBICHLER WAS REFERRED TO GAMA BY DR. KASUMASA TUTIYA, ALSO OF SANTO AMARO. WE WENT TO TUTIYA I S OFFICE. TUTIYA HAD A DENTAL CHART OF PEDRO HOCHBICHLER SHOWING TREATMENT FROM MARCH 25, 1976, TO JANUARY 3, 1978. TUTIYA HAD EIGHT X-RAYS IN AN ENVELOPE MARKED PEDRO HOCHBICHLER. TUTIYA RECOGNIZED A PHOTO\u00ad GRAPH OF MENGELE. HE REMEMBERED PARTICULARLY THE MOUSTACHE AND COMMENTED THAT THE PATIENT OFTEN WORE A HAT. 3. THE DENTAL CHARTS AND X-RAYS ARE NOW IN THE CUSTODY OF THE FEDERAL POLICE IN SAO PAULO. BOTH GAMA AND TUTIYA WILL BE SCHEDULED TO DEPOSE THE WEEK OF MARCH 24. DACHI BT 34 ANALYSIS OF THE DENTAL EVIDENCE RE: JOSEF MENGELE On June 21, 1985 the international panel of forensic scientists delivered reports to Dr. Romeu Tuma, Superintendent, Federal Police in Sao Paulo, Brazil, stating that the skeleton exhumed on June 6, 1985, at Nossa Senhora Do Rosario Cemetery, Embu, Brazil, (Case No. 4096-85) and examined at the Medical Legal Institute of Sao Paulo, is that of Josef Mengele, \"within a reasonable scientific certainty\". The basis of that opinion was an analysis of all the available evidence including a dental chart and facial photo\u00ad graphs contained in the 1938 SS Personnel File brought to Brazil from the Berlin Document Center. On March 21, 1986, additional dental evidence became avail\u00ad able for analysis including: Dental Chart of Dr. Hercy Gonzaga Gama Angelo, Santo Amaro, Sao Paulo, Chart of Dr. Kasumasa Tutiya, Santo Amaro, Sao Paulo Brazil, labelled, envelope of Dr. Kasumasa TUtiya, Santo Amaro, Sao Paulo, Brazil, labelled, \"Pedro Hochbichlertl, seized by Agent Antonio Devisati Sobrinho of the Brazilian Federal Police in the presence of u.S. Consul General Stephen Dachi and Vice Consul Fred Kaplan. I personally interviewed the dentists to authenticate the evidence. Dr. Carlos Valerio, Forensic Odontologist, Institute of Legal Medicine of Sao Paulo (IML) has in his custody six (6) periapical dental x-ray films which I recognize as having been made on the skeleton examined by me at IML in June 1985 and identified as the, \"skeleton exhumed at EMBU\". I am able to compare a 35mm color slide of the x-ray films taken in June 1985 and they are identical. Valerio Film Compares with Tutiya Film Upper Incisor ...............

Radiographically the 'ske.leton is absolutely the dental patient who identified himself as Pedro Hochbichler and is ac\u00ad tually Josef Mengele based upon the scientific comparisons by all the forensic disciplines and modalities. A lone issue should be addressed: Is there anything in the 1938 odontogram which precludes the possibility that Hochbichler is Mengele? NO!!! The 1938 odontogram shows all molars present and filled, two upper first bicuspids missing, and all other teeth present. The Tutiya dental chart seemingly shows an upper left first bicuspid marked for extraction. In actual fact the two x-ray films which show the,upper left bicuspid area CSE and MSE show a hard tissue fragment in soft tissue of the first bicuspid area. This fragment, even if it could be identified as a first bicus\u00ad pid root tip would not preclude the skeleton being Josef Mengele because it is quite possible that a root tip was broken during extraction of the first bicuspid and when the odontogram was drawn no evidence of a bicuspid was visualized. There are numerous additional possibilities involving the fragment, none of which would preclude the skeleton being Mengele and no ob- jective evidence such as x-rays. -- 36 Noma p ~ ~ \" ~ II,.. ,. ,,~,. r 1. 1(' \" I N~ Resid~ncia C s {..

There is a broken emulsion in that area and just a small portion may be interpreted. *8 -Dr .. Tutiya' s Chart indicates 112 for extraction. Tooth #12 on t~e chart is actually a fragment in soft tissue whose origin can not be positively identified from its morphology. The presence of the fragment in that area does not exclude the possibility that the skeleton is Mengele because 112 marked as missing in the 1938 SS Chart is interpreted as one of the two premolars on the upper left side was missing during examination and charting in 1938. Taking the hypothesis that i12 was the tooth that was in fact missing this fragment could represent a root tip from #12 fractured and retained during the extraction procedure. It also courd repre\u00ad sent a root tip from 113, or even a fragment of #11 or #13 which was fractured from the complete carious breakdown of those teeth and lodged under the gingiva. 43 ~c;n -\" \",. \\ .. .! *9 - *10 *11 There is no x-ray film of the lower right however using Dr. Tutiya's treatment we can determine that teeth #'s 30, 31, 32 were missing in 1976.

ROMEU TUMA DIRECTOR GENERAL, BRAZrLIAN FEDERAL POLICE REGARDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE REMAINS OF JOSEF MENGELE 26 MARCH 1986 On 21 March 1986 the following items of dental evidence were seized by Agent Antonio Devisati.Sobrinho of the Brazilian Federal Police in the presence of u.s. Consul General Stephen Dachi and Vice Consul Fred Kaplan: ITEM 1 ITEM 2 ITEM 3 Dental chart of Dr. Hercy Gonzaga Gama Angelo, Santo Amaro, Sao Tutiya, Santo .Amaro, Sao Paulo, labelled, Kasumasa Tutiya, Santo Amaro, Sao Paulo, labelled, \"Pedro Hochbichler\", and containing eight (8) periapical x-ray films labelled, \"( 4) CID, (4) CIE, (4 )MIE, (6) CSD, (6 )MSE, (6)CSE, and (6)MSD.\" I have examined items 1, 2, 3, and six (6) periapical x-xay films in the custody of Dr. Carlos Valerio, forensic odontolo\u00adgist at the Institute of Legal Medicine of Sao Paulo (IML), which I recognize as having been made on the skeleton examined by me in Sao Paulo in June 1985. The eight (8) x-rays (Item 3) seized by the Brazilian Federal Police on March 21, 1986, and identified a\u00b7s having been taken on Pedro Hochbichler (Josef Mengele) incident to dental treatment exhibit multiple, unique, and individual characteris\u00adtics and are of excellent quality for comparison purposes. Police photographs of Josef Mengele were identified at the time of the seizure of Items 2 and 3 by Dr. Tutiya as the patient whose chart (Item 2) and x-rays were seized (Item 3) to Agent Antonio Devisati Sobrinho in the presence of Consul General Dachi and Vice Consul Kaplan. I have compared the Dr. Tutiya x-rays (Item 3) with the x-rays taken of the skeletal remains examined at IML in June 1985, and in the custody of Dr. Valerio (six periapical films). 46 It is my op~n~on that the skeleton identified by an inter\u00ad national panel of forensic scientists as Josef Mengele with reasonable scientific certainty may now be identified as Josef Mengele with an absolute certainty. Comparison of the dental evidence (charts and x-rays) of the skeleton with the dental evidence (Items 1, 2, and 3) of the living patient (Pedro Hochbichler/Josef Mengele) reveal multi\u00ad ple, unique, and individual characteristics and no inconsistent characteristics. Lowell J. Levine, D.D.S. Consultant Office of Special Investigations u.S. Department of Justice Washington, D.C. 47 Dr. Carlos F. Valerio Forensic Odontologist Institute of Legal Medicine Secretariat of Public Security, Sao Paulo, Brazil I t L v. FORENSIC PATHOLOGY: A. CLOTHING: The clothing (ExhibitD-19) consists of the following: 1. A light blue color sleeveless front part of a shirt, with areas of brownish discoloration. The circum\u00ad ference of the shirt, around the lower axilla, is 110 ems. 2. A pair of light brown (tan) color trousers. The total length is 107.5 ems. The length from the crotch area is 80 ems . The ci\u00b7rcumference of the thigh is 60 ems. The manufacturing label has been deteriorated. The waist line measures 96 ems. The circumference of the cuff is 52 ems. 3. A brownish color leather belt without buckle which measures 98 ems., for the waist area. 4. A pair of mid-calf size tan color socks. 5. The underwear consists of jockey shorts. The cir\u00ad cumference of the elastic portion of the shorts is 66 ems. 6. Exhibit N shows the front view diagrams of the shirt and the underwear which reveal the locations of rust color deposits on the clothing. X-rays of these two pieces of clothing exhibit light radio\u00ad opaque corresponding spots, consistent with iron deposits (rust). We have been informed by the Federal Police of Sao Paulo that Mr. and Mrs. Bossert were present at the time of exhumation of the body. Mrs. Bossert identified the clothing on the body at the grave site. Mrs. Bossert was later brought to the Insti\u00adtute of Legal Medicine where she identified to us the items of the clothing to be those that she pre\u00ad pared and had them put on the body of Josef Mengele at the time of burial in February of 1979. B. The skeletonized remains reveal no evidence of soft tissue except for presence of tiny fragments of scalp, thin and dried out, with grayish color hair (Exhibit D-3). The loose scalp hair measures about 5 to 7 ems. in length. 48 --,.\u00ad.:.. ' .... 0-c. The skeleton is that of a caucasoid male, estimated age of 60-75 years, 17.5 cms. in height, right handed. D. No evidence of any antemortem cranial injuries is noted. E. Postmortem fractures of the facial bones are seen except for the mandible. (Exhibit D-4). F. A roundish defect of the left anterior zygoma (Exhibit D-17), about 8 mms.in diameter, is noted with concen\u00adtric rust color deposits on the margin, where several hair shaft-like fibers are imbedded. This defect ex\u00ad tends into the left maxillary sinus space, where it shows a hard and calcified-like material sealing the defect from the sinus cavity itself. There is no ob\u00ad vious gross inflammatory reaction with the maxillary sinus. Microscopic examination of a slide, prepared from the edge of this defect in Brazil, reveals dead bony tissue. The underlying cause of this defect can not be determined. However, it probably represents an antemortem lesion. G. The maxilla retains three teeth with amalgam fillings and shows presence of a partial denture. There is a distinct gap between the right and left hard palates (Exhibi t D-15) ,. The mandible retains seven teeth showing two gold veneer crowns and a partial lower denture (Exhibits D-8 & D-9). H. The external end of the right clavicle appears deformed, consistent with a possible old fracture/dislocation. I. A non-union fracture of the base of the spine of the right scapula is observed (Exhibit D-20). J. The spinal column shows mild to moderate degenerative changes. These findings are more prominent in the lumbar area, especially the lower lumbar vertebrae (Exhibit D-2l). K. There is evidence of an old healed fracture of the right innominate bone with the fracture line extending through the acetabulum (Exhibit D-22). There is a narrowing of the articular surface with a prominent, elevated, irreg\u00adular, roughly rectangular prism shape exostosis, located superior and lateral to the fossa (Exhibit D-23). L. There is evidence of some osteoarthritic changes involv\u00ad ing the cartilaginous surface of the head of the right femur. 49 -,... I' <. . \", '-II , f '1 i M. N. o. P. There is a small exostosis located on the anterior as\u00ad pect of the neck of the right femur. A deformity of the neck of the right fir~t metacarpal bone is noted, indicative of an old trauma. No evidence of obvious disease or injury is observed in the long bones of the upper and lower extremities. Various parts of skeletal remains show postmortem frag\u00ad mentation either due to the decay of burial and/or the exhumation process. 50 VI. DISCUSSION The medical history of Josef Mengele, as recorded in the .Berlin documents, reveals that he had, \"right inguinal of \"ingUinal hernia operation\" cannot be confirmed or ruled out since the soft tissues are no longer present. The osteomyelitis is mentioned in his geneology paper. There are also two living witnesses, in accordance with the information from the u.s. Department of Justice, who have made reference to the osteomyelitis. The first witness, a physician, was a medical school classmate of Josef Mengele. Originally he stated that the osteomyelitis of J.M. was \u00b7very severe. The witness stated that J.M. had a sequestrum and was operated upon. He could not re\u00adcall the location of the osteomyelitis or the sequestrum. In a second interview, however, he indicated that he was not sure about the sequestrum. He still could not remember the location of the osteomyelitis. This witness also indicated that he thought that Mengele had amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is not con\u00adsistent with 50 years survival. Patients with amyloidosis usually die within a short period of time. However, patients with amyloidosis secondary to osteomyelitis are known to have long survivals. . The second witness is a physician who became acquainted ' with Mengele after the war while they were in a P.o.w. camp. They talked about their osteomyelitis. This witness remembered that Mengele's osteomyelitis was very mild and that there was not a sequestrum. Furthermore, he indicated that the osteomye\u00adlitis was in Mengele's right hip area. The right hip is the same region that anatomical and radiographic bone changes are identified. The fact remains that there exists nothing specific as to how the diagnosis of osteomyelitis was made, the severity and the location of this disease or any other clinically documented information. Therefore, the diagnosis of osteomyelitis is ques\u00ad tioned and cannot be used either for the purpose of positive identification or for the exclusion (Exhibits K & L). In his Curriculum Vitae J.M. states he had nephritis. He withdrew from S.A. because of a kidney ailment. He probably had some kind of renal disease. If the nephritis was severe, he would not have survived for a long period of time. Mild neph\u00adritis is consistent with long survival. However, there is no way to confirm the renal disease because the body is skeleton\u00adized. 51 ~QQ. -'\" v I I I f I A , His record indicates that he had a motorcycle accident in Auschwitz. He is also known to have had, \"war-time injuries.\" The skeleton shows an old fracture of the right innominate bone, injury to the right sternoclavicular region, and a healed frac\u00ad ture of the right thumb. This skeletal evidence, while com\u00ad patible with the above history, cannot be used either for iden\u00adtification or exclusion as there is nothing specific linking the history with the injuries. The files from the Berlin Document Center indicate that Josef Mengele was a male, caucasian, 174 cm. in height and born on March 11, 1911. His head circumfer~nce was 57 cm. Examination of the skeleton, exhumed in Brazil, indicates a caucasoid male between 64-74 years at the time of death with a stature of 173.5 cm. The living head circumference of the skeleton is estimated at 57.3 cm. The age of Josef Mengele at the time of his death in February of 1979 was 68. The skeleton was right hand as was J.M. The Berlin dental records reveal fillings in both right and left mandibular and maxillary molar teeth. The records do not give specifics of the type and exact location of the fillings but merely indicate their presence. The skeletal molars that remain show fillings which are consistent with the Berlin record. In June 1985, there were no inconsistencies in the dental findings of the skeleton compared with the Berlin dental records of Josef Mengele. His Berlin photo shows a diastema (wide gap) between the upper frontal teeth. The diastema is seen in a majority of cases when there is a wide incisor canal. The dental evidence of the skeleton consists of a-wide incisor canal, partial upper and lower dentures and root canal work done shortly before death. Although the facial bones were damaged during the exhuma\u00ad tion, reconstruction of the face was accomplished using accepted archaeological techniques. The observed wide incisonal canal is a real finding and not the result of the exhumation damage to the skeleton. This is based upon the following: Partial den\u00ad tures are unique to each individual. A dentist, in fitting a partial denture to a patient's gums and remaining teeth, must grind and drill teeth in order to fit and rest the partial den\u00ad ture. This fitting is what makes the partial denture unique. The partial dentures perfectly fit the skeletal teeth. A par\u00adtial denture may act as a template for reconstruction of the jaw. The skeletal denture precisely fits the teeth of the reconstructed jaws, the maxilla has a wide incisor canal. The diastema is a true finding. Diastema occurs in 5-7% of cauca\u00ad soid. J.M.'s diastema is extremely wide. 52 Subsequent conclusive dental-identification was made in March of 1986 when dental records and x-rays on Pedro Hochbichler (Josef Mengele) were discovered and compared with dental eviden~e of the skeleton and the Berlin documents. A series of twelve photos were used for photo-photo com\u00ad parison. Ten were photos of Mengele/Gerhard living in Sao Paulo and taken by Mr. Bossert. They were compared with the close up frontal and profile photos of J.M. in Berlin documents. The comparison showed all the photos to be the same individual. This photo comparison was done by a German specialist and re\u00ad viewed by the teams of international scientists (Exhibit 0). These photos were then used for skull photo superimposi\u00adtion. One TV camera was focused on the photo. A second TV camera was focused on the skull. Images were then transmitted into a TV monitor which had both vertical and horizontal ras\u00ad tors. These linear rastors permitted real-time interchanging and superimpositioning of the skull on the photo. The frontal sinus, supraorbital ridges, malar bones and occiput were espeC\u00adially noteworthy points, although there were many other areas of comparison. These skull landmarks did fit the photos. The superimposition study was carried out by the German team, observed and confirmed by the u.s. teams (Exhibit Pl. In the coffin, grayish scalp hair as well as eyebrow hair were found. Hair found in his eyeglass casing is consistent with eyebrow hair found in the coffin. A team of American Questioned Document Examiners compared the diaries written by the man who lived in Sao Paulo as Hochbichler/Mengele/Gerhard with documents written by Josef Mengele and kept in Berlin files. They found these documents not to be a forgery and all written by the same person. In November 1972, Josef Mengele's diary refers to x-ray findings in the spine, \"considerable changes in L3/L4, spondy\u00adlitic arthropathy and defect of the disc.\" Examination of the skeleton reveals osteoarthritis in spine especially the lumbar vertebrae. His diary further refers to pain in his right scapular region. On October 21, 1978, he wrote, \"sharp pain in the right subclavicular region upward.\" On October 25th he wrote, \"after a little work sharp pain in the familiar place, upper half of spina scapula ,\" October 26th, \"even when writing, the muscle over the shoulder blade hurts \". On.October 28th he wrote, \"the pain is concentrating in the depression of the upper half of the shoulder blade and in the neck muscles.\" Examination of the right scapular bone shows a non-healing fracture of the base of its spine. 53 I I I I His diary also reveals that on December 5th, 1978, he went to his dentist who referred him to a root canal specialist whom he visited the next day. The skeleton reveals that the root canal work was done recently on tooth number 3, definitely after the dentures were made. Thus, through his diaries and examination of the spine, the scapula, and the dentition, we have evidence that connects the man who lived in Sao Paulo to the body exhumed in Embu, Brazil. Although the testimonies of the Bosserts and Mrs. Stanuner were not taken into consideration when we arrived at our con\u00ad clusions, nevertheless, they were consistent with our findings of the skeletal examination and the information available in the Berlin Document Center. Mrs. Stanuner testified that, \"Mengele had a gap between his upper teeth; he was about 174 cm. tall and had brown eyes with a greenish tinge.\" The Berlin documents show that he had a dia\u00ad stema and was 174 cm. tall with greenish light brown eyes. The testimony of Mrs. Stammer is consistent with physical character\u00adistics of Josef Mengele. The Bosserts testified that Mengele was 174-175 cm. tall, had dentures, and ate little meat. Eating little meat is a diet that someone with a history of renal disease may have to follow. Mrs. Bossert also stated that Mengele had a gold crown on a left lower tooth. The skeletal dentition has a gold crown in the left lower jaw. The Bosserts and Mrs. Stanuner testified that Mengele had periodic swelling in the left side of his face for which he used hot compresses. The skeleton reveals a defect in the left zygoma. One of the dental x-rays discovered in March of 1986 reveals a large lesion around the apex of #11 which appears to communicate with the left antrum. In her initial testimony, Mrs. Bossert described the clothes in which the body was buried. She subsequently identified, at the Institute of Legal Medicine, the clothing recovered from the grave. The remains exhumed in Embu, Brazil, were definitely not those of Wolfgang Gerhard. He was involved in an automobile accident, died in a neurological hospital, and was buried in Austria in 1978 (Exhibit D-24). Wolfgang Gerhard was 188 centi\u00ad meters tall (Exhibit J) while Josef Mengele measured 174 centi\u00ad meters (Exhibit F, Page 10). 54 Based on\u00b7a complete review of the medical, dental, his\u00adtorical, documentary and investigative reports and the scien\u00adtific findings originating from our examination of the exhumed remains and the physical evidence as well as the dental records which became available in March, 1986, it is our considered opinion that: 1. The exhumed remains did not belong to Wolfgang Gerhard. 2. The probability of any two people having this many specific\u00b7points of agreement is virtually nil. 3. The remains exhumed at Embu Cemetery, near Sao Paulo, Brazil, were those of Doctor Josef Mengele. 55 J f CONSULTANTS, UNITED STATES MARSHALS SERVICE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Ali Z.

I EXCERPTS FROM INTERVIEW WITH GITTA STAMMER ~EFORE THE INTERNATIONAL FORENSIC SCIENTISTS INSTITUTE OF LEGAL MEDICINE SAO PAULO, BRAZIL 4:00 p.m., June 18, 1985 1. She had known Doctor Josef Mengele from 1961 to 1964; for the first two years as Peter Hochbuhlet and for the remainder of the time as Josef Mengele. In 1963 Mengele revealed his true identity to Mrs. Stammer, she said, following the publication of a picture of Mengele in a magazine. 2. Josef Mengele lived and worked\u00b7 on her farm and received no compensation. He periodically received money, apparently from Germany, through an unnamed person. 3. She knew Wolfgang Gerhard and had seen him with Josef Mengele. She described Wolfgang Gerhard as being much taller than Mengele. 4. She stated that Mengele told her that he received injuries during the war and had a broken and twisted right fifth finger. 5. Mengele apparently suffered from migraine, rheumatoid arthritis with swelling of the finger joints. 6. Mengele complained of toothache, but did not visit a dentist while with them; however, he went to a dentist after he left their farm. 7. Mengele was right-handed. 8. He was an old smoker but stopped smoking in his later years. 9. Mrs. Stammer described a condition from which he was suffering, probably thrombosed hemorrhoids, leading to his visit to a hospital. 10. Mengele had\u00b7 periodic swelling of the left side of the face, using hot towel compresses to relieve the swelling and pain. 11. She noted a gap between the upper median incisor teeth of Mengele. -2- . 12. She stated that while living on her farm, he did not show any upper or lower dentures. 13. She 'stated that Menge1e was about 175 ems. in height. 14. She said that Mengele told her that he previously lived in Argentina. He had a Spanish accent when he came to Brazil. 15. He had a long, about 10 cms., curved and depressed scar about the right waistline. 16. He spoke English at a high school level. 17. He apparently had a small heart attack, she said . 18. He had brown eyes with greenish tint. 19. She said Gerhard and his family left for Austria. 20. She was informed about Mengele's death by Bossert three days after his death. 21. Mengele left them when he became more independent as his Portuguese improved. It became impossible to live with him. She said Mengele moved out in 1974. 22. The Bosserts used to visit the Stammers while Mengele lived on their farm. 23. She said that he took aspirin and Neuralgine, but she is not aware of any medication coming from Germany. 24. She said that Mengele did not have diabetes. 25. When Mengele worked for a while, he had a back pain. 26. His left leg, up to the groin area, was thicker than the right leg. He was complaining about pain in his leg and told her that he had an infection in Paraquay. 27. He was slightly limping on the left side.' 28. She was not aware of any special shoes. 29. He ate fruits, soup, meat broth and drank lemonade and orange juice. He consumed no alcohol. : J 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. EXCERPTS FROM IN'rERVIEWS BY THE INTERNATIONAL FORENSIC TEAM WITH'MR. & MRS. BOSSERT INSTITUTE OF LEGAL MEDICINE SAO PAULO, BRAZIL 5:00 P.M. JUNE 19, 1985 The Bosserts met Mengele and Wolfgang Gerhard in early 1970. Mr. Bossert said Gerhard was much taller than Mengele. When Bossert saw Mengele after his moving with them, he had no gap between his upper teeth. Mengele had episodes of swelling of the left side of his face. He had a gold crown tooth on the left lower jaw, in accordance with Mrs. Bossert. He had a denture made during the last three years of his life. The dentist must have been located in the outskirts of Sao Paulo. They did not specifically know his dentist and they felt that their own dentist was too expensive for him. 8. Mengele did not own a car. 9. He used to go shopping in the neighborhood and probably did not go to a German dentist. 10. Mengele took the identity of Wolfgang Gerhard when Gerhard left for Austria. 11. Rolf Mengele visited Josef Mengele.twice. 12. Sedlemeyer sent a raincoat to Mengele. 13. Mr. Bossert recognized the man in the picture which was provided by the 'Brazilian Police Department to the International Forensic Team. In that picture Mengele had a hat and a,raincoat. The picture was identified by Mr. Bossert as being that of Josef Mengele. Mr. Bossert further indicated that he himself took the photo. I! r ,--2- 14. Mr. Bossert said that Mengele was about one to two centimeters shorter than he was. His own height was 176 ems., he said. Gerhard on the other hand was much taller than both Mengele and himself. 15. Mengele had swollen left leg. 16. Mrs. Bossert identified the body to the police as Wolfgang Gerhard. She made all the arrangements . for the burial. She stated that, before the burial took place in the cemetery, the superintendent of cemetery arrived and wanted to view the body because the body was going to be buried under the name of Wolfgang Gerhard next to the grave of Gerhard's mother. Since superintendent knew\u00b7 Mr. Gerhard he expressed a desire to view ~he body. Fearing that the superintendent would recognize the body not to be that of Gerhard, Mrs. Bossert said that she had to create a scene so that the viewing did not take place and the body was buried without being identified by the superin\u00ad tendent of the cemetery. 17. Mengele wished to be cremated. However, Mrs. Bossert could not arrange for a cremation since an authorization of the next of kin was required. 18. Mrs. Bossert indicated that she found about $10,000 among the belongings of Mengele. She apparently paid about $1,000 for funeral expenses and later offered, as she claimed, to return the balance of $9,000 to Rolf Mengele when he returned to Brazil six months after the death of his father. Mrs. Bossert indicated that Rolf declined to receive the money. 19. Mr. & Mrs. Bossert and the children .along with Mengele were at the beach where Mr. Bossert noticed Mengele developing difficulty in swimming. He said that Mengele appeared to have a problem with his left arm and left leg. At this point he attempted to rescue him. He had a great deal of difficulty to carry him out of the water. When finally he was able to take him to the shore, his family and a physician were present. Mr. Bossert himself was so exhausted as the result of rescue that he was \"out of breath\". While he was lying on the beach next to the body of Mengele he turned around and noticed a whitish foamy material exuding through Mengele's mouth. , I I I i I I , -3- 20. Mr. Bossert noticed no injury on Mengele. 21. Mengele apparently saw a urologist, but they did not know the physician's name. 22. Mrs. Bossert said that Mengele used to cut a piece of aluminum and. use it as an inlay in his shoe. 23. About a year and a half prior to his death, Mengele had a stroke for which he was hospitalized in Santa Maria Hospital. 24. He had swollen fingers. 25. He ate very little meat. 26. Mengele indicated that he wanted to have his hands on his sides when his body was to be placed in a coffin. 27. Mr. & Mrs. Bossert were present at the time of exhumation of the body and Mrs. Bossert recognized Mengele's clothing to be the same as she provided at the time of burial. ,. ...

Most of those specimens were gunshot wounds from the Civil War with varying degrees of infection that ranged from uninfected gunshot wounds to old, burned out, sclerosing osteomyelitis twenty years after the wound. Some cases of osteomyelitis had very minimal reactive bone response, while others had seques\u00ad tration of the entire shaft with massive involucra. Sequestra ranged from barely visible grain-sized bits of bone to entire long bone shafts. In addition, many specimens involved hemato\u00ad genous osteomyelitis. Some of those showed minimal bone alter\u00ad ation. All degrees of involvement were covered by the term \"osteomyelitis\" --sometimes including cases of only a mild periostitis. In these museum specimens some traces of osteo\u00ad myelitis could be detected for as long as twenty years after the original gunshot wound. It should be remembered that there was .. virtually no effective treatment at that time, nor any concept of antisepsis. Amputations and sequestrectomies often intro\u00ad duced additional infection rather than alleviating the existing one. In the case of Josef Mengele, we had only the recollections of Dr. Mengele himself as recorded in the Berlin Document Center files and as recounted to friends some years after he had the active condition as an adolescent. Various accounts have located this osteomyelitis in widely different parts of his body, including the lower left leg and upper right thigh. There were no radiographs, photographs, or detailed clinical descrip\u00ad tions to assist in the interpretation of the \"osteomyelitis\" that Dr. Mengele recalled having had. The fact that he was a physician is not particularly significant, as the condition was reported to have occurred during adolescence --long before he had any medical training. There is clear evidence of reparative bone formation in the right ilium of the Ernbu remains. This appears to have been an old, healed fracture of the right ilium just above and around the acetabulum and in the vicinity of the anterior inferior iliac spine, or tuberosity. It could have been diagnosed as osteomyelitis on the basis of the reparative bone in the area. ~ ,3 The absence of identifiable evidence of osteomyelitis in the skeleton identified as Josef Mengele should not be given undue importance or significance. There is no real description or any radiographs of the condition for comparison with the remains. More specific evidence of osteomyelitis in the living Mengele is necessary before there can be any discussion of the significance of there not being discernible evidence in a skeleton over 50 years after Dr. Mengele recalled having had \"osteomyelitis,\" while he had been an adolescent, much of whose bone would have been replaced by normal growth and remodeling by age sixty-nine. J I I 1 , , I . I OSTEOMYELITIS BY JOHN FITZPATRICK, M.D. The Brazilians, Germans and American scientists shared all information. During the identification process, we were aware that Josef Mengele1s 5.5. record indicated a history of osteo\u00admyelitis, sepsis and nephritis. We also had knowledge of state\u00ad ments by a witness that indicated a diagnosis of osteomyelitis, sequestration of bone, sequestrectomy and amyloidosis. TERMINOLOGY 1. Osteomyelitis is an infection in the bone cortex and marrow. 2. Infective (supperative) osteitis indicates contamination of the bone cortex. It may be an isolated phenomena or in con\u00ad junction with osteomyelitis. It can also be seen in nonin\u00ad fectious entities. 3. Infective (supperative) periosteitis implies contam~nation of periosteal cloak that surround the bone. It may lead to osteitis or osteomyelitis. However, periosteitis may be seen in noninfectious entities such as neoplastic, meta\u00ad bolic, inflammatory and traumatic disorders. 4. Soft tissue infection indicates contamination of the cutan\u00ad eous, subcutaneous, muscular, fascial, tendenous, ligamen\u00ad tous, and bursal structures. Soft tissue infection can lead to inflammation of the periosteal tissue (periostitis) with\u00ad out necessarily implying contamination. 5. Articular infection implies an infection of the joint. All of the above things could be misdiagnosed as osteomye\u00adlitis. Also, there are anatomical variants that can be mis\u00ad diagnosed for pathological entities. The linea aspera of the femur as well as the periosteal reaction that one sees on the posterior-superior aspects of the femoral condyles are two such examples. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone and bone marrow. There are four principle routes by which osseous and articular structures are contaminated. (1) Hematogenous spread of infection (2) Spread from contiguous infection (3) Direct implantation of infection (4) Post-operative infection There are three distinct patterns of hematogenous spread of osteomyelitis: infantile pattern, childhood pattern, and adult pattern. Because of the vascular anatomy in the epiphyseal plate, the site of hematogenous born osteomyelitis varies. The pathological and radiologic changes that one sees varies with the form of osteomyelitis. Characteristic changes that one sees with osteomyelitis include periosteitis with possibility of an involucrum (periosteal bone formation), osteolytic foci (lucent area in bone), osteosclerosis (dense area in bone), sequestra\u00ad tion (dense dead bone), soft tissue masses and'swelling, and fistulous tract (cloaca). However, these findings may be found in other entities. Evidence that Josef Mengele had osteomyelitis comes from the Berlin documents and two witnesses: Berlin Record: The 5.5. record refers to sepsis, nephri\u00adtis, and osteomyelitis. It does not state how these diag\u00ad noses were made, where the osteomyelitis was, or its sever\u00ad ity. Witness #1: The witness, a medical student colleague, re\u00ad members discussing Dr. Mengele's osteomyelitis because they ate in a vegetarian restaurant. The witness states that Dr. Mengele had kidney trouble, namely amyloidosis. He subsequently changed his statement. Witness #2: The witness was also a physician who was, after the war, in the same POW camp as Mengele. This wit\u00ad ness states that he and Mengele both had osteomyelitis, but Mengele's case was very mild. They frequently dis\u00ad cussed their cases. Taking everything into consideration, it is my op~n~on (our opinion) that Josef Mengele had some sort of illness at the age of 15. The skeleton revealed no evidence of osteomyelitis. The changes in the hip are those of a fracture. The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is a misdiagnosis.

Sher Director June 22, 1989 Office of Special Investigations Department of Justice Bond Building, 11th Floor 1400 New York Avenue, N.W. Washington, D. C. 1988, Mr. Philip L. Sunshine of your office, contacted Deputy Assistant Director John W. Hicks of the FBI Laboratory to explore the possibility of having the FBI use DNA typing to confirm the identification of the skeletal remains of Joseph Mengele. For identification, DNA from the skeletal remains would have to be compared to DNA from direct living relatives of Mengele. Mr. Sunshine indicated that blood samples could be obtained from Mengele's former wife and his son for this purpose. Considering the age of the Mengele remains, it was suggested that the most appropriate DNA test to apply was a DNA typing procedure referred to as the \"Polymerase Chain Reaction (peR) Dot Blot Test.\" This procedure allows for the arialysis of very small amounts of DNA and/or old DNA. A DNA type obtained by using this procedure could be compared to the DNA types of relatives, and an estimate could be given of the chance of relationship of the individuals involved. Mr. Sunshine was advised that the FBI was in the process of evaluating the peR dot-blot DNA analysis method for potential use in the FBI Laboratory. The research was being conducted at the FBI Laboratory's Forensic Science Research and Training Center (FSRTC) located at the FBI Academy. It was agreed that if the DNA typing test was to be performed on the Mengele remains, it would not be done until the FBI had completed the evaluation of the peR dot-blot analysis procedure.' It was estimated that the evaluation process would be complete in the Spring 1989. .1 1 , , Letter to Mr. Neal M. Sher On March 29, 1989, supervisory Special Agent James J. Kearney, section Chief, FSRTC, and Dr. Catherine T. Comey, Research Chemist, met with Mr. Sunshine to discuss the progress of the researeh on the PCR dot-blot DNA analysis method. It was explained that although Dr. Comey had been successful using the PCR dot-blot DNA test on DNA extracted from fresh human bone and aged blood and semen stains, she had not previously attempted extraction of DNA from aged bones. Before attempting to type the Mengele bones, studies attempting to DNA type aged bones needed to be completed. Subsequently, through the cooperation of the smithsonian Institution, pieces of aged human bone were obtained. DNA was extracted from several pieces of this bone, but no PCR dot-blot DNA typing results were obtained. It was subsequently determined that the extracted DNA was not human in origin. Presumably, it derived from bacteria present in the bone samples. At a later date, Mr. Sunshine provided hair samples from the exhumed Mengele corpse. The PCR dot-blot DNA typing procedure was attempted on approximately 500 pooled hair roots from the Mengele remains. No detectable human DNA was obtained from the hair roots, and no DNA typing results were obtained. In light of the experiments described above, we do not, at this time, feel it is appropriate to apply the PCR dot-blot DNA typing procedure on the Mengele bones. However, we ,are continuing our studies on PCR-dot blot DNA typing of aged bones exposed to different conditions and feel that DNA typing of aged bones in the future may provide a valid forensic tool. I regret that we were not able to, at this time, provide you with the desired results, however, as DNA typing tests become more defined when dealing with aged bones, we may be able to serve you in the future.

To improve the discrimination power of this typing, the number Of ditterent microsatellite loci was increased from the original 5\u00b7to a total of 10 loci distributed over 6 different chromosomes. Microsatellite alleles from bone DNA were compared, both by agarose gel electrophoresis an~ by DNA sequencin9 gel analysis, with alleles amplified from DNA prepared from the blood of Josef Mengele's son, Rolf Jenkel, and wife, Irene Hd~kenjos. For ~very locus typed, the. genotype of the bone DNA was fully consistent. with that expected for the father of Holf Jenkel. Nu Yl::!fI()t.ype combinotionc were found which excluded p.ternity. Statistical eVdlu~tion of the evidence using published Caucasian allele frequerl~Y L~ble5 suggested that only one person in 36,000 individuals unrelated to Rulf Jenkel 'would by chance ~ho~ alleles over all 10 lo~l compatible with paternity. Even after compensating for che limiLl::!d sizes of the current allele cataba~es, this frequency remained low (1 ill 1,800' individuals).
