From the first ISS element, launched in November 1998, the ISS has supported investigations and technology demonstrations that will advance NASA's human exploration capabilities beyond low-Earth Orbit (LEO), and improve the daily lives of people on Earth well beyond its operational lifetime. The first 15 years of utilization on ISS has helped answer scientific questions ranging from \"How do fluids flow in space?\" to \"What are the origins of the universe?\" The science and technology returns have grown at a steady pace. Even before the assembly of ISS was completed in 2011, the on -orbit crew were busy performing experiments, and with the full complement of a 6 -person crew, more than 1 600 investigations have b een conducted to date across the international partnership. This report is intended to provide an archival record of the internationally -sponsored ISS research results collected for investigations performed from 2000 -2011 on ISS (Expedition 0 through 30), including scientific publications from studies based on oper ational data. These investigations represent the research of thousands of scientists around the globe, and have Cumulative Amount of Crew Time dedicated ISS Utilization 25 impacts beyond the field of space research into traditional areas of science in multidisciplinary ways that no Earth- based laboratory has done. Yet much like a typical laboratory on Earth, the logistics of the ISS allows for many investigations to be carried forward over several ISS crew expeditions, enabling repeated experimentation and data collection that traditional science calls f or. One exam ple of this is the S eedling Growth- 1 (SG -1) joint NASA -ESA experiment that was implemented as an extension of the earlier Tropi- 1 and Tropi -2 plant growth experiments that first confirmed the existence red- light based phototropism in roots and hypocotyls o f seedlings. Researchers were able to capitalize on Tropi results in the SG -1 design by improving different lighting conditions, decreasing seed storage time, and adding real- time seedling observation through improved image downlink [4]. The results from ISS have so far yielded updated new insights into how to better live and work in space, such as addressing radiation effects on crew health [4], combating bone and muscle loss [1, 7], improving designs of systems that handle fluids in microgravity [12], and how to most efficiently maintain environmental control [15]. Latest examples of the ISS utilization applications relevant to our life on Earth is published in the second edition of the ISS Benefits for Humanity , which documents several tangible benefits that have resulted from ISS utilization in areas of Earth Observation and Disaster Response, Human Health, Global Education, Innovative Technology, and Economic Development of Space [2]. These benefits include suc h examples of how space -based research leads to improvements in therapies for balance disorders [2, 16] and contributions to improvements in smart fluids for advanced braking systems and earthquake dampening devices [2, 6]. ISS results also show promise in diverse applications such as medicine [2, 10] and global maritime tracking [11] and have advanced our knowledge of our planet's health while also contributing to disaster response efforts [2, 13, 9, 8]. With all its diversity, the ISS continues to inspire millions of students in ways that only space can [14, 5, 3]. The ISS offers a unique platform for science with critical capabilities not available anywhere else. It provides long -duration microgravity exposure, thermosphere exposure, and external environment exposure for material observations at high inclination, altitude, and velocity. The microgravity environment of the ISS allows scientists to observe unique behaviors that are otherwise masked by gravity on Earth, such as thermocapillary and fluid flows, protein crystal growth, flame structures, and the structure of living cells. The ISS platform also provides access to extreme heat and cold cycles, ultra vacuum, atomic oxygen, and high -energy radiation. 26 It is a fully -integrated laboratory, and the US assets have been designated as a National Laboratory, opening up world-class research opportunities to users from other US government agencies, universities, and the private sector. The laboratory features 4 key modules for ISS research; the Russian \"Zarya,\" U.S. \"Destiny,\" the European \"Columbus,\" and the Japanese \"Kibo.\" These laboratories provide equipment essential to space -based research such as : plant growth chambers; sample processing tools; multipurpose storage racks; variety of cosmic ray detectors and probes; equipment to support small satellite deployments; a full array of huma n research equipment; and, facilities for externally mounted experiments. This technical publication provides an archival record of the ISS research accomplished through Expedition 30, both as part of formal investigations and from early scientific analys is of data collected as part of operating the station. By scientific discipline, the investigations are collected as follows: Biology and Biotechnology - studies of biology using microgravity conditions to gain insight into the effect of the space environm ent on living organisms. Areas of emphasis include cellular biology, biotechnology, and plant biology. Earth and Space Science - studies of the Earth system as it relates to space. Areas of emphasis include astrobiology, astrophysics, heliophysics, Earth remote sensing, and near -Earth space environment. Educational Activities and Outreach - activities and investigations allowing students and the public to connect with the ISS mission. These activities inspire students to excel in science, technology, engine ering, and math and share the astronauts' unique view of the Earth and space with scientists and the public. Human Research - human medical research to develop the knowledge that is needed to send humans on exploration missions beyond low -Earth orbit. The se STS135 -E011788 - The International Space Station is seen from Space Shuttle Atlantis after undocking on STS -135 Flight Day 12, the final shuttle undocking, July 2011. 27 studies focus on the effect of living in space on human health, and countermeasures to reduce health risks that will be incurred by living in space in the future. Areas of emphasis include physiological studies related to the effects of microgravity on bone and muscle, other physiological effects of space flight, psycho -social studies, and radiation studies. Physical Science - studies of physics and chemistry in microgravity. Areas of emphasis include materials sciences experiments, physical properties a nd phase transitions in polymers and colloids, fluid physics, and crystal growth experiments. Technology Development and Demonstration - studies and tests of new technologies for use in future exploration missions. Areas of emphasis include spacecraft mate rials and systems, and characterization and control of the microgravity environment on ISS. Results from ISS Operations - in addition to the formal, peer -reviewed scientific research and experiments, the ISS supports a large body of research using data from ISS operations, including routine medical monitoring of the crew and data that is collected in the ISS environment, both inside and outside of the ISS. This report includes a summary of the research results across the entire international partnership that were conducted through the first 30 ISS Expeditions. The investigations are presented topically by the research disciplines, and alphabetically within each topical section. Of the investigations that are summarized here, some are completed with results released, some are completed with preliminary results, and some remain ongoing. For each case we provide an overview of the research objectives and the results that have been returned to date. We also indicate whether additional activities are planned for future ISS missions at the time of writing. Please note there are additional investigations/projects not included in this publication that are continuously updated at http://www.nasa.gov/stationresults .

This partnership has worked together for nearly 2 decades to complete one of the most ambitious engineering projects ever conceived, and has initiated a research program that has grown since \"Assembly Complete\" in 2011. Even as the vehicle was being built during the ISS assembly phase, the potential benefits of space -based research and development we re demonstrated, including the advancement of scientific knowledge based on experiments conducted in space, development and testing of new technologies, and derivation of Earth applications from new understanding. The international utilization strategy is based on research spanning several disciplines. The ability to complete follow -up investigations in a period of months allows researchers to make rapid advances based on new knowledge gained from ISS activities. Now, during the utilization phase, and with extension of the ISS through at least 2024, the ISS partners work together to track the objectives, accomplishments, and applications of the new knowledge gained in a way that will impact humanity like no laboratory on Earth. NASA's ISS Program Science office maintains an online experiment database ( www.nasa.gov/iss - science ) that tracks and communicates ISS research activities across the entire ISS partnership, and it is continuously updated. It captures ISS experiment summ aries and results, and includes citations to the result publications and patents as they become available. After any one research activity is Distribution by discipline of NASA's ISS experim ents for Expeditions 0 through 40 . Graph courtesy of JSC/NASA. 30 completed on ISS, it often takes 3 -5 years for completed data analysis and publication of results in a scientific journal [7]. The culmination of these results for experiments performed through Expedition 30 are now published in this r eport, with approval by the ISS partnership. As of December 2015, over 1 200 journal publications describe ISS research. Non-journal publications resulting from ISS utilization include 59 patents and over 400 conference proceedings. Journal articles of ISS science results range across the international partnership and across the disciplines. For example, in PLoS One, ESA -sponsored scientists published molecular evidence of plant seedling stress response to the microgravity environment by documenting the depletion in proteins associated with normal plant metabolism and the increase in proteins associated with stress responses [2]. Scientists from Roscosmos -sponsored programs have leveraged data gathered from long - duration spaceflight to develop new tools for biological and immunological testing in space, impacting space - related immune deficiency research while advancing health care in remote and resource -restricted areas [3]. CSA scientists from the CCISS investigation published in the Journal of Applied Physiology that while the current countermeasures on ISS maintain cardiovascular stability in resting conditions in space; key aspects of cardiovascular health with potential long- term consequences are not yet protected [4]. Advancing ou r knowledge of our universe, JAXA investigators have published MAXI investigation observations in Nature of a \"first -ever\": the instant that a massive black hole swallowed a star, along with data that revealed the existence of a hypernova remnant estimated to be 3 million years old, perhaps the first in our galaxy [5]. The collaborat ion of global scientists involved in the NASA- sponsored Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer -02 investigation ha ve published intriguing evidence of \"new phenomena\" in Physical Review Let ters, as the instrument was the first to sift through galactic cosmic rays in energy ranges beyond 200Gev, challenging theoretical models of cosmic predictions when searching for evidence of elusive dark matter [1]. One of the earliest ISS investigations w as also the most collaborative - the ICE-First investigation included investigators from France, Canada, A compilation of t he number of publications resulting from research aboard the ISS. Each discipline has produced a steady stream of published results. 31 Japan, and the United States to study the effects of the spaceflight environment on living systems, using the Caenorhabditis elegans as the model organism of study. This report shares the publications of this initial collaboration across the different aspects that were studied, including radiobiology, muscle protein changes, ageing, radiation effects on living organisms, apoptosis, and DNA damage and repair [6]. A LOOK TO THE FUTURE \u2014 SUPPORTING EXPLORATION AND BENEF ITS TO HUMANITY As the ISS continues to be a test bed for new technology and scientific discovery, scientists and engineers around the world build on ISS results, leading to greater research impacts and scientific collaboration across both space -related and non- space -related fields of science. The ISS partnership eagerly awaits results of the collaborative research performed on the first -ever one-year ISS human expedition, 3D printing/manufact uring in space, protein crystal growth, advanced telerobotics and materials testing, new rodent research and other model organism capabilities, additional instruments to study our climate, and unique contributions to fundamental physics, all while inspirin g the next generation of innovators and artists. As ISS research activities and operations continue, scientific data derived from earlier experiments will continuously be re -examined, refined, and assembled with new data and findings, including data from other fields never considered. We anticipate successful ISS research will continue to be used to sow the seeds of new ideas and formulate new conclusions and hypotheses to be tested on future missions both in LEO and on Earth.

The lab facilities support the exploration of biological systems ranging from microorganisms and cellular biol ogy to integrated functions of multicellular plants and animals. Several of the biological sciences experiments have facilitated new technology developments that allow growth and maintenance of living cells, tissues, and organisms. 34 DROSOPHILA MOTILITY , BEHAVIOUR AND AGEING - Invertebrate s and 8 Principal Investigator(s): Roberto Marco, PhD*, Universidad Autonoma de Bioligicas, Madrid, The Drosophila Motility, Behaviour and Ageing (Ageing) experiment studies the mechanisms of the abnormal motility response encountered in space by young Drosophila flies with consequences on the posterior aging response of the flies. For this purpose, a long -lived strain, a short -lived strain, and a strain sh owing an abnormal gravitropic response on the ground are studied. R ESULTS Ageing was sent into space to gain a better understanding of the biological responses in living organisms after prolonged exposure to microgravity. On October 18, 2003, a total of 450 Drosophila melanogaster flies were sent to the ISS for an 11 day flight to study their motility behavior. Motility behaviors were studied in 4 different fly strains - short lived mature flies, short lived young flies, gravity altered flies, and long lived young flies. In this experiment, the mature fly strain had the highest mo tility levels. Previous tests led scientists to believe the young flies would have the highest motility levels; however these young flies were exposed to lower temperatures during transport. Temperature plays a huge role in motility levels, and unfortunate ly skewed this study because only the young flies were exposed and not the mature flies. Although activity levels were increased in all strains, because of the cold transport, they did not reach their full potential and a reflight of this investigation wil l need to be run for more conclusive results (de Juan 2007). Once samples were returned to Earth, it was determined that the structural components for the sensory and nervous system are rather insensitive to microgravity. No observable changes were found i n any of the fly strains. Dendritic and axonal activities remained the same and the somata size was only slightly altered (Horn 2007). Although this research line was closed due to the premature death of the PI (Roberto Marco) in 2008, additional work usin g those and additional altered gravitaxis drosophila strains was Drosophila chambers . ESA image. 35 performed later in simulated microgravity ground based facilities. Both simulated microgravity and hypergravity environments led to alterations in the behavior of the flies, as well as with accelerated ageing, especially since the processes are related, strains selected for a different gravitaxis sensibility show different ageing responses (Herranz 2008; Serrano 2010, 2012). It has been particularly interesting to use diamagnetism as a new too l for behavioral studies in flies exposed to altered gravity conditions (Hill 2012).

Sychev, PhD, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Study of the Resistance of a Modeled Closed Ecosystem and Chains of its Components in Microgravity ( Akvarium) examines the impact of spaceflight factors on dormant embryos of lower aquatic crustaceous organisms ( Daphnia magna, Streptocephalus the diapause and the larval stages and capable of remaining in cryptobios is (an ametabolic state of life entered by an organism in response to adverse environmental conditions) for an extended period of time. E ARTH BENEFITS The results obtained may also be important for the ecology of terrestrial communities. The existence of such a capability significantly changes the understanding of the role of the maternal effect in microevolutionary processes in bodies of water. If such a phenomenon is observed with respect to other stress factors typical on the Earth's surface, such as ultraviolet radiation, then the properties of diapause embryos on dry land and at the bottom of bodies of water will be diffe rent, as will their capability to fight against something specific after reactivation. S PACE BENEFITS The experiment results enable data to be obtained on the impact of spaceflight conditions on the resilience of the functioning of a closed ecosystem and on the growth and development of individual organisms that are components of the autotrophic and hetero trophic links of the closed ecosystem. R ESULTS The results obtained made it possible to hypothesize that exposure on the International Space Station (ISS) acted on the dry D. magna embryos as a stress factor, weakening their vital activity. This manifest ed as both a decrease in reactivation effectiveness and a change in the dynamic of the average sizes of specimens capable of hatching, which took the form of the Eggs of freshwater crustaceans (species Daphnia magna) after exposure on board the International Space Station. Ros cosmos i mage . 37 slower emergence of young fish from smaller, and thus weaker, embryos. The effect of spaceflig ht factors is also manifested in the second generation of Daphnia, causing a transition to gamogenesis and the production of males in the population. The D. magna embryos after exposure on the ISS manifested a high sensitivity to the effect of the fungal parasite Pitium daphniarum as compared to the control, which among other factors raises the question of biological safety measures from spacecraft flora regarding biological material intended for long - term space transportation. In S. torvicornis, a decrease in growth and reproduction parameters was observed, however, unlike the control, this was not confirmed statistically due to extremely high variability and relating to its parameter assessment error. The only statistically significant factor fo r this species was the effect of day length on the growth of females. The studies of Artemia salina showed that the temperature threshold of expression activation of the gene encoded in the Hsp90 molecular chaperone was substantially lower in response to thermal stress in Artemia nauplius from the flight samples than in the ground control group. This manifested as a sharp increase detected in the level of Hsp90 gene expression in both flight groups with thermal stress of 32 -33\u00b0C, while in the control group s the minimum thermal stress required to initiate Hsp90 synthesis was 37 -38\u00b0C. Investigations on the ground did not identify an impact of spaceflight factors on the rate of reactivation and subsequent vital activity on the chironomid Polypedilum vanderpla nki larva exposed on the ISS in a state of cryptobiosis. The fertility in the experiment animals did not differ from that of the control animals. These results showed that a cell in a dormant stage and containing just 5% water is capable of acquiring and transferring information on the effects of negative factors after transitioning Daphnia magna female (A) and male (B). Roscosmos ima ge. 38 from the dormant stage to an active state, thus also confirming data from molecular/genetic research. These results provide the rationale for continuing in- depth studies of the impact of spaceflight factors on dormant stage living organisms belonging to various taxonomic groups.

E ARTH BENEFITS In addition to the RNAi experiment, investigators studied the molecular effect of microgravity on the C. elegans muscular cells using transcriptome and proteome analyses. The current results indicate alterations in muscular, cytoskeletal, and mitochondrial proteins of spaceflown C. elegans . This data could potentially clarify the molecular mechanism of human muscle atrophy caused by aging and unloading. S PACE BENEFITS The efficiency of RNAi and Green Fluorescent Protein ( GFP) technologies used in space illustrate the relative ease with which these important tools can be incorporated into future experiments to study the molecular mechanisms underpinning the biological al terations induced by spaceflight. In addition, researchers would like to understand the molecular mechanisms of spaceflight -induced muscle atrophy in order to eliminate the significant risk on astronaut health and mission performance from CERISE data. R ESULTS Comparison of the in -orbit samples to its Ground Control (GC) equivalent showed no differences . The Gene expression of 228 microRNAs of the 232 analyzed were also unaffected during the micro -g duration. RNAi applied to a GFP reduced chromosomal gfp expression in gonad tissue, which was not different from the GC samples. RNAi applied to an rbx -1 also induced abnormal chromosome segregation in the gonad for the in- orbit samples. Finally, RNAi applied to lysosomal cathepsins prevented degradation of the m uscle -specific -actin in both micro -g and GC conditions (Etheridge [a] 2011).

JAXA image. 40 Treatment with RNAi works as effectively in microgravity as on Earth within multiple tissues, suggesting RNAi may provide an effective tool for combating spaceflight- induced pathologies aboard future long -duration space missions. Furthermore, this is the first demonstration that RNAi can be utilized to block muscle protein degradation, both on Earth and in space. Scientists are now attempting to analyze the effect of microgravity on the C. elegans muscular cells using transcriptome and proteome analyses (Etheridge P UBLICATION (S) Etheridge T, Nemoto K, Hashizume T, et al.

Hammond, MD, Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Durham, N orth Carolina David M. Klaus, PhD, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colo rado RESEARCH OBJECTIVES SYNAPTOGENESIS Genetic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) hardware to examine how microgravity affects nervous system development of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster . This investigation uses D. melanogaster embryos and larvae to observe how nerves that control movement navigate through an embryonic central nervous system (CNS) and attach to muscle fibers. Investigators observe how the synapses, which are the junction between 2 nerve cells where signals are transferred from one nerve to another, develop both during and after the embryonic stage. KIDNEY CELL GENE EXPRESSION (HAMMOND ) The primary objective of CGBA - Kidney Cell Gene Expression (KCGE) is to assess how microgravity alters the genes controlling protein production in kidney cells. The investigator hopes to be able to manipulate the kidney cells to produce specific tissues that can be used in models when developing medicines or in humans. The kidney cell samples are drawn into the test tubes containing a preservati ve approximately 2 hours after reaching orbit. Once the samples are drawn, a messenger RNA (mRNA) preservative is added to the cell cultures for postflight analysis. A NTIBIOTIC PRODUCTION IN SPACE (KLAUS ) The objective of this experiment is to determine whether secondary metabolite production in microbes is impacted by long -duration spaceflight. Previous research, which was conducted during short- duration space shuttle flights, identified significant potential for antibiotic ISS004E11048 - The Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus isothermal containment module v.3, installed in Expedite the Processing of Experiments for Space Station rack just above astronaut Dan Bursch's extended left arm; photograph taken during Expedition 4. 42 production by microorganisms in orbit. The CGBA Antibiotic Production in Space (APS) experiment is the first International Space Station (ISS) investigation to test whether long - duration exposure to microgravity stimulated antibiotic production in microorganisms. The experiment uses Streptomyces plicatus to produce the antibiotic compound actinomycin D. Actinomycin D is an anti- tumor antibiotic used to treat tumors of the bone, urogential tract, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis. E ARTH BENEFITS Researchers believe microgravity presents a pure environment to study different human physiological systems. Scientists hope to gain a better understanding of how nerves develop and attach to muscle fibers during the CGBA -SM experiment. Newly ac quired information may be used to produce treatments for various nervous system diseases. CGBA- KCGE aims to manipulate cell samples to create tissues similar in structure to those found in the human body. These tissues can be applied to many different types of research and can be used for developing new medications to treat various diseases. Insight gained through observations made during CGBA -APS target further improvements in antibiotics production and efficiency in facilities on Earth. The microgravity environment is vital in determining the critical factors observed in increasing antibiotic production and may lead to econo mic gain through an increase in fermentation efficiency. S PACE BENEFITS As the drive for long -duration space exploration increases, it is imperative to understand how microgravity affects the human body. CGBA -SM focuses on the developing nervous system. The information derived from this investigation can aid in generating countermeasures to offset the negative effects of spaceflight. CGBA -KCGE observes the effects that microgravity has on cellular structures and gives insight to how the human body reacts at the cellular level. These chan ges may lead to the development of countermeasures that would lower the human risk of long -duration spaceflight. CGBA -APS concentrates on the accelerated rate of antibiotic production in microgravity in comparison to those produced on Earth. Researches thi nk the ability to grow large quantities of antibiotics in microgravity will further pharmaceutical research. R ESULTS SYNAPTOGENESIS IN MICROGRAVITY Preliminary results based on the 30 -day postflight report, provided by Dr David Klaus of BioServe Space Technology, indicated that although the CGBA hardware operated successfully, there were unexpected temperature drifts above the planned temperature in 2 of the 7 Postflight images show tray with waste bag and samples visible (dark substance indicates actinomycin D), close up of remaining viable culture from opened tray, and sample bags. NA SA Marshall Space Flight Center image . 43 containers. While ground tests were comple ted for comparison to the inflight samples, final data analysis has not been released. KIDNEY CELL GENE EXPRESSION Preliminary results indicate d that an average of 60% of the kidney cell samples from CGBA- KCGE were drawn into the Vacutainers. Although the sample size was smaller, the samples were sufficient for postflight analysis. For the synaptogenesis experiment with fruit flies, preliminary results indicated that although the CGBA hardware operated successfully, there were unexpected temperature drifts above the planned temperature in 2 of the 2 containers. While ground tests were completed for comparison to the in -flight samples, final data analysis has not been released. A NTIBIOTIC PRODUCTION IN SPACE This experiment originally flew on Expedition 2 but was unable to function due to technical issues. Its reflight took place during Expedition 4 where the hardware performed as planned. Samples of antibiotic were taken at 4 -day intervals. A total of 48 samp les of Streptomyces plicatus were used to produce the antibiotic compound actinomycin D for a span of 72 days on orbit. The initial production of actinomycin D from in- orbit samples was higher than those produced during the ground tests. This was true for samples that were taken on day 8 (15.6 % increase) and day 12 (28.5% increase) of the investigation. Beginning at day 16, the ground experiment produced more antibiotic s than the in- orbit experiment. This trend continued for the remainder of the experiment . The causes for the higher yield during the first 12 days of the experiment are still unknown. One theory is that there is a shorter lag phase, which allowed ISS samples to reach the growth and production phases sooner than the ground samples (Benoit 2005). Identifying the mechanism that caused increased production of antibiotics while in microgravity and applying them to production on Earth could be advantageous to the pharmaceutical industry. A method for transferring the microgravity research results to Earth - based production has not yet been identified. P UBLICATION (S) Benoit MR, Li W, Stodieck LS, et al.

Horn, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Crickets in Space -2 (CRISP -2) experiment follows on from a previous experiment, Development of an Insect Gravity Sensory System in Space, performed on the Neurolab STS -90 mission in 1998. Results revealed that the development of gravity -related behavior in crickets was not affected by weightlessness while the physiology of a specific neuron linked to posture sensitivity was modified. R ESULTS Successful in -flight fertilization was obtained; high -quality neuroanatomical stainings from embryonal nervous systems were obtained; and after landing, embryos could be reared until hatching to test consequences of in- flight fertilization even on the behavioral level. A total number of 112 embryos and 1st larvae from in -flight fertilization were available for the studies. The number of ground co ntrols was 103. Interestingly, the g -exposed larvae hatched earlier than larvae from the 1 -g ground controls. The results coming from the Eneide (Soyuz 10S/Soyuz 9S exchange) flight revealed that after in fertilization, the AST -ir-, PSK -ir-, and CCAP -ir-neurones developed as after on- ground fertilization. This holds not only for neurons with only short neurites located either only within the cerebrum, the thoracic, or the abdominal ganglia chain, but also for those neurons such as PSK -ir neu rons that project throughout the whole nervous system, with cell somata lying in the protocerebrum and dendritic arborizations within the cerebral, thoracic, and abdominal ganglia. Lack of significant differences between 1 g - and altered gravity -larvae do es not exclude an altered -gravity sensitivity during early development. Compensatory mechanisms might be activated during ongoing altered gravity conditions to overcome transient deviations from normal neuronal development. The earlier hatching of the 1st instar larvae after in -flight fertilization as demonstrated for the spaceflight experiment CRISP -2 makes this hypothesis very likely.

Since there is evidence that suggests the immune system of organisms is affected by spaceflight, this proposal seeks to assess the extent and the detailed molecular biological changes that are associated with spaceflight. In addition, this work also investigates the progression of cancerous and benign tumors in sensitized mutant lines (cells that turn into tumors) that show an increase in tumor formation, and is coupled with the effect of rad iation exposure. E ARTH BENEFITS Microbial effects of pathogens on wild type and immune - compromised hosts are of great relevance to human immune diseases. S PACE BENEFITS It is a known fact that space travel affects the genetic activity of crew members, but researchers cannot yet predict which genes are affected or precisely determine how gravity signals a gene to change. FIT is the first step in answering these questions. R ESULTS FIT studied the effects of spaceflight on the immune system responses of the common fruit fly. Even short -term spaceflight affects the fundamental process of cellular and humoral (secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the blood and accessory processes) immunity and phagocytosis (the cell engulfing microorganisms) functions and the maturation of immun e cells in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) innate immune system (the first line of defense against invading microorganisms). Many of these changes mirror alterations seen in human innate immune systems postflight. The large number of fruit flies returned from FIT allowed a significant number of assays to be conducted postflight. Physiological changes observed in the innate immune system could be explained by gene expression changes, allowing a fundamental understanding of the underlying molecular pathwa ys affected by spaceflight (Marcu 2011) .

Headquarters, Washington, DC, United States Development Akira Higashibata, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Tsukuba, Japan Stuart Kim, PhD, Stanford University, Stanford, California Laurent Segalat, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France Ann Rose, PhD, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES The International Caenorhabditis elegans Experiment First Flight (ICE -First) investigation is a collaborative effort conducted by scientists from several countries, which have the opportunity to work as a team to design related experiments that would produce valuable results for scientists acros s multiple disciplines. Researchers use C. elegans (nematode worms) because they are relatively simple organisms that are used as a model for a wide variety of biological processes. ICE-F IRST-AGING (HONDA ) International Caenorhabditis elegans Experiment - First - Aging (ICE -First -Aging) performs an analysis of the aging related protein aggregation and the effects of aging in muscle cells. ICE-F IRST-APOPTOSIS (HIGASHITANI ) -First -Apoptosis) studies the germ line development including meiotic (process of cell division that produces reproductive cells) chromosomal dynamics and germ cell apoptosis (programmed cell death) under microgravity conditions. This image shows a magnified image of 2 adult worms and 1 juvenile worm crawling in the liquid media that was used for the ICE -First mission. 49 ICE-FIRST-CELLS (KAGAWA ) -First -Cells) studies the effect of spaceflight on cell migration and muscle cells in C. elegans development . ICE-FIRST-DEVELOPMENT (CONLEY -First - Development) studies the morphometry (measurements) of larval (immature) C. elegans Expression (ICE -First -Gene Expressi on) studies the effect of space flight on gene expression and protein alteration in C. elegans . ICE-F IRST-GENOMICS (KIM) -First -Genomics) investigates the whole -genome microarray -Muscle Proteins (ICE -First -Muscle Proteins) studies the correlation between proteins, muscle growth, and endurance in relation to a microgravity environment. ICE-F IRST-RADIOBIOLOGY (ROSE) (ICE -First - Radiobiology) studies the effects of radiation on living organisms by comparing space -flown normal and genetically modified strains of worms with comparable worms grown on Earth for differences in the presence an d expression of glutamine rich proteins. E ARTH BENEFITS By understanding fundamental processes in C. elegans , scientists can achieve a better understanding of such processes in humans. The breakdown of these essential functions often results in disease and medical pathologies, thus allowing scientists to use C. elegans to study development, nerve function, behav ior, and aging. With certain genetic techniques used in this experiment, highlighting the genes where differences occur in comparison to Earth data can further provide scientists with a direction of where to develop research in the future, either on similar organisms or humans. These investigations can also lead to a further understanding of how radiation may affect the human function on Earth as well as in space . S PACE BENEFITS As the possibilities for longer- term spaceflight are increasing, it is crucial to understand the effects that microgravity will have on organisms at the genetic level. It is important for human life in space to study the effects of environmental factors during spaceflight on a number of physiological phenomena. Results from the ICE -First experiments can help scientists better 50 understand the adverse effects that could be experienced, such as cell and muscle atrophy. ICE - First also hopes to gain a better insight on how different organisms are affected by radiation exposure over a long period of time in microgravity. These investigations present several opportunities for further studies including the possibly of automated experiment in flight, which is critical for experiments on deep spaceflight to other planetary bodies. R ESULTS ICE-FIRST-AGING ICE-First -Aging performs an analysis of the aging related protein aggregation and the effects of aging in muscle cells of C. elegans worms during ISS Expedition 8. To examine the effect of space flight on muscle protein aggregation, space -exposed and ground control nematodes were compared during the larval and young adult stages from the ICE -First investigation. The polyglutamine (portion of protein) aggregation in the space -flown organisms was less than that in the grou nd control organisms. These findings suggest that the protein aggregation rate of the space -flown nematodes was slower than that of the ground controls ( Honda 2012). Szewczyk 2008, indicated that the total stowage space required for the eight type I cassettes to house the ICE -First investigation was minimal. Despite this limited size, mass experiments for investigators from 4 space agencies were returned, a total of 53 independent samples, each of which contained more than 100 individual animals. The concept of accommodating a number of experiments within a limited available volume and upmass appears to have merit. By setting flight constraints first and bringing together establ ished C. elegans researchers second, it was possible to design and successfully execute the flight portion of these experiments within 1 year. In the past, the time from flight grant solicitation to completion of a flight experiment has been longer than 3 years (Szewczyk 2008). ICE-F IRST-APOPTOSIS Checkpoint -induced apoptosis is involved in maintaining genomic stability through the elimination of cells that have failed to repair DNA damage. However, the occurrence of checkpoint -induced and other types of physiological apoptosis in animals during or as a result of spaceflight has not been documented. Approximately 300 germ cells of C. elegans undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) during normal development. DNA damage -induced checkpoint apoptosis also oc curs in germ cells, at the meiotic pachytene nucleus stage (stage of chromosomal crossover). Results indicate that pachytene checkpoint apoptosis and physiological apoptosis in germ cells occurred normally in the space exposed nematodes. Thus, the normal o ccurrence of several kinds of apoptosis, including che ckpoint apoptosis, during space flight supports the hypothesis that humans would retain the ability to eliminate cells that have failed to repair DNA lesions introduced by cosmic radiation during spacefl ight (Higashitani 2005). Typical morphology of apoptotic cells in region of dissected gonads of elegans . Gonads were dissec ted from ced-1 mutants of space flight sample and DNA were stained with DAPI (blue fluorescent). Apoptotic cells without the fluorescent are indicated as arrows. 51 ICE-FIRST-CELLS As with wild -type animals, histologic study of unc -15 (e73) animals was conducted using phalloidin and anti -paramyosin staining. In both ground control and space -flown unc -15 animals, deformed thin filaments and the aggregated paracrystalline forms of paramyosin (component of smooth muscles) were noted. However, in space -flown worms, partially formed normal paramyosin filaments were also observed. Additionally, the space -flown animals displayed a normal muscle filament to body -width ratio that was not obser ved in the ground control animals. Thus, spaceflight appears to have partially rescued the histologic defects of the paramyosin mutant. Again as with wild -type animals, Western Blots were used to assess the levels of paramyosin, myosin heavy chains B and C , actin, and tropomyosin III (a type of protein). Space -flown unc -15 mutant animals displayed increased levels of paramyosin and myosin heavy chains relative to both ground controls and space -flown wild -type animals. In contrast, actin remained the same an d tropomyosin III was slightly depressed, although the depression was not statistically significant. Thus, as with wild -type animals, the thick and thin filament proteins showed different effects in response to spaceflight. However, unlike wild- type animals, which showed decreased thick filament proteins in response to spaceflight, unc -15 animals showed increased thick filament proteins. These observations suggest 2 things. First, spaceflight has a differential effect on thick and thin filaments regardless of mutations in a thick filament gene. Second, spaceflight allows animals to better compensate for a mutation in the thick filaments by increasing thick filament gene expression. Together the histologic and Western Blot data from unc -15 animals suggest tha t altered muscle development, induced by spaceflight, allows partial rescue of the defects induced by the mutation. A direct elucidation of the functional consequences and the mechanism underlying the rescue remains to be demonstrated. If spaceflight does indeed rescue the functional consequences of mutations in muscle proteins, this suggests that muscles damaged in flight may be better able to repair than muscle damaged on Earth, a view that runs counter to the current conventional wisdom. However, while s cientists have presented the unc -15 data as spaceflight having \"rescued\" the effects of the mutation, the investigators have correctly pointed out that there may be concerns with this apparent rescue. Specifically, their data can also be interpreted to sho w that increased muscle protein degradation, a required component of muscle atrophy, is found in the mutants vs wild- type. If the investigators are correct, this reinforces the currently widely held view that muscles damaged during spaceflight may not be p roperly able to repair. Future studies are clearly needed (Adachi 2007). ICE-F IRST-GENE EXPRESSION DNA microarray is a powerful technique to analyze the microgravity effect on gene expression. The gene expression levels between the ground control worms and the space -flown worms showed and the number of genes transcriptionally altered was listed up by ge ne ontology (GO) terms. In the space -flown worms, the up -regulated genes were dominant in the GOs related to embryonic and larval development, gametogenesis, and reproduction, and the down -regulated genes were dominant in the GOs related to locomotory beha vior, G -protein coupled receptor protein, and ion transport. Myo -3, unc -54, and hlh -1 genes described in a previous section are categorized as the down- regulated genes in \"locomotory behavior.\" These results indicate that microgravity especially plays an important role of locomotory regulation, early embryo -genesis, 52 and the regeneration process in C. elegans . The alterations of entire protein expression of the space -flown worms were analyzed by a combination of two -dimensional gel electrophoresis. Over 1000 protein spots were detected with SYPRO Ruby stain, and approximately 200 phosphoprotein spots were detected with Pro -Q Diamond stain. Approximately 10% -15% spots significantly increased or decreased in the flight samples compared with the ground control (Higashibata 2006, 2007). ICE-F IRST-DEVELOPMENT ICE-First -Development shows that the growth and development of space -flown C. elegans , using liquid CeMM, was essentially the same as C. elegans grown under similar conditions in the laboratory. These results are as anticipated based upon previous demonstrations of normal growth and development in flight for animals grown on the traditional NGM (Nematode Growth Medium), and from the extrapolation of normal growth and development in flight for animals grown on both NGM and liquid CeMM; the later data was generated by extrapolation due to the delayed recovery of samples following the tragic breakup of the Space Shuttle Columbia. The demonstration of grossly normal growth and development suggests that CeMM presents opportunities for further studies including the possibility of automated experiments in flight, which is absolutely critical for experiments on deep spaceflights to other planetary bodies. ICE-F IRST-GENOMICS There are 3 themes that emerged from the ICE -First -Genomics microarray data. First, there are few genes that show reproducible changes in response to spaceflight when assayed in multiple replicates of a population. This may mean that gene responses to spaceflight are small and/or that the number of genes altered in response to spaceflight is relatively small. Second, there are some genes that show reproducible changes in response to space flight both within replicates of a population and across populations. Notably, the genes that have these highly reproducible changes are largely metabolic (decreased) and stress response genes (increased). Additionally, the bulk of these genes are thought to be regulated by 2 signaling pathways that the worm uses to sense and respond to the external environment, Insulin and TGF -beta. Third, within the class of genes that gave reproducible changes in expression, it is possible to identify genes that change i n only 2 of 3 populations during spaceflight; for example, decreased expression of neuromuscular genes. This may suggest differential sensitivity of populations to spaceflight, or population differences in exposure to multiple vs individual stressors assoc iated with spaceflight. This may also explain why one population of space -flown worms had a postflight movement defect while one did not, and also why there is wide variability in muscle loss in astronauts and cosmonauts. Together, these results paint a se mi-convincing picture of how C. elegans modulate gene expression in response to spaceflight. ICE-F IRST-MUSCLE PROTEINS Unfortunately, due to loss of funding, the ICE -First -Muscle Proteins investigation was unable to produce any results. 53 PUBLICATION (S) Honda Y, Honda S, Narici M, Szewczyk NJ.

Foster, PhD, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida RESEARCH OBJECTIVES the effect of the space environment on the normal developmental timeline of the cooperative relationship between the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri. The goal of this project is to determine whether beneficial microbes that typically associate with animal tissues are negatively impacted by microgravity. EARTH BENEFITS For the approximately 3.8 billion years that life has existed on Earth , gravity has been one of the few constants throughout the evolution process. By experimenting in microgravity conditions we can potentially assess the impact gravity has had on life's evolution as well as delineate developmental triggers or cues that may o therwise be obscured by gravity. This may expand our basic understanding of how gravity has influenced the evolution of life on Earth. SPACE BENEFITS The research complements those studies underway in pathogenic organisms, as several gene pathways (e.g. hfq) are common to both mutualistic and pathogenic organisms. By understanding what commensal/mutualistic bacteria are experiencing in microgravity, we can deepen our understanding of human health in the space environment. RESULTS Results indicated that the bacteria were able to colonize the host squid tissue in situ under microgravity conditions. Only 3 animals were tested, therefore there were not enough specimens for a rigorous study; however, the data provided proof of concept of the feasibility of us ing these animals in microgravity conditions.

The data collected during this investigation may lead to a greater understanding of how the radiation defense system is affected by different factors from space radiation and a microgravity environment to develop new treatments and preventative measures for radiation effects. E ARTH BENEFITS Radiation effects are critical for biological creatures. The data collected during this investigation may lead to a greater understanding of how the radiation defense system is affected by different factors from space radiation and microgravity environment. This data could potentially be used to help develop new treatments and preventative measures for radiation effects. S PACE BENEFITS This may help develop Space Radiation Biodosimeter using silkworm eggs, and thus can provide fundamental information on the effects of cosmic rays on biological systems that can then be applied to better protect humans against cosmic radiation . R ESULTS The environmental conditions aboard the International Space Station (ISS) include microgravity and radiation from cosmic rays and heavy ion beams. Crew members aboard the ISS are always exposed to cosmic radiation, therefore a biodosimetric assessment of health risks associated with radiation exposure is requested. Silkworm eggs possess excellent potential to be developed into a biodosimeter. ISS021E028099 - Expedition 21 Commande r Frank De Winne works on the Integrated Assessment of Long- term Cosmic Radiation Through Biological Responses of the Silkworm, Bombyx mori , in Space (Rad Silk) experiment in the Japanese Experiment Module. JAXA image. 57 Effect of microgravity on embryonic development Silkworm eggs that are in a dormant state (called diapause) are optimal for use on the ISS. To ensure a stable diapause state, eggs were kept at 25 \u00b0C for the first 30 days after oviposition and then at 5 \u00b0C for 30 days. These eggs were then transported to the ISS where they were kept continuously at 2 \u00b0C for about 3 months in the incubator in the ISS until recovery. Portions of these eggs were transferred to either microgravity or 1G compartments in the Cell Biology Experimental Facility (CBEF) of the ISS, and then incubated at 20\u00b0C for 6 days to resume embryonic development. The embryos underwent development normally after exposure to microgravity and 2\u00b0C and about 50% of embryos exposed to 1G and 20\u00b0C also performed embryonic reversal. In contrast, embryos did not carry out embryonic development after exposure to microgravity and 20\u00b0C, sug gesting that microgravity affects embryonic development in silkworm eggs. Chromosome aberration by cosmic rays Heterozygous eggs exposed to heavy ion particles resulted in somatic mutations appearing as white spots on the black integument during larval stage. The white spots were caused by the loss of a chromosomal fragment carrying the P S gene from epidermal cells during growth and development. Based on the above result, the following experiments were undertaken: The Passive Dosimeter for Life Science Experiments in Space (PADLES), estimated that total cosmic radiation was 15-20m Gy in the ISS over about 3 months. N o mutations were seen in the integument of the larvae (first filial generation) from these eggs. However, in the second generation, the larvae exhibited white spots on the black integument of their dorsal surface, and many white spots appeared on the gray dorsal integument of p /p/P S larvae in the third generation. This indicated that cosmic rays damage genes in the primordial germ cells during embryonic development of the first generation. Effects of cosmic rays on gene expression The cosmic radiation appe ared to suppress the expression of the gene encoding a small heat shock protein among several genes known to respond to environmental stress . The extent of gene suppression in each egg was different, suggesting that the dose and type of cosmic ray that hit each egg might have varied. These results alter the focus from studying the biological effect of cosmic rays at a mass level into a more specific focus, looking at each individual level using the silkworm egg. Future research will aim to determine what type of cosmic rays and how great a dose is needed to cause chromosome aberration and suppression of gene expression.

Gorgiladze, PhD, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences , Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Study of the Growth Potential of Statoconia in the Organ of Balance of Gastropods in Weightlessness (Statokonia) investigation evaluates the nature and dynamic of new formation and the growth of statoconia when exposed to weightlessness. SPACE BENEFITS This knowledge both adds to our understanding of and underscores the importance of the gravitational field in the structural orga nization of the organ of balance. The fact established that the test mass increased in the organ of balance in orbital flight must be taken into consideration when developing a medical support strategy for long -term manned spaceflight. R ESULTS The most si gnificant results of the experiment: the discovery that the test mass in the organ of balance depended on the extent of the gravitational field; mass increased under conditions of weightlessness and decreased under conditions of increased gravity. Furtherm ore, this phenomenon is of an adaptive nature, appearing in the restoration of the normal picture during the readaptation period to the Earth's gravitational force. New information was obtained on the morphology, elemental composition, and test mass ultras tructure in the organ of balance in the 2 types of gastropods. The hypothesis was put forward that statoconia nuclei occur in the sensitive cells of the statocyst, and then are imported into its cavity. The topography of the sensitive cells of the statocys t was established. The information obtained on the structural organization of the organ of balance/statocyst of H. lucorum and P. rivulare enable these objects to be used as models in studies in the field of gravitational (space) biology.

RESULTS Stage 20 -21 embryos (4 dpf) were exposed to microgravity during a 10-day spaceflight, or to 3 -g hypergravity f ollowing the same time schedule. After termination of altered gravity, the rVOR was recorded twice in most animals. The main observations were as follows: (1) after the first rVOR appearance at stage 37 (16 dpf), both rVOR gain, and amplitude increased ste adily up to saturation levels of 0.22 and 20, respectively. (2) Three days after termination of microgravity, flight and ground larvae showed no rVOR; 1 day later, the rVOR could be induced only in ground larvae. Differences disappeared after 3 weeks. (3) For 10 days after 3 -g exposure, rVOR development was similar to that of 1 -g controls but 3 weeks later, 3 -g larvae showed a larger rVOR than 1 -g controls. These observations indicated that the immature vestibular system is transiently sensitive to microgravity exposure and that exposure of the immature vestibular system to hypergravity led to a slowly growing vestibular sensitization.

David Dickman, PhD, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas Stephen B. Doty, PhD, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES ADF -OTOLITH (DICKMAN ) The avian (bird) experimental model offers opportunities to observe microgravity induced changes in many systems, including the otolith, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, immunological and neurological. The ADF- Otolith investigation studies the formation of inner ear bones and neurons (involved in the otolith system) under the influence of microgravity. ADF -S KELETAL (DOTY) Under microgravity conditions, bones demineralize, resulting in osteoporosis like (brittl e bones) conditions. The study of embryos that develop in microgravity is an important piece of the bone loss puzzle. ADF -Skeletal investigates how the mechanism of bone formation during development of the limbs in quail embryos could provide basic information to help prevent bone loss in crew members during long -duration missions. E ARTH BENEFITS During embryonic development on Earth, the visual system, if deprived of light during the early critical period, can be impaired o r eliminated during maturation. In the vestibular system, which controls normal postural, eye, and head movement responses during motion, no effort s to study the effects of gravity upon development have been extensively performed. Thus, it is currently unknown whether altered gravity environments affect vestibular system development and subsequent reflex motor behavior. The research should provide basic answers to questions related to vestibular receptor pathology that is known to occur with aging humans and in some disease cases. On Ea rth, fracture healing consists of cartilage formation, conversion of cartilage to a temporary bony structure, and new bone formation involving osteoblast and collagen synthesis. Furthermore, the healing of a bone fracture in the elderly is very slow and ma y not result in a fully healed bone. In addition, significant populations of elderly adults suffer from One of 2 Avian Development Facility ( ADF) carousels, each featuring 18 sample containers. During space missions, one carousel rotates at 77.3 RPMs to simulate a 1g gravity field. The other carousel remains motionless to provide a microgravity environment for the specimens inside. Besides eggs, the ADF can carry fish, plants, insects or cells in its sample containers. NASA's Ames Research Center image . 64 loss of bone material due to the onset of osteoporosis. Since the microgravity environment is known to stimulate the loss of bone material in adults in a very short period of time, the spaceflight microgravity environment is the ideal location to conduct experiments aimed at understanding bone loss. By using the ADF, specimens can be incubated in the exact same environment with the only difference being 1 g versus microgravity. This experimental condition is not available on Earth and is critical to specifically isolating the cause of bone material loss. It is anticipated that the data from this ADF study can provide scientists with key information to ide ntify the specific biological processes that contribute to bone loss and the mechanism of this disease process. Overall, the identification of the specific biological processes can provide scientists and pharmaceutical companies candidate targets for the development of therapeutic agents. S PACE BENEFITS The ADF is the first step to creating new technologies that can support critical biological research in direct support of human space travel. The subsystems used to support the biological specimens can be applied to technologies directed to supporting other animals or the crew. It is a known fact that crew members lose bone material soon after they enter the weightless environment of space. The loss of bone material poses a significant health risk because the crew members' bones weaken and become more susceptible to breakage. Also, since they are adults, their body's ability to regenerate the lost b one material once they return to Earth is very limited. Currently, no therapies exist that can stimulate the production of new bone material. The spaceflight microgravity environment is ideal for studying bone formation and material loss because its effect s on the skeleton are rapid and occur within days of entry into space. This ADF -Skeletal experiment is designed to investigate the biological processes that are key to stimulating new bone formation. By using the ADF, this experiment can control the embryo genesis environment so that components affected by the spaceflight environment, especially microgravity, can be identified. By comparing the data to the simulated 1 g in flight controls and ground controls, the ADF experiment can identify specific changes to bone formation that are due to the microgravity environment, which in turn, points out the specific biological systems (molecular, cellular, and systemic) that are sensitive to changes in gravity. Electron micrographs of quail limb bones that formed under the influence of microgravity show decreased mineralization compared to bones formed in normal gravity. The letters \"B\" and \"C\" indicate bone and cartilage sides of the sample, respectively, with the arrows marking the junction between bone and cartilage cells. The asterisks indicate where mineralization begins. The bone that developed during spaceflight (top) shows less mineral compared to the control sample (bottom); the control sample clearly shows mineral deposits (dark spots) that are absent in the flight sample. NASA's Johnson Space Center image . 65 These therapeutics could be used to both stop bone loss or stimulate the generation of bone material while the crew member is in flight. ADF- Otolith studies how the absence of gravity during the body's formative stage affects basic neural function in an effort to isolate the major influences on the neurovesti bular system, the system that allows us to control our eye movement, balance, and coordination. R ESULTS ADF -OTOLITH The inner ear bones of the embryos developed in microgravity appear to be larger than those found in the controls that remained on Earth. There are some indications that the fan- shaped arrangement of receptor cells may also be altered under the influence o f microgravity. Conclusive data from this investigation is pending further analysis (Increment 4 One Year Postflight Report). ADF -SKELETAL No spaceflight effects were observed for osteocalcin levels in the day 12 embryos, based on bone matrix stating. Since osteocalcin reflects the degree of bone mineralization, this would suggest that mineralization is not affected in an older embryo. However, direct mineralization quantitative studies have not been reported for day 7 and day 12 embryos, which should provide definitive evidence for whether osteocalcin- associated processes are affected. The second finding was that the spaceflight embryos on the spinning carousel or stationary carousel had a reduced level of collagen -synthesizing acti vity as compared to the ground control specimens, although the sample size was small. If this trend is validated, it would suggest that spaceflight has a component that can affect collagen synthesis that is not correctable by an applied 1 g force. These in sights might be important for the development of appropriate countermeasures for space travel. (Increment 4 One Year Postflight Report). Due to the limited number of samples, statistical analysis was never completed and therefore the work was not publishable. These investigations are complete and all results are published.

Horn, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany Christian Dournon, Universite Henri Poincare , Nancy, France RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Embryonic Development of Amphibians in Weightlessness (Aquarius) investigation studies whether altered gravity affects vestibulocular and spinal motor systems in a correlated manner on xenopus laevis embryos. R ESULTS After exposure to altered gravity, each tadpole was tested for its roll-induced vestibulocular reflex (rVOR) and 3 hours later it was tested for the neuronal activity recorded from the ventral roots during fictive swimming . It was observed that weightlessness affected ventral root activity during fictive swimming and rVOR . In particular, ventral root activity changes included a significant decrease of the rostrocaudal delay and a significant increase of episode duration. The rVOR -amplitude was transiently depressed . All modifications of the rVOR and ventral root -activity recovered to normal levels within 4 to 7 days after termination of altered gravity. Significant correlations between the rVOR amplitude and ventral root activity during the recording period have been observed in both tadpoles with or without altered gravity experience. The data are consiste nt with the assumptions that during this period of life, which is characterized by a progressive development of vestibulocular and vestibulospinal projections (i), weightlessness retards the development of ventral root activity while hypergravity accelerat es it; (ii) that retards the rVOR development while hypergravity caused a sensitization, and that (iii) altered gravity induced changes of ventral root activity during fictive swimming have a vestibular UBLICATION (S) Boser S, Dournon C, Gualandris -Parisot L, Horn ER.

Bateman, PhD, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Commercial Biomedical Testing Module: Effects of Osteoprotegerin on Bone Maintenance in Microgravity (CBTM) provides the capab ility to use the microgravity environment for evaluation of new pharmaceutical candidates in small mammals. Results may expedite the review of new pharmaceuticals for allowing immediate access to new disease treatments. E ARTH BENEFITS In microgravity, the messages received by the osteoblasts and osteoclasts are altered. Specifically, without the stresses caused by the Earth's gravitational pull, osteoclasts remove more bone and osteoblasts deposit less new bone. Understanding how these signals change and how OPG mitigates these changes gives scientists insigh t in how to fight bone loss in crew members during long - duration spaceflight and in osteoporosis patients on Earth as osteoporosis is a major public health threat for an estimated 44 million people worldwide. S PACE BENEFITS Crew members suffer from a sig nificant loss of bone mass during spaceflight, the International Space Station (ISS) Medical Project office has developed some countermeasures to hinder the rapid loss of bone mass. Despite these countermeasures , bone mass loss continues to be a problem fo r crew members. Finding additional countermeasures increases the overall health of crew members on long -duration missions. R ESULTS During ISS Expedition 4, 24 female mice were flown to ISS on shuttle flight STS -108 in 3AEMs. The AEMs remained on STS -108 throughout the 12 -day mission. Mice exposed to microgravity exhibited a 15 %-20% decline in femur elastic strength and a 40 %- 60% decrease in bone formation when compared to the controls. The femur elastic strength decline was caused by 3 mechanisms: reduc ed bone formation, increased bone resorption, and inhibition of mineralization. OPG treatment in mice exposed to microgravity nearly reversed the Image on the left shows a microCT image of trabecular bone from proximal tibia from spaceflight mouse compared to ground control mouse on right. NASA's Marshall Space Center image . 69 decline in strength and the increase in bone resorption found in untreated mice (Bateman 2004). Mechanical t esting data were complimented by serum, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), and histological analyses that indicated a decline in bone formation and an increase in bone resorption in addition to an inhibition of mineralization. OPG mitigated the decline in mechanical strength by preventing increase in resorption and maintaining mineralization. In addition to this detailed analysis of skeletal properties, a secondary analysis of calf muscles from placebo -treated specimens was performed to collect baseline dat a to validate space -flown mice as an appropriate model for sarcopenia (age -related muscle loss). Spaceflight caused a 15 %-30% decline in muscle fiber diameter size compared to appropriate ground controls (Harrison 2003). Data obtained from the mice following return to Earth indicated some alternations in immune functions. Analysis of the spleenocytes (immune cells produced by the spleen) indicated an increase in B -cell (white blood cell that matures in the bone marrow and, when stimulated by an antigen, differentiates into plasma cells) production compared to T - cells (white blood cells that complete maturation in the thymus and have various roles in the immune system). A slightly lower white blood -cell count in the flight animals compared to the controls was not statistically significant. The spleen mass was 18 %-28% lower in flight mice compared to controls. Results also indicated that flight mice weighed 10 %-12% less than ground controls (Pecaut 2003). The abili ty to survive a major physical trauma in microgravity may be compromised due to an altered immune system. Platelets (constituent of blood that promotes clotting at the site of injury) are the primary cells involved in the wound healing process. The animals studied had significantly higher platelet levels but low volume compared to the controls. This indicates that the lack of platelets in the wound -healing process is not a problem but that platelets formed in microgravity have a decreased functionality in t he wound healing process. Data indicated that a short stay in microgravity can induce significant changes in immune defense mechanisms, hematopoiesis (blood cell formation), and other aspects of health (Gridley 2003). Analysis of microarray data revealed that 272 mRNAs were significantly altered by spaceflight, the majority of which displayed similar responses to hindlimb suspension, while reloading tended to counteract these responses. Several mRNAs altered by spaceflight were associated with muscle grow th, including the PI3 kinase regulatory subunit p85 alpha, insulin response substrate -1, box O1 transcription factor, and MAFbx/atrogin1. Moreover, myostatin mRNA expression tended to increase while mRNA levels of the myostatin inhibitor FSTL3 tended to decrease in response to spaceflight. In addition, mRNA levels of the slow - Fluorescent image of femur diaphysis from ground control placebo treated mouse, indicating greatly decreased bone formation (calcein label indicates where bone was forming at the time of launch, allowing quantification of bone formation rates during flight. NASA's Marshall Space Center image . 70 oxidative fiber associated and factor PPAR -alpha were significantly decreased in spaceflight gastrocnemius. Finally, spaceflight resulted in a significant decrease in levels of the microRNA miR -206. Together these data demonstrate that spaceflight induces significant changes in mRNA expression of genes associated with muscle growth and fiber type (Allen 2008).

Han, MD, PhD, Amgen Research, Thousand Oaks, Calif ornia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Commercial Biomedical Test Module - 2 (CBTM -2) uses a validated mouse model to examine the effectiveness of an experimental therapeutic as a possible countermeasure for muscle atrophy. E ARTH BENEFITS Muscle atrophy resulting from disuse and reduced physical activity affects millions of Americans particularly in the aging population. This condition contri butes to increased bone fractures, negative metabolic changes and decreased levels of physical activity. Results from this investigation could help inform the development of potential interventions for muscle wasting related to a range of disease s, includ ing cancer, kidney failure and age -related frailty. S PACE BENEFITS Testing the effects of a potential countermeasure to the muscle loss that occurs during long - duration spaceflight can potentially provide NASA with a non- exercise, therapeutic countermeasure that helps ensure crew member health and well being. RESULTS During International Space Station (ISS) Expedition 15, 24 mice were flown to the ISS on shuttle flight STS -118 in 3 Animal Enclosure Modules ( AEMs). The AEMs remained on STS- 118 throughout the mission. Utilizing a tissue sharing program CBTM -2 was able to support several additional investigations that have yielded the results below. Expression and localization of vascular myocyte calcium release channels Researchers found that exposure to m icrogravity during 8 days in the ISS decreases the expression of the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1), which is a calcium release channel inside cells in primary cultured myocytes (muscle cells) from rate hepatic portal vein. Identical results were found in por tal vein from mice exposed to microgravity during an 8 -day shuttle spaceflight. To evaluate the functional consequences of this physiological adaptation, evoked calcium signals obtained in myocytes from hindlimb unloaded rats, in which the shift of blood pressure mimics S118E09308 - The Commercial Biomedical Test Module - 2 (CBTM -2) hardware seen in this image flew onboard STS - 118/13A.1 in August 2007. CBTM -2 test s the effectiveness of an experimental therapeutic as a possible countermeasure for muscle atrophy. 72 the effects of microgravity, were compared to those obtained in smooth muscle cells from rats injected with a chemical agent directed against the RyR1 protein. In both conditions , calcium release was significantly decreased. In contrast, in spontaneous hypertensive rats, an increase in RyR1 expression was observed as well as the calcium- induced calcium release mechanism. Taken together, these results show that myocytes were directly sensitive to gravity level and that they adapt their calcium signaling pathways to vascular pressure by the regulation of the RyR1 expression. Effect of space flight on macrophase differentiation and activation This study involved the analysis of bone marrow cells from the CB<T -2 payload following a 13 - day flight o n the space shuttle to determine how spaceflight affected differentiation of cells in the granulocytic lineage (important white blood cells produced in the bone marrow). The bone marrow cells were isolated from the humerii (long bones of the upper limb or forelimb) of mice. A cell counting method was utilized to assess the expression of several molecules (Ly6C,CD11b,CD31 (PECAM -1),Ly6G (Gr -1),F4/80,CD44 and c -Fos) that defines the maturation state of cells in the granulocytic lineage on 3 bone marrow cell s ubpopulations (R1, R2 and R3) defined by their size and light scattering properties. There were no observable characteristic differences between total bone marrow cells isolated from flight and ground -control mice. Nevertheless, there were subpopulation di fferences observed that suggests neutrophil activation in response to landing. Decreases were noticed in Ly6C, c -Fos, CD44high and Ly6G. An increase in F4/80 suggested that the cells in the bone marrow R3 subpopulation of the mice flown on the shuttle were more differentiated compared to the ground -controls. A loss in body weight was also noticed in the mice that flew in space that suggest that they were subjected to chronic stress beyond what was endured on landing. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to suggest that there are significant changes in bone marrow phenotype in response to the stress of the spaceflight experience (Ortega 2008). The effects of spaceflight on stress and immunity Understanding lymphocyte activity associated with spaceflight stresso rs is important in determining the impact on associated cancer risk. This study examined the T -lymphocytes in C57BL/6 mice (a traditional inbred strain of lab mice) after the return from a 13 -day space shuttle mission. Flight mice (FLT) and ground controls similarly housed in Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs) were evaluated within 3 to 5 hours after landing. Muscle strength testing and nuclear magnetic resonance body composition measurements were performed on the mice. After euthanasia (painlessly put to deat h), spleen and thymus samples were analyzed. DNA synthesis in splenocytes (any one of the different white blood cell types situated in the spleen) from FLT mice was low in response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA -plant chemical used to stimulate the multiplicat ion of white blood cells, specifically T cells) compared to AEM controls. There was a lower percentage of T cells and higher percentage of natural killer (NK) cells (both of which are involved in attacking tumor cells) , in the FLT mice, but the percentage of B cells (involved in producing antibodies) were similar to AEM controls. The secretion capacity of 4 cytokines (small secreted proteins that serve to regulate the immune system) in response to activation via signaling molecules, similarly to what occurs in the body, was significantly different in the FLT mice compared with the AEM controls. Cancer -related gene expression 73 profiles in the thymus differed greatly between the FLT mice and the AEM groups. The data obtained from this study collectively exhibits that T cell distribution, function , and gene expression are significantly modified shortly after return from the spaceflight environment. However, it remains to be determined whether the quantified changes are brief and primarily due to the tremendous physiological stress of landing and readaptation or have an enduring effect on risk for infection and/or cancer (Gridley 2009). Studies have shown that the spaceflight environment can impact several physiological systems potentially resulting in serious con sequences for immunity. The primary aim of this study was to investigate changes in immune parameters concerning the spleen, liver, and thymus in response to flight. C57BL/6 mice (a common inbred strain of lab mice) were flown on a 13 -day space shuttle mis sion. In response to flight, the mice exhibited reductions in liver, spleen, and thymus masses in comparison to ground controls. The changes in organ masses suggest that the mice were subject to psychological and/or physiological stress inflight or during landing. Splenic (pertaining to the spleen) white blood cells (WBCs) and numbers of leukocyte (cells in the blood that destroy disease -causing microorganisms) subpopulations were significantly reduced after flight. To determine the recovery and proliferati ve capacity of lymphocytes, this study characterized spontaneous blastogenesis (unstimulated DNA synthesis). The observed increase in [3H] -TdR incorporation into DNA (tritiated thymidine -method for cell regeneration) by splenic lymp hocytes demonstrated that ex vivo (outside the body) DNA synthesis was increased after flight and suggests that cells were capable of shifting into a proliferative (or recovery) state once removed from any stress -induced inhibition in vivo (inside the body ). In contrast, LPS (lipopolysaccharides -large molecules found in the outer membrane of many common bacteria) induced proliferation was decreased in the flight mice, indicating that the ability to respond to a potent B cell mitogen (substance that indices cell division) may be compromised. The flight mice demonstrated an increased capacity to produce biological responses, interleukin -6 and interleukin 10 (IL -6 and IL -10- chemical messengers secreted by cells of the immune system), but not TNF - (Tumor Necro sis Factor- alpha- protein that can cause tumor cell death when injected into tumor -bearing mice). The genes responsible for scavenging ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species play vital roles in normal cell functions, but are also sources of tissue and DNA damage) were shown to be up -regulated after flight. The data confirm that immune parameters are influenced by the spaceflight environment. Furthermore, these data also suggest that exposure to the spaceflight environment can increase anti - inflammatory mechanisms and change the ex vivo response to LPS, which is a bacterial component that typically indices a strong response from the immune system (Farnaz 2009). Genetic analysis in young adult mice at 8 weeks of age after exposure to spaceflight aboard the space shut tle for a period of 13 -days demonstrate that spaceflight induces significant changes in mRNA expression of genes in the thymus that regulate stress, hormone receptor metabolism, and T white blood cell signaling activity. These data explain, in part, the re ported systemic compromise of the immune system after exposure to microgravity. The results of the study provide insight into how spaceflight affects stress -related gene expression in addition to influencing genes associated with specific immunological pro cesses in the thymus itself. The 74 results also show a connection between many of the altered genes via their relation to a wide range of physiologic processes, including stress and immune response (Lebsack 2010). Space radiation and microgravity effects on regulation of lung tissue NASA has reported pulmonary abnormalities in crew members on space missions, but changes in lung tissue have not been fully documented. CBTM- 2 evaluated the health effects on the lungs resulting from increased levels of radiation , inhalation of possible pathogen, and low oxygen levels. Tissue examination showed profibrosis -like (excess growth of fibrous connective tissue) changes occurred in flown mice, more abundant collagen accumulation around blood vessels, and thicker walls co mpared with lung samples from ground mice. However, no marked abnormality was found in bronchiolar and alveolar lining. The findings suggest that the flight mice may have experienced some degree of lung remodeling. Taken together, the data demonstrate that significant changes can be readily detected shortly after return from spaceflight in the expression of factors that can adversely affect lung function. The study concludes that compromised lung function that is due to spaceflight may result from disturbance of the balance between deposition and breakdown of connective tissue within the lungs. In the future, investigations should be performed on samples taken during flight, after long -term missions, and at later time points after landing to fully document t he take -off, residence in space, landing and oxygen availability effects on lung morphology (Tian 2009). Ovarian follicular and luteal development in the spaceflight mouse This study aimed to assess changes in the gross morphology of the ovarian tissue fr om mice flown on shuttle mission STS- 118 and tissues from corresponding control animals. The experiment consisted of 3 groups of animals: 2 sets of control animals and 1 set of flight animals (each set contained 12 mice). The results showed that there was a presence of developing follicles (structures that contain immature eggs) at all stages as well as the presence of corpora lutea (structure formed after the release of the egg) in all 3 treatment groups indicating no significant gross morphological change s occur within ovarian tissue when exposed to spaceflight for 13 days or less. Flight tissue was morphologically indistinguishable from both ground control and baseline tissue. Future studies of this nature should consider the stages of the estrous cycle for each mouse both pre and postflight. This should be confirmed with hormonal data as well as by vaginal smears. Mice should be housed in as small groups as possible. The scent of male excreta could be introduced to the environment to circumvent the Lee -Boot effect, where the estrous cycle of female mice is prolonged or halted in crowded environments or those that lack a male. Analysis of the ovarian tissue should go beyond gros s morphology and should look at indicators such as capillary density and kit ligand, a signaling molecule important in the formation of eggs, and expression (Smith 2012). Effects of spaceflight on the expression of liver proteins in the mouse The aim was to investigate changes in the profile of major liver proteins of the mouse that are introduced by conditions associated with spaceflight. Raw data was derived from mass spectroscopic analyses of formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded tissue sections of liver fr om mice. 75 The raw data was analyzed by 2 different search engines, using shotgun proteomics, a process by which the proteins are digested and the smaller components separated and read. Statistically significant (p<0.05) changes of 8 proteins were achieved i n the mouse liver. Of the 8 proteins, only carbamoyl -phosohate synthetase and 60kDa heat shock protein, a chaperonin, gave significant positive log 2 fold change values, a statistical approach for detecting differential expression. Carbomoyl -phosphate synthetase was the protein present in the highest concentration, and up- regulation is consistent with increased amino acid breakdown resulting from gravitational changes and/or stress associated with missions in space. Glycine N - methyltransferase, a methyl grou p transferring enzyme which participates in detoxification chemistry in the liver cells was down -regulated. Fructose -bisphosphate aldolase B levels were also down -regulated. Results reveal 8 of the 67 proteins showed statistical differences between flight and ground. Some of these are linked to detoxification pathways within the liver (carbamoyl -phosohate synthetase, glycine N (fructose -bisphosphate aldolase B, alpha -enolase). The 60kDa heat shock protein was up -regulated, probably because of its relation to stress. Regucalcin was highly down- regulated possibly limiting osteoporosis. Ribonuclease UK114, also known as heat responsive protein 12, was down regulated also po ssibly due to the stress of spaceflight (Gridley 2012). P UBLICATION (S) Romer C, Forsman AD.

Humans and animals have been observed to lose bone mass during the reduced gravity of spaceflight. CBTM -3-Vascular Atrophy specifically determines if there is a correlation between spaceflight induced alte red blood supply to the bones and surrounding tissues with a resultant loss of bone mass. EARTH BENEFITS As noted in the preceding paragraph, if a correlation is found between blood supply to bone and bone mass regulation, new insights into the mechanisms governing how the body responds to skeletal unloading can likely result. These insights might lead not only to new therapies for maintaining a healthy musculoskeletal system during long -duration spaceflights but also new therapies for treating muscle and bone wasting diseases on the Earth. S PACE BENEFITS If a correlation is found between blood supply to bone and bone mass regulation, new insights into the mechanisms governing how the body responds to skeletal unloading can result. Such insights may lead t o new therapies for maintaining a healthy musculoskeletal system during long -duration spaceflights. R ESULTS Ground -based studies in rats subjected to chronic head- down tail suspension have been conducted to simulate the fluid shift towards the head and ge neral cardiovascular deconditioning that occurs with spaceflight. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis, derived from the results of the aforementioned experiments, that 13 days of spaceflight aboard the STS -135 mission would enhance narrowing of the blood vessels, increase the thickness of the innermost layers of the arterial wall, and elicit no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries (Taylor 2013). Contrary to the hypothesis, the results showed that myogenic vasoconstriction was less in cerebral arteries from spaceflight mice, passive pressure -diameter response indicated greater ability for vascular expansion and contraction and mechanical testing revealed that the arteries from spaceflight animals had lower effectiv e elastic modulus (tendency to be deformed when force is applied) and stiffness. Gross structural measurements demonstrated that maximal diameter was greater in spaceflight mice, while medial wall thickness of cerebral arteries was 80 not different between sp aceflight and ground control mice. These results demonstrate that spaceflight alters vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and gross structural properties of cerebral resistance arteries. Collectively, these changes in the functional vasoconstrictor and mechanical properties of cerebral arteries suggest that blood flow to the brain may be elevated during spaceflight. Although elevated partial pressure of CO 2 in the closed microgravity environment may contribute to alterations in the properties of cerebral arteries, high CO 2 levels alone cannot fully account for such changes. Finally, if similar alterations in the properties of cerebral arteries occur in crew members, elevations in brain blood flow could serve to elevate intracranial pressure and possibly contribute to the visual impairment reported to occur in crew members (Taylor 2013). Cardiovascular adaptations to microgravity undermine the physiologic capacity to respond to challenges related to an upright posture on return to terrestrial gravity. This study inve stigates the influence of spaceflight on the constriction of mouse muscle arteries either in response to a stimulus (vasoconstriction) or under their own power (myogenic contraction) and to determine the impacts on bone and muscle mass loss. Total body mass tended to be lower in spaceflight animals, and muscle mass was 7 %-13% lower in spaceflight mice. Spaceflight was found to decrease vasoconstrictor responses but did not affect the myogenic responsiveness. The thickness of the vessel walls was not found to differ between the two groups. The lack of change in vessel wall thickness suggests that the blood volume redistribution is insignificant in mice during spaceflight and likely reflects that blood flow to the portion of muscle being tested was preserved. This is an important shortcoming and demonstrates that the mouse may not be an ideal animal model to study this phenomenon. If applicable to the human condition, these results suggest that microgravity -induced changes in the vasoconstrictor characteristic s of skeletal muscle resistance arteries could compromise the ability to raise peripheral vascular resistance in order to regulate arterial blood pressure when standing (Stabley 2012).

ELEGANS TO ASSESS GENOMIC DAMAGE ON LONG-DURATION FLIGHTS (ELERAD ) Research Area Animal Biology - Vertebrates Expedition(s) 14 Principal investigator(s) David L. Baillie PhD, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada RESEARCH OBJECTIVES C. Elegans to Assess Genomic Damage on Long -Duration Flights (Elerad) uses the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a biological dosimeter of space radiation. Using specific regions of the C. elegans genome, this study determines the types of damage induced by space radiation, studies accumulating doses of radiation, and assesses the rate, and type of mutations. The study also makes it possible to map the location of genetic rearrangements within worms. E ARTH BENEFITS Space provides a unique laboratory to study how life and physiologic functions adapt from the cellular level to that of the entire organism. The results obtained in this set of experiments demonstrate that the model organism C. elegans can be used to study the effects of altered gravity and suggest that C. elegans respond to radiation experienced during spaceflight by altering the expression of genes of interest to development of human countermeasures. S PACE BENEFITS As space exploration opens new horizons, it is crucial to be able to provide countermeasures to the effects of the space environment on the human body. The fact that the biological results obtained with C. elegans appear to have strong similarities to those obtained in human beings, suggests t hat not only does C. elegans prove an invaluable model for understanding the fundamental biological changes seen during spaceflight, but that it may also be crucial for understanding those changes associated with human health concerns in space. R ESULTS The exploration of space and colonization of other planets involves numerous physiological changes induced by known factors such as microgravity and radiation exposure. Genetic changes are yet unknown in humans but highly -likely to occur. To accelerate disco very of genetic changes in novel experimental conditions, C. elegans , a model organism was used. (Model organisms are non -human species with fully -sequenced genomes that have already been extensively studied and are able to provide insights that parallel h uman results.) Elerad evaluated reproductive organ radiation damage that can be passed on to offspring during a prolonged period aboard the International Space Station. The eventual goal is the development of an integrating biological dosimeter for spacefl ight. P UBLICATIONS Oczypok EA, Etheridge T, Freeman J, et al.

Research conducted with the MDS is an analog to the human research program, which has the objective to extend the human presence safely beyond low -Earth orbit. E ARTH BENEFITS Microgravity is considered by the scientific community as an accelerated model for studying terrestrial osteoporosis. Results obtained in this space experiment facilitate the understanding of genetic elements that protect people from osteoporosis. The targeted users are crew members after a long - term space mission, elderly people (especially post -menopausal women), and patients after long -time immobilization. S PACE BENEFITS Crew members suffer from a significant loss of bone mass during spaceflight; the International Space Station (ISS) Medical Project office has developed some countermeasures to hinder the rapid loss of bone mass. Despite these countermeasures , bone mass loss continues to be a problem for crew members. Finding additional countermeasures increases the overall health of crew members on long -duration missions. R ESULTS Mice Drawer System (MDS) reached the ISS on board Shuttle Discovery Flight 17A/STS- 128 on August 28, 2009. MDS returned to Earth on November 27, 2009, on Shuttle Atlantis Flight ILF3/STS- 129 after a 91 -day stay, performing the longest duration of mice in space. MDS flew 3 wild -type (Wt) and 3 pleiotrophic transgenic (PTN) mice to determine the micr ogravity effects levied on each mouse. Unfortunately, during the investigation, 1 PTN mouse and 2 Wt mice died due to either health related or payload -related reasons. MDS participated in a Tissue Sharing Program with 20 different research groups in order to determine if microgravity induced any tissue modifications, with a primary focus on bone loss (Cancedda 2012). S128E007107 - Astronauts Nicole Stott, Expedition 20 flight engineer; and Patrick Forrester, STS -128 mission specialist, work in the Kibo laboratory of the International Space Station while Space Shuttle Discovery remains docked to the station. 85 Bone turnover in wild type and pleiotrophin -transgenic mice housed for 3 months in the International Space Station One of the major goals of the MDS experiment was to investigate bone alterations in 3 Wt and 3 PTN -Tg male mice (2 months old at the time of launch) after 3 -month permanence aboard the ISS. The study revealed bone loss during spaceflight in the weight -bearing bones of both strains . For both PTN -Tg and Wt mice a decrease of the trabecular number as well as an increase of the mean trabecular separation was observed after the flight, whereas trabecular thickness did not show any significant change. Non weight- bearing bones were not affected. The PTN -Tg mice exposed to normal gravity presented a poorer trabecular organization then Wt mice, but interestingly, the expression of the PTN transgene during flight resulted in some protection against microgravity's negative effects. Moreover, osteocytes of the Wt mice, but not of PTN -Tg mice, acquired a round shape, thus showing for the first time osteocyte space -related morphological alterations in vivo. The analysis of specific bone formation and resorption marker expression suggested that t he microgravity -induced bone loss was due to both an increased bone resorption and decreased bone deposition. Apparently, the PTN -Tg protection was the result of higher osteoblast activity in the flight mice (Travella 2012). Effects of long -term spaceflight on erythrocytes and oxidative stress of Rodents Several hematological modifications in humans were observed after microgravity exposure such as depression of T -cell lymphocyte activation and of our ability to fight infectious microorganisms. Moreover erythrocyte (red blood cell) hemolysis (breakdown) and hemoglobin loss was also observed after space missions. In addition, space radiations can induce generation of hydroxyl radicals, very reactive at the site of their formation, which can initiate a chain of reactions leading to lipid peroxidation (causing cell damage). In the MDS mice, after landing, blood cell parameter showed a higher erythrocyte concentration (RBC) and RDW% with a hematocrit near or above 50%. Platelets were increased in both Wt and TG mice after flight, while hemoglobin content remained constant. These data are partially in accordance with human data after space mission and could probably be the consequence of body fluid shift and altered renal function. After spacefligh t, both Wt and Tg mice underwent oxidative stress and an increase of by - products of lipid peroxidation concentration. In parallel antioxidant and enzymes involved in the elimination of hydroperoxides from lipids were also enhanced with higher levels in Tg. After the MDS mission, mice erythrocytes presented modifications in the cell membrane composition and an increase of lipid peroxidation products. Despite their cellular activation, antioxidant defenses were not sufficient to prevent damages caused by oxidative stress (Rizzo 2012). 86 Adaptation of mouse skeletal muscle to long -term microgravity in the MDS mission So far, the effect of microgravity on skeletal muscles has been examined in mice only after a short -term (5 -20 day) exposition. It has been obser ved that spaceflight has adverse effects on muscles, including atrophy and partial shift of muscle fibres towards a faster, more glycolytic phenotype. The MDS experiment gave the first opportunity to study long time exposure to microgravity effects on ske letal muscles. After the 91 day flight, muscle atrophy was observed in the fibres of the soleus muscle, but this atrophy was only slightly increased when compared to shorter period s in microgravity. Alterations were observed in the soleus and to a lesser e xtent in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, in particular with regard to slow -to-fast fibre transition and ion channel activity. Gene expression of the atrophy -related ubiquitin ligases was up -regulated in both soleus EDL muscles from flight mice, whereas autophagy (self -degradation) was in the control range. In the same animals, various stress related genes were up -regulated in the EDL, but not in the soleus. Overall, gene expression results suggested that EDL muscle may resist microgravity - induced atrophy by activating compensatory and protective mechanisms and identified some molecular targets for the development of countermeasures (Sandona 2012) . The impact of long -term exposure to space environment on adult mammalian organisims : A study on a mouse thyroid and testis Human hormonal levels are known to change during spaceflight , but the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. To clarify this point, thyroid and testis/epididymis from the flight and ground control mice were analyzed both mor phologically and functionally. While Wt ground samples showed variable size and spatial orientation, spaceflight animals had a more homogenous thyroid tissue structure with a reduction in the interior spacing. In spaceflight animals , the follicular size in both Wt and Tg mice was greatly varied. Structural modification correlated with altered thyroid functionality. Both Wt and Tg cells stimulated with thyrotropin enhanced cAMP production in ground cells. After spaceflight a more pronounced enhancement with Wt mice was observed. At the end of the MDS experiment, the thyrotropin receptor and caveolin- 1 in the thyroid were overexpressed in the spaceflight mice. MDS integrated inside the Double Payload Container. ASI image . 87 In testes, the spaceflight mice showed severe degenerative changes, in some cases with tubules almost devoid of spermatozoa except for few spermatogonia. Tubular degeneration was not homogenous and differences were not seen between Wt and Tg mice. The expression of androgen and fol licle stimulating hormone receptors increased while luteinizing hormone receptor levels were not changed. These data indicate that several changes occur in relevant endocrine organs under the control of the pituitary gland and they could be responsible fo r variations of hormone levels in humans during space missions, significantly affecting the endocrine homeostasis of the body, as well as the reproductive function (Masini 2012). Loss of parafollicular cells during gravitational changes (Microgravity, Hyp ergravity) and the secret effect of Pleiotrophin Bone loss is one of the most important complications for crewmembers who are exposed to long -term microgravity. Changes in blood flow and systemic hormones were indicated as important contributing elements t o the response of the mechanical loading experienced by osteoblast cells. Here, the possible biological involvement of thyroid C cells is being investigated. This study has provided evidence that both microgravity and hypergravity induce similar loss of thyroid C cells with reduction of calcitonin production. Pleiotrophin over -expression results in some protection against negative effects of gravity change. To confirm these results it would be important to know blood levels of calcitonin in hypogravity and hypergravity environments and this could be an area of study for future missions (Albi -a 2012). Observing the mouse thyroid Sphingomyelin under space conditions : A case study from the MDS Mission in comparison with hypergravity conditions Histological ex amination of the thyroid gland revealed an increase in the average follicle size compared to that of 3 control animals and 3 animals exposed to hypergravity (2g) conditions in a centrifuge. Additional analysis detected an increase in two thyroid gland enzy mes, sphingomyelinase and sphingomyelin -synthase1. In addition, sphingomyelinase, an enzyme traditionally confined to the cell nucleus in the control animals, was found in the mouse exposed to hypogravity to be homogenously distributed throughout the cell bodies (Albi -b 2012). Evaluation of gene , protein and neutrophin expression in the brain of mice exposed to space environment for 91 days While modification in the central nervous system are described in literature after short space missions, long -term inhibition of antigravity activity on the mouse brain are unclear. After the MDS experiment, the effects of the 3 -month exposure to microgravity environment on the expression of genes and proteins in the mouse brain were studied. 88 Several genes related t o the immune response, metabolic process, and/or inflammatory responses were up -regulated whereas several genes involved in various metabolic and catabolic processes were down -regulated. Two proteins, BDNF and NGF, which are involved in learning and memory performance, ageing -related disorders , and anxiety -like behavior were studied in the brain and adrenal gland. Expression on NGF in hippocampus, cortex, and adrenal gland of wild type animals tended to decrease following spaceflight, but together with BDNF it was not consistent suggesting only a transient response to spaceflight and not long -lasting effects. On the contrary CRMP1 was up- regulated in flight samples and, since the CRMP1 deficient mice showed an impaired spatial learning and memory, memory performance may be stimulated after spaceflight. Exposure to space environment influenced the expression of a number of genes and proteins in the brain that have been shown to be involved in a wide spectrum of biological function and appears to interfere with expression of neuropeptides involved in psycho -neuro -endocrine adaptations that should need a deeper examination in a MDS re -flight (Masini 2012). Evaluation of long term space permanence effects on other tissues of mice exposed to space environment for 3 months Additional tissues are currently being processed and additional data collected by the different Principal Investigators.

Space Explorers on future long -duration space missions may require preflight vaccinations or other precautions to prevent infection during space travel if immune memory is not retained. E ARTH BENEFITS Understanding the mechanisms of immune regulation is critical to the design of rational therapeutic interventions of these various disease processes. The immunosuppression observed during spaceflight provides important insight into the role of gravity in the generation of normal immune responses. Deciphering the mechanisms of spaceflight immu nosuppression provides a more complete picture of the important factors necessary for successful immune responses that may be masked in Earth -based experiments in the presence of gravity. These gravity -sensitive factors may hold the key to our ability to manipulate the immune system and develop therapeutic interventions to treat the various disease processes affected by immunodysregulation. Dysregulated immune tolerance (overactive immune system) is linked to autoimmune diseases such as type I diabetes mel litus, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. On the other hand, many disease processes result from immunosuppression (underactive immune system). S PACE BENEFITS Spaceflight immunosuppression is a significant obstacle to long -term human space travel. Of foremost concern is whether space travelers may be able to generate effective protective Image of the Animal Enclosure Module that house s the rodents used in the Mouse Immunology investigation. NASA's Ames Research Center image , Moffett Field, C alifornia. 91 immune responses against infections while in space. Using an innovative mouse experimental model, this set of experimen ts tests whether initial specific activation of T cells is intact and whether memory T cell function is maintained during spaceflight. RESULTS Results indicate that the process of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cell differentiation in bone marrow is p rofoundly altered under conditions of reduced mechanical load in microgravity, with retention of stem cell characteristics and a broad down -regulation in marrow differentiation capacity. This phenomenon is revealed in multiple cell types, including osteocl asts and osteoblasts required for bone remodeling and mineral homeostasis, erythrocytes required for the transport of oxygen and iron throughout the body, and megakaryocytes required for the formation of platelets. These results also suggest that under conditions of reduced gravitational mechanical load, such as physical inactivity, mechanical disuse conditions, and spaceflight, it is likely that differentiation of somatic stem cells, such as in bone and blood, may be inhibited, possibly resulting in serious regenerative health effects (Blaber 2013) .

Garofalo, MD, The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, Tex as RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Effect of Spacef light on Innate Immunity to Respiratory Viral Infections (Mouse Immunology - 2) investigates the effects of microgravity on immune function to fight Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). In microgravity, crew members experience changes in immune function. These studies help scientists determine the biological significance of spaceflight induced changes i n immune responses. E ARTH BENEFITS Understanding the function of the immune system during spaceflight may have great relevance to our understanding of the process of aging and/or stress- related immunomodulation (adjustments in the level of an immune response) on Earth. In particular, stud ying the innate host response against pathogens during/after spaceflight provides novel data on the function of the respiratory mucosal response to viral pathogens. S PACE BENEFITS These investigations are expected to generate new scientific evidence of the immune pathways that are affected in antiviral host response during spaceflight and possible preventive or therapeutic approaches applicable to future space missions. R ESULTS This experiment has produced a significant amount of data and researchers are currently in the process of writing a manuscript to submit for peer review.

Actin is 1 of 2 proteins involved in muscle contraction and is found in both smooth and striated muscles. It also serves as an important structural molecule. R ESULTS Preliminary experiments were performed during two sounding rocket flights. The observed effects of microgravity on cell morphology suggested that the actin microfilament system was sensitive to gravity conditions. Analysis of the cells by fluorescence microscopy and by fluorometry revealed that the F -actin content of the cells was increased in microgravity conditions. These preliminary observations, however, clearly indicate that the actin microfilament system may represent a gravity -sensitive cell component. Ground controls samples provided predictable results. Cells showed normal actin morphology and number of ruffles indicating that the cells survived the long period of starvation and exposure to room temperature during the experiment. Cells that were not stimulated showed abundant stress fibers and a pool of G -actin mainly localized around the nucleus. After stimulation with Platelet -Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) the number of stress fibers decreased and both F -actin and G -actin were found in circular ruffles indicating an extensive reorganization of actin. Unfortunately no flight results were obtained due to a combination of malfunctioning hardware and unfu lfilled temperature requirements. . September 2007;19(5- 6):180- 183. doi: 10.1007/BF02919477.

Embryos of the amphibian Pleurodeles waltl are allowed to develop during 10 days of spaceflight in Mini -Aquaria, either in weightlessness or on a 1 g control centrifuge. Tissue samples are collected either immediately on return or 25 days postflight for analysis. R ESULTS This experiment revealed that Immunolglobin M (IgM) heavy -chain transcription was doubled at landing. To determine which space -related environmental modification was responsible for this change, environmental modifications encountered by embryos dur ing their development on the ISS were recreated on ground. This approach demonstrated the fact that gravity changed during Pleurodeles waltl development, and induced a change in IgM heavy -chain transcription. Moreover, this change was associated with var iations in nuclear factor kappa- light -chain -enhancer of activated cells (NF-) mRNA levels, which play a key role in regulating immune response. Given that P. waltl larvae were not immunized during the mission, data suggested that an alteration of B lymphocyte generation could occur if gravity is modified during P. waltl development . The amounts of transcripts encoding NF - molecules were increased in P. waltl embr yos that developed at 3 g and were decreased in those that developed under simulated microgravity, as was shown in human T cells. Important immunological information can be deduced from space experiments performed with an amphibian species. Finally, it c an be shown that an immature vestibular system is transiently sensitive to microgravity exposure and that its exposure to hypergravity leads to a slowly growing vestibular sensitization.

Petrov, PhD, Biopreparat, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Effect of Spaceflight Factors on the Expression of Producer Strains of Interleukin 1 , 1, and Aryl (Aryl) investigation develops a method of increasing the productivity of recombinant producer strains of interleukins 1 , 1, and Aryl (interleukin antagonist) medication by incubating microorganism cultures in microgravity conditions and subsequently selecting the best cultures. The essence of the research is to identify possible changes in physical, chemical, morphological, and genetic properties of therapeutic and diagnostic bacteriophages exposed to spaceflight factors that could be used to obtain highly effective medicines with specific properties. E ARTH BENEFITS The material obtained will be used for selecting producer strains with enhanced properties (increased productivity and segregation stability) on Earth and subsequently introducing them into production. The selected high -productivity lines (clones) of producer strains of interferon, interleukins, and Aryl will be used in the production of biological medications at the State Scientific Research Institute of High Purity Biopharmaceuticals. The use in production of these strain medications with enhanced properties could have a significant economic impact. S PACE BENEFITS The essence of the research is the identification of possible changes in the physical, chemical, morphological, and genetic properties of therapeutic and diagnostic bacteriophages exposed to spaceflight factors that will be used to obtain highly effective medicines with specific properties. R ESULTS During the Aryl -1, the culture retained the capability to synthesize recombinant protein (Aryl). Quantitatively speaking, the following difference s were observed: when IPTG was used as the Conducting the ARIL experiment on the ISS RS . Roscosmos image. 98 inducer, the amount of protein in the space experiment was lower than in ground conditions, while the opposite picture was observed when lactose was used. The maximum yield of Escherichia coli TGl (pPR -TGATG -hIL-1r) biomass observed in microgravity conditions with induction by lactose was higher than in ground conditions. The result obtained can demonstrate the positive effect of microgravity on culture growth and on the high sensitivity of the culture to the nature of the inducer in these conditions. In samples with lactose induction under microgravity conditions, a significant drop in the number of viable cells (CFU) was observed, which could be caused by both spaceflight factors and the oversaturation of cells by the target protein. This finding was confirmed in microscope observations and electrophoretic analysis. The amount obtained in the space experiment of medication containing various forms of recombinant protein did not differ from that obtained under ground conditions. In the conditions of this experiment, most indicative were the initial cultivation doses of 107 and 109 cells/ml, at which the lowest degree of plasmid elimination was observed, and thus better synthesis of target protein by the cells of these cultures both on the ISS and on the ground. In the Aryl -2 investigation, plasmid elimination in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (pAYC -ET-(hIFN - 2b)-lacI) strain cells was absent or minimal both on the ISS and in ground control samples, which distinguishes this strain from the Escherichia coli TG1 (pPR -TGATG -hIL-1r) previously used. The clones selected from the flight sample during ISS Expedition 29 demonstrated varying levels of target protein production, ranging from hyper production to almost complete absence. Based on studying the growth pattern and microscopic picture, it can be stated that the addition to the culture medium of supernatant from the stationary growth phase of the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) [pAYC -ET-(hIFN -2b)-lacI] culture positively impacts survival in space conditions. In order to clarify the mechanism of action of the supernatant, in subsequent experiments it would make sense to study the effect of a simulated mixture of compounds as the additive to reproduce the content of supernatant from the stationary phase of culture development (system of biologically active components of Aktoflor culture broth). This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication. 99 BIOK ON IN SPACE (BIOKIS) , SEVEN INVESTIGATIONS Research Area: Cellular Biology Expedition(s): Principal Investigator(s): Ganga, Livorno, Italy RESEARCH OBJECTIVES BIOKon In Space (BIOKIS) involves the investigation of 7 experiments sponsored by the Italian Spac e Agency (ASI -Agenzia Spaziale Italiana) in the areas of cellular biology, radiation and radioprotection, aging, germination , and plant growth. These experiments aim to evaluate various biological species to determine genetic distinctions following short -duration spaceflight ; also, BIOKIS utilizes a variety of dosimeters to monitor radiation. E ARTH BENEFITS BIOKIS -BIOS-SPORE This study inspires future scientists to pursue a career studying the influence of spaceflight on fertility, which can ultimately improve human existence in orbit. BIOKIS - ArabidopS -ISS This study inspires future scientists to pursue a career studying alterations in plant physiology associated with spaceflight , which can ultimately improve human existence in or bit. BIOKIS - HiDOSE This study can lead to further understanding of how radiation may affect human function on Earth as well as in space. BIOKIS - PHOTO -EVOLUTION The availability of regenerating an oxygen supporting system is of great relevance in spac e as well as on Earth. For environmental purposes, algae cultures could be applicable to the polluted water of civil and industrial wastewater biological oxidation processes. For medical applications, algae cultures could be used as an artificial lung that can replace the gas exchange function of a person's native lungs during recovery from injury or illness, or until donor lungs are available for transplantation. BIOKIS - TARDIKISS This study can improve human life and aging on Earth by engineering new m olecules and metabolites for tissue and cell conservation, which can be used for developing countermeasures against radiation and aging.

BIOKIS - nDOSE This research supports the study of neutron dosimetry concerning high- altitude flights; neutron dosimetry concerning high- altitude countries (eg , Bolivia); and generally, it provides accurate measurem ents of neutron dosimetry concerning medical physics and radiotherapy. S PACE BENEFITS BIOKIS - BioS -SPORE These studies could be important when assessing the importance of spaceflight concerning generations of diversity and the birth of new species. Assessing viability of spores during spaceflight could be relevant to assessing the possibility of transporting terrestrial species to non -terrestrial ecosystems. BIOKIS - ArabidopS -ISS This experiment elucidates the role of cytoskeleton in gravisensing and the genes involved in the ROS signaling chain. The International Space Station (ISS) is the only facility able to permit long -term microgravity conditions. BIOKIS - HiDOSE This experiment monitors primary cosmic radiation. BIOKIS - PHOTO -EVOLUTION For long -term space missions and permanence on space platforms such as the ISS, the isolation of microorganisms with improved tolerance to ionizing radiation represents a fundamental issue in order to be utilized as self -regenerating oxygen producing life supporting system. The exploitation of green algae compared to higher plants allows researchers to optimize the space utilization on ISS as a large algal biomass, which could be grown in relatively small- sized photobioreactors (plastic tubes exposed to sunlight). BIOKIS - TARDIKISS Since the exposure to the space environment can induce rapid changes in living systems, this study aims to define the countermeasures needed to protect sensitive organisms, inc luding humans, which are not naturally able to withstand extreme stresses under space conditions; and for the study of future long -term explorations of the solar system. Image of the BIOK on hardware. ASI image. 101 BIOKIS - 3DISS Absorbed radiation measurements are used to improve the safety of crew members and to develop more efficient radiation shielding. BIOKIS - nDOSE In the space environment, humans are exposed to a complex mixed radiation field. The evaluation of neutron components of the radiation environment in spacecraft, both in low - Earth orbits and in deep space, is of great importance because of their high LET (Linear Energy Transfer); especially in view of long -term space missions as on the ISS; whereby, neutrons can produce dramatic damages to the health of crew members as well as the i nstrumentation. R ESULTS BIOKIS -BioS -SPORE Sporulation of the yeasts included in the experiment was not found to be altered by the space environment. However, it was found that some species of Saccharomyces genus could not germinate in spaceflight, suggesting that germination is species and possibly strain dependent. There were also differences in spore viability suggesting that spaceflight affects hybrid viability and thus the formation of new species. BIOKIS-ArabidopS -ISS No differences in the germination rate were found in both the genotypes under flight and ground conditions. It was also noted that the hypocotyls (structures that eventually form the plant stems) were long due to the seeds being kept in darkness in all conditions and genotypes. BIOKIS -HiDOSE The preliminary results indicate that the dose equivalent rate due to space radiation exposure during the STS -134 mission is 320\u00b5Sv/die (measured by TLD100 and TLD700) and 360\u00b5Sv (measured by TLD600) , according with the results obtained from long -duration flights. BIOKIS -PHOTO -EVALUATION After flight, the mutant cells displayed a higher photosynthetic performance and a faster rate of re -growth indicating a higher capacity of stress recovering. The e nhanced capability to survive the cosmic adverse conditions has been related to a particular localization of the amino acid substitution in the D -1 structure. BIOKIS -TARDIKISS Flight tardigrades, small water- dwelling animals, of 2 species showed a very h igh postflight survival rate, unaffected by microgravity or cosmic radiation. Flight females laid eggs with normal shape that were able to hatch. Newborns exhibited normal morphology and behavior and also laid viable eggs at sexual maturity. BIOKIS -3DISS Work is in progress to analyze the DNA from the dosimeters and the Eppendorf vials and to measure the dose integrated by the diamond dosimeters. 102 BIOKIS -nDOSE The average neutron dose of 17.2\u00b5Sv/day \u00b120% has been estimated. The bismuth stack detector is sti ll under analysis and the experimental results will be published in future papers. All results presented in the listed publication are preliminary results and proved that the experiment was performed as expected. Analyses are on the way for each one of the experiment involved in BIOKIS.

BOP is the first student experiment from European Space Agency's (ESA) Space Station Utilizatio n Contest Calls for European Student (SUCCESS) initiatives program and flew on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2005. Bone mass loss is a major consequence of extended periods of weightlessness. Many studies performed on astronauts and animals have shown that impaired maturation of osteoblast cells as well as a decrease of their bone - synthesizing activity, play key roles in bone mass loss in space. R ESULTS Preliminary analysis indicated that administration of ATP to MG -63 cells cultured in weightlessness conditions was able to inc rease extracellular- signal -regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Analysis of 2 -D gels revealed several differentially regulated proteins in response to ATP treatment. To the best of our knowledge, BOP is the first proteomic study on mammalian cells cultu red in space. The conclusion of the analysis will reveal new aspects of osteoblast biology and provide new insights into the molecular responses of human cells to weightlessness.

The cells are to be returned to Earth and used in studies of several different diseases. CBOSS -01-02-R ENAL (HAMMOND ) To better understand the mechanisms that cause several kidney disorders, human renal cortical epithelial (kidney) cell lines are grown on the International Space Station (ISS). Microgravity allows the cells to grow in 3 -D structures that are similar to how they grow in the human body. CBOSS -01-C OLON (JESSUP ) To better understand the mechanisms that cause the differentiation of cells in microgravity, 6 cell lines of common human illnesses are grown on ISS. This study is important for understanding the mechanisms needed to fight colon cancer in humans. ISS0003E5276 - Image of a Quad Tissue Culture Module Assembly (QTCMA) 7 on International Space Station (ISS) Expedition 3 after activation of the cells. A syringe was used to inject cells into the pink nutrient growth media. The Biotechnology Specimen Temperature Controller ( BSTC ) can hold 8 of these QTCMAs, which are used to grow human cells on ISS. When the samples completed their growth cycle, the crew transferred the QTCMAs from the BSTC to the Biotechnology Refrigerator (BTR) where they were stored until they are examined at a ground -based laboratory. 105 CBOSS -01-OVARIAN (BECKER ) To better understand the mechanisms that cause the differentiation of cells in microgravity, a human ovarian tumor cell line is grown on ISS. This study aims to define mechanisms of ovarian cancer with the goal of developing new ovarian cancer treatments. CBOSS -01-PC12 (LELKES ) To better understand the mechanisms of neural regeneration and pain suppression, a neuroendocrine cell line is grown on ISS and then returned to Earth for analysis. CBOSS -02-E RYTHROPOIETIN (SYTKOWSKI ) To better understand the mechanisms that cause the differentiation of cells in microgravity, 7 cell lines of common human illnesses are grown on the ISS. This study is important for understanding the mechanisms needed to fight immune dysfunction caused by microgravity. CBOSS -02-HLT (ZIMMERBERG ) To better understand the mechanisms that cause the differentiation of cells in microgravity, 6 cell lines of common human illnesses are grown on ISS. This study is important for understanding the mechanisms needed to fight diseases of the human immune system. CBOSS -FDI (ZIMMERBERG ) CBOSS -FDI optimizes of cells and molecules in microgravity to enable future successes for growing cells in space. This investigation uses image analysis to assess how well the particles mix and if the size of particles causes distribution differences. E ARTH BENEFITS In the human body cells normally grow within a scaffolding of protein and carbohydrate fibers that help create a 3 -D structure. This is how o rgans maintain their shape. Studying cells on Earth is difficult because outside the body cells tend to grow in flat sheets and are not capable of duplicating the structure they normally hold, which often makes them behave differently in the lab than they would in the body. Past research, however, has shown that cells grown in microgravity arrange themselves into 3 -D shapes, more closely duplicating how they behave in the body. The CBOSS -FDI experiments allows for a better understanding of the physics of aqueous bubble -liquid interaction and the effects of gravity on surface tension. Stained microscopy image of erythroleukemia cells. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center image . 106 SPACE BENEFITS Development of techniques to reliably cultivate organisms under controlled conditions is essential to understanding the effect of microgravity and radiation on living organisms and creating environmental conditioning sources for long -term spaceflight. The CBOSS -FDI experiments leads to a mixing protoco l that is both optimal in providing uniform and reproducible mixing and convenient for the flight crew. In addition, these experiments promote interactive science between the flight crew and the ground team. These goals are accomplished by evaluating vario us mixing protocols using colored polystyrene microspheres, cytodex beads, and colored dyes in the Tissue Culture Module (TCM). Additionally, since bubble formation in the TCM can be deleterious to cells, the development of bubble removal procedures enhanc es culture conditions in the TCM. Optimizing fluid mixing and bubble removal techniques in orbit is essential to conduct cellular research in microgravity. R ESULTS The CBOSS hardware supported 6 -cell culture investigations with different detailed scientific objectives. There were problems in the growth and preservation of all of the cell lines grown on Expeditions 3 and 4. The PC12 and erythroleukemia cells did not survive well in long -term culture, so no scientific results are expected from these experim ents. It was found that there was more bubble formation than expected that may lead to cell death at the air -liquid interface. Although not well documented in this experiment, it was noted that poor mixing of cells/tissues and medium occurred in the other CBOSS payloads as well. Both the poor mixing and greater than expected bubble formation were important lessons learned that led to the addition of the CBOSS -Fluid Dynamics Investigation (CBOSS -FDI) to study mixing and bubble formation in microgravity on la ter Expeditions. CBOSS -01-02-R ENAL Renal cortical cells returned were treated with an RNA stabilizing agent (RNAlater -Ambion) that enabled analyses of both RNA and immunoreactive proteins. The space and ground control cell cultures exhibited similar immunoreactivity profiles for the antibodies tested. These data provide evidence that the techniques used can be generalized to other cell lines, and that RNAlater provides long -term storage of proteins at 4\u00b0C (39\u00b0F) for long -duration investigations (Hammond 2006). CBOSS -01-C OLON Analyses of the returned colon carcinoma cells revealed that the cells had died in orbit. However, ground -based research led to an appreciation of a novel mechanism by which microgravity may kill cells as well as of the role of tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) on preventing cell death. It has been shown that CEA interacts with death receptors on the cell membrane to reduce cell death. Since CEA is important to many of the cancers that afflict men and women in the United States, this is a critical finding that was in large part initiated by studies of growth in simulated microgravity. These results are not yet published, but were presented by Jessup at the Keystone Symposium on \" Stem Cells, Senescence , and Apoptosis \" (Singapore 2005). 107 CBOSS -01-OVARIAN The LN1 ovarian cell cultures aboard station did not survive in long -term culture. However, the cells grown on ISS were found to have produced reduced amounts of cytokines (small secreted proteins that mediate and regulate immunity, inflammation, and hema topoiesis) compared to the ground controls. The proteins were recovered after the RNA had been removed from the cells via filtration. The novel proteins, vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) proteins, were extracted from filtrate of the RNA extra ction. Vimentin is the main intermediate filament protein in embryonic cells. It plays an important role in the differential diagnosis of undifferentiated neoplasms (abnormal tissue growths). EMA, which belongs to a family of proteins known as human milk f at globulemembrane proteins, is considered a broad spectrum antibody that is reactive against many types of adenocarcinomas. The data obtained from the protein extraction indicate the presence of the antigenic proteins, vimentin and EMA, in RNA -stabilized LN1 cells following long -duration storage at 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F). The vimentin and EMA proteins showed similar profiles at different times between the flight and ground samples. These data provide confirmation that the techniques used can be generalized to other ce ll lines and that RNAlater provides long -term storage of proteins at 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) for long -duration investigations (Hammond 2005). Analysis is ongoing, and additional results are expected to publish. CBOSS -01-PC12 No results were found because the cells did not survive. This is most likely due to inadequate mixing or bubble formation. CBOSS -02-E RYTHROPOIETIN No results were found because the cells did not survive. This is most likely due to inadequate mixing or bubble formation. CBOSS -02-HLT The human lymphoid tissue cultures were activated on board station but did not survive in longer- term culture. Early preliminary results, which were in agreement with rotating wall vesicle (RWV) ground studies (microgravity simulation), indicated that the human tonsil cell suspensions show impaired immune responses in microgravity and that the extent of impairment ISS008E09941 - This is a Cellular Biotechnology Operations Support Systems Fluid Dynamics Investigation Tissue Culture Module taken during Increment 8. 108 depended on the activation state of the cells. Cells in all conditions showed metabolic activity, indicating that they were alive. Cells that were activated in microgravity did not demonstrate any increases in antibody or cytokine production; howev er, if the cells were activated prior to exposure to microgravity, they did demonstrate such responses. These results indicated that microgravity suppresses humoral immune responses in a not dissimilar fashion to that of Human Immunodeficiency Virus on Ear th, and that this phenomenon may reflect immune dysfunction observed in crew members during spaceflights (Fitzgerald 2006). CBOSS -FDI For CBOSS- FDI, a series of procedures was performed on Expeditions 8, 10, and 12 to optimize particle mixing and bubble removal. A mixing protocol for particles has been found that appears to be effective and time -efficient, and crew feedback has been very valuable in these studies. Two bubble removal methods were tested. Future experiments will help determine their effectiv eness, and a protocol for bubble removal can be created for future tissue culture investigations. This investigation is critical for optimizing cell culture in space and ensuring the success of future investigations.

Chondro compares the cartilage tissue cultured in normal gravity (1 g), RPM -simulated microgravity, and actual microgravity environments to validate whether Earth- based simulated microgravity systems are comparable to space microgravity. Cartilage from the hip joint of a pig was harvested, counted, and placed into 9 bioreactor chambers in culture chambers (CC). R ESULTS All cartilage produced was soft, especially the tissue produced on International Space Station (ISS). Neocartilage formed in normal gravity was continuous in shape and form, while both the RPM and the ISS tissues were irregular. Although the ISS- produced cartilage had weaker extracellular matrix stains, it had higher gene expression levels of collagen type II/type I, which was comparable to normal cartilage. RPM - produced cartilage had the highest reduction in cell density, which in turn increased cell spacing. Although the data indicated the RPM system was not equivalent to real microgravity, the system did produce structural features and cellular spacing similar to ISS results, making it a viable tool for producing prefabricated collagen implants with fewer cells and without a scaffold.

E ARTH BENEFITS DomeGene will establish innovative methodology in different scientific disciplines including organisms in physiology, cell biology, radiation biology, and developmental biology. SPACE BENEFITS Systematic study and detailed molecular mechanisms of the effect of microgravity on living cells are still lacking. To fully understand the effect of microgravity on human health it is important to study the microgravity response of cells of various organ origins. R ESULTS Early results revealed that microgravity exerted little influence on the morphological characteristics of the cells or on their gene expression patterns, and that space radiation exerted a greater effect tha n microgravity, particularly in the aspects of organ and cancer development. Understanding the microgravity and space radiation effects on human health leads to the creation of effective countermeasures for future space life. P UBLICATION (S) Ikuzawa M, As ashima M.

This investigation aims to elucidate the mechanism behind the decrease in bone mineral density in the human body during spaceflight and also to investigate the suppressive action of novel indole derivative (1 -benzyl -2,4,6 - tribromomelatonin) on the bone resorption of scales. E ARTH BENEFITS The results from Fish Scales can be the basis of a new pharmaceutical to treat bone disease. S PACE BENEFITS The results from Fish Scales can be utilized to maintain bone density in future space explorers during long - duration missions. R ESULTS Fish Scales demonstrated that osteoclastic bone resorption occurred together with morphological changes of osteoclasts. In addition, it was also observed that 1 - benzyl -2, 4, 6- tribromomelatonin increased the scale of osteoblastic marker expression but suppressed that of osteoclastic marker expression. On the ground basis experiment, the oral administration of this chemical augmented the total bone mineral density of the femoral metaphysis of ovariectomized rats. In rats fed a low -calcium diet, the total bone mineral density of the femoral metaphysis significantly increased following the oral administration of this melatonin derivative. In this space experiment, it was demonstrated that bone resorption was actually observed using the fish scales and indicated that a novel melatonin derivative may have a potential ap plication in the treatment of bone diseases, such as those experienced in spaceflight.

Bacabac, ACTA- Free University Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands Jack van Loon, ACTA -Free University Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Bone Cell Mechanosensitivity in Weightlessness (FLOW ) investigation tests whether near - weightlessness decreases the sensitivity of chicken osteocytes for mechanical stress through a decrease in early signaling molecules that are involved in the mechanical loading -induced osteogenic response (formation of bone). Osteocytes, the bone mechanosensitive cells, will be compared with osteoblasts (the bone forming cells) and periosteal fibroblasts (cells found around or near bones, from which connective tissue develops). R ESULTS Due to unforeseen hardware complications, results from in -flight cultures are considered lost. Ground control experiments showed an accumulative increase of nitric oxide in medium for osteocytes (as well as for osteoblasts and perioste al fibroblasts). Data from the online -nitric oxide sensor showed that the nitric oxide produced in medium by osteocytes increased sharply after pulse shear stress stimulations. COX -2 mRNA expression revealed high levels in osteoblasts compared to the other cell types tested. In conclusion, preparations for the FLOW experiment and preliminary ground results indicate that the FLOW setup is viable for a future flight opportunity.

This experiment should provide further indications that may help in understanding why the sensitivity of the cells to radiation damage is r elated to their cell cycle and to the kinetics of the radiation. Furthermore, it will help improve our knowledge of the effect of the space environment on the human body, especially on long -duration missions. R ESULTS Overall cell number was lower in the cultures exposed to space environment as compared to the ground controls reproducing the temperature conditions during the ENEIDE mission. This phenomenon was most likely related to a slower growth rate in proliferative state. This slow growth rate was rev ersible, as demonstrated by the results of the growth curves, the plating and cloning efficiencies measured on the samples once they were returned to our laboratory in Udine; and mostly related to space effects as indicated by additional control in a clino stat. More experiments of this kind are needed to verify and validate these data and to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenomenon.

This investigation will demonstrate the establishment of how extensive the changes in gene expression patterns are when a complex multicellular organism is exposed to the space environment. R ESULTS When compared to the parallel ground control samples, the spaceflight samples showed a relatively large amount of genes had significant expression level alterations. Furthermore, when the gene expression patterns in the controls that had been exposed to a similar period of exposure to 14\u00baC as the flight samples (parallel controls) were compared to pupae from the same flies not exposed to this cold step, many genes were also modified by such a treatment. It is interesting to note that both treatments (exposure to 14\u00baC or to the space conditions) had been previously found compatible with a normal development of flies that kept successfully breeding after these treatments. It turned out that the 2 treatments showed some kind of synergism. In fact, the genes m odified by the exposure to the space conditions actually fall into 3 categories. Group 1 of genes (317) that had been previously modified by the cold treatment and that in microgravity were returning to the normal conditions much faster than the samples not exposed to this environmental change. Group 2 of genes (77) that were modified by the microgravity treatment even more than by the cold treatment alone, ie, increased/decreased even more than in the parallel controls. Group 3 of genes (894) not significa ntly modified by the cold treatment were changing in microgravity. They can be assimilated to the other 2 groups since most of them (879) change in opposite direction in both treatments, and only 15 (similar to group 2) change in the same direction. There are reasons to believe that the synergism between the 2 treatments is responsible for the changes in group 2. P UBLICATION (S) Herranz R, Benguria A, Lav\u00e1n DA, et al.

This investigation determines if loss of the Interleukin -2 receptor (IL -2) expression is the cause of inhibition. Microgravity is used as an inhibitor of activation. EARTH BENEFITS Determining the factors that cause IL -2 suppression can help scientists on Earth better treat immunosuppressed patients. S PACE BENEFITS Leukin -2 may help scientists better understand the depression of the immune system, which occurs during spaceflight and, therefore, to devise more adequate pre ventive or corrective measures for crew members during long -duration missions. RESULTS Human T cells were stimulated with Con A and anti- CD28 aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to induce immune responses. Microarray expression analysis after 1.5 hours of activation demonstrated that the T cells activated in microgravity (during flight on the ISS) had distinct patterns of global gene expression that differed from those activated in a 1 -g centrifuge during spaceflight (control or normal gravity that can be run during spaceflight). Forty -seven genes were identified that were significantly differentially down -regulated in T cells exposed to microgravity compared with T cells exposed to microgravity in a 1 -g centrifuge. Activation of Rel/NF -B, CREB (a transcription factor that is known for its role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival), and serum response factor gene targets, genes important in immune cell function pathways, was down -regulated. These data suggest that the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway is a major early downstream effector pathway inhibited in microgravity, and this could lead to ineffective, pro -inflammatory host defenses against infections during long -term spaceflight. These results may suggest that there could be a direct effect of microgravity on the expression of genes controlling immune cell function. 120 PUBLICATION (S) Chang TT, Walther I, Li C, et al.

LOH uses lymphoblastoid (immature immune) cells to detect potential changes on the chromosome after exposure to cosmic radiation. E ARTH BENEFITS The developed system for mutation (LOH) analysis is suggested to be applicable for evaluating various cellular responses to low -dose , low -dose -rate ionizing radiation, therefore providing a better estimation of the influence radiation exposure has on crew member health. S PACE BENEFITS Future crew members can benefit from the data obtained in this investigation by understanding the effects of radiation on human cells and may lead to the development of new countermeasures. Furthermore, researchers expect to obtain a better understanding of DNA repair mechanisms under such c ondition. R ESULTS Researchers observed an increase (2.3 - fold) in thymidine kinase deficient (TK-) mutations. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis on the mutants also demonstrated an increase in proportion of the large deletion (beyond the TK locus) events, 6/41 (in-flight samples ) and 1/17 ). Furthermore, in -flight samples exhibited 4 8% of the ground -control level of TK - mutation frequency upon exposure to a subsequent 2 Gy X -rays, suggesting a tendency of radioadaptation when compared with the ground control samples. The tendency of radioadaptation was also supported by the post- fligh t assays on DNA double -strand break repair: a 1.8 - and 1.7 - fold higher efficiency of in- flight samples compared to ground control via non -homologous end - joining and homologous recombination, respectively. These observations suggest that this The Monitoring of the LOH Experiment in the International Space Station from Earth . JAXA image. 122 system can be used as a biodosimeter because DNA damage generated by space radiation is thought to accumulate in the preserved cells during the mission. Certain cell samples were incubated for 8 days under 1G or microgravity in a CO 2 incubator , then refrozen, returned to Earth, and compared to ground control samples to determine the influence of microgravity on cell survival and mutation induction. The results for both conditions varied from experiment to experiment, yielding a large standard deviation, but the microgravity sample results differed significantly from the 1G sample resu lts for each of 2 experiments, with the mean ratio of microgravity to 1G being 0.55 for the concentration of viable cells and 0 .59 for the fraction of TK - mutants. Among the mutants, point mutations were less frequent (31%) after microgravity incubation th an after 1G incubation, which might be explained by the influence of microgravity on cellular metabolic or physiological function. Additional experiments are needed to clarify the effect of microgravity interferes on DNA repair. P UBLICATION (S) Yatagai F, Honma M, Ukai A, et al.

R ESULTS The MIA investigation demonstrated that adherent monocytes are not motile in microgravity ; the cytoskeletal structures of F -actin, -tubulin and vinculin are altered in cells exposed for 24 hours to microgravity conditions, also in microgravity an interaction between T -cells and monocytes takes place, although to a much lesser extent. The cyto skeleton played a major role in the locomotion of adherent cells but also in the clustering of the adhesion proteins LFA -1 and ICAM -1. The fact that several cytoskeletal structures are altered in microgravity may explain why these cells had a highly reduce d ability of locomotion and a reduced interaction between monocytes and T -cells as observed by the colocalization of ICAM -1 with LFA-1. The hypothesis that there is no interaction between T -cells and monocytes in microgravity could not be confirmed. Despite the fact that monocytes lost their locomotion ability we still observed an interaction. In earlier investigations we have found that T -cells are highly motile in microgravity . From the results we can conclude that also in microgravity an interaction between T -cells and monocytes takes place, although to a much lesser extent.

RESULTS Exposure to microgravity during 8 days in the International Space Station induced the decrease of ryanodine receptor subtype 1 expression in primary cultured myocytes from rat hepatic portal vein. Identical results were found in portal vein from mice exposed to microgravity during an 8 -day shuttle spaceflight. To evaluate the functional consequences of this physiological adaptation, evoked calcium signals obtained in myocytes from hindlimb unloaded rats, in which the shi ft of blood pressure mimics the one produced by the microgravity, were compared with those obtained in myocytes from rats injected with antisense oligonucleotide directed against ryanodine receptor subtype 1. In both conditions, calcium signals implicating calcium- induced calcium release were significantly decreased. In contrast, in spontaneous hypertensive rat, an increase in ryanodine receptor subtype 1 expression was observed as well as the calcium -induced calcium release mechanism. Taken together, the r esults have shown that myocytes were directly sensitive to gravity level and that they adapt their calcium signaling pathways to pressure by the regulation of the ryanodine receptor subtype 1 expression.

EARTH BENEFITS The number of bedridden elderly people in Japan is remarkably increasing, which can be considered a serious social problem. However, there is no effective countermeasure for muscle atrophy (de crease in muscle mass), which is a main cause for bedridden conditions. The few countermeasures for unloading mediated muscle atrophy include: rehabilitation, diet, and drugs. The MyoLab investigation focuses on the inhibition of Cbl -b-mediated ubiquitination found in humans) to improve IGF -1 (insulin -like growth hormone) resistance of skeletal muscle cells. Ubiquitin ligase Cbl -b is inhibited by focusing on the competitively inhibitory function of oligopeptides (molecules containing a small number of peptides). S PACE BENEFITS The data collected during this investigation may lead to the discovery of the underlying mechanism behind muscle atrophy caused by microgravity . Novel countermeasures (ubiquitin ligase inhibitors and nutrients) against muscle atrophy are being examined in order to allow crew members to stay in space and perform various projects wi thout muscle atrophy. RESULTS Researchers investigated the transcri ption that regulate Cbl -b expression using rat L6 myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. The biological relevance of Cbl -b expression as a sensor of unloading is strengthened by the findings that both oxidative stress and 3 -D-clinorotation induced Cbl-b expression in L6 myoblasts and myotubes. These findings suggest that increased levels of ROS link mechanical stress to downstream signaling pathways. In the present study, we observed that H2O2 treatment promoted the binding of Egr to the 5' -franking region of Cbl -b gene. Moreover, 3 -D-clinorotation and H 2O2 each induced the expression of Cbl -b in a manner accompanied by the early expression of Egrs 1 -3. This is consistent with the findings of a nother laboratory using Egr- 2 or Egr -3 knockout mice. The results obtained in Egr knockdown studies (siRNA) confirm that Egr transcription factors play a major role in 3 -D-clinorotation -mediated Cbl-b induction. Together, these data uncover the molecular m echanism through which mechanical unloading is transduced into biochemical signaling in skeletal muscle. 127 Several lines of evidence in diverse cell types point to the involvement of Egr transcription factors in the response to mechanical stress. Egr expression induced by 3 -D-clinorotation occurs within 90 minutes of stimulation, indicating that the Egr genes are in close temporal proximity to the mechanical stress \"receptor.\" Consistent with the ro le of oxidants as the second messengers of Egr activation and downstream unloading responses, the ERK1/2 pathway, a common target of oxidative signaling, was activated by 3 -D- clinorotation and H 2O2. Together, these results are consistent with the findings of other laboratories; they showed that immobilization or tail suspension increased oxidative stress -dependent signaling in rat skeletal muscles. Recent studies have identified several signaling molecules, such as ASK1, that mediate oxidative stress -depend ent activation of MAPK signaling. An important area for further investigation will be to identify the molecules that regulate ROS production in distinct cellular compartments (plasma membrane, mitochondria) in response to unloading. It is anticipated that these molecules may be the direct receptors/sensors for unloading stress. This hypothesis is supported by previous finding that the disrupted expression of cytoskeletal genes, especially mitochondria- anchoring protein genes, is associated with large imbalances in the expression of genes encoding diverse members of the electron transport system in the mitochondria of space -flown skeletal muscle.

This study could strengthen the hypothesis that neocytolysis is involved in a number of hematologic disorders. RESULTS After spaceflight, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell counts, and hematocrit values were not significantly different from those measured before flight. In 3 astronauts the reticulocyte counts were lower than before the flight. The hematochemical analysis disclosed a mean increase of 1,54+1,1 times in ferritin plasma level in 3 subjects. As expected, the percentage of recently generated red blood cells (young and a fraction of middle aged red blood cells) was decreased after the flight. Moreover, the percentage of middle aged, old and, to a gre ater extent, young red blood cells, exposing phosphatydilserine on the outer membrane leaflet was increased. Finally, the young cells had lost viability, as measured by calcein fluorescence, and the expression of CD55 and CD47 proteins by neocytes was decr eased both in term of the number of positive cells (from 91.25+7 and 96+2.7 to 86.35+4.4 and 87 +8.58, respectively), and in term of level of expression (fluorescence intensity). No significant changes were observed in control subject's red blood cell popu lation. The consistency in the differences observed for some of the hematological parameters and red blood cell features, prompt some conclusions, although the number of subjects analyzed in this study was small. Erythrocyte destruction likely occurred during the spaceflight, as indicated by the increase in plasma ferritin. Hemolysis occurred most likely due to destruction of neocytes, because young erythrocyte counts in blood samples drawn after the flight were lower than before the flight. The exposure of phosphatydilserine, the loss of viability and the decreased expression of CD47 in some of the still survi ving young red blood cells support this view, indicating that an \"apoptotic -like\" phenotype could trigger ingestion by Healthy red blood cells (upper left) are smooth and round.

Neuro Rad evaluates the risk factors of long -term spaceflight by investigating the ability to recover from radiation damage in microgravity. In addition, this experiment focuses on changes in the mitochondria -related gene expression, since the mitochondria is well known for having a crucial role in apoptosis (programmed cell death). E ARTH BENEFITS The Neuro Rad experiment studies space radiation effects using human nerve cells. The radiation effects are critical for biological creatures. The data collected during this investigation may lead to a greater understanding of how the radiation defense sys tem is affected by space radiation and the microgravity environment. The data obtained could be applied to the development of new treatments and preventative measures for the effects of radiation, life-style related diseases, and aging . S PACE BENEFITS The data collected during this investigation may lead to a greater understanding of how the radiation defense system is affected by different factors from space radiation and the microgravity environment. The data could be applied to develop new treatments a nd preventative measures for the effects of radiation, and to further investigate the effects of long -duration human stays in space. R ESULTS The space radiation dose aboard the International Space Station (ISS) was monitored using the on- board Passive Dosimeter for Life Science Experiments in Space (PADLES) hardware. The monitored data was estimated at 0.48\u00b10.08 mSv/day. Gene expression analysis has been undertaken, and mitochondrial impairment also has been examined for the \"fixed\" cells.

R ESULTS The level of natural killer (NK) cytotoxic activity was measured during co -cultivation of human lymphocytes and target cells (K - 562) in microgravity. Flight experiments were carried out using special instrumentation, the Fibroblast -1 cassettes, in the frame of Russian scientific pro gram during 6 International Space Station (ISS) missions, which involved cooperation with European Space Agency (ESA). Lymphocyte suspensions from human venous blood were used in experiments during short- term flights on 6 ISS missions. Russian crew members performed the experiments after Soyuz docking. The first step was mixing lymphocytes and 3H -labeled K -562 cells and their incubation at 37\u00b0C during 24 hours; the second step was filtration of the cell suspension. The frozen medium and filters were analyze d for the cytokine level and cytotoxic activity after landing. It was found that lymphocytes with different basal levels of cytotoxic activity kept the ability of recognizing and lysing malignant cells. In microgravity, cytotoxity increased to 160% of the basal levels. Donor individual features modulated the magnitude of the increase. The measurement of interleukin levels (TNF- , IL -1, IL-2) in medium showed that synthesis of TNF - increased during cell co -cultivation in microgravity. The level of IL -2 was very low in flight and ground control samples. The production of IL -1 by lymphocytes decreased after in -flight incubation. The results indicate that microgravity did not disturb the cytotoxic function of immune cells in vitro during 24 -hour incubation with specific target cells.

Talbot, PhD, Agricultural Research Services, Beltsville, Maryland Wagner Vendrame, PhD, University of Florida, Homestead, Florida RESEARCH OBJECTIVES NLP-CELLS (TALBOT ) National Lab Pathfinder -Cells (NLP -Cells) comprises 2 experiments conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). One experiment assesses the effects of spaceflight on cellular replication and differentiation in cattle cells. The other experiment examines the effects of spaceflight on the normal differentiation and function of liver cells and bile duct (opens into the small intestine from the liver) epithelium (lining). NLP-C ELLS-JATROPHA BIOFUELS (VENDRAME ) - Cells -Jatropha Biofuels) assesses the effects of microgravity on formation, establishment , and multiplication o f of the Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) , a biofuel plant, using different tissues as explant sources from different genotypes of Jatropha. Specific goals include the evaluation of changes in cell structure, growth and development, geneti c changes, and differential gene expression. Postflight analysis identifies significant changes that occur in microgravity, which could contribute to accelerating the breeding and genetic improvement processes for the development of new cultivars of this b iofuel plant. E ARTH BENEFITS The long -term goal of this project is to enhance the ability to introduce new genetic information into cells and to examine the effects of spaceflight on the normal differentiation and function of undifferentiated plant cells. The J. curcas plant, which is also known as the \" physic nut\" is a small tree from the Euphorbiaceae family that produces seeds from which oil can be extracted for use as biofuel. It has been demonstrated that J. curcas is a feasible species for the commercial production of biodiesel. The oil is of excellent quality and amenable also for jet fuel mixes. J. curcas is a tropical plant with an oil content of about 38% within the seeds. However, J. In this image shows the Group Activation Packs placed into the Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus that provides environmental controls from cold stowage to incubation temperatures. BioServe Space Technologies image , University of Colorado, Boulder, C olorado . 138 curcas is not currently being cultivated as a crop, since no commercial cultivars exist. Therefore the development of J. curcas cultivars with improved characteristics is highly desirable. Such studies can contribute to the development of U S-based new cultivars of an alternative energy crop that can be readily available to U.S. farmers while contributing towards energy independence from fossil fuel sources. Microgravity might be able to induce genetic changes that result in positive characteristics for the development of superior J atrop ha cultivars. That would be a means of accelerating the breeding and genetic improvement of Jatropha towards the commercialization of such superior jatropha cultivars. S PACE BENEFITS This investigation is a part of a serie s of investigations to be conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to provide the foundation for use of the ISS as a National Laboratory following assembly complete. RESULTS NLP-CELLS NLP-Cells assessed the effects of spaceflight on the liver's characteristic cells to differentiate into either monolayers of liver cells or cells lining the vessels that carry bile. In comparing flight vs. ground control cultures, no differences were found between the cultures with the exception being that s ome genes were differentially expressed. By light microscopy both young and older cultures, flight and ground, had grown and differentiated normally in the Opticell culture vessels. The PICM -19 cells grew to approximately 75% confluency (coverage of the pe tri dish), with few signs of cell death. The cells differentiated into either monolayer patches of liver cells with bile ducts visible between the cells or into 3 -D bile ducts with well -defined lumens, the inside space of a tubular structure. Structural fe atures between flight and ground samples were similar with PICM -19 cells. Flight PICM -19 cells produced more urea in response to added ammonia, although there was no apparent difference when compared to the ground control culture samples. The enzyme activities investigated were also found to be similar between ground and flight samples. Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA) containing cell suspensions of J. curcas . The FPAs are assembled into the Group Activation Pack, which is transported to the International Space Station for microgravity studies. Dr. Wagner A. Vendrame image , University of Florida, Homestead, Florida. 139 Researchers noted the nature of the PICM- 19 cells was not obviously changed by exposure to the space environment. However, the study's results should be viewed as prelimina ry because a greater number of observations are needed for additional statistical analyses. Also, different types of cell culture platforms other than the one used in this study (3 -D spheroid culture vs 2 - dimensional culture) might be tested. Finally in neither the immediately assayed PICM -19 cells nor the PICM -19 cells continuously cultured postflight did there appear to be any new unique cellular characteristics, permanent or transient, that would enhance their utility for biotechnological purposes, such as their use in an artificial liver support device (Talbot 2010). NLP-C ELLS-JATROPHA This study aimed to compare the in vitro growth of plant cultures from 3 different plant parts, cotyledon, leaf, and stem sections, derived from J atropha from different geographic locations (Brazil, India, and Tanzania) outside and inside the petriGAP. Cell growth was observed for all Jatropha accessions both inside and outside the petriGAP for all evaluated plant materials. Growth parameters were affected by geographic o rigin, plant part type and environment. The type of plant part type influenced the type of cell growth and subsequent plantlet regeneration capacity. Overall growth showed no abnormalities. The current study shows J atropha in vitro cell cultures are suitab le for growth inside petriGAPs for a period of 12 weeks. The parameters evaluated in this study provide the basic ground work and preflight assessment needed to justify a model for microgravity studies with Jatropha in vitro cell cultures. Future studies should focus on results of experiments performed with Jatropha in vitro cultures in microgravity, including culture growth and potential genetic changes and differential gene expression (Vendrame 2013).

R ESULTS The quality of data for the 4 -hour samples was excellent, though a few more ground studies are needed on the 4-hour samples to determine signal transduction under the 3 methods of activation to complete the picture. The data for the 24-hour samples was less striking most likely due to the fact that the RNA from the 24 -hour samples was in low amount. The data are excellent for the 4 -hour data with changes seen in IL2R, Xcl2, EGR -1, GMCSF and IFN for each activation. In most cases, t he ConA/CD28 and the more physiological CD3/CD28 activations were comparable, confirming that all previous work with ConA/CD28 is reliable. We had thought by bypassing the IL -2 step would eliminate the suppression of spaceflight, but that was not the case. The effectiveness of the 3 activations demonstrated that all 3 stimulations were effective suggesting that IL2 is not the only limiting factor in microgravity. These experiments help to understand immune system activation by introducing the variable of gravity. As in mathematics, the elimination of a variable many times can eventually solve the equation. Spaceflight causes changes in the ability of the T cells to respond to a simulated infection. The central hypothesis was that this effect was solely depen dent on IL -2, however, this experiment showed that IL -2 was not the only factor.

Since all terrestrial life began in a gravity field, this study examines alterations of early T -cell ac tivation, whereby microgravity gives us the unique opportunity to examine the role of Earth's gravity in immune function. The PKinase study shows the regulation of the earliest signals that cause the T cell to activate and the role of normal Earth's gravit y in that signaling. PKinase helps scientists understand the immune -suppression that occurs during spaceflight and can facilitate the development of preventive and corrective measures for long duration missions.

S PACE BENEFITS PKinase helps scientists understand the immunosuppression that occurs during spaceflight and can facilitate the development of preventive and corrective measures for long -duration missions. R ESULTS PKC activation was conducted using phorbol 12,13 -dibutyrate (PDBu) under normal and altered gravity in the PKinase experiment on the International Space Station. Examination of differentiation of monocytes under real microgravity and normal gravity showed significant changes in the molecular function gene expression during early signaling as well as in expression of differentiation of the monocyte. PKinase inside the transportable Kubik incubator. ESA image. 142 PDBu causes differentiation of the monocyte and results in adhesion of the cells within 24 hours. Cumulatively , these results suggest that activation of early signal transduction is regulated in part by gravity. In true microgravity (g), significant changes were seen in gene expression of the monocyte between activation of the g samples and the 1 -g in-flight sa mples. These changes in gene expression suggest a role of gravity in regulation of immune function in human monocytes. P UBLICATION (S) Hughes -Fulford M, Chang TT, Li C.

This data contributes to the knowledge of physiological protection against the serious effects of space radiation on crew members during long -duration missions in space. EARTH BENEFITS These techniques are quite useful for the dosimetry of low dose rate a nd low dose radiation. Data obtained from Rad Gene are applicable to the accidents such as Fukushima nuclear power plant following the 2011 tsunami. The measurement of DSBs induced by heavy -ion beams can also be applied to heavy -ion cancer therapy. S PACE BENEFITS Results obtained from this investigation hope to add important details on how to protect against space radiation during long -term spaceflight. R ESULTS PHYSICAL DOSIMETRY The total dose was about 66.5 mSv for 133 days in space evaluated by small dosimeters : thermoluminescence (TLD) and CR39 . The dose rate was about 0.5 mSv per day, though that has been understood to be about 1.0 mSv (1) . SPACE RADIATION -INDUCED DSB S IN NUCLEI In the frozen cells, researchers determined that DSBs were detected as H2AX -positive foci with the shape of tracks. From the induced frequency of H2AX -positive foci, scientists measured about 93.1 mSv as the total dose. The dose rate was about 0.7 mSv pe r day. This value is very close to the value of 0.5 mSv per day noted by the physical dosimetry.

JAXA image. 144 P53-DEPENDENT INDUCED AND DEPRESSED GENES IN SPACE CULTURED CELLS Researchers previously published the induction of p53 gene products in the muscles and skin of a space -flown rat. The p53 gene product is understood to control apoptosis, cell cycle, and DNA repair as a genome guardian that depresses gene instability and induction of mutation, chromosome aberration, and carc inogenesis. Scientists prepared 2 kinds of human -cultured cell lines of lymphoblastoid cells bearing wt p53 and m p53 gene statuses. Researchers found many new kinds of p53-regulated genes induced by space radiations , by microgravity, and the space environme nt, though the induction of p53 gene product itself was never understood. In addition, space radiations synergistically induced 209 genes by microgravity , while 166 synergistic depression genes altered by microgravity. P53-DEPENDENT INDUCED AND DEPRESSED PROTEINS IN CULTURED CELLS IN SPACE Scientists also analyzed p53 -dependent protein synthesis using protein chips of the space cultured cells. These reports were the first findings in the world. P53-DEPENDENT INDUCED AND DEPRESSED GENES THAT WERE EXPOSED TO SPACE RADIATIONS The flight samples were exposed to space radiations for 133 days in space in a frozen state. After spaceflight, the cells were cultured on the ground. Researchers analyzed the p53 - dependent gene expression in these cells. Induced and depressed genes were 50 and 94, respectively. Heat shock protein (HSP) genes were also found and were induced by low doses of radiations (4). RADIO -ADAPTIVE RESPONSE IN SPACE -FLOWN CELLS IN A FRO ZEN STATE The flight samples were exposed to space radiation s for 133 days in space in a frozen state. After spaceflight, the cells were cultured on the ground and then irradiated by X -rays at 2 Gy. Thereafter, the cells were cultured again for measurements of a radio -adaptive response of cell survival, apoptosis, and chromosomal aberration. Scientists detected the radio -adaptive response in wt p53 cells but not in m p53 cells . These results suggested that the flown cells in space were exposed to space radiations in the range of 20 -100 mSv because reports already reve aled that the radio -adaptive response was found in those specific radiation doses.

Nusgens, University of Li\u00e8ge, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The main objective of the Signalling through Rho GTPases in microgravity (Rho Signalling) experiment is to analyze by immune -morphological procedures distinct cellular processes (cytoskeleton and foc al adhesions organization, GTPases translocation to the membrane, translocation of activated signaling molecules) depending on Rho GTPases activity. The Rho GTPases (RhoA, Rac1 & Cdc42) are molecular switches in the signaling pathways that relay the information collected by most transmembrane receptors to modulate the mechanical and phenotypic expression of the cells. R ESULTS The Rho Signaling experiment was located in a vacuum -tight aluminum container (B -container), providing 2 Ievels of containment for the plunger box unit (PBU) and their contents. Upon inspection of the PBUs after landing, it turned out that 2 plungers had been correctly activated to make the exchange of culture medium 6 hours after reaching 37\u00b0C in the incubator. Four plungers had not been activated causing the loss of biological samples. Postflight debriefing revealed that the B -container was disconnected and removed from the Aquarius, 5 minutes before termination of the experiment just before the activation of the plungers. As such, additional security should be applied in the future to prevent avoidable failure. P UBLICATION (S) Nusgens B, Lambert C, Lapiere C.

R ESULTS In the postflight analysis, the following parameters directly correlated to programmed cell death were tested: Gene expression of calpain and p53 5-LOX protein expression and act ivity DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA) fragmentation The results demonstrated that exposure of human lymphocytes to microgravity for 48 hours aboard the International Space Station (ISS) remarkably increased apoptotic hallmarks such as Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) fragmentation (~3-fold compared to ground -based controls) and -poly (ADP -ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein as mRNA levels of apoptosis such as p53 (~3-fold) and calpain (~4 -fold); these changes were paralleled by an early increase of 5 -LOX activity (~2 -fold). These findings provided a molecular background for the immune dysfunction observed in astronauts during space missions, and revealed potential new markers to monitor health status of ISS crew me mbers.

The project aim is to determine possible alterations of the activity and expression of endocannabinoid system elements in weightlessness, and their impact on the regulation of immune cell cycle, growth and death. R ESULTS Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) isolated from human donors on the ground were sent to the ISS on the Soyuz. The experimental activities, performed in the KUBIK incubator, were stopped at different time points and the experimental containers were stored in the Minus Eighty Degrees Celsius Laboratory Freezer for the ISS (MELFI) facility. The preliminary postflight analysis, using quantitative real time -polymerase chain reaction (qRT -PCR) and western blot techniques, showed that microgravity alters the expression, at transcriptional and translational level, of the main AEA- synthesizing and -degrading enzymes. The project will disclose a potential engagement of endocannabinoid signalling in lymphocyte apoptosis and immunodepression already documented in space.

This 10 -day study which consisted of 12 in- flight and 12 ground -based control modules is important to maintaining crew health during long -duration space exploration. R ESULTS Postflight microarray analysis revealed 1 023 significantly modulated genes, the majority of which are involved in cell adhesion, oxidative phosphorylation, stress responses, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Thioredoxin -interacting protein was the most up -regulated (33 -fold), heat -shock proteins 70 and 90 the most down affected. Cytokine detection in the cultur e media indicated significant increased secretion of interleukin -1 and interleukin -1. Nitric oxide was found not modulated. Our data suggest that in cultured HUVECs, microgravity affects the same molecular machinery responsible for sensing alterations of flow and generates a pro -oxidative environment that activates inflammatory responses, alters endothelial behavior, and senescence.

E ARTH BENEFITS Human liver cells grown on Earth using traditional techniques typically form flat colonies that only function for 1 or 2 days at best. However, liver cells grown on Earth in NASA's Rotating Bioreactor form 3 -D colonies that maintain their function for at least several weeks. These cell colonies closely resemble and function like natural cells in the human body, which makes them excellent candidates for research concerning drug metabolism and general cell function. Scientists believe that cells grown in a microgravity environment also develop in a 3 -D form that resembles cells in the human body. This e nables researchers to isolate and study the multiple factors that influence cellular function in microgravity and then compare the results to ground - based data obtained from the Rotating Bioreactor. The Rotating Bioreactor is being used in the investigato r's laboratory to perform drug metabolism studies. These studies are useful for determining how the human body processes a drug. In addition, quantities of drug metabolites are produced, and these are required in various pharmacokinetic and toxicology stud ies during the course of drug development. The ultimate goal is to speed up the process that is used to make new drugs available for patients in need. The data obtained from this investigation could also aid in the development of a liver- assist device, a machine very similar to a kidney dialysis machine. Such a device would be used to sustain the life of a patient with advanced liver disease waiting for an organ transplant. S PACE BENEFITS This experiment gives insight on how liver cells function in microg ravity. The results help in developing measures to further protect the health of crewmembers on extended exploration missions. Human liver cells at the completion of a ground -control experiment. A stain has been applied t o indicate the live versus dead (blue-colored) cells. NASA Johnson Space Center image. 151 RESULTS The samples returned from space were analyzed by specialized mass spectrometry equipment to determine the amount of drug metabolites formed by the liver cells from the drug substances added. Overall this analysis showed the rate of metabolism by the liver cells in space was lower than that of the liver cells maintained under similar conditions on Earth. This was true for all of the drug substances tested as well as for cells from 3 different liver donors. These results indicate that microgravity may well retard the rate of drug metabolism in the human liver, although the mechanism for this effect is yet unknown. Returned samples were also analyzed by gene array to determine whether genetic expression differed for cells in microgravity. Differences were found, including 9,200 of 13,000 genes that had at least 2 -fold greater expression in space as compared to Earth and 9,800 genes that had decreased expression in space. This large body of data is being analyzed for clues as to how liver cell function changes in specific ways in the microgravity environment of space .

STL-M ICROBIAL IMMUNITY (NICKERSON ) Space Tissue Loss - Microbial Immunity (STL -Microbial Immunity) is a Department of Defense Space Test Program payload examining how human cells respond to bacterial infections in space and if normal processes seen on Earth occur in the space environment.

STL-TATRC2 (PAEK) Space Tissue Loss is a DoD Space Test Program payload flying both DoD and NASA science using cell and tissue cultures in microgravity to study the effects of tissue regeneration and wound healing in space. E ARTH BENEFITS Wound healing is considered a major clinical challenge in surgical and military units; the related concerns have been mounting recently, triggered by an aging population and increasing rates of diabetes, obesity , and cancer treatment side effects. To better understand the physiological cascade of the healing model, the present plan intends to temporally obtain in vitro biological samples associated with endotoxin insulted dermal cells and identify molecular signatures using an integrated pan-omics platform. We project the earth based pan - omic study may reveal true EARLY (or \" immediate onset \") indicators of the healing cascade; but, perhaps more importantly, a demonstrable understanding of the regulatory nodes/networks cascading into successful wound healing. The application spans both military and civilian injuries and immune response o n Earth. S PACE BENEFITS Prolonged residence in a space shuttle causes immunocompromisation; therefore the crew members not only suffer from a delayed healing process, they also become particularly vulnerable to bacterial infection. This study is designed to identify certain early molecular signatures and/or therapeutic targets associated with the compromised healing cascade.

R ESULTS The study involved 4 groups of cells/Skelite constructs: Flight Experiment, FE, (spaceflight, static on orbit, in bioreactors), Flight Control, FC, (spaceflight, artificial 1 g in orbit, in bioreactors), Ground Control, GC, (ground 1 g, static, in bioreactors), and Laboratory Control, LC, (ground 1 g, static in petri dishes). Half of the constructs of each group were maintained in normal growth medium (BMSC cultures), and the other half was stimulated with osteo -inductive medium (BOI cultures). Inspection by stereo -microscope showed vigorous cell growth in all BMSC/Skelite constructs recovered at the end of the experiment; cells grew into a veil -like network, filling pores and frequently forming snowflake -like aggregates. No major difference in morphology was seen between BMSC and BOI cultures in all groups. To maximize yield, since cells maintained in RNAlater solution tended to detach from the scaffold, RNA was extracted from the BMSC/Skelite constructs and from the solution recovered from the bioreactor cell chamber. Half the amount of total RNA was o btained from the FE respective to the GC samples, and a comparable amount was obtained from BMSC and BOI cultures. Stroma -2 hardware.

Unexpectedly, most of the modulated expression was found in genes related to various processes of neural development, neuron morphogenesis, transmission of nerve impulse and synapse, raising the question on the lineage restriction in BMSC.

The second objective is to study the mechanisms underlying space -related alterations in gene expression in osteoblasts. R ESULTS After transfection and selection, 3 MC3T3 -VDRE colonies showed a time - and dose -dependent increase in growth hormone release following treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3. Noteworthy, the induction of growth hormone was less in the stable transfectants than after transient transfection, most likely because less copies of the construct were present in the former. The growth hormone response of the selected MC3T3 -VDRE cell line was not manifestly altered when cells were cultured in the plunger box units and when the temperature profile of the spaceflight was applied. The preparation and course of both spaceflight and ground experiment went uncomplicated. Five days of microgravity during the Odissea missi on (Soyuz 5S/Soyuz 4S exchange) did not affect the level of 1, 25(OH) 2D3 -induced growth hormone expression per cell, which was used as reporter. It has, however, to be remarked that no 1 -g centrifuge was present during the flight. An inflight 1 -g experime nt remains the ideal control as gravity is at that moment the only parameter differing between the 2 conditions. These data indicate that in this model where only certain aspects of the 1, 25(OH) 2D3 signaling cascade are analyzed, the endpoint of the 1, 25(OH) 2D3 signaling cascade, namely gene transcription and protein synthesis of a reporter gene, was not altered by microgravity. However changes in the different aspects of the 1, Vitamin D plunger box unit. ESA image. 158 25(OH) 2D3 signaling pathway, namely the passage of 1, 25(OH) 2D3 through t he plasma membrane, its binding to the vitamin response (VDR), transport to the nucleus, and the binding of the heterodimer VDR -RXR to its response element cannot be excluded although they did not result in altered production of the reporter. These data s uggested that other factors in the promoter beside VDRE can affect 1, 25(OH) 2D3 - induced gene expression during microgravity. Recently, it has become evident that chromatin modifications outside the binding sites for transcription factors contribute to gen e transcription and this has also been observed for vitamin D- regulated gene expression. It therefore remains possible that 1, 25(OH) 2D3 -induced gene transcription was impaired under microgravity due to chromatin modifications.

Baumstark, MD, University of Frieburg, Frieburg, Germany Fermin Otalora Munoz, University of Granada, Martial, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium Adriana Zagari, PhD, University of Naples, Naples, Italy Willem J. de Grip, Ph D, University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Advanced Protein Crystal Facility is a specialized microgravity facility offering researchers several different crystal growth options in a controlled environment enabling undisturbed nucleation (beginning of chemical changes at discrete poi nts in a system) and growth of proteins to obtain large crystals for analysis on Earth. Understanding the results obtained from the crystals can lead to advances in manufacturing and biological processes. E ARTH BENEFITS Biotechnology and pharmaceutical researchers carry out the process of protein crystallization in order to grow large, well -ordered crystals for use in X-ray d iffraction studies. However, on Earth, the protein crystallization process is hindered by forces of sedimentation and convection since the molecules in the crystal solution are not of uniform size and weight. This leads to many crystals of irregular shape and small size that are unusable for X-ray diffraction. X -ray diffraction is a complex process that requires several months to several years to complete, and the quality of data obtained about the 3 -D structure of a protein is directly dependent on the deg ree of perfection of the crystals. Thus, the structures of many important proteins remain a mystery simply because researchers are unable to obtain crystals of high enough quality or large enough size. Consequently, the growth of high quality macromolecular crystals for diffraction analyses has been of primary importance for protein engineers, biochemists, and pharmacologists. Fortunately, the microgravity environment aboard the ISS is relatively free from the effects of sedimentation and convection and pro vides an exceptional environment for crystal growth. Crystals grown in microgravity could help Camelid crystals grown by diffusion under microgravity aboard STS -95 during October, 1998.

The knowledge gained could be instrumental in the design and testing of new drugs. SPACE BENEFITS The crystals grown in microgravity are able to grow larger and more organized than those grown on Earth. The results from this investigation may further human space exploration efforts by creating technological and biological advancements as a direct result from this research. R ESULTS Initial analysis of crystals returned from station support the findings of earlier APCF fligh ts: comparative crystallographic analysis indicates that space -grown crystals are superior in every way to control -group crystals grown on Earth under identical conditions (except the critical space environment). Crystals grown in microgravity generally have improved morphology, larger volume, higher diffraction limit, and lower mosaicity as compared to Earth -grown crystals. The researchers reported that the electron -density maps calculated from diffraction data contained considerably more detail, allowing them to produce more accurate 3 -D models (Vergara 2005). The APCF hardware performed well during International Space Station (ISS) Expedition 3 with very few anomalies. APCF- Camelids, APCF- Crystal and APCF -PPG10 all produced excellent quality crystals that had better resolution and other optical properties than those grown on Earth. APCF -Lipoprotein successfully produced crystals, but they did not achieve the expected level of resolution. APCF- Rhodopsi n had slight technical problems that prevented the formation of suitable crystals. Well -diffracting crystals prepared in space have 2 purposes: understanding the gravity -dependent phenomena (such as nucleation and growth mechanisms) and structural determination. Each new high -resolution structure may become the start of a casc ade of investigations to unravel the complexity of the cellular events like growth, division, differentiation, communication, motility, death , and their role in the development of multicellular organisms. This may accelerate the structure -based design and redesign of drugs targeting pathogens, diseases, and degenerative Camelid crystals, complexed with lysozyme, grown in the Advanced Protein Crystallization Facility during International Space Station Expedition 3. NASA Johnson Space Center image . 161 cellular processes as well as of protein and nucleic acid leading to custom enzymes, ribozymes , or inhibitors to treat diseases. APCF -CAMELIDS (WYNS) Four of the 6 reactors used for APCF- Camelids produced crystals. Optical analysis and interferometry were used to determine the crystals ' properties that included a maximum resolution of 1.2A. This was much better than crystals grown under similar conditions on Earth and comparable to the best resolution ever achieved for crystals grown in hanging -drop experiments aboard the shuttle. APCF -CRYSTAL GROWTH (WEINKAUF ) After their return to Earth, the ferritin crystals were found to have better diffraction than Earth - grown crystals but the data collection was incomplete. The lumazin synthase crystals had diffraction properties equal to those on Earth. APCF -C RYSTAL QUALITY (GIEGE) Crystallographic analysis indicates that the space -grown crystals are superior to the control- group crystals grown on Earth. Crystals grown in microgravity generally have improved morphology, larger volume, better optical properties, higher diffraction limit , and lower mosaicity when compared to Earth -grown crystals. Several space -grown crystals including Aspartyl- tRNA Synthetase and thaumatin ha ve a common feature; an increased number of ordered hydrogen- bound water molecules in the hydration layer of the protein. This may be responsible for the enhanced stability of the protein crystals (Vergara 2005). Well -diffracting crystals prepared in space have 2 purposes: understanding the gravity -dependent phenomena (such as nucleation and growth mechanisms) and structural determination. Each new high- resolution structure may become the start of a cascade of investigations to unravel the complexity of t he cellular events like growth, division, differentiation, communication, motility, death , and their role in the development of multicellular organisms. This may accelerate the structure -based design and redesign of drugs targeting pathogens, diseases and degenerative cellular processes as well as of protein and nucleic acid leading to custom enzymes, ribozymes , or inhibitors ) Although APCF -Lipoprotein successfully produced crystals, the main objective of achieving a significant improvement in resolution (compared to Earth -grown crystals) was not accomplished. However, there was some indication that parameters like mosaicity and the sign al/noise ratio were in fact improved. Computer generated image of a ferritin molecule. NASA image . Computer generated image of a lysozyme molecule.

Crystals grown in microgravity generally have improved morphology, larger volume, higher diffraction limit, and lower mosaicity as compared to Earth -grown crystals. The researchers reported that the electron -density maps calculated from different diffraction data contained considerably more detail, allowing them to produce more accurate 3 - D models (Vergara 2005). The APCF hardware performed well during ISS Expedition 3 with very few anomalies. APCF- Camelids, APCF -Crys Octarellins and APCF- PPG10 all produced excellent quality crystals that had better resolution and other optical properties than those grown on Earth. APCF -Lipoprotein successfully produced crystals bu t they did not achieve the expected level of resolution. APCF -Rhodopsin had slight technical problems that prevented the formation of suitable crystals. The more recently developed Granada Crystallization Facility (GCF) makes it possible to carry out a larger number of experiments. To optimally use the results from these experiments, it was necessary to visualize the crystal development throughout the forming process. The Protein Microscope for the International Space Station (PromISS) was developed for obs ervation by digital holography. This method enabled researchers to evaluate the initial appearance of crystals, their growth rates , and the movement of crystals. Adjustments need to be made to reduce the sensitivity of the PromISS to vibrations aboard the ISS and also to have the crystals form within the observation time. Well defracting crystals prepared in space have 2 purposes: un derstanding the gravity - dependent phenomena (such as nucleation and growth mechanisms) and structural determination. Each new high -resolution structure may become the start of a cascade of investigations to unravel the complexity of cellular events like gr owth, division, differentiation, communication, motility, death , and their role in the development of multicellular organisms. This may accelerate the structure -based design and redesign of drugs targeting pathogens, diseases, and degenerative cellular pro cesses as well as of protein and nucleic acid leading to custom enzymes, ribozymes , or inhibitors to treat diseases. APCF -O CTARELLINS (MARTIAL ) Data for this investigation was inconclusive. Ribbon Structure showing the ma in chain de novo design o the idealized alpha/beta- barrel. This scaffold has been used for the design of the next generation octarellin. NASA image . 163 APCF -PPG10 (ZAGARI ) Early published results have come out for crystals of (Pro -Pro Gly) 10 (PPG10). PPG10 is a collagen protein found in many tissues. This collagen is particularly concentrated in the skin, joints, and bones. Video that was collected during Expedition 3 showe d the small movements within the crystallizing solutions. A direct correlation between crystal motion and acceleration from events on station (such as docking, venting, and crew movement) was determined for the first time. The PPG10 crystals were independe ntly studied by X -ray diffraction in various labs; the best resolution attained for microgravity -grown crystals from ISS was 1.5A, superior to the 1.7A obtained on the ground. The teams of APCF scientists are combining data from previous spaceflight s, the ground, and the station to get the best possible information on protein structures for applications in pharmaceutical and physiological research (Vergara 2005). PPG10 crystals grown aboard the ISS were observed to move coherently and followed parallel trajectories, which was different from movements observed aboard the shuttle. These movements have been linked to large -scale acceleration events such as the undocking of the shuttle, change in ISS attitude , and the venting of water and air. Final distributio n of the crystals in solution was strongly affected by this motion. Crystal appearance time and growth rate was comparable in all crystal environments (agarose gel in microgravity, solution on Earth and agarose gel on Earth). These observations suggest tha t the crystal growth mechanism is kinetically controlled (Vergara 2002, Berisio 2002). Using 2 other experiment aboard ISS Microgravity Acceleration Measurement System (MAMS) \u2014which measured residual gravity on the experiment \u2014and Space Acceleration Measurem ent System (SAMS ) \u2014which measured acceleration caused by space craft docking and undocking, change in ISS attitude, venting, and crew movement \u2014a direct correlation between crystal motion and acceleration was determined for the first time. However, this paper reports that there is no apparent correlation between the resulting crystal motions and crystal quality. APCF -R HODOPSIN (DE GRIP) Even though the reactors successfully produced small crystals on Earth, they did not perform well during their stay on ISS Expedition 3. Apparently, slight technical problems developed that lead to minor leakage of the protein chamber. Slow destabilization of the rhodopsin protein occurred that prevented formation of suitable crystals (One Year Postflight Report). P UBLICATIO N(S) Vergara A, Lorber B, Sauter C, Giege R, Zagari A.

DeLucas, OD, PhD, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Commercial Protein Crystal Growth - High Density (CPCG -H) tests hardware using a variety of protein crystal growth methods. Researchers aim to determine the most appropriate type of hardware for each exp eriment and which type of hardware could be permanently added to or removed from International Space Station (ISS) facilities for future protein crystal experiments. Protein crystal growth experiments aid the generation of computer models of carbohydrates, nucleic acids and proteins, and further advance the progress of biotechnology. Understanding these results can lead to advances in manufacturing and biological processes, both in medicine and agriculture. E ARTH BENEFITS Knowledge of precise 3 -D molecular structure is a key component in biotechnology fields such as protein engineering and pharmacology. In order to obtain accurate data on the 3 -D structure of protein crystals or other macromolecules, scientists employ a process called X- ray crystallography. Crystallographers construct computer models that reveal the complex structures of a protein molecule. In order to generate an accurate computer model, crystallographers must first crystallize the protein and analyze the resulting crystals by a pr ocess called X -ray diffraction. Precise measurements of thousands of diffracted intensities from each crystal help scientists map the probable positions of the atoms within each protein molecule. This complex process requires several months to several years to complete. The quality of structural information obtained from X -ray diffraction methods is directly dependent on the degree of perfection of the crystals. Thus, the structures of many important proteins remain a mystery simply because researchers are unable to obtain crystals of high enough quality or large enough size. Generally, crystals must have dimensions of approximately 0.3 mm to 1.00 mm, and the protein molecules must be arranged in an orderly, repeating pattern. Consequently, the growth of hi gh quality macromolecular crystals for diffraction Thermus flavus crystals of the 7bp helix B1 grown on the International Space Station Expedition 2. Image provided by Acta Crystallographica. Section D, Biological Crystallography. Crystallization and Structure Analysis of Thermus flavus 5S rRNA helix B. 166 analyses has been of primary importance for protein engineers, biochemists, and pharmacologists. On Earth, the crystallization process is hindered by forces of sedimentation and convection since the molec ules in the crystal solution are not of uniform size and weight. This leads to many crystals of irregular shape and small size that are unusable. However, the microgravity environment aboard the ISS is relatively free from the effects of sedimentation and convection and provides an exceptional environment for crystal growth. S PACE BENEFITS The crystals grown in microgravity are able to grow larger and more organized than those grown on Earth. The results from this investigation may further human space exploration efforts by creating technological and biological advancements as a direct result from this research. R ESULTS Preliminary analysis indicated that at least 65% of the macromolecules flown in the CPCG -H experiments produced diffraction -sized crystals. X- ray diffraction studies of these crystals were conducted, and the data were used to determine and refine the 3 -D structures of these macromolecules. Three benchmark proteins, ML -I, Thermus flavus 5S RNA, and BARS, were flown to validate the performance of the hardware. Diffraction -quality crystals, which were obtained from all of these proteins, yielded X- ray diffract ion data comparable to those previously collected on Earth -grown crystals. Since the structure of each of the benchmark proteins is known to high resolution, these results indicate that the new HDPCG assembly worked very well, successfully producing high -quality crystals of the benchmark proteins. Synchrotron diffraction data, collected from the space crystals of the BARS protein, were comparable in resolution but more intense and showed significantly less mosaicity than data from Earth -grown crystals. Thi s indicates that the space -grown crystals had a higher order at the molecular level, and the X- ray diffraction data from the space crystals produced a more complete data set. These results contributed significantly to the structural study of BARS (Nardini 2002). ISS004E10827 - Astronaut, C arl Walz works with CPCG -H in US Laboratory during International Space Station Expedition 4. 167 ML-I is an enzyme that has the ability to inactivate ribosomes and inhibit cell replication. It is a target for new cancer treatments. Crystals of the protein attached to adenine (2 of 5 building blocks of DNA or RNA) were flown, and these crystal s yielded X -ray data to 1.9 angstrom. These data were used to refine the structure of the complex and were especially valuable in refining the active site conformation (Krauspenhaar 2002). Perhaps the most exciting results from the macromolecular crystalli zation experiments conducted in the CPCG -H [ribosomal ribonucleic acid] experiments. a synthetic RNA duplex of 5S rRNA, which is a model system for the study of the binding o f ribosomal RNA to proteins. Crystallization under microgravity provided crystals of significantly higher quality than those grown in one -g. The space crystals diffracted to a maximum resolution of 2.6 angstrom in contrast to the best Earth -grown crystals, which diffracted to 2.9 angstrom. The improved X- ray data facilitated the completion of the structure of the RNA segment (Vallazza 2002). To understand the true function of a protein, the structure must be determined. The model of the structure must be a ccurate to allow scientists to create compounds that bind to the protein. The understanding of the protein structure is of major importance with complex proteins (proteins that have significant folding). The 3 -D structure of the triple mutant protein Mb-YQR was solved by growing the protein on ISS during Expeditions 2 and 4. Following return to Earth, 3 -D models were created of the Mb -YQR proteins grown in space using X -ray crystallography techniques (Miele 2004). Structural studies of microgravity -grown c rystals have provided important information for the development of new drugs. For example, previous studies conducted using crystals grown on shuttle flights have been used in the design of inhibitors, which may serve as broad- spectrum antibiotics. The CPC G-H payload offers a great increase in the amount of space available for protein crystal growth, enhancing the space station's research capabilities and commercial potential.

DeLucas, OD, PhD , University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Dynamically Controlled Pro tein Crystal Growth demonstrates significant advances in the ability of researchers to control protein crystal growth processes. Previous research demonstrated that macromolecular crystals grown in microgravity are frequently larger and more perfectly formed than their Earth grown counterparts. Understanding the results obtained from the crystals can lead to advances in manufacturing and biological processes. E ARTH BENEFITS Proteins play a key role in the living world around us. They are the building blocks for humans and other animals and they regulate the biochemical processes of plants. Knowledge of the structure and design of proteins helps researchers design new drugs, combat disease, and improve agricultural products, such as pesticides. Researchers are unlocking this knowledge by studying protein crystals , their growth , and 3 -D atomic structure. For the most part, drugs are not so much discovered anymore, they are designed. Scientists can now target a specific protein of a pathogen, be it bacterial or viral, to maximize a drug 's effectiveness while at the same time minimizing possible side effects. This method, known as rational drug design, has one major downside. The exact structure of the target protein must be determined, down to the last molecule. To uncover this molecular structure, scientists use X -ray crystallography. A crystal of the protein is bombarded with X- rays to produce a pattern, which, much like a fingerprint , reveals the identity of the protein's atomic structure. But to get an accurate pattern, the crystal must be as free of imperfections as possible. Growing such crystals can be extremely difficult, even impossible, on Earth because gravity causes the crystals to settle on top of one another resulting in structural flaws. The DCPCG s ystem demonstrates significant advances in the ability of researchers to gain control of the protein crystal growth process and provides tremendous opportunities for both Glucose Isomerase crystals from Dynamically Controlled Protein Crystal Growth on International Space Station Expedition 3. From left to right, fast evaporation rate, medium evaporation rate and slow evaporation rate. NASA image. 170 terrestrial and microgravity research. Large, high -quality crystals are necessary for the determination of the molecular structure of macromolecules by X -ray diffraction analysis. Previous research has demonstrated that macromolecular crystals grown in microgravity are frequently larger and more perfectly formed than their Earth grown coun terparts. This improvement in size and quality translates into X- ray diffraction data of higher resolution and intensity, yielding better structural information about the molecule. SPACE BENEFITS The crystals grown in microgravity are able to grow larger and more organized than on Earth. The research done on these crystals may further human space exploration efforts by technological and biological advancements developed as a direct result from this research. RESULTS DCPCG was the first flight test of an a pparatus designed to control the crystal growth process by controlling the rate of evaporation. The apparatus worked in orbit, and crystals were grown for the test proteins; however, the investigators determined that the growth could have been better. The same apparatus was used in extensive testing on the ground. Researchers tested a selection of protein solutions, including insulin (a hormone produced by the pancreas to regulate the metabolism and use of sugar), serum albumin, and lysozyme (an enzyme that attacks bacteria) and found that a slower evaporation rate yielded better results than a more rapid evaporation rate. While the results of the ground tests were published, the DCPCG experiment investigators did not seek to publish any structures from crys tals grown in orbit. Additional flights were originally scheduled for this investigation until funding was removed. Due to the loss of funding, no additional analysis was performed. This investigation is complete and all results are published. 171 GRANADA CRYSTALLISATION FACILITY (GCF) Research Area: Macromolecular Crystal Growth Expedition(s): 3, 5, 6- 10, 12, 14- 17 Principal Investigator(s): Juan Manuel Garcia- Ruiz, PhD University of Granada, Granada, Spain RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Granada Crystallisation Facility (GCF) experiment concerns the crystallization of proteins in space by the counter -diffusion technique. The major objective is to produce a detailed analysis and quantitative interpretation of the relationship between the quality of the crystals and the environment in which they were produced. The secondary objective of the project is to compare identical experiments performed in space with free protein solutions on one hand, and on the ground in gelled protein solutions on the other hand. R ESULTS Most of the molecules did crystallize, both in space and on the ground and correspond to those molecules in which crystallization conditions were adequately optimized. Owing to the very short time available to prepare this project, the optimal crystallization conditions could not be found for some molecules, and they did not crystallize, either in space or on ground. Both on ground and microgravity grown crystals showed very good I/sigma(I) values for the crystallographic analysis performed postflight. For the model proteins, the values were comparable to the best obtained by other techniques. An analysis of the slight differences in crystal quality in terms of I/sigma(I) as a function of the reso lution revealed the inexistence of a clear and consistent pattern that led to conclude which environment yields the best crystals. The effect of redundancy on I/sigma(I) was clearly observed in the thaumatin: data sets collected at room temperature from cr ystals grown in space with gel, without gel, and on ground share similar multiplicity and yield similar crystal quality in terms of I/sigma(I). Interestingly, the differences in crystal quality that appeared between the data sets collected at 100 Kelvin an d their counterpart collected at room temperature can be correlated with differences in redundancy. Example of proteins crystallized in the Andromede synthase; m) Ferritin. LEC, Granada, Spain images. 172 In some cases, crystal quality was evaluated by X -ray diffraction. Regarding the crystal quality, the preliminary analysis of the data sets collected with s ynchrotron radiation showed that the crystals grown with the counter -diffusion technique shared excellent global indicators of X- ray data quality with no obvious difference between crystals grown under reduced convection conditions in space and crystals gr own under convection free conditions on ground. It is noticeable that due to unexpected logistic and safety problems, the data recorder could not be used with the space GCF. Therefore, it is impossible to know if the temperature profile during the mission and the one on the GCF on ground were similar enough to permit a reasonable crystal quality comparison.

E ARTH BENEFITS The surface glycoprotein of the West Nile virus is the main target for virus neutralizing antibodie s. The accurate spatial mapping of neutralizing virus epitopes is of fundamental importance for the development of antiviral medications, vaccines, and diagnostic tests. The project implementation provided fundamentally new information on the structure of a new type of viral proteins and combined the accumulated information on the organization of the virions of an entire family of warm- blooded animal viruses. S PACE BENEFITS The space grown crystals will be used to determine the 3 - dimensional structure of the protein. This will facilitate the continuation of the refinement of the technology for obtaining bio-crystals in microgravity and the development of crystallographic research in space in order to obtain high -quality protein crystals. RESULTS As a result of the Glikoproteid experiment, in most cases, the presence of small prism -shaped crystals was identified with a maximum size of approximately, 100 micron in the presence of amorphous deposits. The development relates to the following aspects. First, to the principal role of the 1 and 2 glycoproteins in the development of the infection process and the generation of an immune response to an alphavirus infection. Second, to the prevalence of alphavirus infections among pets and humans. Third, to the structural specifics of viral proteins, which as a rule, are typical for a group of viruses and usually differ greatly from other proteins. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. Results of the experiment during ISS -13.

EARTH BENEFITS Biotechnology and pharmaceutical researchers carry out the structural analysis of proteins a s part of their research process . However, it is difficult to obtain high quality protein crystals on E arth because the sedimentation and convection caused by gravi ty adversely affects the protein crystal growth. This makes it difficult to obtain suitable crystals for X -ray diffraction experiment s. The quality of the 3 -D structur al information of a protein depends on the quality of the crystals. Thus, the structures of many important proteins remain unknown due to difficulties obtaining high quality and/ or large size crystals . Consequently, the high -quality macromolecular crystals obtained for diffraction analysis are still importan t for protein engineers, biochemists, and pharmacologists. S PACE BENEFITS The results from this investigation may further human space exploration efforts by creating technological and biological advancements. R ESULTS Through the first, second, and third space experiments, JAXA launched alpha- amylase and lysozyme proteins to validate the developed crystallization technique. As a result, high- quality protein crystals were successfully obtained (eg, up to 0.9 \u00c5 in alpha -amylase) and the structur al analysis was carried out closely and carefully. JAXA was able to obtain the highest resolution data from some of the proteins (eg, sleeping and allergy material synthetase and proteins related to symptoms of parasite infection) provided by different user orga nizations. We expect these results will lead to new drug development in the future.

JAXA PCG creates high -quality protein crystals in a micro gravity environment to apply to structural biology and pharmaceutical activit ies. E ARTH BENEFITS This investigation may contribute to society by creating new drugs for diseases and new catalysts for the environment or for energy production. S PACE BENEFITS This investigation is applied to new knowledge and not specifically to advances in space exploration. R ESULTS The JAXA PCG studies have been performed for more than 20 years. JAXA has conducted protein crystallization experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS) since 2003. In this experiment, over 300 protein samples were launched in order to obtain high- quali ty crystals in space. In the past PCG missions, 60 - 70% of the proteins experimented were crystallized as single crystals . Excellent diffraction data used to determine the precise structure of proteins were obtained for several different proteins. Deta iled structur al analysis of those proteins are currently being conducted. In microgravity, the incorporation of molecules into the crystal highly depends on diffusion. The incorporated molecules may be allocated in order and the incorporation of impurity may be suppressed. Consequently, these nature of microgravity environment brings the grow th of the highly ordered crystals. It is assumed that the formation o f a protein depletion zone (PDZ) and an impurity depletion zone (IDZ) around growing crystals under a microgravity environment is due to the suppression of a convection flow. The combination of the crystal size (R), the diffusion coefficiency of the protei n molecule (D), and the kinetic coefficien cy for the protein molecule (), R/D, could be an index of the extent of these depletion zones. Larger 'R/D' are favorable to maximize the effect of microgravity environment. 'D' can be decreased ISS028E49720 - ISS crewmembers Satoshi Furakawa (L) and Sergei Volkov (R) holding the JAXA PCG during ISS Expedition 28.

JAXA image 178 by using high- viscous reagent such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 for crystallization solution, and '' can be increased by using highly purified protein sample for crystallization. Researchers now become able to estimate microgravity effects and optimize the crystallization condition prior to performing microgravity experiments by referring to this /D value . Here are some result s of the successful crystallization experiments in space. The crystal s of Aspergillus oryzae alpha- amylas e were obtained as cluster -like crystals that diffracted up to 1.4 \u00c5 resolution on the ground so far . However, after the further purification of the protein sample using FPLC and changing the precipitant from salt to high viscous polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, high -quality crystals were obtained. These crystals diffracted up to 0.79 \u00c5 resolution by visual inspection ; and a full X-ray diffraction dataset could be obtained up to 0.92 \u00c5 resol ution. After the data analysis, the electron density corresponding to hydrogen atoms were visualized. Hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (H -PGDS) and Lipocalin- type prostaglandin D synthase (L -PGDS) are both clinically important drug target proteins provided by Professor Urade of University of Tsukuba . H-PGDS was crystallized in space 12 times with more than 20 inhibitors since 1997. It was difficult to obtain good crystals of H -PGDS initially . Accordingly, scientists used the same strategy , which applied to the crystallization of alpha -amylase , to the crystallization of H -PGDS (using PEG as a high -viscous precipitant and highly purified protein sample) . Afterward, investigators were able to obtain high -quality crystals of H -PGDS with novel inhibitors that diffracted X -ray waves up to 1.1 \u00c5. Those novel inhibitors are expected to be candidates for novel drug designs. L-PGDS with a C65A mutation was previously crystallized with citrate or malonate as a precipitant, and the X -ray crystal structure was d etermined at 2.0 \u00c5 resolution. Then, scientists attempted to obtain high- quality crystals of the C64A mutant under microgravity environment by using the same conditions as used in the previous study, but they could not obtain a satisfactory results. T heref ore t he same strategy as mentioned above was used, and then high - quality crystals could be obtained in microgravity, which diffracted at around 1.0 \u00c5 resolution. The crystal quality was markedly improved through the use of a high -viscosity precipitant solution in microgravity, in combination with the use of a highly purified protein. These examples are a part of JAXA's procedure for growing high -quality protein crystals. From the purification of a protein sample to the high- resolution X -ray data collection , including the optimization of crystallization condition on the ground, JAXA has established a sequence of experimental steps for successful crystallization in space.

Such phenomena are strongly affected by buoyancy being accompanied by concentration and, consequently, density gradients that indeed promote buoyancy driven convective instabilities. E ARTH BENEFITS Without the convection and sedimentation effects induced by Earth's gravity, the experiments carried out in the PCDF will help to understand the fundamental processes that occur during crystallization. Understanding the proc ess of protein crystallization can help to obtain better quality crystals. This in turn will help improve their function in various applications, such as in protein -based medicines where they are a means of controlling the release rate of an active compoun d, or of increasing shelf -life. S PACE BENEFITS Zero gravity on the International Space Station helps to prevent the occurrence of negative sedimentation impacts known from ground experiments and supports undisturbed crystal formation. Precise knowledge o f the nucleation process is crucial to grow sufficiently homogeneous and large crystals, which may provide information on the protein molecule. The results from this investigation may further human space exploration efforts by creating technological and biological advancements as a direct result of this research. R ESULTS The corrected and reprocessed Dynamic Light Scattering data obtained in the experiment indicated the presence of 3 main particle populations during the experiment: the glucose isomerase tetramer at approximately 6 nm, particles with an apparent radius arou nd 200 nm, and a third population with apparent size between 2 and 30 m. For each of these, the apparent size of the particle changed with reactor temperature during the nucleation experiment. The reactor also contained glucose isomerase precipitate, comp licating the analysis. Nevertheless, the 200 nm particles seemed to fit well with the hypothesis of metastable dense liquid clusters in pre -nucleation conditions. Front view of Crystallization Diagnostics Facility hardware. ESA image. 181 Further investigation of the pre -nucleation behavior of glucose isomerase on ground showed that the presence of the 200 nm particles is the result of specific interactions between protein and precipitant. In addition, data indicated that the apparent size of the glucose isomerase depended on both specific interactions with the precipitant and on total ionic strength.

Understanding these results can lead to a better selection process for later protein crystal experiments on the International Space Station (ISS). E ARTH BENEFITS Knowledge of precise 3 -D molecular structure is a key component in biotechnology fields such as protein engineering and pharmacology. In order to obtain accurate data on the 3 -D structure of protein crystals or other macromolecules, scientists employ a process called X- ray Crystallography. Crystallographers construct computer models that reveal the complex structures of a protein molecule. However, in order to generate accurate computer models crystallographers must first crystallize the protein and analyze the resulting crystals by a process called X -ray diffraction. Precise measurements of thousands of diffracted intensities from each crystal help scientists map the probable positions of the atoms within each protein molecule. This complex process requires several months to several years to complete. On Earth, the crystallization process is hindered by forces of sedimentation and convection since the molecules in the crystal solution are not of uniform size and weight. This leads to many c rystals of irregular shape and small size that are unusable. However, the microgravity environment aboard the ISS is relatively free from the effects of sedimentation and convection and provides an exceptional environment for crystal growth. S PACE BENEFIT S Hardware that provides low -cost and low -crew maintenance crystal production in the microgravity environment is extremely beneficial to scientific studies on Earth. The crystals that are grown in microgravity grow larger and are better organized than thos e grown on Earth. The research that is done on these crystals may further human space exploration efforts by technological and biological advancements developed as a direct result of this research. Electron density map of thaumatin crystal grown on the International Space Station on Increment 2. NASA Marshall Space Center image . 183 RESULTS The PCG -EGN experiment was a platform that prov ided an economical and potential high - volume avenue to produce biological protein crystals in microgravity. The samples used in the EGN Dewar were placed into individual tubes, flash frozen , and allowed to warm to the ambient temperature aboard the ISS. Crystals produced in microgravity when compared to their counterparts grown on Earth are usually larger and more defined in structure making them better candidates for X -ray diffraction studie s. The X -ray diffraction studies show researchers the structure of the molecules in the proteins, and once the structure is understood, the active sites can be determined, which may lead to improvement in medical treatment for certain conditions. Successful crystallization rates were as follows: Expedition 0 (prior to permanent human occupation of ISS), 10 of 24 proteins and viruses; Expedition 1, 4 of 23 proteins and viruses; Expedition 2, 6 of 8 proteins and both viruses; Expedition 4, 3 of 9 proteins and 0 of 2 viruses. Major crystals obtained included Bence -Jones protein, Bromegrass Mosaic the rate of successful crystallizations was not as high as expected. Although many of the crystals produced were no better than those obtained in the ground laboratory, there we re still some significant structural results. When compared to their Earth -grown counterparts, the space -grown thaumatin crystals diffracted to a higher resolution, and some crystals showed as much as 40% more intensity during the diffraction process. This resulted in a more accurate protein structure model (electron density map) being produced from the space -grown crystal data. The pea lectin crystals also diffracted to higher resolution than their Earth -grown counterparts. Data from the space -grown crysta ls were the best obtained, giving rise to the highest resolution structure for pea lectin. A refinement for the structural model of pea lectin is in progress. DcoH crystals grown on Expedition 1 also appeared to be of better quality than those grown on Ear th. Student investigations across the 4 Expeditions were successful in crystallizing a number of proteins. Although many of the crystals did not appear to be better than previously analyzed crystals, some of the crystals from Expedition 2 were used for microscopic observation and X-ray examination.

EARTH BENEFITS Biotechnology and pharmaceutical researchers carry out the process of protein crystallization in order to grow large, well- ordere d crystals for use in X- ray diffraction studies. However, on Earth, the protein crystallization process is hindered by forces of sedimentation and convection since the molecules in the crystal solution are not of uniform size and weight. This leads to many crystals of irregular shape and small size that are unusable for X -ray diffraction. X - ray diffraction is a complex process that requires several months to several years to complete, and the quality of data obtained about the 3 -D structure of a protein is directly dependent on the degree of perfection of the crystals. Thus, the structures of many important proteins remain a mystery simply because researchers are unable to obtain crystals of high quality or large size. Consequently, the growth of high -qualit y, macromolecular crystals for ISS005E21531 - Astronaut Peggy A. Whitson, Expedition 5 science officer, works the PCG -STES hardware a board the International Space Station. 187 diffraction analysis have been of primary importance for protein engineers, biochemists, and pharmacologists. Fortunately, the microgravity environment aboard the International Space Statoin (ISS) is relatively free from the effects of sedimentation and convection and provides an exceptional environment for crystal growth. Crystals grown in microgravity could help scientists gain detailed knowledge of the atomic, three -dimensional structure of many important protein molecules used in pharmaceutical research for cancer treatments, stroke prevention , and other diseases. The knowledge gained could be instrumental in the design and testing of new drugs. Protein crystal growth experiments aid the generation of computer models of carbohydrates, nucleic acids and proteins, and further advance the progress of biotechnology. Understanding these results can lead to advances in manufacturing and biological processes, both in medicine and agriculture. S PACE BENEFITS The crystals grown in microgravity are able to grow larger and more organized than those grown on Earth. The results from this investigation may further human space exploration efforts by creating technological and biological advancements as a direct result from this research. R ESULT S PCG-STES is a suite of 9 experiments with additional shared samples for associated investigators. Samples were taken to and from station five times for crystallization during Expeditions 2, 4, 5, and 6. The logistical considerations of spaceflight affect ed some of the results, as flight delays compromised some samples, and a jarring drop of the hardware shortly after return on 11A/STS -113 probably destroyed any larger crystals that had formed during that set of runs. PCG -STES samples in DCAM were in orbit prior to the Space Shuttle Columbia accident and then spent an unprecedented 981 days (Nov ember 2002 - August 2005) on ISS before being returned on the next space shuttle flight . PCG-STES- IDQC The PCG -STES -IDQC operated on the ISS during Expedition 2. The experiment used 2 types of protein samples, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and thaumatin, used to grow crystals and was active for 22 days. The bFGF samples were originally supposed to b e loaded into 45 PCAM chambers. Due to regulations that are related to flight, the original formulation of chemicals was declared ineligible for fight. After a new set a chemical formulations were created, 18 chambers were loaded with the samples. Of the 1 8 chambers 8 produced crystals. The largest crystal was about 80 micrometers x 50 micrometers. The thaumatin samples were originally to Image from Vahedi -Faridi, A. Acta Crystallographica, Section D, Biological Crystallography, a Manganese Superoxide dismutases crystal grown in microgravity. The pink color is a result from the oxidized manganese in the active site. 188 be loaded into 23 PCAM chambers. Due to flight regulations, one compound (hexadecyltimethyl ammonium bromide) in the sam ple was not eligible for flight. A new formulation was created to replace the original sample and was used to fill 45 chambers. There was a clerical error during the transcribing of the recipe and this affected 4 sample chambers. Of the remaining chambers, 9 produced crystals. The crystals that were produced in microgravity were large needle splays (Kundrot, Increment Two One Year Postflight Report). PCG-STES- IMP The PCG -STES -IMP operated on ISS during Expedition 5. The E. coli MsbA and EmrE membrane prote in samples used did not produce crystals. Previous ground tests indicated that crystal growth was possible. Upon examining the pedestals (part of the PCAM trays where the sample was originally loaded) it was found that the protein drops were no longer pres ent. The drops also contained a detergent that is used in crystallization experiments. These drops had a lower surface tension and were more sensitive to displacement than proteins that do not contain the detergent. An explanation for the displacement of t he drops is that the trays, PCAMs, or the entire STES unit was bumped or jolted at some point before the experiment was initiated. The investigator has concluded that new recipes for crystallization that use detergents are needed in order to raise the sur face tension of the protein drops so they can survive the normal movements associated with STES unit during the round trip from ground to orbit (Chang, One Year PostflightReport, 2003) . PCG-STES- MM Not surprisingly, given the wide array of materials and objectives, some samples did produce large crystals, while other samples produced crystals no better than those produced on Earth. Yet other samples failed to crystallize at all. Crystals of MnSOD, produced during Expedition 4, exhibited an 80 -fold volume increase when compared to the crystals produced on Earth. The crystals that were produced in orbit ranged from small, needle- like crystals to large 3 -D crystals. These crystals were used for Synchrotron X -ray analysis, the use of a high -energy, adjustable particle beam used for crystal diffraction. Through this analysis it was determined that the diffraction resolution and quality of data for the crystals produced in microgravity were increased when compared to the diffraction resolution of the crystals grown on Earth (Vahedi - Faridi 200 3).

NASA Marshall Flight Space Center image . 189 PCG-STES- MMTP The PCG -STES -MMTP operated on the International Space Station during Expedition 5. The experiment used Mitochondrial Metabolite Transport Proteins samples to grow crystals. This investigation suffered sample loss from the sample pedestals during the mission. Even though there was a loss of some of the sample, crystals did grow in 4 out of the 28 wells. Unfortunately, these crystals were too small and poor quality to perform X -ray diffraction. PCG-STES- MS The PCG -STES -RGE operated on the International Space Station during Expeditions 6 through 11. This mission was launch in November 2002 and was returned in August 2005. This was the longest running crystal experiment to date aboard the ISS. PCG-STES- RDP PCG-STES- RDP operated on I SS during Expedition 5 during 2 separate runs. The experiment used an engineered RNA enzyme sample to grow crystals. Crystals were not obtained from the first run of this investigation. This was attributed to using the precipitant MPD (hexylene glycol), which is now known to evaporate more than expected in the PCAMs. This investigation began in June 2002 and was concluded in October 2002. During the post analysis, it was discovered there was an increase in the concentration of magnesium chloride in the samples, which may have led to the degradation of the samples. (One Year Postflight Report, 2003) The second run of this investigation began in October 2002 and concluded in December 2002. The detailed examination of the PCAM trays revealed that tiny crystals had grown in the trays. They may have been overlooked in the initial examination when the samples were returned to Earth. It is not known whether the crystals grew in orbit or post- landing. Upon further examination, it appeared that the samples had been disturbed. An explanation of the disturbance is that the STES unit had been dropped or jolted during transport with enough force to displace the samples or shatter crystals. These experiments lead to an optimization of growing the ribozyme in ground laboratories. Crystals are now more reproducible. The rate of growth has increased from 4% to 50% (One Year Postflight Report, 2003) . PCG-STES- RGE No information gathered. PCG-STES- SA Not surprisingly, given the wide array of materials and objectives, some sa mples did produce large crystals while other samples produced crystals no better than those produced on Earth. Yet other samples failed to crystallize at all. Crystals of MnSOD, produced during Expedition 4, exhibited an 80 -fold volume increase when compared to the crystals produced on Earth. The crystals that were produced in orbit ranged from small, needle -like crystals to large 3 -D crystals. These crystals were used for Synchrotron X -ray analysis, the use of a high -energy, adjustable particle beam used f or crystal diffraction. Through this analysis it was determined that the 190 diffraction resolution and quality of data for the crystals produced in microgravity were increased when compared to the diffraction resolution of the crystals grown on Earth (Vahedi - Faridi 2003). High -resolution structural data were also obtained from human albumin and human antithrombin III crystals. PCG-STES- VEKS The PCG-STES -VEKS operated on the ISS during Expeditions 2, 4, 5. The experiment used precipitants of ammonium sulfate, sodium chloride, 2 -methyl -2,4-pentanediol , and polyethylene glycol. The samples that used ammonium sulfate and sodium chloride showed that a ctivation of 4 days provides equilibrium, while activation for 2 days provides 90% equilibrium. This indicates that shuttle missions of 10 days are long enough to allow salt samples to reach equilibrium. For the remaining samples, time to equilibrium is de pendent on the drop volume; at the highest volume, it takes approximately 10 days to reach equilibrium. (Achari, Increments 2 and 4 One Year Postflight Reports). Expedition 5 used 9 trays in PCAM 6 on flight STS -111/UF2. The sample in 7 of the 9 trays los t volume during the experiment. The space shuttle mission was unexpectedly extended, which might explain the loss of volume in the trays. Due to the loss of volume, the kinetics data was not obtained (Achari, Increment 5 One Year Postflight Report).

Garcia -Ruiz, PhD, University of Granada, Granada, Spain Fermin Otalora Munoz, University of Granada, Granada, Spain Ingrid Zegers, PhD, Free University, Brussels, Belgium RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The major objective of the Protein Crystal Growth Monitoring by Digital Holographic Microscope for the International Space Station ( PROMIS S-1,-2,-3,-4) experiments is to produce a detailed analysis and a quantitative interpretation of the relationship between the quality of the obtained crystals and the environment in which they are produced by the method of digital holography. The experiment aims to investigate the protein growth processes in weightless conditions using the counter diffusion technique in order to measure the parameters of the growing protein crystals and to measure the composition changes (depletion zone) of liquid around the growing protein crystals. R ESULTS The following results are based on the first 3 series of PromlSS experiments, which were performed on 6 proteins: the complex of the variable domain of a camelid heavy chain antibody with Iysozyme (cablys3*lysozyme), Thermotoga marirtima equine spleen ferritin, and lumazine synthase. For 12 out of the 18 reactors flown (6 reactors per mission), crystals were obtained in the right time frame. The results showed that counter diffusi on experiments can be useful not only for producing crystals of higher quality, but also in cases where one wants to obtain a different crystal form with improved (diffraction) properties. The effect of diffusive conditions was very extensively investigate d for the proteins TIM and cablys3*1ysozyme. For TIM, more than 100 datasets were collected from crystals grown either in non -convective environments (in microgravity or in gels on the ground) or by conventional techniques prone to convection. The results show that there is a clear effect of diffusion, and the crystal perfection was higher for crystals grown in a non-convective environment. Analysis of crystal growth rates and mass transport showed that the depletion zone model cannot explain this, as TIM c rystals essentially grew in a regime controlled by surface growth rates. Diffusion is not rate -limiting and no depletion zone was formed. For other proteins like cablys3*lysozyme the influence of a diffusive environment was negligible.

Shcherbakov, MD, PhD, Biopreparat, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Structural Research on Protein Candidates for an AIDS Vaccine in Earth and Space Condition (Vaktsina- K) investigation aims to create a new generat ion of vaccines against viral infections based on artificial proteins with predetermined antigenicity and immunogenicity. Analysis of the spatial structure provides information on the conformation of the active center and on the efficacy of the protein construction, and allows necessary changes to be introduced in order to increase the biological activity of artificial proteins. E ARTH BENEFITS As a result of Vaktsina- K, the spatial structure of the protein monocrystals obtained are being studied, the mechanism of their action is being determined, and the possibility of using the information obtained to create new pharmaceuticals is being assesse d to facilitate the creation of new vaccines against harmful viral diseases. S PACE BENEFITS Improvements in the technology for producing biocrystals in microgravity and development of crystallographic research in space will make it possible to obtain high -quality protein crystals. RESULTS As a result of the use of several types of precipitants for crystallizing TBI protein in microgravity, monocrystals were obtained th at were several times greater in size than those grown on Earth. In a number of instances, the total dimensions of the crystals permitted testing of their quality (reflective capability) using X- ray diffraction methods. Vaktsina -K resulted in crystals of rod -like or tubular shape, or without defined facets with a maximum size of about 200 m in the presence of amorphous precipitation. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. Activation of the crystallization process in the Luch- 2 hardware.

E ARTH BENEFITS Performance of this investigation makes it possible to expand the circle of tasks for space biotechnology experiments in the direction of solving the issue of obtaining biological end- products in an integrated technological chain and refine stage -by-stage processes during orbital flight. S PACE BENEFITS The Glovebox -S apparatus makes it possible to assure the sterility and cleanliness of experiments being conducted, and prevents contamination of the ISS Russian Segment, thus assuring crew safety . The use of this equipment is the first step on the path to creating a bio -lab module on board an orbital station that will be the site of laboratory production of biological preparations and target biologically active substances for long -term interplanetary flights and planetary stations. RESULTS During the course of the Aseptik investigation it was revealed that the interior air s pace of the glovebox was not sterile for bacteria. Moreover, this experiment also revealed the non -sterility Photographs of cultures grown in Poverkhnost samplers after the Asept ik experiment was conducted. Poverkhnost 6.1 and Poverkhnost 6.4 green mold; Poverkhnost 6.5 shows cocci. Poverkhnost 6.1 Poverkhnost 6. 4 Poverkhnost 6. 5 195 of the internal surface of the Glovebox -S apparatus . The same varieties of fungi and bacteria were encountered fairly frequently when the non -steri lity of the Glovebox -S apparatus, both inside and out, was revealed . It was possible to determine that the surface of the Glovebox -S apparatus was non -sterile in 2 places: the surface of the lower loading hatch after the performance of the Kaskad experiment and after sterilization, and the surface of the loading port. Using the data obtained, one may conclude that the hypothesis concerning the introduction of contaminating microflora through the placement into the glovebox of equipment necessary fo r biotechnology experiments being conducted on board the ISS Russian Segment was justified. The mold cultivated belongs to the genus Penicillium , and the bacterial colony belongs to the cocci . Since these types of fungi and bacteria have been found before when the Glovebox -S apparatus was found to be non -sterile, one may conclude that the glove box may get contaminated during the transfer of equipment necessary for biotechnology experiments being conducted on board the ISS RS. Based on the data, it seems wise to treat equipment being transferred into the glovebox with sterilizing wipes, and to perform additional treatment of the glovebox surface after conducting biotechnology experiments, paying particular attention to hard- to-reach areas. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication. 196 CULTIVATING ESCHERIA COLI PRODUCER OF CAF1 PROTEIN IN WEIGHTLESSNESS (ASTROVAKTSINA ) Research Area: Microbiology Expedition(s): 16 and 19 - 24 Principle Investigator(s): Grigoriy Y. Shcherbakov, MD, PhD, Biopreparat, Moscow, Russia Anatoliy M. Vasilyev, PhD, Institute of Engineering Immunology, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Cultivating Escheria coli Producer of CAF1 Protein in Weightlessness (Astrovaktsina) studies the effect of spaceflight factors on the processes of biosynthesis, secretion, capsule formation, and the biological properties of the E. coli producer of the genetically engineered CAF1 a ntigen protein of Yersinia pestis during its exposure to microgravity. EARTH BENEFITS The results of the experiment may be used on Earth to obtain highly pure preparation of V antigen blended with polyhistidine peptide as the main component of a new -gener ation molecular vaccine against yersiniosis, as well as for the targeted creation of new medicines, including medicine for treating Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome and a number of tumor diseases. S PACE BENEFITS Incubation in spaceflight conditions fo llowed by selection on Earth may be used as a method for obtaining lines of productive strains with an elevated number of copies of plasmids controlling the synthesis of targeted products. This data is important for developing the biotechnology of molecular vaccines against yersiniosis and other infectious diseases in humans and animals, and also for developing a program of life -support systems for cosmonauts during long -term spaceflights. RESULTS Displaying of working cultures on agar slants to microgravity conditions, and the effect of other orbital flight factors, led recombinant Escherichia coli HB101/pVHB62 to synthesize an increased amount of the target product at a level 30% \u00b1 10% greater than that of control samples located on Earth (for example, 12.3 mg/ml and 9.8 mg/ml). Lyophilically dried culture samples did not differ in the level of V gene synthesis in the experiment al or control cultures.

EARTH BENEFITS Bacteriophages are used to prevent and treat certain bacterial infections. Due to their specific lytic action on bacteria, they are an alternative to antibiotics. They are strictly specific, and live in the human body in the presence of specific bacterial flora, then due to the absence of a substrate, they die and the body self- cleans. S PACE BENEFITS During the long -term presence of crewmembers in space station conditions, human microflora infiltrates the structure, equipment, and materials which cause c onditions similar to the development of hospital based infections. On Earth, the battle with these infections is fought using harsh disinfectants that cannot be used in spaceflight conditions. In these conditions, bacteriophage preparations will turn out to be indispensable; the treatment with them may be similar to wet cleaning, and after inactivation of microorganisms, the bacteriophages themselves die. Such specific sterilizing preparations will also help to eliminate dispersed microorganisms destroying materials and equipment. Therefore, during long -term autonomous spaceflight conditions, having such preparations on board the vehicle is promising. RESULTS BAKTERIOFAG Of the lyophilically dried bacteriophages exposed on the ISS one, Staphylococcus aureus bacteriophage exhibited increased lytic activity. Data indicated that in the lyophilically dried forms of bacteriophages exposed to space factors, the structure of particles was unchanged and the heads of the phage particles contain DNA. The biological properties of the bacteriophages (morphology of negative colonies, spectrum of lytic action, and stability under the influence of fluctuating pH level s) do not change relative to initial data. All studied bacteriophages retained their viability and biological activity after being in space for 3 months. However, it was noted that the Electron micrographs of bacteriophages after 4 months in space from ISS Expedition 30. Roscosmos image. 199 concentration of bacteriophages was an order of magnitude lower than the initial concentration. BAKTERIOFAG -L Experiment results showed that bacteriophages in lyophilically dried form do not change their biological properties over the course of 3 months under spaceflight conditions. The study of the properties of bacteriophages after 3 - month and 6 -month exposures to spaceflight showed that in lyophilically dried bacteriophages exposed to long -term spaceflight, the ly tic spectrum reduces by 1.5 - 2 times, the lytic activity reduces by 5 orders of magnitude, and resistance to temperature factors and pH fluctuations also decreases. The obtained results show that gel -form bacteriophages exposed to spaceflight for 1 month do not reduce lytic activity, maintain their resistance to temperature and pH fluctuations, and this specific timeframe is acceptable for their storage. Improving the environment for retaining therapeutic bacteriophages in long -term spaceflight requires further experimentation. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. Electron micrographs of bacteriophages after 6 months in space from ISS Expedition 31.

Sc, Belgium Nuclear Research Center, Mol, Belgium RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Bacterial Acclimation and Adaptation to the Space Environment Conditions -A (BASE -A) investigation studies the effects of space conditions such as microgravity and cosmic radiation aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on physiological and metabolic processes in bacteria. The bacteria used for MESSAGE and BASE experiments included R. rubrum S1H as MELiSSA bacterium and Cupriavidus metalidurans CH34 as an example of a bacterium adapted to a variety of harsh environments, including the clean rooms where satellites are built. R ESULTS Growth, spontaneous mutants, and viable counts were similar to ground experiments. Proteomic data show limited effects of spaceflight conditions, especially for C. metallidurans , although some uncommon proteins involved in acetone metabolism, were found to be over-expressed in space. Transcriptomic data were mainly obtained for R. rubrum and provided information about the importance of experimental design and the effect of low dos es of cosmic radiation. This effect was mainly revealed in the BASE -A spaceflight experiment where various over- expressed genes matched those found during ground tests of ISS radiation. Thus, for the first time, studies showed a low dose of ionizing radiat ion (2 mGy) can induce a significant response at the transcriptomic level, although no change in cell viability was observed. This experiment will surely stimulate further studies of effects of low -dose ionizing radiation in bacteria. These will be paramou nt for implementation of bioreactors in spaceflight and on planetary stations. P UBLICATION (S) Leys N, Baatout S, Rosier C, et al.

R ESULTS The preliminary results indicated that none of the 4 test bacteria samples were able to proliferate in space during the incubation. The reason remains unclear, as all cells were viable, present in the culture medium and temperature data indicated 28\u00b0C. In addition, all parallel ground control cultures did grow. Only one of the bacteria samples that were packed for return showed growth in the non -fixed cultures. It is suspected that growth occurred in these samples after incubation during the 16.5 hours additional storage at ambient temperature in the Soyuz before return. As 4 different bacteria and different culture media were involved, a \"biological\" cause of failure can be excluded. The 4 different bacter ia and different culture media prepared by different research groups used in the flight experiment units were checked postflight and have proven to be correct. In addition, samples were prepared by different science teams, minimizing also the potential of human error as cause of experiment failure. Although the experiment failure root cause could not be identified, it is suspected that perhaps a possible error in the timeline, which may have caused a too -short incubation time between automatic activation an d fixation or removal from the incubator, may have limited the cell proliferation. Unfortunately, as no bacteria proliferated during flight, insufficient biomass was obtained to continue cell and molecular analysis. Thus the samples from the BASE -B and BAS E-C flight experiment cannot be exploited any further and no trustable scientific data could be obtained. This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected. Kubik experiment hardware.

Nyn, PhD, Biopreparat, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Study of the Effects of Spaceflight Factors on the Technological and Biomedical Characteristics of Bifidobacteria (Bif) investigation identifies the specifics of metabolism and morphology of different phenotypes of one strain of the Bifidobacteria caused by microgravity in order to obtain probiotics with improved biomedical properties and to increase the efficiency of production. E ARTH BENEFITS A comparative analysis of the morpho -physiological dissociation of the bifidobacteria on Earth and in microgravity, assuming appropriate procedures, will facilitate identification of the specifics of metabolism and morphology of different phenotypes of one strain, which will provide new opportunities to raise the efficiency of producing bifido -containing probiotics with improved biomedical characteristics. S PACE BENEFITS The spaceflight factors may only serve as the main starting point for selecting organisms with modified properties. Subsequent work with them on Earth may assist scientists in obtaining technologically important material. RESULTS Bif utilized the Bifidobacterium bifidum 1 and Bifidobacterium adolescentis -42 strains to observe onbo ard the ISS. Bif showed once again that microorganisms undergo phenotypic changes during cultivations under the influence of different environmental factors. The obtained results confirm that possibly, the changes in microorganisms' activity types, which occur on board of a space vehicle under condition of microgravity are not often due to genetic or chromosomal mutations. And these are the very ones that define the stability of the newly obtained properties of organisms and transmission of these properties from generation to generation. Spaceflight factors, the most significant of which, microgravity, impossible to simulate on Earth, may serve only as the most important starting point for the selection of organisms with modified properties. Subsequent work with them on the ground may assist scientists in obtaining technologically important material. This investigation is complete and additional results are pending publication.

Krasheninnikova, PhD, Biokhimmash, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Obtaining Highly -Efficient Strains of Microorganisms for the Production of Biological Petroleum Degrading Compounds, Organophosphate Substances, Plant Protection Means, and Exopolysaccharides used in the Petroleum Industry ( Bioekologiya) investigations have 2 goals. The goal of Bioekologiya- M is to obtain strains of high performance microorganisms for production of growth -promoting hormones.

The fungal species chosen for experiments belong to 4 genera selected as organic material decomposers, possible contaminants of materials destined for interplanetary travel, aggressive biodeteriogens of artworks, and wooden buildings. R ESULTS Different growth rates were observed for the aerial and for the submerged mycelium. Growth of aerial mycelium has a high rate in flight and ground controls up to Flight Day 5, then becomes lower and stops between Flight Day 8-9. Sporulation takes place in flight and ground, but it is less abundant compared to ground and laboratory control. Integration of the microcapsules in the biocontainers showed a negative effect on the growth and on the sporulation in comparison with the laboratory control; new ground experiments will be made to acquire more information. Microgravity reduced the rate of growth of aerial mycelium and stimulates the growth of submerged mycelium. The CFS- A experiment demonstrated that fungi as biodeteriogens and biodegraders are able to grow in microgravity, such as inside the International Space Station (ISS) where substrates are humid. For the dry spore samples the spores chosen for the CFS -A experiment were still viable after 5 months in microgravity. Ulocladium chartarum spores are more resistant from a viability point of view then Basipetospora halophila and Cladosporium herbarum spores but less than Aspergillus niger spores. Aspergillus niger spores were more than 91% viable on all types of wafers. Basipetospora halophila spores had a lower viability on ISS than on the ground, which could suggest that white spores are more sensitive to the ISS environment than black spores. Colored fungi. ESA image. 207 Basipetospora halophila spores also showed a lower viability on the silica w afers than on plastic wafers, and no viability on iron wafers was probably due to a strong oxidation of iron wafer in contact with salts removed from the nutrient.

Craig Venter Institute, San Diego, Calif ornia R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES Microbes are the most abundant life forms on E arth, but the least well characterized and understood. International Space Station High Efficiency Particle Filter Analysis (ISS High Efficiency Particle Filter Analysis) studies the microbes present in the air of the International Space Station (ISS) by examining those trapped on the ISS air filter. The goal is to characterize the enormous diversity of microbes that a re normally present in indoor environments. E ARTH BENEFITS Humans spend the majority of their lives in indoor environments, but little is known about the microorganisms living along with us, including in the air we breathe. This research identifies and helps us understand the vast diversity of microorganisms present in indoor air. Many of these are beneficial to humans, some are harmful, but most are merely co -inhabitants. S PACE BENEFITS In order to maintain crew health aboard the ISS, it is essential to ensure crew members have clean air to breathe. Identifying and understanding the microorganisms present on the ISS HEPA filters allows for mitigation of any potential hazards that may result from this very specialized microgravity environment. R ESULTS Single microbial cells are currently frozen and waiting to be sequencing. The analysis portion of this experiment is not funded and is awaiting spare capacity on an additional run to be conducted. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication.

Nickerson, PhD, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona David W. Niesel, PhD, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas Michael McGinnis, PhD, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES Microbial Drug Resistance and Virulence (MDRV) evaluates microbial drug resista nce and the mechanisms of virulence (infection potential) in microbial cultures. E ARTH BENEFITS By understanding the unique spectrum of microbial genetic and virulence changes induced by spaceflight, this experiment could yield valuable knowledge leading to advances in vaccine development and other therapeutics for treatment, prevention, and control of infectious diseases on Earth as well as in space. S PACE BENEFITS Results from these experiments could provide important information on the threat of pathogens in the space environment. This could assist with deve lopment of diagnostic tools to monitor the atmosphere, water and surfaces for the presence of these microbes as well as developing countermeasures to manage infections. Understanding the molecular responses of these organisms to spaceflight is a necessary step that significantly contributes improved systems for keeping crewmembers safe. Furthermore, identification of the changes caused by spaceflight to gene expression and proteins could provide novel targets for pharmacological intervention to prevent and control infectious disease, which ultimately facilitates safe and productive long -term exploration of the moon and Mars. R ESULTS The Microbe experiment aboard STS- 115 was the first spaceflight experiment to show increased virulence of the pathogen, , serovar Typhimurium (S. Dominic Gorie, commander, watches Group Activation Pack float, containing Microbial Drug Resistance Virulence. Photo was taken during STS-123/Expedition 16 joint operations. 210 Typhimurium ) in response to spaceflight culture. As a follow -up experiment, the MDRV experiment was performed in March 2008 during the STS- 123/1JA mission to the International Space Station to reproduce and confirm the Microbe findings (Wilson 2008). MDRV expanded th e scope of Microbe by culturing S. Typhimurium in 3 different growth conditions, which included a rich medium, a minimal, high inorganic salt medium, and the rich media supplemented with key inorganic salts. This experiment confirmed the Microbe findings, as S. Typhimurium grown in a rich medium exhibited increased virulence compared to identically grown bacteria on Earth. Interestingly, the S. Typhimurium grown in either the minimal, high inorganic salt medium or the rich media supplemented with key inorganic salts did not display this increased virulence. Subsequent ground -based testing using the NASA designed spaceflight analogue Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor supported this finding and indicated that the key inorganic salt which was influencing the changes in S. Typhimurium was inorganic phosphate. Both Microbe and MDRV have prompted new studies using spaceflight analogues and true spaceflight. One example includes the study of bacterial genes that were identified as a part of the spaceflight response but have not had their function previously identified. These genes are of particular importance to determine if they play a role in mediating bacterial responses to low fluid shear and/or have additional functions that influence bacterial physiology in general. The study in collaboration with the Microbe/MDRV team (Jennings 2011) investigated the gene ydcI, which was found to be differentially regulated when cultures grown in the RWV were compared to controls. The ydcI gene is a highly conserved DNA binding protein found in multiple Gram- negative bacteria, including S. Typhimurium ; however, the function was previous not well understood. From this study, ydcI was found to be a part of the rpoS regulon, which is responsible for a variety of stress responses in S. Typhimurium . Future experiments will be aime d to identify the genes that are members of a potential \" ydcI regulon\" and how they are linked to stress resistance, host cell interactions, biofilm formation, and other bacterial characteristics. The results of MDRV and future follow -up studies should continue to provide newfound knowledge to keep crew members safe during space exploration and to identify novel targets for vaccines and therapeutic development.

Ralstonia metallidurans CH34 is a proteobacterium that can survive in hars h environmental conditions. Rhodospirillum rubrum S1H (only used in MESSAGE -2) is of major importance for a future bioregenerative life support system called MELiSSA under development at the European Space Agency (ESA) . R ESULTS The results showed that space conditions can significantly change the physiology and metabolism of bacteria. The differences in bacterial survival and growth observed between space and ground cultures of R. metallidurans CH34 in the MESSAGE -1 experiment were not observed in MESSAGE - 2. Also the R. rubrum S1H cell survival count indicated no significant difference between space and ground -grown cultures. It should be noted that a more stable temperature control was possible in the MESSAGE -2 experiment. The motility of R. metallidurans CH34 showed no significant differences between ground and space cultures, though this was based on pure visual analysis and did not allow good quantitative analysis. Flow cytometry data did not show any significant difference between R. me tallidurans CH34 cells grown in space or on ground for cells size and shape, membrane integrity and potential, intracellular pH, and intracellular concentrations of reactive oxygen species. For R. rubrum S1H , significant differences in cell physiology were observed. Space -grown cells showed a change in cell size and shape in space conditions. Cell permeability was increased and membrane potential was reduced under space conditions, indicating a lower viability of cells grown in space conditions. The transcriptomic analysis of R. rubrum S1H showed 372 genes that were significantly up -regulated under space conditions. Typical genes related to oxidative stress were identified: H 2O2 detoxification, SOS response (a global response to DNA damage in which the cell cycle is arrested and DNA repair and mutagenesis are induced), iron transport, and metabolism. Induction of genes related to chemotaxis, flagellum structure and metabolism, co balamin metabolism, and nitrogen regulation system were also observed . 213 PUBLICATION (S) Leys N, Baatout S, Rosier C, et al.

Collins, PhD, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Gravitational Effects on Biofilm Formation during Spacef light (Micro -2) experiment studies how gravity alters biofilm (aggregation of microorganisms) formation with the goal of developing new strategies to reduce their impact on crew health and to minimize the harmful effects of biofilms on materials in space and on Earth. E ARTH BENEFITS According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), hospital -acquired infections are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States behind stroke, cancer , and heart disease. Furthermore, it is estimated that more than 65% of all bacterial infections are associated w ith biofilms. A greater understanding of biofilms is essential if we are to find effective methods to combat their formation. Furthermore, the low -shear conditions microbes experience in microgravity are similar to those found in the human body that are di fficult to study. This work may provide new insights into the role of shear and other physical effects, such as convection, on biofilm formation . S PACE BENEFITS Understanding the different effects of microgravity on biofilm formation may provide new insig hts into combating biofilm formation in space and may lead to better management and treatment of infections if they occur. Also, novel antimicrobial surfaces are tested for their potential to reduce the impact of biofilms in future spacecraft design. R ESULTS While planktonic cultures (grown under constant mixing) of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight on biofilm development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue, P seudomonas aeruginosa was cultured during 2 Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS -132 and STS -135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized. Micro -2 reveals the first evidence of spaceflight affecting the biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa. An increased number of viable cells, increased biomass, and increased thickness were observed in spaceflight biofilms when compared to The Group Activation Pack - Fluid Processing Apparatuses is essentially a microgravity test tube that allows controlled, sequential mixing of 2 or 3 fluids in a weightless environment . BioServe Space Technologies, University of Colorado - Boulder, Colorado image. 215 ground controls regardless of phosphate concentration or carbon source. Results also show P. aeruginosa forming column -and- canopy shaped biofilms during spaceflight and flagella- driven motility plays a key role in the formation of this unique structure, where flagella are structures that enable cells to move in liquids by \"swimming.\" The findings indicate that altered biofilm production during spaceflight may have detrimental impacts on long -term spaceflight missions, where increases in biofouling and microbial- induced corrosion could have profound impacts on mission success. Furthermore, it is important to explore the effects of such changes on human health through pathogenic and beneficial interactions between humans and microbes during spaceflight (Kim 2013).

In this manner, the selective growth of every strain in the yeast deletion series can be analyzed. E ARTH BENEFITS Fundamental Space Biology (FSB) uses the space environment to probe the fundamental nature of life on Earth in order to enhance the understanding o f how life responds to physical forces on Earth and in space. S PACE BENEFITS Direct assessment of selective pressures on cell populations through generations using the yeast deletion series is a critical experiment to directly address risks to biological integrity and life -based support systems for long -term occupation in space. Results from this study allow researchers to gain a global perspective to the genes that play a role in survival, in regards to microgravity conditions and allows for a more thorough understanding of the effects of microgravity on a model organism. The expectation is that what is observed in yeast is likely to have a comparable effect in mammalian cells. This is supported by the observation that regulatory mechanisms are largely conserved between yeast and mammalian cells. R ESULTS Results are pending publication.

Nickerson, PhD, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Microbe experiment investigates the effects of the spaceflight environment on virulence (ability to infect) of 3 model have been identified as potential thr eats to crew health based upon previous spaceflight missions. E ARTH BENEFITS By understanding the unique spectrum of microbial genetic and virulence changes induced by spaceflight, this experiment can yield valuable knowledge leading to advances in vaccine development and other therapeutics for treatment, prevention and control of infectious diseases on Earth as well as in space. S PACE BENEFITS Results from this single flight experiment can provide important information on the threat of pathogens in the space environment, which assists with the development of diagnostic tools to monitor the atmosphere, water, and surfaces for the presence of these microbes. Understanding the molecular responses of these organisms to spaceflight is a necessary step that significantly contributes to the development of systems that meet requirements for supplying and storing potable water that is free of microbial contaminants. Furthermore, identification of the changes caused by spaceflight to genes and proteins prov ides novel targets for pharmacological intervention to prevent and control infectious disease, which ultimately facilitates safe and productive long -term exploration of the moon and Mars.

Color enhanced scanning electron micrograph showing Salmonella typhimurium (red) invading cultured human cells . Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAAD, NIH image. 218 RESULTS A human presence in space, whether permanent or temporary, is accompanied by the presence of microbes. However, the response of microorganisms to growth during a spaceflight mission is not completely understood. While several spaceflight studies have inves tigated changes in microbial characteristics when cultured during spaceflight, the Microbe experiment was the first to investigate changes in virulence and gene expression in several microbes that are pertinent to both crew members and the general public o n Earth. The organisms investigated were, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella Typhimurium , Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans . Within a few hours after return to Earth aboard STS -115, the S. Typhimurium grown in space was used to infect mice to deter mine the disease -causing potential (virulence) of the organism. Mice infected with bacteria cultured in space displayed a decreased time to death and increased percent mortality compared with those infected with ground controls (Wilson 2007). To better und erstand why the spaceflight- grown cultures were more virulent, an analysis of the gene expression was performed. The S. Typhimurium grown in space expressed a total of 167 genes differently compared to the identically grown cultures on Earth. Surprisingly, many genes that are commonly associated with increased virulence were not differentially regulated. Perhaps the most interesting finding was that a regulatory protein, Hfq, appeared to play a role in the alteration in gene expression in response to spacef light culture. This finding was the first to identify a potential mechanism by which a microorganism was being altered when grown in space. One additional finding detected alterations in microbial morphology grown during spaceflight. Greater cellular aggre gation and the formation of an extracellular matrix associated with bacterial biofilms were displayed. Because extracellular matrix formation can help to increase survival of bacteria under various conditions, this biofilm phenotype indicated a change in bacterial responses that are related to increased virulence. Also grown aboard STS- 115 were cultures of P. aeruginosa (Crabb\u00e9 2011). A comparison of spaceflight grown cultures to those grown identically on Earth indicated that 167 genes were differentially regulated, with many being different than those seen with S. Typhimurium . However, one key similarity was that when analysis of the data was performed, Hfq was again identified as a key regulator for many of the differentially regulated genes. This finding reinforced the role for Hfq in microbial response to spaceflight and also suggested that this response may be evolutionarily conserved between species. The differentially regulated gene expression data also indicated that many P. aeruginosa virulence characteristics may increase in response to spaceflight culture. The results for C. albicans are still being evaluated and prepared for publication. Candida albicans . Dennis Kunkel Microscopy Inc image. 219 Both during the preparation for spaceflight experiments and to fully understand the results after the experimen t, scientists used spaceflight analogues, like the rotating wall vessel (RWV) and the random position machine (RPM) to mimic spaceflight growth conditions in order to gain insight into the potential behavior P. aeruginosa in microgravity (Nickerson 2004). For Microbe, microarray analysis samples of P. aeruginosa grown in a RWV were compared to samples grown in normal gravity controls (Crabb\u00e9 2010). The results revealed an alteration in a regulatory role of the sigma factor AlgU, which consequently led to an increase in production of the extracellular substance alginate. This change in gene regulation and increased production of alginate resulted in an increase in heat and oxidative stress resistance. Perhaps most interesting was the involvement of Hfq in res ponse to culture in the RWV, consistent with Microbe spaceflight findings in S. Typhimurium and P. aeruginosa . The Microbe experiment had far reaching implications. It clarified the mechanisms behind the observations of microbial spaceflight experiments over the past 40 years and initiated studies to understand how these findings impact risk assessment to crew health. In addition, the knowledge gained from spaceflight research has been the focus of commercial and academic entities toward the discovery of novel therapeutic and vaccine approaches leading to the implementation of new strategies for translation of this research into health benefits for the general public (Sarker 2010).

E ARTH BENEFITS This experiment contributes to the establishment of a standard microbial sampling method that pharmaceutical and food industr ies can use. These industries require strict microbial control and could greatly benefit from such techniques. Microbe can also contribute to a better microbial quality control of freshwater , a fundamental part of daily life . S PACE BENEFITS Periodically monitoring microbial activity in the JEM module secures microbial hygiene and can be used in other closed habitat systems, such as the relatively constant environment of space ships. R ESULT S FUNGAL POPULATIONS (MAKIMURA ) Samples were collected from 3 sites in Kibo (air diffuser, handrail, and surfaces) for analysis of fungal biota approximately 1 year after th e module had docked to the ISS. Samples taken from Kibo before launch and from our laboratory were used as controls. In the case of Kibo, both microbe detection sheet (MDS) and swab culture tests of orbital samples were negative. The MDS were also examined by field emission -scanning electron microscopy; no microbial structures were detected. However, fungal DNAs were detected by real -time PCR and the clone library method; Alternaria and Malassezia spp. were the dominant species before launch and in space, respectively. The dominant species found in specimens from the air conditioner diffuser, lab bench, door push panel, and facility surfaces on the laboratory (ground controls) were Inonotus , Cladosporium , fungi in Kibo were probably derived from contamination due to humans, while those in the laboratory came from the environment (eg, the soil). In conclusion, the cleanliness of Kibo was equivalent to that in a clean room environment on the ground. ISS033E012541 - Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, Expedition 33 flight engineer, perform s microbial white t ube sampling in the JEM Pressurized Module with wet wipes and sampling sheets for the JA XA MICB (Microbe- III) experiment. JAXA image. 222 BACTERIAL POPULATIONS (NASU) Microbiological monitoring is important to assure microbiological safety especially in long - duration space habitation. Researchers have continuously monitored the abundance and diversity of bacteria in the ISS- Kibo to accumulate knowledge on microbes in t he ISS. In this study, we used a new sampling device, the microbe -collecting adhesive sheet developed in our laboratory. This adhesive sheet has high operability, needs no water for sampling, and is easy to transport and store. We first validated the adhes ive sheet as a sampling device used in space habitat, with regard to stability of bacterial number on the sheet during prolonged storage of up to 12 months. Bacterial abundance on the surfaces in the Kibo was then determined, and it was lower than that on the surfaces in our laboratory (10 5 cells [cm2]-1), except for the return air grill, and bacteria detected in the Kibo were a part of the human skin microflora. From these studies of microbial abundance and their phylogenetic affiliation, scientists concluded that the Kibo has been microbiologically well maintained; however, microbial abundance may increase with prolonged stay of crew members. To ensure crew safety and understand bacterial dynamics in space habitation environments, continuous bacteria l monitoring in the Kibo is required.

The exposure to radiation, vacuum, electricity, and magnetic waves has been investigated in the past, but still little information is available about the effects of the space environment on microorganisms. The Microbial life in Space: Response to environmental factors in a space vehicle (Microspace) research studies the response of representative nonpathogenic microorganisms to the environment inside the space vehicle and at different mission stages. R ESULTS The response of microorganisms was investigated in terms of survival rates, cell structure modifications, and genomic damages. The survival of cells was affected by both radiation doses and intrinsic cell features. As expected, only samples kept on the International Space Station (ISS) for 226 days showed significant levels of mortality. As far as the effect on cell structures, these samples also showed remarkable morphological changes, particularly for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, and Saccharomy ces cerevisiae. The data collected allowed for new insights into the biological traits of microorganisms exposed to space environment during spaceflight. Moreover, the result obtained may be important for the improvement of human conditions aboard space vehicles (nutraceuticals for astronauts and disinfections of ISS modules) and also for the potential development of closed systems devoted to vegetable productions and organic recycling.

Roberts, PhD, Dynamac Corporation, Cape Canaveral, Florida RESEARCH OBJECTIVES This experiment evaluates how exposure to space leads to genetic changes and variation using model microbe cultures. E ARTH BENEFITS The research objective is to develop and test passive observatories for experimental microbial systems (POEMS) for the long -term, multi- generation monitoring of microbial community development in isolated biological systems such as humans on long -term space missions. However, the results of this study may be applicable to other isolated biological systems found on Earth, including those that incorporate humans, such as cruise ships and submarines. Results may also provide insight into the mechanisms of DNA repair and acquisition of exogenous genetic i nformation in microorganisms, which is important to understanding the spread of such genetic -based traits as antibiotic resistance. S PACE BENEFITS Extension of human habitation into space results in humans carrying with them the microorganisms with which they coexist on Earth. This proposal seeks to develop simple, ground -based experimental systems with low manpower, mass, volume, and energy requirements that enable exploration of the ecology and evolution of microbiological communities in the space enviro nment. Given the potential for rapid change in populations of microorganisms under space conditions, it is essential to the NASA mission to understand both the mechanisms and consequences of microbial evolution in space. Just as on Earth, the survival of h umans on long -term missions is inextricably linked to their microbial companions. Passive experimental microbial systems (POEMS) are an enabling technology to address fundamental questions in the ecology and evolution of microbes in the insulated ecosystem of the space environment.

Bacterial cells and genetic transformants were recovered in all returned canisters. Fixed gases and volatile organic compound analyses of canister headspace are und erway. The investigation team continues to isolate and characterize rifampicin - resistant bacteria and to enumerate auxotroph mutants (lysine methionine tryptophan) that were recovered from sortie mission canisters (5 canisters) and 3 canisters from the I nternational Space Station (ISS) mission returned on STS -115. Viable cell and spore counts are completed; total direct counts and genetic characterization of transformants is ongoing. Transformation efficiency was lower than expected in both flight and gro und experiments, but rates were sufficient to yield >102 rpo B transformants. Data analysis continues for 6 months after recovery of all POEMS canisters from ISS. Trends in early analyses suggest that microbe population densities and transformation rates may be slightly elevated in flight samples compared to ground controls, but the preliminary conclusion is that the effects of the space environment on the rate of horizontal gene transfer are not statistically significant for Bacillus subtilis .

Niesel, PhD, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Tex as RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Streptococcus pneumoniae Expression of Gene in Space (SPEGIS) examines the behavior and growth of bacteria in microgravity and investigates the effects of the space environment on the gene expression, protein production, and virulence of the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae . The data collected also provides insight on what types of bacterial infections may occur during long -duration space missions and the risks to crew members. E ARTH BENEFITS Analyzing and understanding the mechanisms utilized by S. pneumoniae to adapt to microgravity can lead to the development of novel methods to combat newly emerging drug -resistant strains, which could greatly assist in disease prevention and management on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS Identification of the global genetic responses undergone by S. pneumoniae in reaction to space enabl es this single -flight experiment to determine if the spacecraft environment exerts a selective pressure on microbial contaminants, leading to increased virulence and contributing to increased health risks to the crew.

The final goal is to obtain i nformation on the importance of gravity on the formation of organized cell structures (flocculation, biofilm, invasion) and the entire \"Flo processes\" itself. R ESULTS The colony growth rate of the agar invasive S. cerevisiae 1278b strain was reduced as well as its agar invasiveness. Postflight growth experiments of a brewer's top yeast strain showed an increase in G2/M and a decrease in Sub -G1 cell population; an increased viability, a decreased lipid peroxidation level, increased glycogen content, and changes in carbohydrate metabolic enzyme activities were also observed. Using the S. cerevisiae BY4741 deletion collection, genes that provide a survival advantage in space, were identified in a batch growth experiment; no difference i n growth rate was observed. Freeze -dried strains showed significant changes in the cell wall thickness. Spaceflight unique gene expression changes were observed in stress response element (STRE) genes with transcription regulation involving Sfp1 (which is involved in the TOR pathway) and Msn4. Some of the components of the ribosome biogenesis (which is under the control of Sfp1) as well as components of the proteasome were down regulated in microgravity. Recent results indicate that microgravity ISS020E044456 - Astronaut Frank De Winne, Expedition 20 flight engineer, works with the Yeast -B Part 2 experiment container in the Biolab incubator located in the Columbus module. 230 imposes a \" microgravity\" stress on the cells, which has the characteristics of an osmotic stress. Cellular energy is directed towards protective measures such as cell wall biosynthesis (cell wall integrity pathway activation) and the production of compounds (glycerol , trehalose) that increase the osmotolerancy (HOG pathway). This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. 231 YEAST-GROUP ACTIVATION PACKS (YEAST-GAP) Research Area: Microbiology Expedition(s): 8 and 13 Principal Investigator(s): Cheryl A. Nickerson, PhD, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Yeast -Group Activation Packs (Yeast -GAP) studies the effects of genetic changes of yeast cells exposed to the space environment. The results help scientists understand how cells that respond to radiation and microgravity impact the determination of health remedies and increase the basic understanding of cell biology. E ARTH BENEFITS Any insight into the genetic controls of a single -celled organ ism like yeast or certain bacteria can yield tremendous benefits on Earth, including increased antibiotic production as well as further insight into general cell biology. Research, such as Yeast -GAP, can lead to further developments in cancer research. S PACE BENEFITS Understanding how microbes reproduce and mutate in space may lead to the development of additional countermeasures to protect crew members on future long -duration missions. R ESULTS Yeast -GAP was sent to space in October 2002 and September 2006 to determine the effects microgravity has on S. cerevisiae . More specifically, this experiment was conducted to determine which genes impart a survival advantage and which a disadvantage under the unique environmental conditions associated with microgravity. To accomplish this, a gene deletion series of yeast strains were combined and grown in the same media and id entical growth conditions both in flight and on the ground. S115E07274 - Astronaut Heidemarie M. Stefanyshyn-Piper, STS-115 mission specialist, works with the Yeast -Group Activation Packs (Yeast -GAP) on the middeck of Space Shuttle Atlantis . Yeast - GAP experiment studies the effects of genetic changes of yeast cells exposed to the space environment. The results help scientists to understand how cells respond to radiation and microgravity. 232 It wa s found that indeed select key genes are necessary for robust growth during spaceflight (deletion leads to poor growth) while others appear to inhibit growth in microgravity (deletion leads to enhanced growth). Spaceflight cultures exhibited survival advan tages in strains with deletions in their catalytic active genes. In comparison to ground controls, flight cultures held were disadvantaged with deletions dealing with strains lacking transporter, antioxidant , and catalytic activity. Yeast -GAP further identified specific genes critical for survival in space (Johanson 2007). Yeast -GAP was able to identify Stress Response Element (STRE) genes associated with microgravity. STRE genes are activated in response to specific stresses, including osmotic stress, heat shock, and environmental stresses such as microgravity. This experiment investigated the gene expression changes of the STRE genes SSA4, YIL052C, and YST2, with transcription regulation involving Sfp1 and Msn4. Results show that spaceflight significantly decreased expression of most genes, with only one left unaffected. Next, transcriptional regulation of YIL052C and SSA4 were explored. Genes were stripped of one of their transcriptional factors and evaluated to determine each gene's dependence on the cor responding factor. Both genes lacking Msn4 decreased expression while genes lacking Sfp1 did not experience any change. This suggests that the cellular effects of the space environment are at least in part mediated by the transcription factor Sfp1. This is significant because it demonstrates the importance of true microgravity experimentation (in contrast to ground simulations of microgravity), which can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind cellular responses to this unique environment (C oleman 2008). Finally, phenotypic variations were observed as assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Yeast cells grown under ground -based conditions revealed a normal budding pattern with buds developing adjacent to previous bud scars. Yeast cell s exposed to microgravity exhibited random and more numerous budding patterns (Johanson 2007). Scanning electrograph image of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells grown on Earth. Scanning electrograph image of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells grown on the International Space Station. 233 These early investigations were designed to be launched on an unmanned spacecraft (Progress) well in advance of processing aboard the International Space Statio n and remain stable for months before return to Earth and analysis. The results obtained demonstrate the robustness of studies utilizing S. cerevisiae as a model for eukaryotic cell studies. These studies demonstrate that the yeast gene deletion series is a powerful tool to assess the effects of microgravity and other environmental factors on cellular level responses, which is likely to be relevant to more complex organisms including humans.

The final goal is to obtain information on the importance of microgravity on the formation of organized cell structures (flocculation, biofilm, invasion) and the entire \"Flo processes\" itself. R ESULTS Yeast cells were grown on Yeast extract Peptone Dextrose (YPD) agar plates during 300 hour at an average temperature of 19.28\u00b0C. Colony morphology was assessed by photographing the plates at 2 time points in orbit, after 97.5rh and 216.3hr. For the ground reference experiments, photographs were taken every day. Both the CMBSESA1 and 1278b yeast colonies covered a larger surface on 0.8% agar than on 2% agar throughout the experiment, which is in ac cordance with previous studies. Two -dimensional spreading of the yeast colonies grown on semi -solid agar medium was reduced under microgravity in the 1278b laboratory strain but not in the CMBSESA1 industrial strain. This was supported by the 1278b prote ome map under microgravity conditions, which revealed up -regulation of proteins linked to anaerobic conditions. The 1278b strain showed a reduced invasive growth in the center of the yeast colony. Bud scar distribution was slightly affected with a switch toward more random budding. Together, microgravity conditions disturb spatially programmed budding patterns and generate strain -dependent growth differences in yeast colonies on semi -solid medium. Proteomics analysis showed that the 1278b WT showed a more anaerobic fermentative growth in microgravity compared to the ground samples, since many enzymes involved in the Krebs cycle were less abundant in microgravity, which indicates a higher request for energy in microgravity. 235 PUBLICATION (S) Van Mulders SE , Stassen C, Daenen L, et al.

Morrison, PhD, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES A single -step process forming a tiny liquid -filled, biodegradable, micro -balloons containing various drug solutions (a process called microgravity micro -encapsulation) has been shown to provide better drug delivery and new medical treatments for solid tumors and resistant infections. Recent testing in mouse models has shown that these unique microcapsules can be injected into human prostate tumors to inhibit tumor growth or can be injected following cryo -surgery (freezing) to improve the destruction of the tumors much better than freezing or l ocal chemotherapy alone. The microcapsules also contain a co ntrast agent that enables C -T, X-ray or ultrasound imaging to monitor the distribution within the tissues to insure that the entire tumor is treated when the microcapsules release their drug conte nts. E ARTH BENEFITS The utilization of microcapsules can benefit the treatment of several diseases here on Earth. Microcapsules can be inhaled to deliver antibiotic and immune stimulant drugs to treat inhaled bacterial infections of the lungs. These unique microcapsules can be injected directly into solid tumors to provide local, sustained release, of anti- cancer drugs. The microcapsules c an be imaged with C -T scans or ultrasound to insure that the release combinations of medications slowly over 12 -14 days, which can be delivered directly to the target tumors. Since the drug release is local, using these mirocapsules reduces the unwanted si de effects of systemic (intravenous) chemotherapy, which involves large amount of drugs producing major side effects throughout the entire body. S PACE BENEFIT MEPS expands our understanding of the use of microgravity to enable development of new drug deli very devices. These new discoveries can help protect crew members on long -duration space missions and provide alternative delivery routes and countermeasures to injured or sick crew members. Micro -balloons containing anti-tumor drugs and small amounts of radio- contrast oil were created during Microencapsulation Electrostatic Processing Systems operations on STS - 95. The radio- contrast oil is traceable by radiograph and allows doctors to follow the microcapsules as they travel to the tumor. The permeable outer skin releases the drug slowly, giving the microcapsule plenty of time to reach its dest ination. This slow release prevents artery damage as the drug travels to its destination. NASA 's Johnson Space Center image . 237 RESULTS The MEPS experiment on the International Space Station consisted of 8 samples processed using va rious methods to mix dissimilar liquids to form micro - balloons/microcapsules. The recovered micro - balloons were analyzed for size and drug content. Additionally, studies included the effects of temperature and mixing fluid shear on the size of the micro -balloons and payload concentration of contrast and concentrated drug . ON UF -2 several combinations of anti -cancer drugs, photodynamic therapy drugs, and a DNA construct were successfully encapsulated. These results led to the invention and NASA Patent for a Pulse Flow Microencapsulation Processing System that has been used to make these microcapsules for ground -based studies on human tumors grown in a mouse model. Pre -clinical investigations revealed that when only a few doses of microcapsules containing 5 -Fluorouracil are injected directly into human prostate tumors, the growth can be inhibited by up to 51% within 3 weeks. When chemotherapy microcapsules are injected following cryo -surgery, the combined treatment can greatly inhibit the growth of 1 -2cm size prostate tumors by 72% in just 3 weeks (Morrison 2009). Other studies using 2 doses of 5- FU microcapsules injected into A549 human lung tumors inhibited growth by 45% and destroyed 18% of the lung tumors after 4 weeks of sustained release. In a parallel st udy, only 2 doses injected of microcapsules containing Paclitaxel, injected on Day 0 and Day 7 produced macroscopic necrosis in 43% of the tumors. After 26 days of sustained Paclitaxel release, lung tumor growth was inhibited by 82% and 28% of the tumors h ad completely disappeared (Morrison 2013, in press). A further study was carried out aiming to confirm the increased growth inhibition of human prostate tumors produced by an intentionally palliative combination treatment of cryochemotherapy (partial cryoablation followed by intratumor partial chemotherapy with injection of microencapsulated 5 -fluorouracil at the ice ball periphery). The results of this study extend and confirm previous findings (Le Pivert 2009). The addition of 5- fluorouracil focal chemoab lation to partial cryoablation of a fast growing hormone resistant prostate cancer enhances the directional destructive effect of cryosurgery and inhibits growth in peripheral unfrozen tumor tissues (Le Pivert 2004). The images shows some microcapsules produced on the International Space Station in Microencapsulation Electrostatic Processing Systems during the UF -2 mission (July 18 -19,2002).

The ability to produce high energy, low -mass food sources during spaceflight enables the maintenance of crew health during long -duration missions while having a reduced impact on resources necessary for long -distance travel. Additional applications of a plant growth chamber include using plants as components of regenerative life support systems for travel to the moon and Mars. E ARTH BENEFITS ADVASC contributes to National Security, cancer -fighting pharmaceuticals and educational tools for students. Bio-KES, a device that uses ultraviolet light to convert ethylene into carbon dioxide and water, to remove the ethylene from plant growth chamber, can be used to kill pathogens like anthrax. The light, used to simulate photosynthesis in the growth chambers, heals wounds and increases the effectiveness of cancer -fighting drugs in vitro . The Orbital Laboratory is an Internet -based multimedia tool that allowed students and educators to conduct their own ground- based plant experiments and to analyze data returned from the ADVASC units in their classrooms on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS ADVASC explores the benefits of using microgravity to create customized crops that withstand disease and inhospitable conditions, resist pestilence, and need less space to grow. These qualities benefit space explorers and earth inhabitants. Plant growth and development in microgravity can provide a natu ral air and water filtration system and large -scale plant growth systems. Furthermore, ADVASC is a precursor for growing plants during extended space expeditions to the moon and Mars.

The ADVASC experiment is located in Expedite the Processing of Experiments to the Space Station rack 4 in the Destiny U.S. Labor atory during Expedition 4. 240 RESULTS Arabid opsis thaliana was successfully grown from seed to seed on the International Space Station (ISS). During a 2 -month growth period, the plants progressed from seed hydration to germination, vegetative, and reproductive stages, producing mature seeds. Ninety percent of the seeds germinated in space, although only 70 percent of the plants grew to maturity. Some of the seeds that were harvested from the plants grown in microgravity were planted in a ground study. These seeds produced typical plants without any v isible abnormalities (Link 2003). During a second ADVASC run, second -generation seeds were produced and tissues were harvested and preserved for RNA and complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) analysis. Detailed results of the germination and harvesting of space -grown seeds in the ADVASC growth chamber in the U.S. Destiny Laboratory have not been released. In the third ADVASC run, which took place over approximately 95 days on ISS, soybeans were grown from seed to seed for the first time in space. Biomas s production in the space seeds was approximately 4 % larger than ground controls. Flight and ground controls produced nearly identical numbers of seeds, but the space seeds were larger on average. Scientists found that the seeds produced in space were heal thy, the germination rates were comparable to those on Earth, and no major morphological differences were evident. Phytochemical analysis of commercially important components such as oils, amino acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and phytoestrogens have not y et been released.

Parts of a tree that are not vertical typically grow one kind of wood on one side and another kind on the other. This is known as \"reaction wood,\" and the mix of different kinds of this wood in trees influences their suitability f or different uses, such as construction or paper. Scientists believe reaction wood is a response to gravity, but they haven't been able to prove it. APEX - Cambium determines if reaction wood forms to the same extent, and in the same position as in trees gro wn on Earth. E ARTH BENEFITS Understanding the fundamental processes by which plants produce cellulose and lignin in their tissues is of great interest in the realm of forestry and industry. Trees used for paper production are selected for maximum cellulose production and minimal lignin production. Conversely, trees used to make structural lumber are selected for maximum lignin content. However, due to the complex relationship of these 2 biosynthesis processes, researchers do not yet know how to gen etically alter such plants to further boost their productivity. Gravity is suspected to strongly affect the formation of reaction wood, and this experiment determines if this is true. S PACE BENEFITS APEX- Cambium along with the Advanced Biological Research System hardware demonstrates the capabilities of providing the correct environment for plant growth aboard spacecraft. For future long -duration exploration, crews will need to be able to grow plants for a variety of applications. R ESULTS Data ana lysis for this investigation is ongoing; no results have been published to date. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication.

E ARTH BENEFITS Gravitational pull influences the quality of wood that is produced by the tree. Depending on their composition, some types of wood are not appropriate for specific industrial applications. By growing trees in weightlessness, the investigator identifies candidate genes involved in the production o f these different types of wood. These candidate genes are used to select trees that produce the wood of interest for different industrial applications. These trees are used in breeding and reforestation programs in Canada, with the aim of improving indust rial competitiveness and forest sustainability. S PACE BENEFITS The experiment defines the best growth conditions for trees using the Advanced Biological Research System habitat and opens the way to more basic plant research in the space environment, as well as better biological life support systems to sustain human presence in space. R ESULTS At the end of the experiment, the leading shoot from 3 plantlets from each line tested was collected and fixed in a RNA stabilization solution. The expression lev els for 27 candidate genes and 3 reference genes were determined by quantitative real -time polymerase chain reaction (qRT -PCR) on the 9 seedlings grown at 0 g and 1 g. While close to 20 genes displayed some up- regulation in microgravity conditions, only 3 genes showed statistically significant up -regulation at 0 g. The function of these 3 genes was linked to crucial processes such as cell propagation, development, and response to stress, and their up- regulation is very likely to influence seedling growth pa tterns in microgravity. Further analysis of plant tissues clearly demonstrated an increase in leaf growth as compared to ground- based plants, with needles less inclined towards ISS023E036876 - NASA astronaut T.J.

This comprehensive research should reveal the crucial factors controlling the gravity signal transduction cascade in arabidopsis thaliana, or thale cress, a plant that is genetically related to soybeans, cotton, vegetables, and oil seed crops R ESULTS Data analysis of AT -Space samples revealed numerous genes affected by microgravity. Gene network analysis revealed a hormonal cross -talk between auxin, abscisic acid (ABA) and ethyle ne signaling pathways in meadiating microgravity triggered stress responses, such as osmotic stress and water deprivation and lipid metabolic changes in particular.

Morrow, PhD, Orbital Technologies Corporation, Madison, Wis consin RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Biomass Production System (BPS) environmental control subsystems provide a complete growing environment for plants in microgravity. Results can lead to the development of regenerative life support systems on future exploration missions to the moon or Mars. E ARTH BENEFITS As less fertile land becomes available to grow food, alternative agricultural systems that efficiently produce greater quantities of high- quality crops are increasingly important. Data from the operation of the BPS can advance greenhouse and controlled- environment agricultural systems and help farmers produce better, he althier crops in a small space using the optimum amount of nutrients. S PACE BENEFITS The amount of food necessary to sustain a crew during a long -duration mission to Mars would prohibitively increase the mass of spacecraft and the overall cost of the mis sion. Some of the crew's food would need to come from a selection of renewable crops grown in biomass production systems. The biomass production systems may also be used as a filtration system for water and atmospheric gases. Plant growth chambers would also offer a comforting, green reminder of Earth to a crew a long way from home. R ESULTS Thirty -two germinating Brassica rapa plants were launched inside the BPS for the TVT of the hardware. The Brassica rapa plants were grown over 2 growth cycles on International Space Station (ISS). Brassica rapa tissue from BPS was analyzed for general morphology, seed anatomy and storage res erves, foliar carbohydrates, and chlorophyll and root zone hypoxia analysis. Some of the wheat plantings were evaluated for growth, germination, weight, chlorophyll concentration and root ISS004E11721 - View of Brassica pl ants from plant growth chamber 2 being harvested as part of the technical validation test of the Biomass Production System conducted during International Space Station Expedition 4. Video screen shot of Brassica rapa, 36 days after planting on International Space Station during Increment 4. NASA image. 247 appearance (Morrow 2004). By the end of the 73 -day experiment, BPS T VT produced a total of 8 harvests, 7 primings, and a plant tissue archive of more than 300 plants. Gross measure of growth, leaf chlorophyll, starch, and soluble carbohydrates confirmed comparable performance by the plants on the station with ground contr ols. Of particular interest were the differences between the immature seedlings. Immature seeds from station had higher concentrations of chlorophyll, starch, and soluble carbohydrates than the ground controls. Seed protein was significantly lower in the I SS material. Also, microscopy of immature seeds fixed on ISS showed embryos to be at a range of developmental stages, while ground control embryos had all reached the same stage of development. These differences could be attributable to differences in wate r delivery or reduced gas exchange due to lack of convection. These results suggest that the microgravity environment may affect flavor and nutritional quality on potential space produce (Musgrave 2005). An ancillary study tested for bacterial and fungal communities in the BPS chambers and root modules, and these cultures were compared to ground control bacterial and fungal growth. Analysis indicated more species of both bacteria and fungus were identified in the flight samples than the ground samples. The populations were common airborne species found on Earth. The significance of the difference is uncertain (Frazier 2003). P UBLICATION (S) Allen J, Bisbee PA, Darnell RL, et al.

Kiss, PhD, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio Anna -Lisa Paul, PhD, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida Elison Blancaflor, PhD, Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation Incorporated, Ardmore, Oklahoma RESEARCH OBJECTIVES BRIC -16-CYTOSKELETON (KISS) Biological Research i n Canisters - 16: Investigations of the plant cytoskeleton in microgravity with gene profiling and cytochemistry (BRIC -16- Cytoskeleton) studies the effects of microgravity on the structure and organization of the actin cytoskeleton in plants using the model plant Arabidopsis. The specific aims of this research are: to investigate plastid position in statocytes (the gravity - perceiving cells) in microgravity; to determine the effect of microgravity on the actin cytoskeletal organization in gravity -perceiving cells and to study the microgravity effects on actin cytoskeleton- related gene expression in plant cells. BRIC -16-DNA (PAUL) Biological Research i n Canisters - 16: The impact of spaceflight on Arabidopsis: Deep sequencing and Arrays as of the Transcriptome Arabidopsis Seedlings and Undifferentiated Cells in Space (BRIC -16-DNA) compares and contrasts the gene expression responses within 2 forms of Arabidopsis: whole, etiolated seedlings and undifferentiated cells in culture.

The fundamental knowledge gained through these investigations can aid in the understanding of basic plant processes that can eventually increase our ability to better control plant use on Earth in agriculture (and ot her) applications. S PACE BENEFITS The fundamental knowledge gained by growing plants under microgravity conditions can contribute to resolving the following risks: providing and maintaining biodegenerative life support systems maintaining food quantity and quality maintaining acceptable atmosphere managing waste providing and recov ering potable water RESULTS BRIC -16-CYTOSKELETON The BRIC -16-Cytoskeleton experiment was carried into space on April 5, 2010, and returned April 20, 2010, aboard orbiter Discovery on space shuttle mission STS- 131 as part of the BRIC -16 suite of investigations. A total of 13 Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) samples were studied in flight and on ground. These samples were allotted approximately 309 hours in total darkness to grow in microgravity and then fixated for later observation. The primary focus of this experiment is to focus on the changes in composition of the seedlings in microgravity. Seedling morphology did not develop with any major discrepancies. With controlled temperatu res, averaging within 22 -25\u00b0C, seedling germination between the ground and flight controls remained comparable with 90.9% for the ground controls and 89.0% for the flight controls. When comparing ground and flight experiments, both exhibited an etiolated a ppearance, elongated hypocotyls, which is typical for plants grown in darkness. The BRIC -16-Cytoskeleton experiment found 2 major differences of note between ground and in flight samples. The first difference arose in the morphology found in the roots sys tems of the Image of Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) - 16 middeck payload hardware and final packing of locker MR28K. BRIC Canister A -D, only A is fully assembled. NASA image. 251 seedlings. Extreme skewing was observed at the root apex and proximal root. The roots skewed only slightly on the ground controls in comparison to flight controls. This leads to the conclusion that plants have endogenous growth patterns that ar e largely masked in normal 1 g conditions found on Earth. Another major difference was noted between the amount of adventitious roots (roots formed from shoot tissues) found on the flight and ground samples. This adds to the idea that microgravity produces an increase in mitosis in the pericycle, thus producing a larger number of adventitious roots. It is also believed that with previous and present experiments that microgravity may induce alterations in essential cell functions that may be related to cell cycle regulation (Millar 2011). BRIC -16-DNA Previous studies determined that plants exhibit adaptive behaviors in response to spaceflight. One specific study looked to determine if cell cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana were able to perceive and respond t o spaceflight. This study determined that only under constant clinorotation (rotation about an axis) were these cells able to induce heat shock proteins. This led to the conclusion that even nondifferentiated cells are able to sense and react to gravity (Z upanska 2012). BRIC -16-DNA addressed these issues by producing replicable results in order to answer fundamental questions using current gene profiling technologies. Seedlings and cell cultures both respond to microgravity by altering specific gene expressions in entirely different responses. A possible explanation for the differences between cultured cells and seedlings is due to the fact that seedlings use their organs to sense and sample their environment, and that undifferentiated cell cultures, lacking such organs propagate inappropriate stress responses. Another possibility is that all the cells in the culture were responding unanimously, while distinct tissue -types in the seedlings responded differently (Paul 2012).

Stutte, PhD, Dynamac Corporation, Cape Canaveral, Florida RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Biological Research in Canisters Symbiotic Nodulation in a Reduced Gravity Environment (BRIC - SyNRGE) investigates microgravity effects associa ted with microbe -host interactions and cell -cell communication using a plant -bacteria model system. Medicago truncatula (barrel medic) seedlings are grown in orbit in the presence of genetically marked strains of nitrogen -fixing bacteria of the species Sinorhizobium meliloti. These bacteria are able to form a mutualistic symbiosis (relationship between different species in which both benefit) with leguminous plants. On Earth, this symbiotic plant - bacteria relationship benefits both crops for humans and live stock. E ARTH BENEFITS Plant -bacteria symbiosis accounts for a large percentage of human and livestock food production on Earth, particularly in nitrogen -depleted soil. BRIC -SyNRGE adds to the knowledge base of this plant- bacteria mechanism. S PACE BENEFITS BRIC -SyNRGE directly addresses the impact of the space environment on microbial virulence in a constructed ecosys tem. The establishment of a controlled environment, legume -rhizobium ecosystem, to utilize biological fixation to recycle nitrogen and reduce food resupply benefits long - duration transit and planetary surface habitation missions. Preliminary work has indic ated that establishment of the legume -rhizobium ecosystem enables Martian regolith (loose material covering rock) stimulants to support plant growth. The M. truncatula- S. meliloti system is a well - defined biological model system for studying plant/microbe interactions and the biological and genomic tools are available to determine whether the virulence of S. meliloti is increased in the space environment. BRIC -SyNRGE is designed to directly test the hypothesis Medicago truncatula (barrel medic) leaf sample; brown markings show beneficial due to bacterial inoculation. NASA image . Medicago truncatula (barrel medic) seedlings grown inside a Biological Research In Canisters Petri Dish Fixation Unit. NASA image . 254 that the virulence of S. meliloti is increased in microgravity. BRIC -SyNRGE is designed to use molecular, biochemical, and microscopic tools to determine whether a change in virulence is due to reduced resistance of the host, increased virulence of the microorganism, or changes in the signal transducti on pathway. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. 255 REVERSE GENETIC APPROACH TO EXPLORING GENES RESPONSIBLE FOR CELL WALL DYNAMICS IN SUPPORTING TISSUES OF ARABIDOPSIS UNDER MICROGRAVITY CONDITIONS (CELL WALL) Research Area: Plant Biology Expedition(s): 16 and 17 Principle Investigator(s): Kazuhiko Nishitani, DSc , Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Reverse Genetic Approach to Exploring Genes Responsible for Cell Wall dynamics in Supporting Tissues of Arabidopsis Under Microgravity Conditions ( Cell Wall) investigation explore s the molecular mechanism by which the cell wall (rigid outermost layer) construction in Arabidopsis thaliana (a small plant of the mustard family) is regulate d by gravity. The results of this investigation support future plans to cultivate plants on long -duration exploration missions. E ARTH BENEFITS Data gathered from the Cell Wall study aims to further the understanding of how plant growth and development at a molecular level can lead to significant advancements in agricultural production on Earth S PACE BENEFITS The Cell Wall experiment aims to explore the molecular mechanism by which the cell- wall construction of supporting tissues in land plants is regulat ed via a gravitational signal, which can benefit space explorers.

E ARTH BENEFITS The cell wall is an essential organelle in maintaining the plant life cycle. The data obtained from this investigation may greatly improve the understanding of how gravitational stimuli affect the formation of cell wall architecture in higher plants. Furthermore, the basic mechanism behind the formation of cell wall phenolic components are clarified in this investigation and may contribute to the development of an efficient method for breeding gramineous (cereal) plants. S PACE BENEFITS The information obtained from this investigation could be applied to develop efficient plant production systems in an altered gravity environment. The data may also contribute to improve the experimental procedures for cultivating plants in orbit. R ESULTS The sterilized rice seeds were planted on an agar medium, placed in a black polycarbonate culture dish, and stored in a refrigerator to prevent germination before and during the flight until the start of growth experiment in the Kibo module of the International Space Station (ISS). In o rbit, seeds were transferred to the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) and allowed to germinate and grow under 1 G and micro gravity conditions in the dark. After incubation, seedlings were frozen and returned to Earth. The CBEF has 2 incubator compartm ents, a microgravity compartment and an artificial gravity compartment with a centrifuge. The facility allowed for plant samples to be grown under microgravity and artificial 1 G conditions simultaneously in orbit. ISS023E056378 - NASA astronaut, Tracy C. Dyson, is working on the Regulation by Gravity of Ferulate Formation in Cell Walls of Rice Seedlings experiment. 258 The germination rate was more than 90% in both in -orbit 1 G and microgravity conditions. The length of 1 G-grown rice shoots substantially increased from day 4 to day 5. Microgravity did not affect the shoot growth. Analysis of the mechanical properties in the cell walls showed that shoot cell wa lls obtained from seedlings grown under microgravity conditions for 5 days were loosened as compared with those under 1 G conditions. On day 5, the levels of cell wall- bound mono -phenolic acids, such as ferulic acid (FA), in micro gravity grown shoots were almost comparable to those in 1 G-grown shoots, while the levels of diferulic acid (DFA) were lower in microgravity grown shoots. Furthermore, cell wall peroxidases activity measurements showed that the activity obtained from micro G-grown shoots was lower than that from 1 G-grown shoots. These results suggest that microgravity conditions reduce the activity of cell wall peroxidases in rice shoots, resulting in the suppression of DFA formation , which in turn, may cause the reduction of mechanical strength in shoot cell walls.

Twelve -day-old seedlings are grown either in space, in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) under microgravity, on a 1-g reference centrifuge, or on the ground. Proteins associated with membranes were selectively extracted from microsomes and identified and quantified through Liquid Chromatograph y-tandem Mass spectrometry (LC -MS-MS) using a label -free method, ie, a method in mass spectrometry that aims to determine the relative amount of proteins in biological samples. RESULTS Among the 1484 proteins identified and quantified in the 3 conditions mentioned above, 80 membrane -associated proteins were significantly more abundant in seedlings grown under microgravity in space than under 1 g and 69 were less abundant. Clustering of t hese proteins according to their predicted function indicated that proteins associated with auxin metabolism and trafficking were depleted in the microsomal fraction in microgravity space conditions, whereas proteins associated with stress responses, defen se, and metabolism were more abundant in microgravity than under 1 g indicating that microgravity is perceived by plants as a stressful environment. These results clearly indicate that a global membrane proteomics approach can give a snapshot of the cell s tatus and its signaling activity at a given time in response to microgravity and highlight the major processes affected.

The results obtained from the GraPhoBox experiment can give new insights to the interactions between the mechanisms underlying the formation of the b asic architecture of the plant, and can also give rise to new ideas in how plants respond to their environment. RESULTS The angle of directional growth of roots and shoots was assessed. Light is\u2014 even in the absence of gravity \u2014the most important environmental cue for directional growth of shoots, while for roots, gravity is by far the most important cue, and light is only a very minor factor due to their poor phototropic capacity. Compared to roots, shoots were deviated more than roots in microgravity and therefore less gravity -dependent. All results together suggested that environmental cues were perceived differently by roots and shoots, which also adapt differently. Furthermore, environmental cues were probably transferred little or none to the opposite side of the plant. P UBLICATION (S) Buizer doi: 10.1007/BF02919490.

In the first part of the experiment, seedlings are grown in weightlessness following hydration for 15 hours and then centr ifuged for almost 14 hours. In the second part of the experiment, seedlings are grown for 21.5 hours in weightlessness followed by 9 hours of induced gravity by centrifuge. E ARTH BENEFITS These goals will provide insight into the fundamental organization and operation of the gravity response system of plants and determine if, other than the root cap, other parts of the plant require cues for directional growth. S PACE BENEFITS Although this is primarily a basic research study, understanding how plants resp ond to partial gravity environments may be useful for growing plants on the moon or Mars. RESULTS The imagery showed that the embryonic roots curved away from the cotyledons and then slowly straightened from 17 hours to 30 hours after hydration. Due to this straightening the root tip was oriented close to an optimal angle of curvature (120 -135\u00b0) during a 2 -hour period of centrifugation. One interesting point is that lentil roots grown in weightlessness were more sensitive to stimulation than lentil roots grown under 1 -g conditions. The gravity threshold perceived by these plants was determined to be between 0 and 0.002g. In addition by using a hyperbolic model, the gravity threshold was estimated to be 1.4 x 10 -5 g. Cultivation chambers from the Gravi -1 experiment in the U S laboratory, carries out research to determine the gravity perception threshold in lentil seedlings.

Seedlings are grown either in microgravity or 1 -g conditions, and the expression of some genes between the two samples is compared. R ESULTS No exploitable results were obtained due to lack of germination in all but one of the culture chambers .

This experiment aims to demonstrate that gravitropism interferes with hydrotropism. Second, it clarifies the differential auxin response that occurs during the respective tropisms by investigating the auxin -inducible gene expression. Lastly, it shows whether hydrotropism can be used in controlling root growth orientation in microgravity. E ARTH BENEFITS Water availability is a critical matter for plant growth and survival. For example, crop cultivation and yields are indeed restricted under drought conditions in an arid area. The results of Hydro Tropi provides additional knowledge to develop new technolo gy that enables plants to efficiently uptake water. S PACE BENEFITS Hydro Tropi demonstrates a plants ability to respond to moisture gradients. It also aims to provide basic information for creating new plants suitable for the hydrotropism -assisted plant growth unit or developing a hydrotropism -controlled growth unit itself for future space exploration. R ESULTS The on -board experiments were successfully carried out and researchers measured the growth and curvature of the seedling roots and analyzed CsIAA1 expression by in situ hybridization. The results showed that roots hydrotropically bent toward the moistened plastic foam under microgravity conditions, whereas they grew straight along the direction of gravitational force under 1 G conditions. The hydrotropic response in microgravity appeared to be greater in the NaCl chamber compared with that in H 2O chamber, but they did not differ statistically. Furthermore, CsIAA1 gene differentially expressed in the hydrotropically bending roots; the expression was much greater on the concave side than on the convex side. On the other hand, ISS025E0077880 - Astronaut, Shannon Walker, is working on the Hydro Tropi experiment in K ibo module. JAXA image. 266 no asymmetric expression of CsIAA1 in the roots grown under 1 G conditions were detected. These results revealed that roots become very sensitive to moisture gradients in microgravity and that auxin redistribution and differential auxin response take place during hydrotropic response. Also, the results imply that the hy drotropic response can be used as a means of root growth regulation for plant production in space.

Bingham, PhD, Utah State University, North Logan, Utah RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Validating Vegetable Production Unit (VPU) Plants, Protocols, Procedures and Requirements (P3R) Using Currently Existing Flight Resources (Lada -VPU -P3R) is a study to advance the technology required for plant growth in microgravity and to research related food safety issues. Lada -VPU -P3R also investigates the non-nutritional value to the flight crew of developing plants in orbit. The Lada- VPU -P3R uses the Lada hardware on the ISS and falls under a cooperative agreement between NASA and the Russian State Space Corporation (Roscosmos ). E ARTH BENEFITS As less fertile land is available to grow food, alternative agricultural systems that efficiently produce greater quantities of high- quality crops are increasingly important. Data from the operation of this investigation can advance greenhouse and controlled -environment agricultural systems and he lp farmers produce better, healthier crops in a small space using the optimum amount of water and nutrients. S PACE BENEFITS Plants not only provide food, but for many they provide comfort and relaxation, a diversion from the stress of required activities. For many people, plants provide significant non - nutritional benefits during long -duration spaceflight. These values are currently based only on anecdotal and untested observations that need verification. Part of the benefit may be a small fresh food sourc e, which makes food safety issues important. ISS013E84325 - View of Spaceflight Participant, Anousheh Ansari, posing for a photo with barley in a root tray from the Lada greenhouse, which is part of the Rasteniya experiment. 268 RESULTS Creation of an effective life support system (LSS) is one of the main obstacles faced by engineers in order to support long -duration spaceflight. Experiments with higher plants conducted on board MIR and the Russian segment of the ISS, showed plant organisms are capable of long -duration normal growth, full development and reproduction without deviations under real spaceflight environment. These results allowed researchers to assume that properly engine ered greenhouses are potential candidates for biological subsystem and may be included in the LSS for interplanetary spaceflight. Successful inclusion of greenhouse equipment in the spacecrafts required a number of actions to the existing LSS, redistributi on of material streams inside an LSS, and increased functional load. Furthermore, involvement of a greenhouse in a LSS of an interplanetary spacecraft required a number of technical tasks to be cleared, such as selection of plant species and larger scale h ardware development. To resolve the mentioned tasks, real spaceflight -based and ground- based experiments are being conducted in the frame of Russian Scientific Program (Sychev 2008). Previous experiments revealed that plants are capable of normal growth, development and proliferation if they are provided with everything essential for life. However, the absence of phenotypic (observable characteristics) and genotypic changes (DNA changes) in plants grown in microgravity for several generations does not mean plants do not experience some stresses during these conditions. The genomic expression patterns analyzed revealed over 500 genes changed more than two - fold. The results demonstrate an increase in the transcription of eliminating genes and circumstantially indicate the presence of oxidative stress -causing factors aboard the International Space Station. These factors are yet to be identified and their elimination could improve productivity (Shagimardanova 2010). ISS005E20305 - View of Cosmonaut Valery G.

Sychev, PhD, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Study of Mass -Exchange Properties of Capillary -Porous Bodies, Root Habitable Media, in Spaceflight Conditions (Massoperenos) investigation studies the particulars of moisture transfer in capillary - porous bodies \u2014soil substitutes \u2014in microgravity. Massoperenos examines the movement of liquid when pores are partially filled and, subsequently, with the active participation of capillary forces, since microgravity conditions are primarily evident where capillary forces start prevailing. S PACE BENEFITS Results of this study are used to design space greenhouses (such as the Lada greenhouse) that are proposed for use on near -Earth orbital stations. In addition, all the particulars discovered are important for designing modules for researching substrates and for various space technologies using porous bodies. R ESULTS The results showed that the gravitation factor played an important role in the formation of a different level of moisture content in root habitable media when cultivating plants . For the first time, the dynamics of capillary sorption by root habitable medium in microgravity were determined, and the coefficient of capillary diffusion of moisture was determined experimentally in microgravity for root habitable medium with limited capillary saturation. In order to study the particulars of moisture migration in the root module (RM) for spaceflight conditions, a comparison of the hydrophysical characteristic was made during the root habitable medium drying phase. In order for liquid to move via capillary forces in c apillary RM (drying process) in spaceflight conditions, greater potential is required than for gravitational conditions (roughly up to 10 times greater for humidity of 70 -60%); thus, the value of rheon is significantly higher in spaceflight conditions than in gravitational conditions. These data coincide with previous data on the possibility of creating localized weakly diffusing zones of moisture in RM for spaceflight conditions. Massopere nos experimental cuvette following completion of the investigation and return to Earth . 271 The dispersion in the readings of hydrophysical characteristics obtained in s paceflight conditions indicated the heterogeneous nature of RM drying, which is not observed in gravitational conditions. The difference in moisture for a potential of - 60 mm of water may reach 17% (62.58% and 45.87%). Massoperenos demonstrated the possibility of using the proposed method for studying the dynamics of capillary sorption in root habitable medium in microgravity conditions, as well as the possibility of applying the method in the experimental determining of the coefficient of capillary diffus ion of moisture in microgravity conditions root habitable medium with limited Jahns GC.

The results of this investigation will support future plans to grow plants on the long -duration transit to Mars. R ESULTS In August 2007, seeds were cultivated in experiment containers on 2 separate rotors in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS), with images taken every 5 minutes. During the 73 day long experiment, 85% of the seeds germinated, despite interruptions caused by too high air flow on day 7 and unforeseen power outages. The gravitropic response to 1 g applied force was greater for the microgravity grown plants than the 1 g grown plants, with the leaves curving upwards 30 minutes after the start of the rotor. At an early growth stage, rosette leaf movements usually bent down when exposed to light, bent upwards when exposed to darkness, and included oscillative (swinging) movements. In light periods, rhythmic leaf movements were present at 45 and 80 minutes. In darkness only 120 minutes rhythms could be found, but image qual ity was lower and could have missed detecting faster rhythms (Solheim et al. 2009). Side stems showed small movements in microgravity and darkness, as well as pronounced circumnutations in 0.8 g force (in darkness and light), followed by no movement once the centrifuge stopped. Although power outages affected the quantity of observations collected, there was enough data to show the main stem demonstrated small movements in microgravity and amplified movements under applied acceleration (Johnsson et al. 20 09).

E ARTH BENEFITS The company undertaking the research belongs to a multi -billion dollar co nsumer company that produces dozens of new products that contain terpenes and other compounds each year. These include beverages, perfumes , and cosmetics. Synthetic variations of terpenes and terpenoids also greatly expand the variety of flavors used in fo od additives. Another application is that the ingredients of terpenes have been shown to serve as natural agricultural pesticides. Hence, the understanding of terpenes extracted without gravity may well produce new understandings of a wide range of new products and processes. This is expected to be the first of several phases of research, all sponsored by the company. S PACE BENEFITS One of the key questions for space station utilization remains a) whether the unique environment of space can capture the int erest of mainstream consumer companies; and b) whether by fostering greater understanding of complex molecules, researchers can shed light on the impact of gravity on basic materials. R ESULTS Results are pending further analysis. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication.

Bingham, PhD, Utah State University, North Logan, Utah R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES ORZS was developed to provide direct measurements and models for plant rooting media that cab be used in future Advanced Life Support (ALS) plant growth experiments. The goal of this investigation is to develop and optimize hardware and procedures to allow optimal plant growth to occur in microgravity. E ARTH BENEFITS As less fertile land becomes available to grow food, alternative agricultural systems that efficiently produce greater quantities of high - quality crops are increasingly important. Data from the operation of the ORZS can advance greenhouse and controlled- environment agricultural systems and help farmers produce better, healthier crops in a small space using the opti mum amount of nutrients. S PACE BENEFITS The experiment develops and optimizes hardware and procedures to allow optimal plant growth to occur in microgravity to support long -term spaceflight life -support scenarios assuming the use of regenerating green plants to provide food supplies for crewmembers, as well as to recycle waste products. R ESULTS The present use of particulate plant growth media lags far behind the technological ability to engineer a porous medium for specific applications in a microgravity environment. Each gravity environment presents sligh tly different challenges with respect to water control and designing particular aspects of an optimal porous medium for plant growth. Capillarity, the ability of a liquid to flow through a narrow passage, is countered by the gravitational force (drainage), which prescribe the water ISS016E027955 - Astronaut Peggy Whitson, Expedition 16 commander, checks the progress of plants growing in the Russian Lada greenhouse in the Zvezda Service Module of the International Space Station . 276 retention property of the porous medium. A well -defined matrix can improve and stabilize plant rooting environmental conditions by optimizing and controlling fluxes and content of critical plant resources. The objectives of ORZS were to develop a modeling approach for optimizing liquid and gas fluxes to plant roots under extreme volume constraints and reduced gravity conditions. Secondly, this study aimed to extend this approach to design engineered porous media to satisfy plant r oot metabolic requirements in reduced gravity. Media properties in terms of hydraulic and structural constraints were combined with physiological information (optimal oxygen concentration or water content) and used to express gas and liquid fluxes to plant roots. Further efforts to engineer optimal porous medium properties should strike a balance between the biological needs of the plants, practical limitations regarding material properties (cost, weight , etc) and providing the desired transport properties (Jones 2005).

Stutte, PhD, Dynamic Corporation, Cape Canaveral, Florida RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Photosynthesis Experiment and System Testing and Operation (PESTO) studies the photosynthetic response of plant tissues grown in microgravity. Results can lead to the development of regenerative life support systems on future missions to the moon or Mars. E ARTH BENEFIT S As less fertile land becomes available to grow food, alternative agricultural systems that efficiently produce greater quantities of high -quality crops are increasingly important. Data from the operation of the PESTO can advance greenhouse and controlled -environment agricultural systems and help farmers produce better, healthier crops in a small space using the optimum amount of nutrients. S PACE BENEFITS The amount of food necessary to sustain a crew during a long -duration mission to Mars would prohibitively increase the mass of spacecraft and the overall cost of the mission. A possibility to alleviate this problem could be the use of plant systems as food sources or for regenerative life support systems. The biomass production systems may also be used as a filtration system for water and atmospheric gases. R ESULTS During International Space Station (ISS) Expedition 4, PESTO grew 32 plants for 73 days inside the plant growth chambers of the Biom ass Production System (BPS). Following return to Earth, these plants were compared to ground controls that were grown in BPS plant growth chambers on Earth. The PESTO investigation had 3 dimensions that resulted in a more complete picture of microgravity influences on photosynthesis: gas exchange, partitioning , and metabolism. Carbon dioxide and light response curves allowed researchers to establish whether canopy photosynthetic responses were affected by space conditions. This is noteworthy since plants can be used to regenerate the atmosphere in space conditions thr ough removal of carbon ISS004E10138 - Close -up view of Apogee Wheat Plants with a scale as backdrop to exhibit the growth of the plants grown as part of the Photosynthesis Experiment and System Testing and Operation on ISS Expedition 4. 278 dioxide and production of oxygen. In addition, the tests that evaluated movement of water via transpiration are important since they are indicative of the stomatal respon ses that regulate photosynthesis. Further, the impact of microgravity on transpiration was significant since plants can be used to purify water under spaceflight conditions. These studies involving gas exchange at elevated carbon dioxide concentrations inc reased our understanding of the biological impacts of increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide on Earth -based ecosystems. Furthermore, an understanding of plant responses under a range of carbon dioxide and light conditions has potential benefits to commercial, controlled environment, agriculture industries. The growth and development of the dwarf wheat plants on the ISS was similar to the growth and development of plants on Earth. Analysis of the plants indicated that the microgravity - grown plants were 10% taller than plants grown on Earth, although the growth rate of dwarf wheat leaves was very similar to the plants grown on Earth. The near- real-time video data provided by BPS allowed for validation of the growth data in microgravity when compared to the controls. Design applications can be made to the BPS to allow for successful plant production on the ISS and future long -duration missions to the moon and Mars (Stutte 2003). To effectively farm in space, multiple redundant plant growth chambers ar e needed to acquire the maximum yield of food, oxygen, and water. PESTO evaluated the transpiration (water) and photosynthesis (oxygen) processes of the dwarf wheat plant in microgravity and found that microgravity did not affect either the transpiration o r the photosynthesis processes of the plants (Monje 2005). When environmental controls such as temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide, and water are effectively maintained, microgravity does not affect canopy growth of dwarf wheat plants. Slight d ifferences in photosystem I (photosynthesis in which light of up to 700 nm is absorbed and reduced to create energy) and photosystem II (photosynthesis in which light of up to 680 nm is absorbed and its energy is used to split water molecules, giving rise to oxygen) were noted and are being evaluated further (Stutte 2005). When conducting biological studies, it is important to maintain the integrity of the samples. The standard method to preserve samples is quick freezing at low temperatures ( -80\u00b0C (-112\u00b0 F) and below), but strict temperature control of samples on station is not always uniform or possible. Therefore, a preservative is needed that will maintain the integrity of biological samples before cooling. RNAlater TM was used to preserve some of the PESTO samples on station. The viability ISS004E10128 - Close -up view of Apogee Wheat Plants grown as part of the Photosynthesis Experiment and System Testing and Operation investigation during International Space Station Expedition 4. 279 of the samples pres erved with RNAlaterTM was greater than that of the samples preserved using formalin. To carry out long -term studies aboard ISS, a fixative such as RNAlaterTM is needed to maintain the integrity of samples at the varying temperatures that are experienced on ISS (Paul 2005). The objective of PESTO was to determine what effects microgravity have on chloroplast development, carbohydrate metabolism, and gene expression in the leaves of the plants grown on the ISS. PESTO data indicated that microgravity alters l eaf development, cell structure, and chloroplast morphology but does not compromise the overall physical function of the plant (Stutte 2006).

E ARTH BENEFITS One interest to scientists and industry is the structural compound called lignin, which is produced by plants. Lignin is one of the molecules plants use to make stiff, woody cell walls. Plants grown in space produce less lignin, because in the absence of gravity they don't need such a woody structure. Genetic information gained from plants grown in the PGBA could enable scientists on Earth to control the amount of lignin a plant produces. Growing trees with less lignin could dramatically reduce the economic and environmental cost of paper production, allowing faster tree growth, more paper production, and le ss chemical use during milling. Other plants could gain added protection from the elements if lignin production was increased. S PACE BENEFITS The ability to grow plants in space has an enormous impact on the success of future interplanetary space exploration. Any long -term human presence on the moon or Mars requires sustainable plant growth, which can provide a renewable food supply for explorers and assist with the maintenance of breathable air. R ESULTS The returned plant material did not develop in a normal manner, and the primary scientific objectives were not met. The study did, however, help identify the need for greater regulation of air quality within a plant growth chamber to ensure uniform plant growth.

Perera, PhD, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Plant Signaling experiment studies the effects of microgravity on the growth of plants. The experiment is performed aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA). Images of the plants are captured and down -linked to Earth. Samples of the plants are harvested and returned to Earth for scientific analysis. The results of this experiment can lead to information that aids in food production during future long -duration space missions, as well as data to enhance crop production on Earth. E ARTH BENEFITS Further understanding of how plants g row and develop at a molecular level can lead to significant advancements in agricultural production on Earth. Understanding mechanisms of plant development supports improved agricultural production and lead s to higher crop yields on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS During long -duration space missions, it is necessary to provide crew members with regenerative sources of food as well as supplemental methods to recycle carbon dioxide into breathable oxygen. As new information about how plants grow in microgravity emerg es, sustainable plant -based life support systems may be developed.

RESULTS The Polca experiment was conducted using Brassica napus seedlings, which submitted 4 different conditions: continuously on 1 g centrifuge or continuously in microgravity conditions. Some seedlings that germinated on centrifuge for 28 hours were transferred for 10 minutes into microgravity conditions, leading to a loss of amyloplast -ER interactions through amyloplasts displacement. Others seedlings that germ inated in microgravity conditions for 28 hours were transferred to a centrifuge for 10 minutes. One hundred percent of seed germination was obtained in all conditions. The analysis of amyloplast positioning (ESA Figure 1) showed clearly (1) a relocalizat ion of amyloplast in statocytes of seedlings grown microgravity conditions compared to those grown on 1 g centrifuge; (2) a slight amyloplast displacement after 10 minutes of transfer. Surprisingly, despite the slight amyloplast displacement, a change in t he number of calcium precipitation is revealed after each transfer. These results suggested that the calcium signaling seemed to be affected by a slight amyloplast displacement. The presence of a gravi- receptor near the amyloplast was then hypothesized . This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication.

The results of this investigation support future plans to cultivate plants on long - duration exploration missions. EARTH BENEFITS Data gathered from the Resist Wall study aims to further the understanding of how plant growth and development at a molecular level can lead to significant advancements in agricultural production on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS The Resist Wall experiment aims to explore the molecular mechanism by which the cell- wall construction of supporting tissues in land plants is regulated via gravity signal, which can benefit space explorers. R ESULTS Under microgravity conditions, seeds of the tua6 mutant were shown to germinate and grow normally until they reached the seedling stage. The seedlings were naturally air- dried in European Modular Cultivation System ( EMCS) due to a failure in the water supply system. The cell wall mechanical properties of rehydrated hypocotyls exhibited typical stress -strains and stress- relaxation curves, which is normally seen in fixed or frozen ma terials. There were no prominent differences between space -grown hypocotyls and the ground controls. During the final steps in gravity resistance, plants increase their cell wall rigidity by modifying their cell wall metabolism and cell wall environment. Under hypergravity conditions, the orientation of cortical microtubules was modified, suggesting that they play an important role in gravity resistance. The Resist Wall Experiment aims to clarify whether the gravity resistance of plants in 1 G, specifically the function of microtubules , is the same as the resistance in hypergravity. In 2008, this experiment was carried out on the Plant Cultivation Chamber (PCC) in the EMCS on the International Space Station (ISS) . The mechanism of gravity resistance has of ten been confused with that of gravitropism. Future experiments will take place to further define this mechanism under microgravity conditions.

For this experiment Arabidopsis thaliana has been used, the first plant species whose genome was totally sequenced. R ESULTS Conspicuous differences in length were found between seedlings grown at 1 g and the parallel samples grown under microgravity in that the latter were substantially longer. The causes of this differential growth were determined by examining the morphology of the root meristematic cells, with a focus on their nucleoli, in the 2 radial regions of the root meristem, namely the cortex and stele. While the stele showed longer ce lls with larger nucleoli in the longer roots of the flight samples compared with the ground controls, cortical cells from space - grown seedlings were shorter, more numerous and more densely packed compared to the ground control. However, nucleoli were smaller and less active in these fast proliferating cells of the flight sample than in the ground control sample. This lower level of ribosome synthesis per cell in the flight sample was probably due to an accelerated cell cycle, which resulted in shortened pha ses. An altered rate of cell proliferation may have been harmful for the plant and could be the reason of the reported reduced size of older seedlings grown in space. Furthermore, in order to explore a possible differential gene expression in proliferating cells caused by space conditions, 2 -dimensional protein electrophoresis was performed on samples in which fixation was reversed by prolonged storage in buffer. The total proteomic profile of seedlings showed noticeable differences between the space sample and the ground control. Immunocytochemical studies, which are currently in progress, will show differences in the levels as well as in the distribution of relevant nucleolar proteins, known to be regulated in their expression and in their mechanisms by factors affecting the cell proliferation rate and the cell cycle progression.

E ARTH BENEFITS The plant experimental unit (PEU) was developed in collaboration with JAXA. It is a small plant subsystem that is able to control the cultivation environment automatically . The PEU can be a basis of design for large -scale plant factories, which are more efficient on the ground . SPACE BENEFITS Plants are vital to long -duration space exploration. Green plants are valuable not only for food production but also for providing oxygen. The Space Seed experiment may provide fundamental data covering plant growth in space. R ESULTS Downlinked images f rom the Kibo laboratory demonstrated that seeds started to germinate 3 days after initial watering, followed by the development of rosette leaves, flower stalks, flowers, and siliques. Fruit formation was also observed regardless of the magnitude of gravity . The rosette leaves under microgravity remained dark green for longer as compared to plants grown in the 1 G centrifuge, indicating that leaf senescence is delayed under microgravity. Microarray analysis of genes involved in supporting flower stalks revealed that under microgravity conditions , one gene was downregulated, while f our genes were upregulated , indicating that microgravity conditions modify the pattern of gene expression involved in secondary cell formation . This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. Photo A and B; Bolting of inflorescences in Arabidopsis plants grown for 28 days in Kibo.

Ferl, PhD , University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System (TAGES) investigation is one in a pair of investigations that use the A dvanced Biological Research System (ABRS) facility. TAGES thale cress, with sensor promoter -reporter gene constructs that render the plants as biomonitors, or an organism used to determine the quality of the surrounding environme nt, using real- time nondestructive Green Fluorescent Protein imagery and traditional postflight analyses. E ARTH BENEFITS The miniaturization of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) imaging apparatus as a requirement for this spaceflight investigation has p roduced a device that is easily transportable and may be used as a means for conducting in situ analysis of appropriately genetically prepared biomonitors. S PACE BENEFITS TAGES along with the ABRS hardware demonstrates the capabilities of providing the correct environment for plant growth aboard spacecraft. For future long -duration exploration, crews need to be able to grow plants for a variety of applications. R ESULTS TAGES analyzes root morphology of Arabidopsis grown on Petri plates while aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Imaging hardware delivered plant images from the ISS providing science without returned samples. These images revealed that in the absence of gravity with the presence of directional light, roots continued to grow away from the light source and shoot growth. This phenomenon was previously thought to be gravity dependent, however the TAGES experiment proved this incorrect. Root skewing also took place while in microgravity, identifying this process as gravity independent as well. Overall growth patterns in microgravity mimic those from simultaneous ground studies, with slightly less uniformity. Microgravity was also found to retard the rate of early Arabidopsis growth (Paul 2012).

Kiss, PhD, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Analysis of a Novel Sensory Mechanism in Root Phototrpism (Tropi) studies Arabidopsis thaliana plants sprouting from seeds to gain insights into sustainable agriculture for future long -duration space missions. E ARTH BENEFITS Further understanding of how p lants grow and develop at a molecular level can lead to significant advancements in agricultural production on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS During long -term space exploration, it is necessary to provide crew members with regenerative sources of food, as well as supplemental methods to recycle carbon dioxide into breathable oxygen. As new information about how plants grow in microgravity emerges, sustainable plant - based life support systems may be developed. RESULTS Tropi was a multi- part experiment aimed to gain a better understanding of how microg ravity affects phototropism, directed growth of a plant in response to a light stimulus, and gravitropism, directed growth in response to gravity, in Arabidopsis thaliana. An in space experiment was necessary because the microgravity conditions of space pr ovide the opportunity to study phototropism in the absence of gravity (Correll 2005). Tropi was initially performed during Increment 14 on the International Space Station (ISS). These experiments were returned to Earth on 3 space shuttle missions. Several important lessons were gained from this initial run. The first issue arose while using analog video tapes. Although quality images were taken, there was an inefficient use of resources in the time it took for image processing and analysis procedures to be performed. Another issue arose during ISS022E087465 - NASA astronaut Jeffrey Williams, Expedition 22 commander, services the Tropism in Plants (TROPI2) experiment in the Columbus Laboratory of the International Space Station. 293 the seedling hydration procedure. The initial command did not take place and without video downlink s, the entire experiment would not have been completed. An additional issue arose in seed germination. The seeds were stored from 6 to 8 months prior to hydration and resulted in only 58% germination in the first run with progressive deterioration in the following 2 runs. The last major issue to arise was found in the transfer of the frozen materials from the shuttle to NASA cooler bags. Because the samples were allowed time to \" warm up \" during transfer, the RNA from the STS -116 samples degraded. This issue was mediated by implementing a \"3- minute rule \" in the following runs (Kiss 2009). Although several issues did arise during the first part of Tropi, invaluable information was gained from this experiment. A novel positive phototrophic response to red light was observed in hypocotyls of seedlings that developed in microgravity. It is hypothesized that A. thaliana exhibits red -light phototropism in microgravity, while on Earth, it is suppressed by normal gravity. A greater phototrophic response was also observed in blue -light -based trials. A more prominent curvature was detected when shoots were briefly exposed to red light followed by blue light (Millar 2010). European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) Tropi experiment unique equipment (EUE) shown stimulating Arabidopsis seedlings with blue light (left). EMCS Tropi EUE shown stimulat ing Arabidopsis seedlings with red light (right). Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, C alifornia image. 294 Investigators had the opportunity to confirm and extend the results of Tropi in a follow -up experiment during Increment 22 on the I SS. Major modifications between part 1 and part 2 of Tropi took place to ensure optimal experimental conditions. Instead of using analog videos to capture images, part 2 used direct downlinks from the ISS. This allowed for much quicker processing of experi ment images and results. Due to modifications in the storage time of the seedlings, the second part of Tropi demonstrated better seed germination (approx. 90%) and improved seedling growth compared to part 1. The last major modification in part 2 of Tropi involved a switch to use powered GLACIER freezers for the transfer of the frozen samples from the ISS to the space shuttle then to Earth. These freezers helped to maintain the low temperatures required to keep RNA intact (Kiss 2011). Previous experiments h ave dealt with the effects normal gravity and microgravity on plant biology, however Tropi tested the effects fractional gravity has on plant development. More specifically, the effect fractional gravity has on hypocotyl and root development. Tropi part 2 confirmed red -light -based positive phototropism found in hypocotyls under microgravity. When gravity levels began to elevate, a decreased response was noted. Under microgravity conditions, roots displayed a positive phototropic response to red light. This response was only observed under microgravity because when 0.1g was induced, the red- light response was attenuated. Tropi was also utilized to determine the relationship between red- light pretreatments prior to blue -light exposure in hypocotyls and roots. Hypocotyls displayed a decreased response in phototropism while roots exhibited an increase response in phototropism when exposed to a red- light pretreatment. In response to these findings, investigators wanted to determine if there was a direct or indirec t relationship between the red-light pretreatments in the hypocotyls and roots. In regards to the hypocotyls, these space studies support the concept that red -light is indirectly involved in blue -light -based phototropism through the attenuation of gravitro pism. These results support the hypothesis that red- light enhancement of blue -light root phototropism is direct. Taking Tropi as a whole, these observations show that the microgravity conditions found in laboratories aboard the ISS can provide a unique res earch tool to gain insights into fundamental mechanisms in plant biology (Kiss 2012).

The team aimed to compare the microtubule cytoskeleton of plant cells exposed t o weightlessness for a shorter period with the microtubule cytoskeleton of plant cells, which have been exposed to weightlessness for a longer period. R ESULTS It was found that at near weightlessness during an 8 -day space experiment aboard the International Space Station (ISS), tobacco BY -2 suspension culture cells divided and grew as the control cells in the on -board 1 -g centrifuge and the 1 -g ground setup. The ir interphase cytoarchitecture and their cortical microtubule and cellulose micro fibril ordering were also indistinguishable. Not only did near weightlessness not alter these characteristics, the whole environment, including radiation and vibrations, also did not affect the processes that are crucial for plant cell growth and proliferation. These are important and positive results if, in the future, plants have to be propagated from (frozen) cell culture stocks during long -term space missions. In general, the results agree with several studies using whole plants (Halstead and Dutcher 1987; Musgrave et al. 1997; Levine et al. 2001), but contrast with the findings of Sato and coworkers (1999), who reported, based on electron microscopic observations, that Nicotiana tabacum stem explants grown in space had reduced microtubule quantities. It was concluded that plant cells do not need to be organized in a tissue to grow, divide, and organize their microtubules and cellulose microfibrils in space.

This scientific area has also received more attention with the perspectives of very long -duration orbital flights, in particular, future human exploration of Mars. R ESULTS The vine grafts were launched into orbit on Soyuz TMA -6 in a pressure/vacuum proof sealed metallic container to avoid any environment contamination. Once back on the Earth, at the end of the short- duration ENEIDE mission in 2005 (Soyuz 10S/Soyuz 9S excha nge) tendrils were planted, to test their growth. These were compared to equivalent plants that were treated in a similar fashion in parallel on the ground for reference purposes. This showed no comparable difference in growth. This investigation is comp lete; however additional results are pending publication. Vine in Near Orbit experiment container.

One aim specifically is to verify that circumnutation of Arabidoposis roots is driven by an endogenous mechanism that is independent of gravity as a cue. R ESULTS Postflight analysis is complete, and publication of results is imminent. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication.

MD, Biopreparat, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Optimizing Heterologous Expression in Saccharomyces Yeast in Microgravity based on the Example of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Synthesis ( Antigen) investigation comparatively studies the specifics of the heterologous expression of the H BsAg gene of the Hepatitis B virus in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in microgravity and Earth. This investigation establishes methods for optimizing synthesis in order to obtain high- quality strains of producer yeasts of the H Bs antigen to create an effective vaccine for Hepatitis B. E ARTH BENEFITS Studying the specifics and factors of HBs -antigen gene expression stability in yeast cells is relevant to optimize the large -scale production of a yeast recombinant vaccine for Hepatitis B. S PACE BENEFITS The results obtained demonstrate the possibility of the suitable existence of microorganisms aboard spacecraft as a part of biotechnological factories that in the future will accompany extended interplanetary flights. The space investigations demonstrated that microorganism cultures with the needed properties can be selected both on Earth and in space. R ESULTS An analysis of the data obtained confirmed the feasibility of applying new methods to line breeding, super -producers of the HBs -antigen. Based on the data obtained, the following conclusions can be drawn: the stability of HBs -antigen characteristics does not depend on storage time on Earth or in space conditions, and it is mainly determined by strain properties and experiment design conditions.

Nickerson, PhD, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccine (RASV) evaluates the ability of the spaceflight platform to accelerate recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccine development against pneumococcal pneumonia, which causes life -threaten ing diseases (pneumonia, meningitis, bacteremia) that kill over 10 million people annually, particularly children and elderly who are less responsive to current anti-pneumococcal vaccines. The overall goal of the RASV experiment is to use spaceflight as an innovative platform to facilitate the design and development of next generation vaccines with improved efficacy and protective immune responses while minimizing unwanted side effects by 1) providing novel gene targets for vaccine improvement and developme nt, and 2) re -formulating existing vaccines. The experiment is a joint collaboration between Arizona State University researchers, Dr. Cheryl Nickerson and Dr. Roy Curtiss III. E ARTH BENEFITS The research results from RASV could lead to the development of new and effective vaccines to combat pneumonia and related infections on E arth. Further, these vaccines could have fewer side effects and provide a template for the development of vaccines to combat other infectious diseases. S PACE BENEFITS Our previous spaceflight studies demonstrated a significant increase in virulence and/or virulence characteristics in bacterial pathogens when cultured during flight, thus increasing the uncertainty of the infection risk to the crew during a spaceflight mission. Our current spaceflight experiment provides additional key information that can advance our understanding of alterations that occur in microbial virulence during spaceflight and may lead to better countermeasures against infection in future human exploration missions. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. Cheryl Nickerson of the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University .

These images changed our view of ourselves and our relationship to the Earth. Even with the many satellites now orbiting in space, ISS continues to provide unique views of our planet and galaxy. 304 EUROPEAN TECHNOLOGY EXPOSURE FACILITY - EXPOSURE EXPERIMENT - ADAPT (EUTEF-EXPOSE - ADAPT ) Research Area: Astrobiology Expedition(s): 16-20 Principal Investigator(s): Petra Rettberg, PhD, German Aerospace Centre, Cologne, Germany RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The European Technology Exposure Facility - Exposure Experiment exposes several investigations outside of the International Space Station (ISS) for 18 months on the external surface of the European Columbus Laboratory. The EuTEF -Expose -Adapt investigation examines the capability of highly resistant microorganisms to a dapt themselves to being exposed to different levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. It looks at whether long exposure to UV radiation of different, harmful levels could result in highly resistant microbes to extreme environments in space or on other planet s. R ESULTS From the 5 space factors (UV, vacuum, ionizing radiation, temperature variations, microgravity), solar extraterrestrial UV radiation, as well as the Martian UV spectrum, was the most harmful factor applied. In some samples only a few survivors were recovered from Bacillus subtilis MW01 spores exposed in monolayers. However, if shielded from solar irradiation, about 8% of MW01 spores survived in low -Earth orbit conditions, and 100% survived in simulated Martian conditions, compared to the laborat ory controls. The results demonstrated the effect of shielding against the high sterilizing potential of extraterrestrial solar UV radiation, which limits the chances of survival of even the highly UV -resistant strain of Bacillus subtilis MW01 in the harsh environments of outer space and the Martian surface.

Lithic fungi and lichens from extreme environments are the best adapted eukaryot es (cells with a nucleus and internal specialized structures like our own cells) to dryness and radiations. The EuTEF -Expose -Life investigation aims to test selected representatives of these organisms to evaluate their survival in space conditions. R ESULT S Photosynthetic activities, growth tests, DNA tests, and vital staining tests have been performed and analyzed, while electron microscopy is still in progress. The experiment was considered successful with interesting results as space and Mars -like conditions resistance was observed for all eukaryotes tested for a long period. Samples resisted full solar irradiation (1 lichen with a PSII activity, ie, Photosystem II [or water-plastoquinone oxidoreductase, o f 45% and one black fungus with 80% of DNA]). The dark samples, shielded from UV light, survived with different levels (from almost 100% to 2.5%). One sandstone sample contained interestingly a very high fraction of intact fungal cells though exposed to the full solar spectrum. P UBLICATION (S) Brandt A, de Vera J, Onofri S, Ott S.

EuTEF -Expose -Process improves our knowledge about the chemical nature and evolution of organic molecules in various space environments. Organic samples are exposed to space conditions to simulate their evolution on extreme places such as asteroids, comet s, and the surface of Mars. R ESULTS A selection of the results from the EuTEF - Expose -PROCESS experiment showed that resistance to radiation depends on the chemical nature of the exposed molecules and the wavelengths of the UV light. The experiment also demonstrated the protective effect of m eteorite powder. The most altered compounds are the dipeptide, aspartic acid, and aminobutyric acid. The most resistant are alanine, valine, glycine, and aminoisobutyric acid. All molecules, with or without meteorite powder, were affected when exposed to s olar radiation. Aspartic acid, an amino acid with a diacid group, is more sensitive to UV radiation than amino acids with alkyl chains. The dipeptide with an amide bond degraded almost completely when not associated with a mineral surface. In contrast, the amino acids with a substituted chain, such as valine, are more stable than those with a linear chain, as in the case of aminobutyric acid. Aboard the ISS, the amino acids exposed in the free form degrade by more than 40%. The quantity of the leucine dipeptide (Leu2) in the samples is too low to be quantified, but intact molecules are present. More than 80% of the compounds associated with meteorite powder are preserved, except for the aspartic and amino butyric acids and Leu2. The protective effect of the meteorite powder is important, in particular for those compounds that showed the most degradation when exposed in the free form. In these 2 forms, free or embedded in meteorite powder, the most resistant compounds were the amino acids alanine, glycine, a minoisobutyric acid, and valine; the most degraded were the dipeptides and the aspartic and aminobutyric acids. Expose allows long exposures to space conditions and solar UV -radiation on the International Space Station.

The EuTEF -Expose -Protect investigation is designed to assess the survivability of spacecraft contami nants on a landed mission to Mars. During the mission, bacterial endospores, attached to spacecraft qualified aluminum coupons, are subjected either to a simulated Earth -to- Mars trajectory or to simulated Martian surface conditions. R ESULTS This study confirmed the high resistance of spores of 2 Bacillus species to the most adverse conditions encountered during a planetary mission, such as space vacuum, cosmic radiatio n, temperature fluctuations, long storage, and Martian atmospheric pressure and composition. The high sterilizing efficiency of solar UV radiation experienced on an Earth to Mars trip as well as on the surface of Mars was also confirmed. Spores could only escape the deadly radiation attack by hiding in cracks or pits of the spacecraft surface, protecting the inner layers in spore clumps, or shielding via the spacecraft itself. Because a landing probe would most likely be encased in an entry shield or bioshi eld, possible spore hitchhikers attached to a lander may well escape this irradiation during an Earth to Mars mission.

Plant seeds have evolved to conserve the species and its genome under extreme stress conditions (cold, drought, heat). EuTEF -Expose -Seeds determines the resistance of plant seeds when exposed to the open space environment. Plant seeds have in fact frequently been tested in space, mostly as part of microgravity and radiation studies, but never with full exposure to solar UV-C on a long -duration flight. R ESULTS Of the 2 100 wild -type thaliana (cress plant) and Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) seeds, 23% produced suitable plants after exposure for 1.5 years to full space conditions including solar UV. The highest survival occurred in tobacco (44%). These results indicated that a seed- like entity could survive exposure to solar UV radiation unprotected during transport between Mars and Earth. Full survival is attained in seeds shielded from solar light, demonstrating that a longer space travel would be possible for seeds embedded in an opaque matrix. Survival is lower in the Arabidopsi s wassilewskija ecotype and in mutants lacking UV screens. Chemical samples of seed flavonoid UV screens were degraded by UV, but their overall capacity to absorb UV was retained. Nucleic acids (large biological molecules essential for life) were also degraded by UV. However, a fragment was detected and the gene survived in space when protected from UV. This showed that even if seeds do not survive, components (eg, their DNA) might survive transfer over cosmic distances. Expose allows long exposures to space conditions and solar UV -radiation on the International Space Station. Several trays filled with organisms were installed on the outside of the European Columbus laboratory as one of the 9 payloads of the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF).

This suite of experiments are accommodated in 3 special sample trays, which are loaded with a variety of biological samples and exposed to the harsh enviro nment of open space for almost 2 years from March 2009 -January 2011. This experiment studies the effect of solar UV radiation on a type of virus (Phage T7) and an RNA compound (uracil) to determine their effectiveness as biological dosimeters for measuring UV dose in the space environment. R ESULTS During the whole flight, the surface of PUR experiment was exposed to the solar radiation for 2 687 hours, which corresponds to a total UV (ultraviolet) dose of 1 100 MJ/m 2. The effect of the solar UV was evaluated by spectrophotometry in the specific UV range: 200 -400 nm. The so- called dark samples (not exposed to the solar radiation) in the EXPOSE -R under the exposed ones did not change in the flight (ie, the measured absorption spectra did not change under the influence of space conditions). On the top of the exposed uracil and bacteriophage samples, magnesium fluoride filters of various (4 orders of magnitude) transparency were applied, which aimed to approximate dose effect relations for both targets. B ased on the slope of the curves, higher sensitivity of the uracil samples was found. The resulting curves indicated that both bacteriophage T7 and uracil in thin layer form are suitable for the assessment of the biological risk due to extraterrestrial solar radiation (Berces 2013).

This suite of experiments are accommodated in 3 special sample trays, which are loaded with a variety of biological samples and exposed to the harsh environment of open space for almost 2 years from March 2009 -January 2011. This investigation records with time resolution, the dose of solar light over 4 wavelength ranges as well as the flux of heavy cosmic particles. Relativistic Electron Precipitations (REP) have been observed for many years. Electrons with energies of a few MeV can penetrate the spa cecraft shielding and can cause damage to sensitive electronic preamplifiers and whole systems of the spacecraft. The total dose of an astronaut on a 6 -hour spacewalk inside the REP, has also been estimated to exceed the astronaut's short- term limits for b oth skin and eyes. The main idea of the analysis of daily fluences on the International Space Station (ISS) is to underline that REP events are common on ISS. R ESULTS Comparison between the relativistic electron dose rate data measured by the R3D instrum ent on ESA's EuTEF facility (R3DE) and R3DR showed that during periods of simultaneous operation the R3DR dose rates were higher than for R3DE because the R3DR instrument was in a less shielded surrounding. The conclusion was that astronauts on EVA collect highly variable dose rates during REP in dependence of their position around the station. Only active personal dosimeters were able to accurately measure these large variations. The most interesting period was between April and August 2010. The R3DR and GOES -11 daily relativistic electron fluences greatly increased on of April 6 and 7. Solar activity was at very low levels with isolated low -level B -class flares, and a halo coronal mass ejection was observed on April 3. The main conclusion of the research was that REP events were common on the ISS and require additional comprehensive investigations (Dachev 2012).

The AMS -02 uses the unique environment o f space to advance knowledge of the universe and leads to an understanding of the universe's origin by searching for antimatter, dark matter, and measuring cosmic rays. E ARTH BENEFITS This investigation seeks to understand fundamental issues shared by ph ysics, astrophysics, and cosmology on the origin and structure of the universe. Results from AMS -02 will be used to advance knowledge of the universe and lead to the understanding of the universe's origin by searching for antimatter, dark matter, and measu ring cosmic rays. S PACE BENEFITS AMS- 02 will provide a plethora of cosmic ray data that will help to advance and perhaps redefine much of what we know about the low -Earth orbit space radiation environment. S134E007193, ISS028E016135 - Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer mounted on the S3 truss . 325 RESULTS AMS- 02 was installed on the International Space Station (ISS) on May 19, 2011. In the first 18 months of operations, AMS -02 recorded 6.8 million positron (an antimatter particle with the mass of an electron but a positive charge) and electron events produc ed from cosmic ray collisions with the interstellar medium in the energy range between 0.5 giga-electron volt (GeV) and 350 GeV. These events were used to determine the positron fraction (ratio of positrons to the total number of electrons and positrons). Below 10 GeV, the positron fraction decreased with increasing energy, as expected. However, the positron fraction increased steadily from 10 GeV to 250 GeV. This increase, seen previously though less precisely by instruments such as the Payload for Matter/ antimatter Exploration and Light -nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) and the Fermi Gamma- ray Space Telescope, conflicts with the predicted decrease of the positron fraction and indicates the existence of a currently unidentified source of positrons, such as pulsa rs or the annihilation of dark matter particles. Furthermore, researchers observed an unexpected decrease in slope from 20 GeV to 250 GeV. The measured positron to electron ratio is isotropic, the same in all directions. Above 250 GeV, more data is require d to determine the positron fraction behavior. PUBLICATION (S) Aguilar- Benitez M, Aisa D, Alpat B, Alvino A, Ambrosi G, Andeen K.

Mitrofanov, PhD, Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Study of the Fluxes of Fast and Thermal Neutrons (BTN -Neytron), focuses on the spatial and temporal distribution of neutron fluxes and spectra in near -Earth space, including during solar flares. These investigations help researchers to improve current in -orbit radiation models and examine the complete radiation dose the International Space Station (ISS) crew members receive during EVAs. E ARTH BENEFITS Scintillators studied for their radiation -resistance during the BTN -Neytron experiment are currently in use in scientific equipment being created by Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences. S PACE BENEFITS The r esults may be used to create models of the neutron radiation situation in near -Earth and interplanetary manned space complexes. RESULTS BTN -Neytron- Database The BTN -Neytron space experiment data accumulated between February 2007 through November 2011, the spectra of neutron fluxes outside the ISS were experimentally assessed for energies from the cadmium threshold of 0.4 eV to 10 MeV, which correlated well with the results of other space experiments. BTN -Neytron- Design A map was created of the distributio n of neutron fluxes for various energies on ISS orbit, which indicated that the neutron fluxes on the station vary significantly depending on its geographic position, which is particularly evident during flight over the South Atlantic magnetic anomaly (SAA). BTN -Neytron- Radiation ISS Assessments were made of the dose accumulation rate outside the ISS pressurized compartments from neutrons with energies from the cadmium threshold of 0.4 eV to 10 MeV, which, depending on the geographic position of the ISS, v ary from 0.2 mSv/hour (in the Installation of the -1 on the exterior of the Service Module, 2006. Roscosmos image. 328 equatorial zone) to 5 mSv/hour (in the vicinity of the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly [SAMA]). These data were compared to data from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency investigation Bonner Ball Neutron Detector (BBND) and demonstrated close correspondence, taking into account the differing levels of solar activity in these experiments. BTN -Neytron- Ground Segment Studies were performed on the degradation of crystals of prospective gamma scintillators, and it was shown that lanthanum bromide (LaBr 3[Ce]) and LaCl 3(Ce) crystals are suitable for use in future space applications, due to their low induced activity and minor degradation of spectrometric properties. BTN -Neytron- Earth and Mars Experiments confirmed the effect of increased neutron flux caused by increased galactic cosmic ray fluxes in a period of declining solar activity. The result obtained correlates well with the results of measuring neutron fluxes in Mars orbit and the network of neutron monitors on Earth. BTN -Neytron- ISS Recording of space gamma- ray bursts and other transient phenomena (for example, sources such as soft gamma repeaters) in the gamma range has started.

MAXI looks for galactic transient phenomena in the X -ray spectrum of the sky. When in teresting phenomena are discovered, the information is made available to astronomers around the world. E ARTH BENEFIT The all -sky X -ray pictures obtained with MAXI are very useful in furthering science education. Images have already appeared in a planetarium program, a Japanese physics textbook, and a United States astronomy textbook. S PACE BENEFIT The X -ray charge -coupled device (CCD) camera technology developed for MAXI was used on the Hayabusa spacecraft that returned samples from a near Earth asteroid in 2010. R ESULTS BLACK HOLE CANDIDATES MAXI has a distinctive capability of monitoring the outbursts of black hole binaries from beginning to end. MAXI is particularly useful in discovering and monitoring the very early phase of outbursts. MAXI discovered 5 new black hole candidates, J1910 057 (Usui 2012). Since the activation of MAXI, half of all new black hole candidates have been discovered by MAXI. All-sky image with Monitor of All -sky X -ray Image (MAXI) Gas Slit Camera (GSC). The 1.5 year data was used. The black hole candidates detected with MAXI are shown with the names. JAXA image. 331 BINARY X-RAY PULSARS The MAXI team reported more than 20 outbursts. MAXI detected an outburst of GX 304 1 for the first time in the last 30 years and another outburst 10 times bigger in 2010. The latter outburst was quickly followed by a coordinated Suzaku satellite observation, which detected a cyclotron resonance absorption line indicating the strongest magnetic field ever observed. The Swift Gamma -Ray Burst Satellite has also been conducting coordinated observations following the MAXI alerts. For example, Swift/XRT d iscovered X MAXI J1409 619 (Kennea 2010). S TELLAR FLARE The first unbiased survey of X -ray flares in stars and young stellar objects (YSO) is ongoing. MAXI detected 23 flares from 12 stars in the first 2 years, proving that large X- ray f laring is possible and providing a unified picture for star flaring. A CTIVE GALACTICE NUCLEUS (AGN) AND THE TIDAL DISRUP TION OF A STAR BY A MASSIVE BLACK HOLE MAXI monitored 3 X- ray flares from the blazer (a class of AGN) Markarian 421, and provided a new insight on the origin of giant flares. MAXI and Swift also observed the instant that a massive black hole swallowed a star for the first time in the world. MAXI CATALOG The MAXI team released a GSC source catalog for high Galactic -latitude sky sources, which shows the member list of AGN in the X -ray sky drastically changed in the last 30 years (due to time variability). The catalog was used to make a reliable luminosity function of AGN in our local universe. H YPERNOVA REMNANT The MAXI Solid -state Slit C amera (MAX -SSC) revealed the existence of a hypernova remnant, estimated to be 3 million years old and is believed to be the first in our galaxy. Hypernov Remnant The size of the hypernova remnant discovered by Monitor of All -sky X -ray Image (MAXI) looks 20 times bigger than the full moon when viewed from the Earth. The right panel shows the all -sky X -ray image constructed from the 2.5 year data of the MAXI X -ray CCD Camera (or Solid -state Slit Camera, SSC). SSC is sensitive to \"soft\" X -rays, which is invisible to the other MAXI camera, GSC. Several extended regions are seen in the SSC image (right panel), but not in the GSC image, above. One of the extended region s (enclosed in the rectangle) is the newly discovered hypernova. JAXA image. Full Moon Mt.

Gagarin, The Ioffe Institute for Research in Physics and Technology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Searching for Low -Energy Heavy Nuclei of Solar and Galactic Origin using the PLAstic Track ANalyzer (PLATAN) measures streams of the heavy nuclei of cosmic rays in the Earth's magnetosphere. PLATAN consisted of 5 distinct investigations. P LATAN -IRON Study of the energy spectra of galactic cosmic ray iron nuclei in the energy range 30 -160 MeV/nucleon at various phases of the solar activity cycle. PLATAN -A RGON Study of the anomalous component of cosmic rays (energy spectra of argon ions in the magnetosphere and assessing their charged state with increasing energy). PLATAN -S UN Study of the energy spectra of the iron ions of solar cosmic rays from the most powerful flares in the energy range 30 -160 MeV/nucleon. PLATAN -C OSMIC RAYS Determining the transmission function of particles from Earth's orbit into the magnetosphere and comparing it with simulation ca lculations. PLATAN -ISS Measuring microparticle streams in the environment surrounding the International Space Station (ISS) according to damage, in the form of through -and-through holes in heat shielding placed above a nuclei detector. PLATAN -M chamber#1 during exposure on the surface of the International Space Station. The chamber is in its open, operating position. Roscosmos image. 335 EARTH BENEFITS The results of the experiment will have great importance for answering a number of fundamental questions: the sources of low -energy cosmic ray nuclei, including anomalous component of cosmic ray, and the generation of energetic heavy particles in the sun. S PACE BENEFITS This investigation is applied to new knowledge and not specifically to advances in space exploration. R ESULTS The spectra of galactic cosmic ray iron nuclei and of the iron ions of solar cosmic rays from the most powerful flares in the range 30 -160 MeV/nucleon were measured. The results obtained point to the broad capabilities of the PLATAN unit. This unit made it possible to measure the spect ra of galactic cosmic ray iron nuclei and of iron ions of the most powerful solar cosmic ray flares reliably and with a high -energy resolution, which is extremely crucial to compare the results of measurements with theoretical models. The results of PLATAN together with those of a number of experiments on orbiting stations made it possible to discover the particular features of nuclei spectra and to identify the systematic methodological differences when measuring particle streams in space using different e quipment. Microparticle streams in the environment surrounding the ISS, micrometeoroids, and orbital debris, caused damage to heat shielding placed above a nuclei detector. The total spectrum of the diameters of through -and-through holes caused by microparticle penetration in heat shielding film was measured. The spectrum measured was compared with simulation calculations. The majority of microparticles passing through the heat shielding film remained in the top layer of the detector (Lavsan). However, a un ique event was noted: a microparticle punctured a steel frame of the chamber 0.5 -mm thick. Such events pose a significant hazard for the crew and equipment of orbiting stations, therefore, assessing the probability of such cases is of great value.

Requesting parties (eg, farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers, tribal officials, and educators) directly receive images within 2 days of requests, which helps them improve environmental stewardship. Students and faculty at the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, North Dakota, chiefly built and operate the AgCam. E ARTH BENEFITS Anticipated benefits from AgCam data and information product imagery include nitrogen application maps for efficient fertilizer use, agriculture management zone decision support systems for nutrient an d invasive species management, and rangeland management tools to improve livestock allocation and evaluation. The rapid responsiveness of AgCam imagery may also aid in disaster management applications, such as flood monitoring and wilderness fire mapping. S PACE BENEFITS AgCam is a space -related research project that provides direct benefits from space to the general public. Increasing the relevance of space -related research activities in the daily lives of the general public will benefit all ISS applicatio ns, whether for space or Earth applications. By using AgCam data in support of precision agriculture activities, the public will receive benefits synergistically from 3 different space systems: (1) Earth -observing from the ISS, (2) in -field navigation from the Global Positioning System (GPS), and (3) data delivery via satellite communications. With respect to the educational aspect of the AgCam project, using students to develop and operate AgCam helps train the next generation of scientists and engineers t hat will work on future space -based applications. The Agricultural Camera is installed in the WORF Ground Test Rack. Shown with simultaneous installation of EarthKAM. 338 RESULTS Agricultural Camera (AgCam name used historically from 2005 - 2010, later version known as ISSAC) was originally installed aboard the ISS over the US Lab Window in May 2009. On May 31, 2009, during the first execution of the AgCam TAKE_IMAGE command (which initiates image acquisition), an in- flight anomaly occurred. ISS crew re -secured a loose cable connection, however, the anomaly continued to occur. The anomaly manifested itself as an intermittently random failure to successfully take images. Over the next 5 months, an exten sive troubleshooting and failure analysis effort was undertaken. This effort reached the conclusion that the intermittent random failure was isolated to an internal electronics hardware problem within one AgCam component, the Power/Data Controller (PDC). I SS crew deactivated and stowed the AgCam payload on November 13, 2009. An upgraded sensor was developed and installed that both eliminated the interface problem and significantly improved the science performance of the system by adding a third band to incr ease its spectral resolution. The remainder of the onboard and ground equipment functioned well and has been reused in the new investigation, which is known as the International Space Station Agricultural Camera (ISSAC). This investigation is complete, and no results will be published. Astronaut Michael Barratt, Expedition 19/20 flight engineer, performs Agricultural Camer a setup and activation in the US Laboratory of the International Space Station. 339 COORDINATED AURORAL PHOTOGRAPHY FROM EARTH AND SPACE (AURORA MAX) Research Area: Earth Remote Sensing Expedition(s): 29 and 30 Principal Investigator(s): Ruth Ann Chicoine, Canadian Space Agency, St Hubert, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada RESEARCH OBJECTIVES For Coordinated Aurora Photography from Earth and Space (AuroraMAX), crew members photograph the aurora borealis from the International Space Station (ISS). The photography may be timed with periods of increased solar activity to increase the chances of photographing auroras. This is a public outreach initiative designed to inspire the public to learn more about solar- terrestrial science and how solar activity affects Earth. E ARTH BENEFITS The benefit is to enhance public awareness of the science of the aurora. R ESULTS The AuroraMAX program promoted public interest in science and produced highly valuable science data. It was a public outreach and education initiative with the mission of bringing real - time auroral images to the public from a camera located outside Yellowk nife, Canada. AuroraMAX used a digital All- Sky Imager (ASI) that collected full- color images of the night sky every 6 seconds and transmitted them via satellite Internet to the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) AuroraMAX Web server where they were made instantly available to the public. AuroraMAX was a highly successful outreach program with hundreds of thousands of distinct visitors to the website, thousands of followers on social media, and hundreds of newspaper, magazine, radio, and television spots. AuroraM AX will eventually include real- time, high -resolution, single -lens reflex (SLR) auroral images taken from the ground as well as from the ISS where astronauts will take pictures of the aurora with a handheld SLR. AuroraMAX was one of nearly 40 All -Sky Image rs operating across The Aurora Borealis as photographed from Ea rth. Canadian Space Agency image . 340 North America and integrated its data with the Canadian GeoSpace Monitoring (CGSM) ASI data, which was made available to the space science community through Web and FTP sites. Some of the data from the Time History of Events and Macrosc ale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) and CGSM imagers will eventually be incorporated into the AuroraMAX system to maximize viewing opportunities. This investigation is complete and all results are published. Auroral photography from the International Space Station, like this image from the crew of Expedition 23, provides valuable information about the structure and profiling of auroras as well as captivating the public's imagination. NASA image. 341 CREW EARTH OBSERVATIONS (CEO) Research Area: Earth Remote Sensing Expedition(s): 1-ongoing Principal Investigator(s): Susan Runco, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES In Crew Earth Observations (CEO), the crew on the International Space Station (ISS) photograph natural and human -made events on Earth. The photographs record the Earth's surface changes over time, along with dynamic events such as storms, floods, fires, and volcanic eruptions. These images provide researchers on Earth with key data to understand the planet from the perspective of the low -Earth Orbit. E ARTH BENEFITS Earth observations from human spaceflight serve as a unique record of environmental changes on Earth. These photographs provide valuable information that allows a better understanding of the planet from many perspectives. Short - and long -term events documented include hurricanes, floods, fires, volcanic eruptions, climate change, agricultural development, forest fires, urban sprawl, and pollution. S PACE BENEFITS The imagery captured by astronauts during long -duration missions provide insight for planetary surveys within our solar system and anomalies that occur in low -Earth orbit. R ESULTS ISS provides a unique opportunity to capture a variety of sites on Earth by providing repeated overflight passes of the Earth with different lighting and viewing angles. Through CEO, ISS crew members share their view of the Earth with the public and take pictures of some of the most dramatic examples of change on the Earth's surface. These sites have included major deltas in South and East Asia, coral reefs, cities, alpine glaciers, volcanoes, and features on Earth, such as impact craters, that are analogs to structures on other planets. An Expedition 20 crew member photographed Sarychev Peak Volcano, in Russia's Kuril Islands, during the early stages of eruption on June 12, 2009. This detailed photograph is exciting to volcanologists because it captures several phenomena that occur during the earliest stages of an explosive volcanic eruption. 342 From Expedition 1 through March 2013, ISS crew members took more than 1 163 543 images of Earth, more than half of the total number of images taken from orbit by astronauts since the first Mercury missions. Scientists and the public around the world have access to CEO images captured by astronauts on ISS through the Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth website ( http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/ ). Between 400,000 and 1,000, 000 digital photographs of Earth taken from the CEO collection are downloaded by the public each month. The website also features an Image of the Week and searchable access to all the photographs. Scientific analyses using CEO data have been published in scientific journals in a wide variety of disciplines. PUBLICATION (S) Jehl A, Farges T, Blanc E.

International Space Station crew members photograph polar phenomena including icebergs, auroras, and mesospheric clouds in response to daily correspondence from the scientists on the ground. E ARTH BENEFITS Data collected by CEO -IPY will be used by an international collaboration of scientists to determine how the Polar Regions have changed over the past 125 years and might help to explain atmospheric phenomena such as Polar Mesospheric Clouds. The blueprint the data creates will be used to determine the changes in the Polar Regions in the future. The data gathered will also be used as an educational tool for teachers and students worldwide. S PACE BENEFITS Observations that are made from Earth's orbit create the model for planetary exploration observ ations on future long -duration missions. R ESULTS ISS crew members successfully documented the break -up of large tabular icebergs that calved from the Antarctic ice shelves and drifted northward into the South Atlantic Ocean. Researchers from the National Snow and Shows the regional view of Iceberg A22A, also known as 'Amigosberg', and a much more detailed image of ice breakup along the margin (white box and inset). The images were taken as part of the International Space Station support of the International Polar Year, initiated by astronaut Don Pettit, and implemented through the Crew Earth Observations payload. Layers of Earth's atmosphere, brightly colored as the sun rises over central Asia, and Polar Mes ospheric Clouds are featured in this image photographed by an Expedition 17 crew member. The image was acquired in support of International Polar Year research. 346 Ice Data Center used the imagery from the ISS to examine surface features, including ice margins, cracks, and surface melt water ponds to better understand the mechanisms and timing of iceberg breakup. Large Tabular Icebergs can be used to model b reakups of the Antarctic ice shelf. Several sequences of polar mesospheric clouds were observed and documented by the ISS crews, and imagery of auroras from the ISS and shuttle were collected simultaneously with data from ground stations and meteorological satellites. Some of the data were published and served to the public via NASA's Earth Observatory website (http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov ). P UBLICATION (S) Scambos T, Ross R, Bauer R, et al.

Each scene covers an area of about 30 miles by 125 miles, which captures features like river outflow plumes or algae blooms, and lets scientists do environmental characterizatio n of coastal regions. E ARTH BENEFITS The HICO camera can study the ocean's depth, shallow sea floor, water visibility and chlorophyll content, which indicates the presence of microscopic species of plankton. Improved understanding of these ocean characteristics is important for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, which may need to move ships quickly in shallow or murky waters. HICO data can also be used to monitor w ater quality, which could help the Environmental Protection Agency and other civilian researchers studying coastal ecosystems. S PACE BENEFITS HICO is part of a larger experiment called HICO and RAIDS Experiment Payload (HREP) that combines HICO and the Remote Atmospheric and Ionospheric Detection System (RAIDS). Imagery captured during the experiment's long duration will provide new data about h ow sunlight, cloud cover, and different viewing angles can affect images taken in low -Earth orbit. R ESULTS HICO has been operating since September 25, 2009 aboard the ISS. Over 1 700 pictures were collected from HICO in the first year of operation. These images have been used to characterize a variety of optical conditions of ocean waters, such as chlorophyll concentrations, colored dissolved organic matter concentrations, suspended sediment concentrations, and water depth. Image targets have included the Yellow Sea near South Korea, to determine the depth of shallow mud flats and channels, and the Florida Keys, to demonstrate chlorophyll concentrations, dissolved organic matter and suspended sediment concentrations, water A HICO image taken over the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay on October 7, 2009. NASA image. 350 depth, and bottom information. In 2010, HICO images were used to observe chlorophyll- a concentrations in the Azov Sea, Russia. Model estimates of chlorophyll- a concentrations derived from HICO images were in close agreement with chlorophyll- a concentration measurements taken from actual samples. This verified HICO's ability to estimate chlorophyll- a concentrations in turbid waters in real -time. Data from HICO was also used to characterize the oil spill resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion on April 20, 2010. HICO collecte d data from targets around the explosion site and in the nearby marshlands of Louisiana and Mississippi. The results from HICO identified uncontaminated water and oil/water mixture, as well as strands of emulsified oil. Results from HICO will be used in the management of both inland and coasta l aquatic ecosystems, for planning and executing operations from humanitarian relief to military actions, and for identification of oil spilled from ruptured oil pipes.

Combined with satellite images, the collection provides scientists with crucial information in the field of Earth observation on clouds, desertification, deforestation, and much more. R ESULTS Unfortunately, the photo sessions in orbit did not manage to produce images of good enough quality to assist in the goals of the experiment. This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected. 355 INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AGRICULTUR AL CAMERA (ISSAC) Research Area: Earth Remote Sensing Expedition(s): 27-ongoing Principal Investigator(s): Bruce Smith, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, North Dakota RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The International Space Station Agricultural Camera (ISSAC) takes frequent images, in visible and infrared light, principally of vegetated areas (growing crops, grasslands, forests) in the northern Great Plains region of the United States. The sensor is also being used to study dynamic Earth processes aroun d the world, such as melting glaciers, ecosystem responses to seasonal changes, and human impacts, including rapid -response monitoring of natural disasters. ISSAC was built and is being operated by students and faculty at the University of North Dakota, in Grand Forks, North Dakota. E ARTH BENEFITS The combination of characteristics that ISSAC provides offers a unique data source that allows aspects of agricultural efficiency that are of particular importance to the northern Great Plains to be investigated and improved. More generally, these same capabilities of ISSAC can be applied to scientific study of any areas undergoing rapid ecosystem change, worldwide. Potential targets range from natural systems such as glacier melt and plant phenological transitions, to human impact such as deforestation and urbanization. The rapid responsiveness of ISSAC imagery may also aid in disaster monitoring applications worldwide. S PACE BENEFITS Using students to develop and operate ISSAC helps train the next generation of scientists and engineers who will work on future space -based applications. R ESULTS ISSAC was installed into the Window Observational Research Facility (WORF) on May 13, 2011. Initial ISSAC images showed finer details when compared to Landsat 5 images. Additionally, radiance (measure of the radiation emitted from the Earth's surface) and surface reflectance (fraction of the total radiation falling on a surface that is reflected by that surface) results from ISSAC images were compared with radiance and surface reflectance measurements taken on ISS027E023647 - NASA astronaut Ron Garan, Expedition 27 flight engineer, works with International Space Station (ISS) Agricultural Camera hardware in the Destiny laboratory of the ISS. 356 the ground and found to be in good agreement. In November 2011, ISSAC lost its pointing ability after experiencing a current spike caused by being physically obstructed by another payload, Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students (EarthKAM), which was mounted next to ISSA C. However, ISSAC continued to collect images even without the ability to target specific locations. P UBLICATION (S) Kim HJ, Olsen D, Laguette S.

Sprites are a meteorological phenomenon, which have the appearance of a luminous glow above lightning storms between 50-90 km above the Earth's surface. R ESULTS During 19 hours of ef fective observations, 180 flashes were captured, and several possible sprites were identified, demonstrating the effectiveness of the differentiation method. In addition, during sunset and sunrise when the lower atmosphere is dark, LSO observed the airglow of the secondary ozone maximum at about 90 km modulated by gravity wave activity. At the end of the Odissea mission (2002), LSO observed 60 transitory events with the camera in the visible and near infrared and 13 events with both cameras. The ratio of th e intensities received by both cameras was about 3 to 5%. The event is correlated to lightning activity measured at ground by the Japan Lightning Detection Network. On the LSO data, 15 sprites were observed on a surface of 200x200 km within 19 hours of effective measurements over continents. During these 19 hours, about 1000 lightning occurred, according to LIS statistics. This corresponded to 1 -3 sprites for 100 lightning flashes. This value was in agreement with the values generally given of 1 sprite for 100 to 500 lightning, even if the number of effective observation hours of LSO was still low for reliable statistics. It is necessary to obtain additional measurements to validate these first statistics. First observation of sprite from the nadir by Lightning and Sprite Observations . The color scale indicate the measured intensity 1) Top : filtered camera 2 ) Middle : camera in the visible and near IR, 3) Bottom : ratio of both camera intensities in pe rcent. The event at the right is an intense lightning while both events on the left are sprites. They are differentiated by the ratio of the intensities measured by both cameras, most intense for sprites than for lightning. ESA image. 358 The results obtained up to now are very encouraging. They allow validating the measurement concept, which will be used by the microsatellite TARANIS (Tool for the Analysis of RAdiation from lightNIng and Sprites) submitted to the Myriade microsatellite program of the CNES. Taranis is dedicated to the study of sprites and associated phenomena and to the global analysis of the coupling between the atmosphere, the ionosphere, and the magnetosphere in relation with these phenomena.

Kuznetsov, PhD, NV Pushkov Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Troitsk, Russia Alexander V. Gurevich, PN Lebedev Physical Institute, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Investigating Atmospheric Burst of Gamma- Ray and Optical Emissions During Thunderstorm Activity (Molniya -Gamma) investigation examines high -altitude lightning discharges, specifically the gamma -ray bursts and optica l emissions in the Earth's atmosphere and ionosphere related to storm activity. EARTH BENEFITS The results of the scientific processing of the gamma - ray flash data obtained in the Molniya -Gamma space experiment will be used for the purposes of fundamental geophysics research, such as analyzing the atmospheric gamma- ray burst generation mechanisms and verifying the existing theories of burst generation and correlation with high -altitude lightning discharges, as well as on a practical level, for mapping the gamma-ray emission background levels in the ISS orbit. This is important both for practical applications and for initiating and developing future experiments in this field. S PACE BENEFITS Also of significance is that determining the physical nature, properties, rate of occurrence, and intensity of penetrating radiation could be of interest in terms of flight safety in the thunderstorm atmosphere.

Roscosmos image. 360 RESULTS The Molniya -Gamma investigation results should lead, in addition to explaining the physical nature of high -altitude sprite discharges, to detection in experiments of a new physical phenomenon, runaway electron breakdown. Based on current data, runaway electron breakdown should be an important factor in the entire system of atmospheric thunderstorm processes. Thus, the ISS -based investigation, in combination with a wide range of RF observations, including those using radio interferometers and radar, will facilitate significant advances in our knowledge of the processes occurring in the atmosphere during thunderstorms, as well as their correlation with events in the ionosphere. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. 361 STUDY OF THE ELECTRODYNAMIC INTERACTION PROCESSES IN THE EARTH 'S ATMOSPHERE , IONOSPHERE , AND MAGNETOSPHERE USING THE -3 Area: Remote Sensing Principal Investigator(s): Vladimir D.

EARTH BENEFITS The main emphasis while preparing and performing the Molniya -S experiment was placed on studying the spatial and temporal characteristics of strong electrical discharges and their relation with the structure of thunderstorm cells to refine the physics of interactions with the electromagnetic radiation environment cre ated by high -energy thunderstorm discharges. The assessment of the data obtained will be used for refining the transfer mechanism of energy and disturbances in a unified system consisting of lithosphere, atmosphere, ionosphere, and magnetosphere. This approach is necessary for developing a unified thermodynamic model of the geophysical environments in the near -Earth space. S PACE BENEFITS Also of significance is that determining the physical nature, properties, rate of occurrence, and intensity of penetrati ng radiation could be of interest in terms of flight safety in the thunderstorm atmosphere. -3 Videophotometric Camera installed on a window in the ISS RS Service Modul e.

One of the main requirements for such experiments is high sensitivity of equipment, high temporal and spatial resolution, integration of optical and radio -physics methods, and the use of terrestrial, aircraft, balloon, and satellite -based measuring platforms. Based on the experiment results, the equipment as described here has been verified for future research of the processes associated with lightning discharge ( Belyaev 200 7, 2008).

From the International Space Station (ISS) altitude, the instrument detects a weak submillimeter electromagnetic wave that is emitted from atmospheric molecules as a \"radiance spectrum.\" The spectra are analyzed with algorit hms so that the amounts of several kinds of atmospheric molecules on various altitudes are calculated. E ARTH BENEFIT The global distributions of ozone and related atmospheric constituents (eg, HCl, ClO and BrO) monitored from SMILES observation data with high resolution. The distribution of these species vary during the 24 -hour day/night cycle on Earth, and SMILES can be observed, something previously not possible in such detail. The highly sensitive observations of SMILES will help to gain a better unders tanding of processes controlling the stratospheric ozone chemistry, and those related to climate change. S PACE BENEFIT The technologies of the cryogenic system used in SMILES to provide cooling for the scientific instruments will be used in future space science programs. R ESULTS SMILES performed atmospheric observation of Earth for 6 months from October 12, 2009, to April 21, 2010. D ue to a failure of the local oscillator component, the observation period was terminated. However, SMILES obtained sub - millimeter spectrum data with extremely low noise, and the instrument demonstrated its high potential for minor atmospheric constituent observations in the middle atmosphere. For example, SMILES data revealed anomalous distribution of stratospheric ozone in tropic regions from autumn of 2009 to spring of 2010. In January of 2010, ozone depletion in the arctic (caused by the same mechanism as the antarctic ozone hole) was observ ed based upon SMILES data of ozone and chlorine compounds. Detailed comparisons with previous ground -based and spaceborne experiment data revealed that SMILES data quality is comparable or more high -precision than previous methods. This conclusion is also based upon comparisons with the multiple atmospheric numerical models. For example, diurnal variations of stratospheric ozone was revealed by SMILES data by Sample of global distribution of ozone, HCl and ClO on certain altitude in stratosphere, which were measured with SMILES instrument. It measures electromagnetic wave emitted from atmospheric molecules on various altitude. Vertical distributions of such molecules are retrieved from the submillimeter spectra.

Alpatov, Fedorov Institute of Applied Geophysics, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Observation, in the Near -IR Range of the Spectrum, of Wave Disturbances in the Middle Atmosphere (Volny) records and maps wave processes in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere of Earth's atmosphere. A component of the complex problem of climate cha nge on Earth is the problem of mechanisms by which the various layers of the atmosphere interact. E ARTH BENEFITS Volny studies the links between perturbations of density in the lower thermosphere and processes taking place beneath the surface of the Earth (earthquakes), on the Earth's surface (tsunamis, explosions, fires, launches of aerospace technology), and in the troposphere (storms, typhoons, tornados). SPACE BENEFITS This investigation is applied to new knowledge and not specifically to advances in space exploration. R ESULTS Volny confirmed a previously stated hypothesis on the existence, at an altitude of about 90 km in the vicinity of the solar terminator, of a bright, emissive layer that emits in the atmospheric band (0,0) of molecular oxygen (762\u00b15 nm). Mathematical proces sing of digital images of the emissive layer showed the possibility of obtaining the spectral characteristics of a group of atmospheric internal gravity waves passing through this emissive layer from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere. Thus, the means of observing the atmospheric band (0,0) of molecular oxygen from the ISS that was developed and implemented in the Volny experiment holds promise for use in a system of global monitoring of climate changes.

Galper, National Nuclear Research University, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES : Monitoring Seismic Effects \u2014Bursts of High -Energy Particles in Near -Earth Space (Vsplesk) studies seismo -magnetospheric phenomena that were discovered in recent years and are linked to a correlative dependence between the dynamics of fluxes of high- energy, charged particles in near -Earth space and seismic activity. One of the most significant directions for geophysical experiments today is the search for credible and sufficiently reliable signs of catastrophic seismic phenomena that will lead to a future method for predicting earthquakes and other emergency situations. E ARTH BENEFITS Vsplesk will lead to developments in approache s to predicting seismic activity and individual powerful earthquakes using nuclear -physics methods and space technologies. It will also develop empirical models (both stationary and mobile) of the radiation situation in near -Earth space. S PACE BENEFITS Vsplesk will lead to developments in modern technologies to be used in the development and creation of scientific equipment that operates outside the pressurized volume and is designed to conduct long -term space experiments. R ESULTS Statistics on bursts of high -energy particles, collected from August 2008 through 2011 during the course of the Vsplesk experiment, together with data on particle bursts obtained from the Arina experiment on the Resurs -DK1 satellite, allowed the first detailed research on the geographic distribution of particle bursts. A detailed map of the geographic distribution of particle bursts is given in the figure above. Geographic distribution of high -energy charged particle bursts (light circles and squares with a black dot in the center). Dark lines indicate tectonic faults. Squares with a black dot in the center indicate particle bursts found along fault lines . Roscosmos image. 369 Correlative analysis for each of the particle bursts and seismic events was identified in the experiment. It considered the coincidence of L -coordinates of genetically linked particle bursts and earthquakes with a time shift of 1 -5 hours in -between, identified 8 particle bursts that were potential candidates for harbingers of earthquakes with a magnitude of more than 4 on the Richter scale. It was discovered that along with particle bursts observed at various longitudes of perturbed L - shells, there are particle bursts grouped along tectonic fault lines; that is, right in the zones of local perturbations of the Earth's radiation belt. The correlative analysis performed on the spatial and temporal characteristics of recorded particle bursts and on the data for seismic events showed in sufficient statistics that approximately 15% of particle bursts may be seismic in nature. T hey are localized in the L -shells of earthquakes and precede earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4 by several hours.

The SOLACES instrument has been active since 2008, being located on the SOLAR facility on the external surface of the European Columbus Laboratory. EARTH AND SPACE BENEFITS The awareness of the environment of the Earth and of the sun radiation level and spectrum is of importance to both Earth - based and space -borne systems as well as to advanced studies on climate. Monitoring the sun radiation outside of the Earth atmosphere over a large electromagnetic spect rum and correlating with parallel observations with other space missions and on ground helps provide the accurate data required to support predictive models and anticipate on the influence of sun radiation on our environment. R ESULTS The period of the solar Extreme -UV minimum between solar cycles 23 and 24 continued over an unexpected long period (roughly 2 years instead of 1 around 2008 -2009 timeframe) with SOLACES showing a distinct minimum in August/November 2009. During the beginning of solar cycle 24 measurements were showing abnormally low characteristics of the EUV spe ctral irradiance. The maximum of the solar cycle was also predicted for late 2013. However, in SOLACES measurements up to now, the maximum of the Solar cycle appeared in late 2011. After that, the solar cycle subsided and is stagnating at a lower level, th ough measurements continue, which does not exclude another strong increase of solar activity within the near future. Data from the SOLAR facility on the International Space Station together with data from the Solar EUV Experiment (SEE) aboard the NASA TIM ED satellite (which measures Solar spectra in the wavelength range from 0.1 nm to about 200 nm) have helped to confirm the improvement in the EUV -TEC model. SOLACES has been measuring the short -wavelength solar EUV irradiance Sun monitoring on the Exter nal Payload Facility of Columbus - SOLar Auto-Calibrating EUV/UV Spectrophotometers external facility mounted outside the Columbus module.

RESULTS SOLAR facility measurements were the first ones with in -orbit recalibration capability for the total spectral range of interest. In the extreme UV (EUV) spectral range, SolACES used ionization chambers that are considered a primary detector standard. Within SOLSPEC, several sources allowed checking instrument stability. In August/September 2009 period, the EUV data showed a distinct minimum during the extended solar minimum period between solar cycles 23 (beginning in May 1996 and ending in January 2008 ) and 24 (from January 2008 until now, wit h several irregularities in terms of sun behavior), while at UV wavelengths this minimum appeared before. Using SolACES, SOLSPEC, and SOLSTICE SSI to fill the spectral gap between the 2 instruments, 2 spectra SOLAR 1 and SOLAR 2 have been developed, which differ between 1100 and 2400 nm by using ATLAS 3. In this range, SOLAR 2 showed a lower SSI reaching 10% at 1 700 nm. An exhaustive investigation has been carried to understand this difference (though currently no explanation has been found). An important aspect of SSI measurements was the validation/comparison with the theoretical SOLAR consists of 3 complementary instruments: SOlar Variable and Irradiance Monitor (SOVIM ) covers the near -ultraviolet, visible and thermal -infrared of the spectrum; SOLar Auto-Calibrating Extreme UV/UV Spectrophotometers (Sol-ACES) measures and SOLar SPECtral Irradiance measurements (SOLSPEC ) covers the 180 - ,000 nm wa velength range. ESA image. 373 approach. The numerical COde for Solar Irradiance ( COSI model) has been used. Several comparisons between ATLAS 3, SOLAR, WHI, and COSI theoretical spectrum showed an overall agreement taking into account the uncertainties of these spectra. However, at some small wavelength domains, differences (expressed in terms of percentages) were above the mean. These cases were explained either by a low signal to noise ratio, instrument unce rtainties, and limitation in lines list to simulate the solar spectrum. These spectra were used to derive the temperature of the solar atmosphere. Up to 1 100 nm, these temperatures were in agreement within 50 K. Above 1 100 K, measured spectra provided co nsistent temperature, however, greater than the COSI temperature and reaching 200 K. At the contrary, SOLAR 2 spectrum provided temperature smaller by 400 K than the temperature derived from the other experimental spectra. P UBLICATION (S) Thuillier MG, Bolsee D, Schmidtke G, et al .

SOVIM measures the total and spectral solar irradiance and calibration of TSI. The investigation studies the irradiance of the sun, with high precision and high stability. R ESULTS The SOVIM package was composed of 3 PMO6 absolute radiometers, 2 sunphotometers, 1 pointing sensor (TASS), and 1 DIARAD radiometer. This summary came from the DIARAD/SOVIM TSI results (and their associated uncertainties). Concerning the acquired data, the TSI value from DIARAD/SOVIM for 3 days of measurements (June 13, 14 and 15 of 2008) was 1364.50 \u00b1 1.38 W m -2 (watt per square meter) for the left channel and 1364.75 \u00b1 1.38 W m-2 for the right channel. The uncertainty of \u00b11.38 W m-2 was obtained when the individual contributions of the instrument equation were added. If they were combined in quadrature, the uncertainty was around \u00b10.497 W m-2. The difference between the independent left and right channel measurements as low as 0.25 W m-2, which is within the absolute uncertainty limit of \u00b11.38 W m-2 (Total) and \u00b10.497 W m-2 (RSS). Although DIARAD/SOVIM TSI measurements were 1.2 W m-2 lower than DIARAD/ VIRGO TSI value, it was still 4 W m-2 higher than TIM/ SORCE TSI measurements.

Ruzhin, PhD, NV Pushkov Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation of the Russian Academy of Sciences , Troitsk, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Altering the Ionosphere by Pulsed Plasma Sources (Impuls Stage 1) i nvestigation obtains data on the ionospheric disturbances and sources of low-frequency waves generated in the ionosphere upon injection of pulsed plasma streams from an orbital station, as well as data on the effect of artificially stimulated ionosphere he terogeneity regions and artificial plasma generations on the propagation of high- and low- frequency radio waves. D ISTURBANCE Studies the feasibility of using pulsed plasma injectors as sources of ionospheric disturbances and low - frequency electromagnetic waves. I NJECTOR Studies the space environment disturbances caused by artificial plasma streams from the ISS. GENERATION OF ARTIFICIAL PLASMA Studies the impact of artificial plasma formations on the propagation of high - and low - frequency radio waves. E ARTH BENEFITS Impuls Stage 1 results will be used in the fields of applied geophysics, ecology, and radio comm unications. S PACE BENEFITS Supporting the background electro -physical parameters monitoring and investigation in the ISS near- surface areas under various station flight conditions and attitudes and in the ISS near - surface areas during various active experiments on the station. R ESULTS The experiment has produced the electro -physical parameters measurements obtained in the ISS RS SM near -surface areas on different days and in different orbits, including the period of flying from the equator point in one orbit to the equator point in the next orbit. General View of th e Pulsed Plasma Injector with Electro -physical Parameter Monitoring System Sensors on the ISS . Roscosmos image . 376 The electrical -field parameter measurements acquired in the ISS RS SM near- surface areas show significant strength variations in the direct and alternating components of the electrical field, depending on the station attitude relative to the orbital velocity vector and on the light/dark conditions. The increases (in absolute values) that were recorded in the electrical parameters in some sections of orbit and sometimes exceeded the telemetry range require special study in order to identify the sources of such variations. The experiment has demonstrated that since the ISS operates in the ionosphere environment with continuously changing properties, the electro -physical parameters study determines the point in time and space when and where the electromagnetic background can be of the greatest impact on the operation of radio communication, navigation, and other systems of the station (Ruzhin 2009).

Tverdokhlebova, PhD, Central Research Institute for Machine Building , Korolev, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Observation of the Reflective Characteristics of the Spacecraft Plasma Environment during Engine Firing in Space Using Ground - Based Instruments (Plazma -Progress) studies the plumes of liquid -propellant engines as they are ionized by the effect of solar radiation and atomic oxygen. As a result, a large -scale and comparatively dense plasma environment occurs around the International Spa ce Station (ISS). This plasma environment changes the radiophysical properties of the environment and its dimensions correspond to the ISS dimensions. E ARTH BENEFITS The results of Plazma -Progress answers contemporary questions about space research, including the physics of near - Earth space, the ionosphere and atmosphere, the study of solar -terrestrial links, the development of research methods, and equipment in the field of geophys ics. S PACE BENEFITS Data on small- scale irregularities that form in the near- spacecraft area when liquid -propellant engines are fired will be used in studies of the ISS plasma environment and the electrical discharge situation on the station's exterior surface. R ESULTS During the Plazma- Progress space experiment, using the only incoherent scatter radar in Russia measurements were taken of the parameters of the ionospheric plasma environment and the reflective characteristics of the Progress cargo transpor t vehicle when engines were and were not firing. Computer and theoretical analysis was performed of the data obtained to determine the parameters of the large -scale plasma formations that formed during Progress cargo transport vehicle liquid -propellant eng ine firing. Another comparative analysis was performed of the ISS and Progress cargo transport vehicle's reflective characteristics when the liquid - propellant engines were and were not firing. Finally, comparative analysis was performed of the ionospheric parameters, taken on a digital ionospheric recorder, in areas the Progress cargo transport vehicle flew through while engines were and were not firing.

Relaksatsiya -Spektr (Relaxation - Spectrum) Hyperspectral monitoring of the Earth's atmosphere and the \"atmosphere -surface of the Earth\" system in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared portions of the spect rum. E ARTH BENEFITS The results of system and exploratory studies on natural and anthropogenous global phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere and ionosphere can be used for: development of future Earth remote -sensing spacecraft ; development of new approaches to forecasting of earthquakes and other catastrophic phenomena ; development of advanced methods for Earth The Fialka -MV-Kosmos Multispectral system aboard the ISS RS. Roscosmos image 381 hyperspectral monitoring; collection data about weather and gas composition of the atmosphere and ionosphere; and collection data conc erning impacts of space activities on the Earth's atmosphere and ionosphere (interaction of space vehicles with the atmosphere and ionosphere). RESULTS Relaksatsya -Vykhlop Global areas of interaction between rocket engine exhausts (installed on Progress and Soyuz -TMA spacecraft) and the upper rarefied atmosphere of the Earth (H ~ 350 to 400 km) were disclosed and studied; through analysis of brightness fields, fundamental constants of hypervelocity oxygen atoms interaction with components of engine exhausts were revealed. It was found that during onboard engine units operations one can observe bright UV glow of the own ISS atmosphere in OH molecular bands related to decay and photolysis of the water vapor contained in engine exhaust gas . Relaksatsya -UF-Vkhod Unique in situ UV experimental data about spatial structure and intensity of the emission spectrum from spacecraft plasma formations and transport vehicle fragments during hypersonic reentry into the atmosphere throughout the entire descent trajectory, which includes entering and fragmentation of a Soyuz -TMA and a European cargo vehicle ATV Jules Verne were obtained. Relaksatsya -Sten d A global glow of the Earth upper atmosphere at altitudes of about 100 to 140 km in the southern and northern hemispheres was discovered under impact of powerful radiofrequency emission from the Earth to the Earth's ionosphere and atmosphere \u2014a probable mechanism of modification of the atmosphere is actuation of Alfven oscillations in the ionosphere. Relaksatsya -Groza For the first time in the UV spectrum, an investigation researched spatio -temporal and power budget of global thunderstorm phenomena in upper Earth's atmosphere ( elves, sprites, jets, etc), as well as new, previously unknown data about their origin and development were received over the equatorial Africa. Relaksatsya -Spektr According to systematic UV -spectrum measurements of brightness in the upper atmosphere, it was revealed the phenomenon of bifurcation of the high -altitude limb at altitudes of about 100 km and , respectively , concentration of atomic oxygen layer over the seismically active area Processed video frame of exhaust jets from docking and orientation engine, 2010.

SEDA -AP instruments include 5 radiation and particle monitors , an electronic device performance monitor , a micro-particles capturer, and a space environment exposure device . Characterizing and understanding the environment around space vehicles through this unique combination of instruments allows researchers to develop and design more robust, safe, and protective spacecrafts in the future. EARTH BENEFIT It is possible to contribute to safety operation of broadcasting, com munication, and the car navigation system satellite by using the space environment data measured by SEDA- AP. Additionally SEDA- AP provides support for space weather forecasting and other fields in atmospheric physics. S PACE BENEFIT The space environment is used to troubleshoot the satellite anomalies caused by radiation and the radiation dose control of the crews aboard the ISS. RESULTS SEDA- AP gathered valuable data of the space environment at an altitude of 400 km over a course of 3 years. This data will improve models used for the estimation of radiation hardiness of satellite exterior desi gn and minimize the radiation dose during a solar flare. The space environment data is also useful for the trouble shooting of satellite anomalies caused by radiation as well as determining dose control of astronauts in the space station. New findings fr om SEDA- AP are obtained by analysis of neutron measurements, such as understating the acceleration mechanisms of the solar flare particle and the evaluation of neutron leakage from the terrestrial atmosphere which is called CRAND (Cosmic Ray Arbedo Neutron Decay). Analysis of this data is ongoing. In this solar cycle 24, the solar activity is very low, however, solar activity has been increasing in recent years, and is expected to increase S127E008244 - Close -up view of Kibo arm moving Space Environment Data Acquisition Attached Payload.

In low -Earth orbit, interaction with both high - energy particles in space and the dominant neutral gas, atomic oxygen, causes performance problems. The SM/MPAC and SEED experiment involves exposing materials to the space environment, and returning them to Earth for analysis, in order to provide an understanding of the effects of the space environment on materials. E ARTH BENEFIT The MPAC investigation captures objects to determine the existence of original extraterrestrial objects with unknown mineralogical character. It can offer clues to help understand what happened in the early stages of the birth of the solar system. The SEED investigation tests new materials to determine survivability in the space environment. S PACE BENEFIT The MPAC investigation collects micro particle data, which includes flux, size, energy, and components. The SEED investigation examines the actual de gradation data for space material (polymeric materials, paint, adhesives, bearings, compound material, etc.) from space radiation, atomic oxygen, and from where UV is obtained. A considerable improvement in developing space material protection technology i s expected. R ESULTS SM/MPAC and SEED revealed the space environment and its effects after periods of 1, 2, and 4 years of space exposure in the same position. Three identical Service Module/Micro-Particles Capturer and Space Environment Exposure Device (SM/MPAC and SEED ) components were installed on the Russian Service Module (SM) , Zvezda in October 2001. On August 26, 2002, the first unit of SM/MPAC and SEED, MPAC and SEED #1, was retrieved by EVA after 315 days of in-orbit exposure. Subsequently, MPAC and SEED #2 was retrieved on February 26, 2004, (after 865 days) and MPAC and SEED #3 on August 18, 2005 (after 1 ,403 days). JAXA image. 387 In addition, SM/MPAC and SEED discovered new extraterrestrial objects with a mineralogical characteristic, which was named \"Hoshi,\" meaning \"star\" in Japanese. The object consists of a micro -particle, the origin of which relates to interplanetary dust and micrometeorites. It is also characterized by an unprecedented formation and mineral composition and represents a world -first discovery of this object. SEED consists of 28 samples, in which the actual degradation data of these materials were acquired. In addition, a nalysis of AO fluence samples indicated that substantial contamination had occurred. The contaminant was sufficiently extensive to protect the surface of the AO fluence monitor sample from erosion, while the wake samples and holders were found to be unifo rmly covered with molecular contamination and had numerous colored spots . Surface analysis ( X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy [XPS] depth profiles ) showed the contaminant thicknesses depended on exposure duration. PUBLICATION (S) Kimoto Y, Ishizawa J, Shimamura H.

Station educational activities have had a positive impact on thousands of students by involving them in station research, and by using the stati on to teach them the science and engineering that are behind space exploration. 390 AGROSPACE EXPERIMENTS SUITE (AES), TWO INVESTIGATIONS Research Area: Classroom Versions of ISS Investigations Expedition(s): 10 and 11 Principal Investigator: Rome, Italy RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Agrospace Experiments Suite (AES) consists of 2 separate investigations: Seedlings and Space Beans for Students. Seedlings evaluates the feasibility of producing vegetable (rocket seeds) sprouts in space for food purposes and to study the influence of weightlessness on germination, growth, and the nutritional quality of sprouts. Space Beans for Students allows students in classrooms on Eart h to germinate beans at the same time as being germinated by astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS). R ESULTS On return to Earth, the plastic bags and seedlings were sent for quality analysis (eg, vitamin C, carbohydrates, nitrates, antioxidants). Producing sprouts directly during space missions may represent an interesting opportunity to offer high- quality fresh ready -to-eat food to the astronauts. The goal of this work was to compare, in terms of growth and nutritional quality, rocket ( Eruca sativa Mill) seedlings grown in the International Space Station during the ENEIDE mission (Soyuz 10S/9S exchange) with those grown in a ground -based experiment (in presence and absence of clinorotation). The rocket seedlings obtained from the space -experiment were thinner and more elongated than those obtained in the ground -based experiment. Cotyledons were often closed in the seedlings grown in the space experiment. Quantitative (germination, fresh, and dry weight) and qualitative (glucose, fructose, sucrose, and starch) traits of rocket seedlings were negatively affected by microgravity, especially those recorded on seedlings grown und er real microgravity conditions. The total chlorophyll and carotenoids of seedlings obtained in the space experiment were strongly reduced in comparison to those obtained in the ground- based experiment (presence and absence of clinorotation). The results s howed that it is possible to produce rocket seedlings in the ISS; however, further studies are needed to define the optimal environmental conditions for producing rocket seedlings with high nutritional value.

ELEGANS AND SEED GERMINATION (CSI-01), TWO INVESTIGATIONS Research Area: Classroom Versions of ISS Investigations Expedition(s): 14-15 Principal Investigator(s): Louis S. Stodieck, PhD, University of Colorado, BioServe Space Technologies, Boulder, Colorado RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus Science Insert - 01 (CSI -01) is comprised of 2 educational experiments utilized by middle school students in the Unites States and Malaysia. One experiment examines seed germination in microgravity including gravitropism (plant growth towards gravity) and phototropism (plant growth towards light). The second experiment examines how microgravity affects the model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans , a small nematode worm. Thousands of students began participating in th e experiments in February 2007. E ARTH BENEFITS CSI-01 provides a unique educational opportunity to encourage and inspire students to pursue careers in the scientific and technical fields by participating in near real- time research activities on the ISS. S PACE BENEFITS Influences children to continue their education in the science, technology, engineering, and math areas (STEM) and pursue related careers. This type of experiment promotes the next generation of scientists, engineers, and crew members for the space program. In addition, scientific research with the CHab and GH ab experiments is expected to provide a greater understanding of the effects of spaceflight on biological organisms.

Williams, Expeditions 14 and 15 flight engineer, activating the alfalfa seed in the G -Hab for the CSI -01 investigation. 393 RESULTS CSI-01 was the first in a series of experiments targeting students with an interactive approach to increase Science, Technology, E ngineering, and Mathematics (STEM) interest. More than 5,000 students participated in the CSI -01 experiments by observing differences detected between C. elegans grown in classrooms and in -flight. Students also observed the alterations in seed germination rates along with the seed's ability to orient itself in space and ground samples (Hoehn 2007). The first experiment associated with CSI -01 examined the long term growth of C. elegans in space by observing biological changes in response to radiation and by comparing gene expression over multiple generations grown in space. Results showed C. elegans exhibit normal development and movements when fed with C. elegans Maintenance Medium (CeMM). CeMM was previously proven to be a sufficient food source aboard STS -107 (Szewczyk 2005). Although in both humans and C. elegans decreased production of myosin is observed while in space, C. elegans displayed normal movements when sufficiently fed. This finding suggests the decrease in muscular function is adaptive to micro gravity, possibly relating this to human cardiac, skeletal, and vascular muscles. Because movement decline was not detected throughout the entire 12 generations observed, this also suggests there may be a muscular decline plateau (Oczypok 2012).

Stodieck, PhD, University of Colorado, BioServe Space Technologies, Boulder, Colorado RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus Science Insert - 02 (CSI -02) is an educational payload designed to interest middle school students in science, technolog y, engineering, and math (STEM) by participating in near real -time research conducted aboard the ISS. Students observe 4 experiments through data and imagery downlinked and distributed directly into the classroom via the Internet. The first experiment exam ines seed germination and plant development in microgravity. The second experiment examines yeast cells adaptation to the space environment. The third experiment examines plant cell cultures and the fourth is a silicate garden. The experiments conducted fo r CSI -02 are designed primarily to meet education objectives; however, to the maximum extent possible, meaningful scientific research is conducted to generate new knowledge into gravity - dependent biological processes and to support future plans for human s pace exploration. CSI -02 has the potential to impact over 15 ,000 middle school and high school students. E ARTH BENEFITS CSI-02 provides a unique educational opportunity to encourage students to pursue careers in the scientific and technical fields. Approx imately 15 ,000 students conduct ground controls and observe these experiments while aboard the ISS, influencing these students to further their education in STEM fields. S PACE BENEFITS This influences children to continue their education in STEM areas and pursue related careers. It promotes education of the next generation of scientists, engineers, and crew members for the space program. In addition, scientific research with the experiments is expected to provide a greater understanding of the effects of s paceflight on different biological systems, which could support future plans for the human exploration of the solar system. The above image shows the nickel sulfate silicate garden grown duriThe above image shows the nickel sulfate silicate garden grown during Expedition 17. BioServe Space Technologies image , University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado. 395 RESULTS CSI-02 consisted of 4 unique experiments, including the \"Silicate Garden.\" Osmotic silicate gardens grow when a solid of a metal- ion salt is placed into a sodium silicate solution. As the salt begins to dissolve into the silicate, it develops a colloidal semi- permeable membrane of metal silicate. This investigation examined the growth of several types of silicate gardens when gravity forces were removed. Four sodium silicates and nickel sulfate (NiSO4) \u2014were mixed at various concentrations for study abo ard ISS and compared to those grown on Earth using identical sets of reaction chambers. The reaction chambers were positioned in the Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) to capture still and video images of the experiment for downlink to the c ontrol center. In the ground samples, the tubes grew upward regardless of the location of the semi- permeable membrane's initial burst, whereas flight experiments exhibited tubes that grew randomly in all directions (Cartwright 2011). This investigation reached 500 elementary, 3 500 secondary, 5 undergraduate, and 5 graduate students including 30 schools and 40 teachers.

ISS021E028973 - Canadian Space Agency astronaut Robert Thirsk, Expedition 21 flight engineer, works with the new Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus Science Insert 03 (CSI -03) assembly in the Kibo Laboratory of the International Space Station. 397 RESULTS CSI-03 investigated the growth and behavior of spiders and butterflies aboard the ISS during expeditions 18 and 21/22. The experiments were designed to engage students in authentic science investigations and increase their interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) academic areas. During expedition 18, the butterflies did not successfully pupate into adults due to food problems. The orb- weaver spiders, however, thrived in this environment. Students were able to track their web building and feeding activities throughout the expedition. This experiment was successful and laid the groundwork for future sim ilar experiments to engage students. Teachers reported 80% of students expressed interest in science careers following completion of the investigation. On expedition 21/22, CSI -03 allowed students to track morphological, behavioral, and developmental diffe rences from their own in -class butterflies to those aboard the ISS real- time. This experiment was highly publicized by several different media sources including social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. During this expedition, approximately 180, 000 students from all 50 states and 23 countries were able to observe 4 Vanessa cardui (painted lady) butterflies aboard ISS. CSI -03 showed that engaging students with hands -on scientific experiments is effective in increasing conceptual understandings and enthusiasm for science (Moreno 2012).

Levine, PhD, NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida RESEARCH OBJECTIVES On-orbit videotape and photographic images are taken of plant germination and early growth. Imagery is converted to educational videos for the purpose of exciting and engaging students i n science and technology and for motivating and providing professional development for educators. E ARTH BENEFITS Studies such as these could lead to a better understanding of how seeds germinate and grow on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS The goal of Education -SEEDS is to evaluate the growth of space -exposed seeds compared to earth -grown seeds. Another goal is the demonstration of plant growth in space. Food producing plants is necessary when it is impossible to carry enough freeze dried food to last the entire voyage. Another goal of Education -SEEDS is to increase student interest in s cience and space exploration; ie, stimulating enthusiasm in students and teachers for space related education. R ESULTS The Education- SEEDS investigation, which was part of the Jason XI mission, was the first plant experiment to be performed on station. This experiment studied the effects of microgravity and light on the germination of corn and soybean seeds. The corn seedlings that were exposed to light appeared to show phototropism (or growth towards light). The shoots grew toward the light and were gr een, demonstrating chlorophyll synthesis (the creation of the green pigment that is used in photosynthesis). The corn seedlings that were not exposed to light did not turn green and did not grow towards the light. The soybean seedlings grown in the light w ere slightly greener than the seedlings grown in the dark. The phototropic effect was more evident in the corn seedlings than in the soybean seedlings. On Earth, gravity influences the roots of plants to grow in a downward direction (gravitropism). While i n orbit the seedlings grew in a microgravity environment. Whether grown in light or ISS01E5191 - Bill Shepherd tends to a seed pouch during Increment 1. Additional pouches hang off the International Space Station wall above the \"Astronauts at Work\" sign. 401 dark, the corn roots grew in random directions. The roots of the soybean seeds also grew in random directions (Levine 2001). Examination of the seeds after their stay on I SS revealed that the nutritional and epidermal layers of the space exposed seeds were more porous than those of the ground -based control seeds. This might allow nutrients to disperse through the seeds more quickly and explain the faster germination and gro wth rates observed in the space -exposed seeds. A total of 750, 000 students across the United States participated in the experiments, growing corn and soybean seeds in their classrooms to compare their results with the results from the station and participating in live broadcasts.

School children operate identical experiments on the ground as were undertaken on the International Space Station (ISS) in order to witness how foams differ under the influence of gravity compared to Station's weightless environment. This project intends to stimulate the students' curiosity and motivate them towards science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects as well as to bring awareness to the younger generation of the importance of the ISS as a testing bed for future exploration activities in space. R ESULTS As an education activity the experiment was a success with all activities, includ ing the live link, being accomplished. ESA -EPO-Foam -S distributes large numbers of kits to schools in order for students to undertake the same activity in the classroom as undertaken by the astronaut in orbit, and a multi- site live -link event to the ISS in order to present the conclusions of the experiment on the Station to the participating school children and the general public. Recordings were also made available online in order for children/students performing their investigations at a later time to that performed on -board ISS. The investigation observations are supported using footage and observations of terrestrial events. This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected.

Babayevskiy, PhD, Tsiolkovsky Russian State University of Technology, Moscow , Russia R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES Demonstrating the Effect of Restoring the Form of Billets Made of Cellular Polymer Materials (MATI -75) demonstrates the ability of polyurethane foam to restore and lock their shapes, sizes, and the pore structure during heating and cooling in microgravity. E ARTH BENEFITS Graduate students were involved in the creation of the procedures for the MATI -75 investigation. S PACE BENEFITS MATI -75 focuses on 2 areas: character and kinetics of restoring the sizes and shapes of foam samples in microgravity as well as the results of the subsequent studies of their structure and properties on the ground in comparison with the results of a similar ground investigations. The data gained during the investigation can be used during the deve lopment of intelligent composite materials that have shape memory for transforming large -scale space structures. R ESULTS MATI -75 demonstrated the memory of the shape and sizes of a cellular polymer material made of polyurethane foam with a specified type of open porous structure and porosity value in microgravity conditions. An analysis of photographs showed that shape restoration occurred practically the same aboard t he International Space Station (ISS) and in ground conditions. A distortion of the shape of samples was observed both aboard the ISS and in ground conditions due in large measure to a twist appearing in samples with a small cross -section (cylinders with a diameter of 10 mm). The twist of the main axis of samples was 45 \u00b1 5\u00b0. The twist of the shape was explained, most likely, by the uneven heating of the samples, caused by Before shape restoration (top), after shape restoration (bottom). Roscosmos image . 404 the fact that the samples were heated using heating elements, located on the bottom of the case. The convective air thermal currents that occurred were unevenly distributed around the case volume and heat was unevenly transferred to the samples. In connection with this, the development of a method for evenly heating the foam in the case o f their practical use to create transforming structures will be necessary. The degree of restoration of the sizes of the flight samples was slightly less in comparison with the ground samples, which may be explained by the lack of or minimal intensity of t he convective currents during heating of the samples in microgravity conditions. The constituent porosities (opened and closed) of the samples vary in considerably large ranges and depend on both the height and the depth of the layer being used for the stu dies.

Identical experiments are performed on the International Space Station (ISS) and in the classroom to compare mixing oil and water in microgravity to mixing them on Earth. R ESULTS Students (11 -14 years old) carried out this experiment on Earth, and Thomas Reiter did the same in orbit during his long -duration Astrolab mission aboard the ISS. The space section of Oil Emulsion was filmed and downlinked. This experiment aimed to highlight how an oil and water emulsion behaves differently in weightlessness and under gravity conditions. A se aled container holding 2 non -combining fluids, clear oil and ink colored water, was shaken until the 2 fluids were slightly mixed. The fluids' behav ior in space was filmed within defined time slots during a 2 -week period. The data was downlinked and the results were shown in a special children's program on German public television. The different kinds of segregation that occurred during the experiment , in space, and on Earth, could be observed and then explained by the teacher. This experiment can form the basis of further physics lessons (concerning weightlessness, density, and other fluid parameters) and maybe even lessons in other scientific areas. The Oil Emulsion experiment was introduced by DLR and is a co -operation between DLR and the European Space Agency. This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected.

This allows students to experience that science is fun and that the weightless envir onment of space opens new possibilities. R ESULTS Within the Netherlands, some 80 ,000 students participated, representing 15% of the population in the age group of 10 - 14 years old. In addition, another 80 ,000 German pupils, a few local schools in the Moscow -Koroljov area and some in the Dutch A ntilles also participated. Considering these numbers, it can be concluded that Seeds in Space was a very successful educational project and might be considered for future spaceflight missions. The Dutch schoolchildren simultaneously started the Seeds in Space experiment on April 22, 2004 by planting their seeds in a rocket -shaped kit. After 4 days , they compared the growth of their seeds with those of Dutch ESA astronaut Andr\u00e9 Kuipers' aboard the International Space Station. Kuipers opened his \"growing rocket\" during a live video downlink from the International Space Station. The plants in the dark chamber had grown in all directions. In space, the seedlings in the light chamber had grown larger and were greener, and they had all grown towards the same direction \u2014towards the light. The children who participated made conclusions about the experiment. The conclusion of Seeds: light or gravity help plants to know in which direction to grow. In the absence of both, the plants get confused. The result of the Seeds experiment showed school children how scientific research is undertaken, and contributes to space travel in the future.

Taste is part of the curriculum of school children around Europe. By recording a tasting session aboard the International Space Station (ISS), ESA's Human Spaceflight a nd Operations Promotion Office aims to develop an online lesson that educators could use in their classroom. This activity targets pupils aged 10 to 12 years old. R ESULTS ISS Flight Engineer and NASA astronaut Shannon Walker supported the Taste in Space education activity, which took place in the Russian Service Module on November 2, 2010, with the support of NASA astronaut Doug Wheelock. The activity demonstrated to primary school students the differences in the way in which the sense of taste is affected under weightless conditions and on Earth by comparing the results of a blind tasting of 6 different food items on the ground and in space. Video files of the demonstration accounting for almost an hour of material were downlinked to ground. The material w as used to produce ESA educational Web - based material for upper primary school teachers and their students aged 10 -12 years old. The lesson covered topics such as: Different environmental conditions on the ISS (concept of weightlessness) compared to Earth. Eating and drinking on the ISS is done differently, taking into account weightlessness. Food and drink on the ISS need to be prepared differently to conserve/preserve and save on weight. Is our sense of taste affected by any other of our senses, such as smell? Has microgravity conditions had any effect on the food's flavors as compared to when tasted on Earth? Eating is an important part of astronauts living aboard the ISS, therefore, food taste is important (not just for nutrition but psychologic ally). A range of food and drinking products were selected in order to have products with similar consistencies. In addition, only standard available products were chosen in order to avoid specific upload for this activity.

PhD, S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, Korolev, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Creating, Preparing, and Launching Small Spacecraft during Extravehicular Activity (RadioSkaf) uses a decommissioned Orlan spacesuit equipped with a ham radio transmitter and a compact disk containing messages and images from students around the world. After being released during extravehicular activities, the suit will transmit a ham radio signal and then re -enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up. Students and hobbyists from around the world can tune in to the signal to identify the transmitted words and image. T his investigation will not only inspire the next generation of explorers but can help bridge the cultural gap of people around the globe. E ARTH BENEFITS The results obtained during the experiment sessions proved the capacity for student - created space objects with various target applications using recycled components and not requiri ng large material expenditure. During the experiment, sessions were conducted to receive information from the satellite at ham radio stations on the ground, thus confirming the capability to receive data from the International Space Station (ISS) by all ham radio communication stations on the ground located in the area of radio coverage of the microsatellite. SPACE BENEFITS During the experiment, a microsatellite was successfully launched from aboard the ISS during extravehicular activity; microsatellite equipment was also tested experimentally in autonomous flight. Viewing and listening to the data received made it possible to confirm the stability of satellite signal reception on Earth from the ISS. RadioSkaf created using a decommissioned Russian Orlan spacesuit that is outfitted with transmissio n hardware was released during an extravehicular activity. Roscosmos image. 411 RESULTS During the RadioSkaf experiment, data was obtained for the development of future projects to launch similar satellites as a part of youth education programs. A proc edure was developed for assembling and launching satellites such as RadioSkaf from the ISS during extravehicular activity. Verification of technical solutions on receiving radio signals from a chaotically tumbling object, the operating lives of spacesuit batteries, temperature changes in the spacesuit without the operation of a temperature control system, and other parameters, were completed. The Kedr amateur microsatellite was a new stage of the RadioSkaf experiment, which began in 2006. This experiment w as carried out within the framework of the UNESCO student program on space education for the youth around the world.

This program also aims to provide children and students in the Asia -Pacific region with opportunities to learn about space experiments and the space environment, including orbital microgravity. EARTH BENEFITS Students from across Asia are inspired to seek careers in the field of aerospace and science by experimenting with actual seeds flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). S PACE BENEFITS The future of space exploration is dependent on the genera tions of students yet to come. This program aims to spark interest in space activities and scientific research among young people in the Asia- Pacific region by allowing them to actually hold the seeds from space in their hands. The seeds themselves have li ttle scientific importance; however, the impact of this experiment lays the foundation for scientific curiosity among today's young people. RESULTS Well over 1000 students from 4 Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam) participated in this program (Space Seeds for Asian Future 2010 -2011), allowing them an opportunity to grow \"space seeds\" retuned from the Kibo laboratory. Various domestic programs were conducted by the local agencies including: Bandu ng Institute of Technology (ITB, In donesia); National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN, Indonesia); National Space Agency (ANGKASA, Malaysia); Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI, Malaysia); Ministry of Education (MOE, Malaysia); Department of Agricultu re (DOA, Malaysia); National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA, Thailand); and Tay Nguyen Institute of Biology and Space Technology Institute of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (TNIoB/VAST and STI/VAST, Vietnam). Indonesia rec eived 2 kinds of space seeds, tomato and garden balsam. The tomato seeds were distributed to students during a science competition at Space Science Festival in 2011, and the garden balsam seeds were distributed to students during 2012 L'Oreal Girls Science Camp and 2012 Kalbe Junior Science Award. Malaysia sent its original strain of chili (MC -11) seeds to space. ANGKASA established a local committee to conduct this program. The committee consists of MARDI, MOE, and DOA and ran both education and research programs. As an education program, the Malaysia Space Seed 413 Program Competition was open to all secondary students in Malaysia. Schools are only allowed to send in 1 team, which comprises a maximum of 20 students supervised by 4 teachers. In Thailand, 17 schools received the chili seeds from the hands of the Minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology at the Siam City Hotel in Bangkok. The event was held by NSTDA and there were many dignitaries including JAXA representative in Thailand and newspersons attended. Both the Minister and the NSTDA director wore the astronaut jumpsuits specially designed for this event. About 100 people were in at tendance, and the event generated interest from more than 20 news publications. STI/VAST participates in this program as a condition and sees it as good luck for such a young institute to pioneer the field of space technology in Vietnam. The seed progra m was launched in Vietnam in June 2010 organized by STI and TNIoB. Vietnam has sent 3 different kinds of flower seeds : garden balsam, snapdragon, tropical sage.

Hoffman, PhD, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites - Zero - Robotics (SPHERES -Zero -Robotics) investigation establishes an opportunity for high school students to design research for the International Space Station (ISS). As part of a competition, students write algorithms for the SPHERES satellites to accomplish tasks relevant to future space miss ions. The algorithms are tested by the SPHERES team and the best designs are selected for the competition to operate the SPHERES satellites aboard the ISS. E ARTH BENEFITS SPHERES -Zero -Robotics provides a unique and valuable opportunity to maintain students interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers; even those who do not wish to pursue space careers see their lives affected by knowing their work can have an impact beyond the classroom. The ability of the students to part icipate in real engineering activities, beginning in high school, potentially encourages them to remain interested in those fields. SPHERES -Zero -Robotics also builds critical engineering skills for students such as problem solving, design thought process, operations training, teamwork, and presentation skills. S PACE BENEFITS The NASA \"International Space Station Education Concept Development Report\" calls out 3 levels of interaction for students involved with NASA activities: exposure, engage, and educate. SPHERES -Zero -Robotics provides a unique and valuable opportunity to go far beyond exposure. The students are truly engaged in space research; the need for them to create their own programs takes it to the point where they are being educated. In this way, SPHERES -Zero - Robotics inspires future scientists and engineers to work within the space program. Starting at the high school age group, students view working in space as \"normal,\" with the expectation Three satellites fly in formation as part of the Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites investigation. 419 that they become inspired to push the limits of space exploration, engineering, and development. R ESULTS 2009: SPHERES -Zero -Robotics Pilot Program In the fall of 2009, the pilot competition for SPHERES -Zero - Robotics included 2 teams from Idaho.

EARTH BENEFITS Ownership of the imagery collected during flight is divided between NASA and DREAMTiME. As for the success of the mission, all HDTV hardware perfo rmed as expected, and the crew collected historical footage that is far beyond the initial imagery expectations. The footage includes imagery of Human Life Sciences, life on ISS, ISS structures, Earth views, and STS docking, and is irreplaceable in its enh ancement to the NASA archives. S PACE BENEFITS This new video recording technology can document future long -duration exploration missions. HDTV can provide improved imagery for spacecraft surveys while inflight. R ESULTS In developing the original public -private partnership, NASA had hoped that DREAMTiME would play a role in developing commercial products based on the historic activities on ISS. Lacking commercial direction from DREAMTiME, yet recognizing the historical significance of activities on the station, NASA took the initiative and developed scenarios and created storyboards for the flight crew to record ISS do cumentary footage of outstanding quality during the mission. The result of this effort returned over 500 minutes of HDTV footage, suitable for commercial purposes, and far exceeding the expected imagery return. The private company that originally sponsored DREAMTiME was short -lived, and no results were generated. The Bioastronautics Research Program has created the video Secrets of Science in Outer Space using some of the DREAMTiME footage. This investigation is complete and all results are published.

The still and video imagery acquir ed is used as part of a national engineering design challenge for students in grades K -12. Students grow basil seeds (control and flown seeds) to conduct their own science experiments on plant growth using growth chambers created by the students on the gro und. E ARTH BENEFITS Using a new approach in the classroom on spaceflight, science, and mathematics captures the imagination of students. Allowing students to participate in activities that directly involve NASA inspires them to pursue careers in science and engineering. S PACE BENEFITS Student participation in the design processes for the EPO -Kit C activities prepares the next generation of scientists and engineers. R ESULTS The EPO -Kit C, 20 -day in -orbit plant growth investigation was successful. The cinnamon basil seeds germinated in the microgravity environment and had some growth during the short investigation. Toward the end of the experiment, the plants appeared to have received more water than needed, causing them to slowly deteriorate. When the 20 days were up, the growth chambers were collapsed and prepared for their trip home on STS -120. Through the EPO -Kit C investigation, nearly 1 million students in grades K -12 p articipated in the NASA Engineering Design Challenge Lunar Plant Growth Chamber. This engineering design challenge asked students to design, build, and evaluate a plant growth chamber for future missions to the moon. Students learned about the engineering design process and how to conduct a scientific experiment.

This idea targeted European children ages 12 -14 years old and links this concept to the biology and science curriculum. By demonstrating the idea that greenhouses can be specially developed to support plant growth for food and following the life cycle of a flow ering plant on the International Space Station ( ISS), school children are able to follow with their own similar control experiment on the ground to see how plants can be grown and used in space. RESULTS This investigation began February 17, 2011; following 3 weeks of steady growth in space under the watchful eye of ISS crew member Paolo Nespoli, the Arabidopsis plants (small flowering plants related to cabbage and mustard) found a new and unexpected travelling companion: fungus. The ISS ecosystem is a particularly delicate one. Whereas some fungi does not cause much harm to earthly plants or humans, the balance of the closed systems in the station could be compromised. It is known that spaceflight reduces the crew's immune systems, their ability to fight off infections; once safety experts had confirmed that a fungus was growing in the greenhouse, by mid-March 2011, the unavoidable decision was made to carefully remove the greenhouse from the ISS, thus avoiding any probability of causing any harm to the astronauts. Paolo Nespoli was the first one to remark that simple procedures on Earth are extremely complex a nd possibly dangerous in weightlessness. \"Part of the experiment was indeed a success: we were able to grow the plants and observe them.\" Even though the in -orbit Students involved in constructing greenhouses and planting seeds. ESA images. 439 experiment experienced this problem, the experiment did produce some very stimulating activit ies for the participating students, especially as they could continue their individual growth experiments along with the participants of the Mars 500 isolation study that were also taking part in the project.

Shoshunov, PhD, S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, Korolev, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Scientific and Educational Demonstration of Physical Laws and Phenomena in Microgravity (Fizika- Obrazovaniye) studies and demonstrates various physical processes in microgravity for educational purposes in physics. This program is geared toward high school students in elective courses involving the in -depth study of physics, mathematics, and information technology. Fizika- Obrazovaniye is composed of 3 distinct studies. F IZIKA -LT Demonstrates the effects of the physical laws of motion with a spinning geometrically symmetrical body (much like a flying saucer), in microgravity. F IZIKA -FAZA Studies the complete gas -liquid phase separation of a fine dispersion system in microgravity with the effects of diffusion and the surface tension of liquid. F IZIKA -OTOLIT Demonstrates the simulation processes for the transfer of motion and the effects on the human vestibular system in microgravity. E ARTH BENEFITS The results of the comprehensive Fizika - Obrazovaniye investigations are used in education as graphic demonstration tools, and to develop educational scientific teaching materials for high schools. S PACE BENEFITS The results of the experiment can be used to verify the ap propriateness of the mechanical modeling of the human vestibular system in microgravity and, if possible, to model several of the negative effects microgravity has on this system.

Video footage was used for initial analysis and demonstrations of the laws of motion to students. A radio conference between students and the International Space Station commander was also held at the Mission Control Center -Moscow (MCC- M). When the laboratory processing of video footage and a comprehensive analysis of Fizika- Obrazovaniye space experiment results are complete, scientific e ducational presentation materials are planned to be released on compact disks on the following topics: \"demonstration of the effects of reactive and gyroscopic forces in microgravity and the impact of internal and external forces on the pattern of motion o f spinning bodies\" and \"demonstration of the phenomenon of the clustering of gas bubbles during gas - liquid phase separation in a fine -dispersion system in microgravity occurring with the effects of diffusion processes and liquid surface tension forces.\" Fi zika-Obrazovaniye experiment materials were included in the film \"Urok iz kosmosa\" (Lesson from Space) created by the Roscosmos film studio. FIZIKA -LT During the Fizika -LT study, the rates of forward motion and rotation of a flying saucer and the motion of a spinning ellipsoid according to the Bernoulli's law were demonstrated and compared with theoretical calculations. In the experiment, behavior that is of interest for demonstrational purposes was noted: stabilized rotation of a body with simultaneous displacement (sideways \"drift\") of its axis of rotation. The unstable and stable behavior of a body in weightlessness, the initial stage of precession, and motion with eccentricity of the spatial position of the axis of rotation was demonstrated. F IZIKA -FAZA During the Fizika -Faza study, it was demonstrated that in microgravity the process of gas and liquid phase separation has significant differences: Complete phase separation takes noticeably longer, and the clustering of gas bubbles has different patterns than under conditions of the Earth's gravitation.

S PACE BENEFITS JAXA EPO attracts attention to Japanese manned spaceflight activities to gain the support of the Japanese community for future manned space exploration. R ESULTS ARTISTIC EXPERIMENTS USING A WATER SPHERE The resulting spheres formed triangular and hexagonal shapes. \"C HUON \" THE SPACE VOICE OF THE OPEN MIND While everything about the ISS is man -made, an attempt took place to explore the source and nature of sound which has nurtured human sensitivity by stimulating acoustic sense. It also attempted to seek what human senses are all about. Chuon, a 3 -dimensional sound -emitting object, was created with the intention of producing sounds which would move one's senses and touch one's heart. Scientists are working with astronauts to determine how the sound emitted by the object is heard and felt in space. M ARBLING PAINTING ON A WATER BALL (INK BALL) As all the colors mixed thoroughly, the spheres eventually turned completely black. When the water was s oaked onto washi, the colors printed on the washi showed rich and bright patterns. The result was a new form of expression in microgravity. D EWEY 'S FOREST By creating a garden in Kibo, differences in gardens between space and Earth were explored. Furthermore, examinations were made of the feelings of astronauts of having a garden in space. The space gard en was shaped like a round air ball. Seeds were planted in a cultivation kit. Astronauts watered it every 10 days or so, and cultivation took place over a period of approximately 2 months. International Space Station crew members gathered in Kibo to observe the growth of Dewey's Forest. JAXA image. International Space Station (ISS) astronaut conducting the Japanese Powdered Green Tea in space investigation in the ISS Kibo module. JAXA image. Yoichiro Kawaguchi,/JAXA 451 HITEN Hiten refers to fl ying deities, which were portrayed on the walls of ancient ruins along the Silk Road approximately 1600 years ago. In Japan the story of Hiten was described as those who send flowers from the sky, play music, and fly the high sky. While living and working on board the ISS, the basic movements and posture of dancing were performed to express the image of Hiten by an ISS astronaut, inside Kibo. The microgravity environment enables certain movements, eg, curvilinear pivoting around a point indicating a center of gravity. Further developments of these movements would enable certain movements which previously existed only in people's i maginations. Those findings can also be applied to physical artistic expressions on Earth. M ARBLING PAINTING ON A WATER BALL (INK BALL-II) The first ball was made with salt water to symbolize Earth. Blue fluorescent ink and powder extracted from sea -fireflies, which are bioluminescent species, were injected into it. As for the second sphere, red, blue, and green fluorescent ink, representing the 3 primary colors of light were injected. After mixing them, an LED black light was turned on. In the first sphere a blue striped print emerged while the second sphere showed the fluorescent ink all the way through from the other side. J APANESE POWDER ED GREEN TEA IN SPACE Whisking green tea in outer space is a challenging task, as the powder and liquid would fly everywhere. We prepared a green tea powder capsule, a custom -made bamboo whisk, and a hermetically -sealed round container. The difference with tea on Earth was foam. Foam in outer space tea had a hard and metallic feel, and its surface reflected its surrounding environment like lenses. The foam did not bur st, even when mixed. Once stirring ceased, the form stayed still. This attempt proved that it is possible to conduct outer space experiments which involve diffusion and scattering.

Takuro Osaka/JAXA Shiro Matsui/JAXA Takuro Osaka/JAXA 452 MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE Message in a Bottle captured \"space\" in a glass bottle. The intention was to bring it back to Earth so people would feel closer to outer space. Unfortunately, \"space\" was not brought back to Earth because the bottle was broken on the first attempt. The sec ond attempt was successfully conducted and \"space\" was brought back to Earth. M ODELING CLAY IN SPACE This experiment was an attempt to create clay figurines in tebineri style (hand -pinching) in a micr ogravity environment. The findings show that a gravity -free environment enables creation of figurines of any shape. 'MOON' SCORE : ISS ASTRONAUT This score is unlike an ordinary music score consisting of vertical notes. Rather, it consists of 5 oval- shaped circular lines. Sounds were assigned such that craters are played by marimba and lunar mares by cembalo, whereupon this piece of music was perfo rmed. S PACE CLOTHES EXPERIMENT Fashion arises from functionality and then develops into mode. This experiment sought new fashion which would be suitable for long -term stays in space. An important factor for clothes is how efficiently one can move in a sp ecific environment. To explore how to move one's body in a microgravity environment, an ISS astronaut, imitated the movement of fish, birds, and spiders to examine physical movements. In particular, the difference in the role played by lower body limbs in space and Earth was highlighted, providing insights into clothes which would be suitable for this environment. S PACE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS Space Musical Instruments demonstrated 2 bells. One was a fractal bell, which resembles different -sized leaves lined on top of each other. The other is an ellipsoid bell, which contains a natural fragrant ball made of Japanese cypress. The fractal bell sho wed movements which were more intricate than expected. The Ellipsoid Bell showed that the sound disappears upon rotation due to centrifugal force, but it produces sounds when its rotating movement ceases, unlike anything we hear on Earth. Furthermore, the beautiful sounds produced resonate much longer than they would on Earth. There was an exquisite balance of sounds; the wooden ball controlling the metallic sounds to some extent. Under weightlessness, sounds are created when instruments are pushed or jiggled; so a new method of playing, away from the accepted musical wisdom to One of the bells utilized for the Space Musical Instruments investigation.

This included a live link demonstration designed to give students an appreciation of the conditions of freefall through 2 simple, curriculum relevant experiments. R ESULTS Hundreds of schoolchildren participated during a live link -up in September 2009 with ESA astronaut Frank De Winne inside the European Columbus laboratory on the International Space Station (ISS). During the 20 -minute link -up, De Winne successfully conducted the \"Do objects have weight in space?\" experiment that was proposed by European teachers in response to a call for experime nts that can be carried out on the International Space Station to demonstrate the effects of freefall. To support the activity, ESA distributed Education Kits in Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, and Spanish to participating schools containing the same hardware De Winne would use in orbit. The demonstration involved calculating the mass of an object on the ISS by measuring the time it takes to oscillate whilst hooked onto a spring. The experiment helped to illustrate the difference between the concepts of weight and mass. The schoolchildren performed the experiment themselves at the same time as De Winne from the museums in Barcelona (Spain), Thessaloniki (Greece), Milan (Italy), and Mechelen (Belgium). An edited highlights video was made available aft erward, and the recording of the demonstration apis was also used to produce ESA multimedia educational material. This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected. ESA astronaut Frank De Winne demonstrates an experiment during the \"Take your classroom into space \" event.

R ESULTS A live link activity took place between ESA astronaut Frank De Winne on the ISS and nearly 300 Belgian schoolchildren on October 6, 2009. The kits were distributed to many other schools. The children, aged 10-12 years old, gathered at the Free University i n Brussels for a day of activities dedicated to learning about life on the ISS. The students asked De Winne questions directly such as \"How do the astronauts wash themselves?\"; \"How do they brush their teeth\"; \"What and how do they eat?\" and \"How do they k eep fit and healthy?\" Organized with the Belgian European Space Education Resource Office (ESERO), in collaboration with the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office, the ministries of education of the Flemish Region, the French -speaking and German -speaking communities in Belgium, UNICEF Belgium and ESA's Directorate of Human Spaceflight, the emphasis of the ISS Day was water scarcity in space and on Earth. This theme tied in with De Winne's role as UNICEF ambassador and his support for their Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH) campaign. Water is vital for the health of people on Earth and in space and the day's activities encouraged children to make the link between the problems of water management in space and the problems facing millions of people on Earth. The live link was the finale of the day, during which De Winne performed 3 simple demonstrations to show how water behaves in space before answering the children's questions. The recording of the demonstration was used to produce ESA multimedia educa tional material for upper primary school teachers and their students aged 10 -12. This investigation is complete; however, no publications are expected. De Winne performs demonstration with water.

The comparison is made using an Atomic Force Microscope after the NanoLab is returned to Earth. E ARTH BENEFITS Utilizing the unique microgravity environment on the International Space Station (ISS) allows for determining the fundamental physical properties that occur when concrete is mixed and settles. By removing the force of gravity, it is hoped that the molecular structure of concrete and the properties that control its strength leads to developing a more robust form of concrete to be used on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS While concrete is not likely to be used in space, studying the structural and settling properties of this mixture might lead to a better understanding of the chemical and physical properties of similar mixtures. If it is found that mixing concrete in microgravity produces concrete of sufficient strength, then one could mix concrete and build concrete buildings on the moon or Mars that have smaller gravity fields.

APIS focuses on the behavior of a rigid body rotating around its center of mass. The experiment was only concerned with torque -free rotational motion. R ESULTS The experiment showed the different types of motion that could appear depending on the mass distribution of the body and on the mechanical energy dissipation effect due to external or internal actions. An undesirable effect of internal energy dissipation is to change the axis of rotation. Similar changes of the spin axis may appear also by changes such as deployment of booms, solar panels, antennae, etc. Several videos showing both stable and unstable configurations were recorded in the International Space Station during ESA's Cervantes (Soyuz 7S / 6S exchange) mission. Later, on ground, the videos were analyzed and reproduced with analytical and numerical models. The materials produced allow students to gain a global comprehension of the dynamics of solid body rotation and its dependence on the distribution of mass within the body.

The aim of the set - up is to acquire p recision data of the output during a total drain of a fuel cell in weightlessness. This is the first time that bacterial fuel cells have been tested in space. Currently foreseen applications are very promising for spaceflight and include waste disposal on human spaceflight missions. R ESULTS Due to differences in magnitude of the output the data had to be normalized and cumulatively plotted. In all, it can be concluded that bacterial fuel cells showed similar phases in the output under different gravitational conditions. Hence it can be concluded from a biological point of view that bacterial fuel cells do operate in space. PUBLICATION (S) De Vet SJ, Rutgers R.

Carey, ESA/ESTEC, Noordwijk, Netherlands RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Electrostatic Self-assembly Demonstration (ESD) education experiment is aimed at demonstrating the electrostatic self -assembly of 2 different types of macroscopic spheres of identical dimensions to create different molecular structures in weightless conditions aboard t he International Space Station by means of filming 3 demonstrations. Comparable on- ground experiments were performed and filmed in order to familiarize students with the differences between the Earth and space environments. R ESULTS During the demonstration, organized structures of PMMA/PTFE spheres were formed, but instead of forming one large 3 -D cluster in the center of the contai ner as anticipated, numerous, smaller individual clusters were observed, the majority of which attached themselves to the inner surfaces of the container. However, a small number of 3-D structures were seen in the stills from the video sequences. The contact electrification appeared to have charged the particles strongly such that they were attracted to the inner surface of the container \u2014this behavior had been observed during an earlier parabolic flight test, but not to the extent visible during the ENEIDE Mission. Footage of the \"on -ground\" and \"in space\" demonstrations were recorded, and the footage used to develop an International Space Station DVD lesson, fitting the basic European science and technology curriculum of the target age group: 12 -18 year o lds. The DVD was distributed in 12 languages to secondary school teachers in ESA Member States. P UBLICATION (S) AG Noordwijk. Project: Zero Gravity, Mission 3: Space Matters [DVD].

Students design their own experiments using flight -approved fluids and materials that are flown on the Materials Dif fusion Apparatus (MDA) or MixStix NanoLabs in a NanoRacks module. Students complete proposals for a flight opportunity, experience a science proposal review process, complete a flight safety review, and attend their own science conference. The goal of this program is to allow students to experience scientific exploration through their own involvement. E ARTH BENEFITS The long -term goal of this project is to enhance technological, industrial, and educational growth for the benefit of people on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS This investigation is a part of a series of investigations to be conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to provide the foundation for use of the ISS as a National Laboratory following assembly complete. R ESULTS As a result of the NCESSE Student Spaceflight Experiments Program (SSEP) announcements of opportunity, 39 communities across the United States have joined the program, providing 71 900 students in grades 5 through 14 the opportunity to participate.

Subtilis) studies the growth and growth rate of Bacillus subtilis bacteria in microgravity. Beef broth is added to the Bacillus subtillis, and the rate of growth is determined by measuring the amount of light shining through the bacteria -broth solution over time by using lumen sensors and analyzing the bacteria photos. E LECTROMAGNETIC EFFECTS ON FERROFLUID NanoRacks -Valley Christian High Effects on Ferrofluid (NanoRacks -VCHS -Electromagnetic Ferrofluid) studies the effects of a variable magnetic field on ferrofluids in microgravity. Three -D figures formed by the varying magnetic field are photographed and downlinked to the students daily to be analyzed and compared with those formed on the ground. E LECTROPLATING NanoRacks -Valley Christian High School - Electroplating (NanoRacks -VCHS - Electroplating) studies the effects of electroplating gold and bronze in microgravity aboard the station and compares the results of identical electroplating on Earth. Samples of electroplating in space and on the ground are analyzed with Valley Christian's atomic force microscope. P LANT GROWTH NanoRacks -Valley Christian High School -Plant Growth (NanoRacks -VCHS -Plant Growth) examines the growth and growth rate of marigold and thyme seeds in microgravity. With the bank of light- emitting diodes to simulate the sun, 2 Wisconsin fast plants and 2 Eng lish thyme plants are watered at a predetermined rate and photographed to measure the rate of growth. The growth is compared with the growth of the same plants grown on the ground. EARTH BENEFITS NanoRacks -VCHS allows students at Valley Christian High Sch ool to participate in an out of this world experiment to determine how microgravity affects several different research areas including bacterial growth, ferrofluids, electroplating, and plant growth. A better understanding of the fundamental properties benefits each discipline individually. The color photos from the NanoRacks -Valley Christian High School -Electromagnetic Effects on Ferrofluid Ground Test Unit. Valley Christian High Schoo l image . 486 ferrofluids experiment are beautiful and artistic and help bridge science and the arts. A better and more consistent method of electroplating could result in the start of a new commercial space plating industry that would result in more jobs and plating applications. A similar and larger automated plant growth design could be used to grow plants in any area of a home, including the basement and attic, reducing the amount of land required to provi de food for the world's rapidly increasing human population. S PACE BENEFITS In order to ensure crew health during spaceflight and long -duration missions, an understanding of how bacteria behave in microgravity leads to better prevention and treatment of infections. Understanding ferrofluids is also important because if they can be moved by the application of a magnetic field, they could be made part of a restartable space liquid propulsion system that would be moved toward the nozzle before ignition. This would eliminate the need to have heavy liquid containment screens within the propellant tanks. Electroplating is also of importance because if it is determined that electroplating in space produces more consistent plating than plating on the ground, this could result in the start of a new commercial space plating industry. Lastly, if crew members are going to travel to Mars, and they do not have sufficient room to take all the food required for the 3 -year trip, they will have to grow some of their food aboard the space vehicle. Research is required to determine the best method to pr ovide an automated plant growth system. R ESULTS A total of 4 teams consisting of 38 Valley Christian High School Students were given a NanoLab to house its microgravity science experiment in. Each team was responsible for selecting, designing, building, programming, and testing its own investigation. This investigation is complete and all results are published.

COLI BACTERIA AND ANTIBIOTIC (NANORACKS-WCHS -E. COLI AND KANAMYCIN ) Research Area: Student -Developed Investigations Expedition(s): 29 and 30 Principal Investigator(s): Whittier Christian High School, La Habra, California RESEARCH OBJECTIVES NanoRacks -Whittier Christian High School -E.Coli Bacteria and Kanamycin Antibiotic (NanoRacks - WCHS E. Coli and Kanamycin) is a NanoLab project studying the growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria in microgravity and the E. coli bacteria's resistance to the antibiotic Kanamycin by varying the antibiotic dosage. EARTH BENEFITS Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria cause major illnesses. The microgravity environment on the International Space Station (ISS) provides a means to determine the degree of antibiotic resistance and dosage level required to eliminate bacterial colonies. Re moving gravity has proven to cause bacteria to grow differently and by determining dosage response in microgravity to ground controls, improved treatment methodologies might be developed. S PACE BENEFITS Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria are found as normal flora in the human body. While most strains are harmless, some can cause major illness. It is important to determine the anti biotic resistance of E. coli in order to treat crew members who might potentially be infected by this bacteria. R ESULTS Students studied the growth of green fluorescent protein tagged Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) bacteria in microgravity and the E. coli bacteria's resistance to the antibiotic Kanamycin by varying the antibiotic dosage. Photos of the bacteria were taken to determine its growth as measured by the amount of fluorescence. The bacteria's resistance to antibiotics was determined by measuring th e decrease in fluorescence. This investigation is complete and all results are published.

SEM provide s students with the opportunity to conduct their own research on the effects of microgravity, radiation, and spaceflight on various materials. E ARTH BENEFITS Eleven schools are running experiments on the first Space Experiment Module (SEM) satchel flight. The experiments are contained in clear polycarbonate vials. These vials are also flown in passive (no power required) SEM experiment modules. Students create their own experiments, and consider such variables as space radiation, microgravity, and launch environment. SEM is educating and inspiring the next generation to take the journey. S PACE BENEFITS SEM introduces the concept of space - based scientific experiments to the next generation. RESULTS Eleven schools and 3, 300 students developed experiments for SEM Satchel 001. The satchel was launched during ISS Expedition 10 in December 2004 and returned to Earth on Space Shuttle Discovery (STS -114) in August 2005. The sample vials were returned to the students for analysis. This investigation is complete and all results are published.

The experimental setup used to perform the experiment consisted of transparent closed containers (having the same size and total mass) filled with solid spheres of different sizes that were periodically oscillated in one dimension. R ESULTS The figure (left) is a sequence of the experiment container with 48 spheres: (a) The spheres coming out of the small holder, (b) the container sliding to the end of the sliding guide, (c) the container in motion, and (d) the configuration after the stop of oscillation. There is a difference between spheres distribution in (c) and (d). The behavior of the spheres in (d) was due to electrostatic effects that affected the motion of the spheres inside the container in a way that was not expected, changing the dynamics of collisions between spheres and between the spheres and the container. This effect was more important for the conta iners with higher number of spheres. Another problem was that the lubricant was too viscous and the guide did not slide properly, reducing oscillation displacement. For safety reasons all the sliding parts of the experiment had to be lubricated by a specific lubricant, but it was not possible to test the hardware with the lubricant in advance. Several improvements could be made in the future. Proofs with different allowed lubricants should be performed in advance to achieve the desired slide. An impo rtant part of the experiment was the study of the container with the fluid; therefore, a triple level of containment container would need to be designed, to fulfil the safety specifications in the International Space Station. Finally, a study of the materials to be used would need to be done to avoid the electrostatic forces, irrelevant in the ground experiments but important in microgravity conditions.

Reglero J. M. Rodrigo RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The main goal of Under the Background Influence (UTBI) is the measurement of the background radiation inside spacecraft. Measurements of the X -ray, gamma ray, and other particles (protons, neutrons, electrons) have a very important effect outside the Earth's geomagnetic field, which can help in the development of future space vehicles and other space technologies. R ESULTS The radiation aboard the International Space Station has been measured. The fluctuation of the radiation along the orbit has been measu red. The influence of the Earth Magnetic Field (L -Shell) and the South Atlantic Anomaly has been imaged (representative image to the left). This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected. Image plot of Under the Background Influence image date over time.

Many research investigations address the mechanisms of the risks \u2014 the relationship to the microgravity and radiation environments \u2014and other aspects of living in space, including nutrition, sleep, and interpersonal relationships. Other experiments are used to develop and test countermeasures to reduce these risks. Results from this body of research are crit ical enablers for missions to the lunar surface and future Mars exploration missions. 494 EFFECT OF PROLONGED SPACEFLIGHT ON HUMAN SKELETAL MUSCLE (BIOPSY ) Research Area: Bone and Muscle Physiology Expeditions: 5-7 and 9 -11 Principal Investigator(s): Robert H. Fitts, PhD, Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Biopsy examines calf muscle samples of crew members before and after their stay aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to study muscle adaptation to weightlessness. This investigation helps to develop exercise program aimed at keeping muscles at their peak performance during long -duration space missions. E ARTH BENEFITS As people age on Earth, muscle tissue tends to lose elasticity. The results of this resea rch provide a better understanding of muscle atrophy in the elderly population on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS It is well established that muscle mass and strength decrease during spaceflight. The atrophy of muscles in space affects not only the performance of crew members during missions, but can lead to severe muscle injuries upon return to Earth. Astronauts landing on Mars may be susceptible to muscle injury once they step onto the planet. The exact cellular and biochemical events that produce these losses of mass and strength are not as well understood. Biopsy is the first experiment to tackle the cellular question in long -term spaceflight. The data from this experiment are used to illustrate the structural and metabolic changes that occur within individual muscle fiber cells. This experiment also helps to crea te a model that illustrates to what degree muscles deteriorate in space over time, which can be used to predict risks for long -term flight. As the mechanisms of muscle deterioration during spaceflight become clearer, scientists can pursue new methods to pr otect muscles for long missions. R ESULTS This study examined calf muscle physiology and performance of the astronauts who completed exercise routines on various exercise systems during their 6 -month stay on the ISS. Specifically, calf muscle volume, calf muscle performance, and muscle fiber physiology and microanatomy were assessed before and after spaceflight. Data showed a reduction in calf muscle mass and performance along with a slow -to-fast fiber type transition in the calf muscles. The decrease in muscle performance, combined with muscle physiological and anatomical changes (transition of the slow fiber types into the fast fiber types, increased thin filament density, and decreased This photomicrograph shows normal skeletal muscle fibers (above) and atrophied skeletal muscle fibers (below). Note the marked decrease in size of the atrophied skeletal muscle below. NASA image. 495 fiber diameter and overall muscle volume), show the exercise counterme asures did not provide the intensity needed to maintain calf muscle performance and structure (Trappe 2009 and Fitts 2010). Fast -twitch muscle fibers contract quickly but get tired quickly so a substantial microgravity -induced muscle fiber shift from the slow to fast type over long - duration spaceflight would be physiologically harmful and would increase the crew's risk of injury, impacting mission objectives. After several ISS missions and long -term bed rest experiments in the last decade, enough data now exists to warrant changes to the astronaut exercise regimen. Since completing this study, a second treadmill was added, the Combined Operational Load -Bearing External Resistance Treadmill (COLBERT) to ISS and an improved resistance exercise device, the Advanced Resistive Ex ercise Device (ARED). This allows for greater musculoskeletal loading during exercise. A new high- intensity, low -volume resistance and aerobic exercise program is also being implemented. The latest regimen alternates days of high - intensity interval trainin g with continuous aerobic exercise (opposed to mostly continuous aerobic exercise) and 3 days/week of high -intensity resistance training (opposed to 3 -6 days/week at lower intensity). Ongoing research is investigating the effectiveness of the new exercise program for protecting skeletal muscle health over long stays aboard the ISS (Bagley 2012). P UBLICATION (S) JL, Riley DA.

Leblanc, PhD, Universitie s Space Research Association, Houston, Texas Toshio Matsumoto, PhD, MD, University of Tokushima, Kuramoto, Japan RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The purpose of the Bisphosphonates study is to determine whether an antiresorptive agent, in conjunction with the routine in- flight exercise program, protects International Space Station (ISS) crew members from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions. E ARTH BENEFITS The benefits of this research are primarily for space travelers. However, knowledge gained from this investigation may generate useful information applicable to patients on Earth with accelerated bone loss because of disuse (eg, spinal cord injury patients or those with prolonged immobilization). S PACE BENEFITS If shown to be an effective countermeasure to spaceflight -induced bone loss, bisphosphonates could prevent or reduce several potential bone -related problems ide ntified in NASA's Critical Path Roadmap. If bisphosphonates improve the efficiency of in -flight exercise to maintain bone mass, then more crew time could be made available for other purposes. R ESULTS Seven ISS astronauts who spent a mean of 5.5 months on the ISS were given an oral dose of 70 mg of alendronate (a bisphosphonate drug used to treat the thinning of bone, ie, osteoporosis) weekly starting 3 weeks before flight and continuing throughout the mission to study the effectiveness of alendronate on re ducing bone loss. All crew members had a treadmill, cycle ergometer, and a resistance exercise device available for exercise. Bone assessment included densitometry of multiple bone regions using X -ray absorptiometry (DXA) Pictured is 1 -mm-thick sections through the mi d frontal plane of the hip, showing regions of evaluation in white superimposed on a false color image of the Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) data. The left -hand image shows the cortical region of the femoral neck, and the right -hand image shows the trabecular bone regions. NASA image. 497 and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and assays of biomarkers of bone metabolism. In addition to pre - and post- flight measurements, these results are compared to data from 18 astronauts who flew ISS missions and who exercised using an early model resistance exercise device called the interim resistance exercise device and 11 ISS astronauts who exercised using the newer Advanced Resistance Exercise Device (ARED). Findings indicate that the ARED provided significant lessening of bone loss compared with the older device, although some post-flight decreases in the femur neck and hip remained. The combination of ARED and bisphosphonate lessen the expected decline in essentially all indices of altered bone physiology during spaceflight. Losses in bone mineral density of the spine, hip, and pelvis, as well as measurements of fall and stance bone strength of the hip, bone resorption markers, and urinary calcium show that the combination of exercise plus an antiresoptive drug may be useful for protecting bone health during long -duration spaceflight.

Crew's Health: Investigatio n on Reduced Operability (CHIRO) provides early data within a wide range of research on human upper limb behavior and performances. The purpose of the experiment is to determine the influence of the microgravity on the control of the grip force exerted by the hand or by a group of fingers and the adaptive behavior of this control through long -term exposure to microgravity. RESULTS In general, a loss of motor control was observed in the blind period of contraction due to the absence of visual feedback; as soon as the visual feedback was restored (at the beginning of the final period), the test subject tried again to reach the fixed threshold, even if attempts were often nullified by the arising muscle fatigue. The weightlessness influenced the motor control and the capability of keeping muscle contraction constant was much stressed. So the Static Effort, after an early increase, recov ered the initial values, whereas the Root Mean Square was often still increasing; this can lead to different hypothesis: a) the biomechanic system gain (amplification factor) increases due to the absence of gravity; even if the stimuli to keep the fixed fo rce level are the same, the Root Mean Square of oscillations increases. b) the biomechanic system gain does not change, but the stimuli is higher. Finally, the collected data confirmed the increasing of Root Mean Square during the blind period of experimen t independently of weightless effects.

Braak, University of St -Etienne, St -Etienne, France Laurence Vico, PhD, University of St -Etienne, St-Etienne, France Peter Ruegsegger, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland Martina Heer, PhD, German Aerospace Center, Cologne, Germany RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Early Detection of Osteoporosis in Space (EDOS) experiment is testing the skeletal adaptation to long -term space exposure by 3 -dimensional peripheral quantitative computed tomography (3DpQCT) as a technique for detection of bone structure. Its goal is to provide a detailed evaluation of the bone loss and kinetics of recovery after flight. EARTH BENEFITS With crew members exhibiting bone loss similar to osteoporosis in space, ie, about 1% loss per month in space, this research should significantly contribute to the development of a reference technique to perform an early detection of osteoporosis on Earth. These improved diagnostics in the early stages of such a medical condition may prove extremely important in development of more effective counter measures to the effects of osteoporosis. The 3DpQCT scanner used in EDOS, which the European Space Agency supported the development of for a non- invasive/in vivo technique for bone structure observation, has already been commercialized successfully. S PACE BENEFITS The EDOS project helps to assess the efficiency of countermeasures, developed through ESA research and research from other organizations, to the bone loss crew members experienced on long -duration space missions such as to the International Space Station. This will assist in the optimal planning of long -duration missions with respect to pharmacological, dietary, or exercise -based protocols in order to alleviate such adverse effects and hence improve/maintain the health and performance of crew members in orbit. This data could also feed into the development of numerical bone models for crew members that could assist in the optimal planning for future longer -duration human exploration missions. This investigation is ongoing, and additional results a re pending publication. Xtreme CT distal radius . Image provided courtesy of SCANCO Medical.

Hand Posture Analyzer ( HPA) examines the way hand and arm muscles are used differently during grasping and reaching tasks in weightlessness. Measurements are compared to those taken before and after flight to improve understanding of the effects of long -duration spaceflight on m uscle fatigue. RESULTS The experiment was undertaken with 2 long -duration astronauts during Expeditions 7 and 8 aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and 1 astronaut during a short -duration Soyuz mission. The HPA hardware consisted of 2 dynamometers (Handgrip and Pinch Fo rce Dynamometers - HGD/PFD) for measuring handgrip and pinch forces, together with an instrumented glove device. With respect to power performance parameters, the Maximum Voluntary Contraction (greatest amount of tension a muscle can generate and hold) decreased by up to 45% in weightlessness for the handgrip measurements whereas the Static Effort (which investigates the subject's muscle fatigue, measuring force/effort applied for a period of time) globally increased for both hand grip tests and pinch force tests. Muscular microfilaments perf ormance could be reduced by the reduction of the concentration of the calcium ion Ca 2+ or by other physiological factors correlated with the Ca2+ concentration. This process is without adaptation in long -term space missions as confirmed by Maximum Voluntary Contraction and Static Effort parameters. ISS008E21614 - International Space Station Science Officer Mike Foale perform s the Hand Poster Analyzer investigation during Expedition 8, using the hand grip dynamometer to test the muscle fatigue of the forearm. 501 With respect to muscle Contraction Speed (ability to change force intensity with the time) for long -duration astronauts, contraction speed decreased in the global time window by up to 45% across the mission for the hand grip tests but with no significant difference in the pinch force tests. This was probably correlated with the same factors involved in the Maximum Voluntary Contraction decrease for handgrip measurements. In weightless conditions, the force level control and the maintenance of constant force level improved, however for higher target level (75% of Maximum Voluntary Contraction), the muscular fatigue effects were evident. This effect is predominant and more evident in weightlessness, probably dependent on the same physiological factors involved in the Maximum Voluntary Contraction decrease for handgrip measurements. Proprioceptive feedback seems to produce better results in weightless conditions. PUBLICATION (S) Pacelli F, Paoli A, Zolesi V, Norfini A, Donati A, Reggiani C.

Cavanagh, PhD, DSc, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Foot/Ground Reaction Forces During Spaceflight (Foot) experiment studies the load on the lower body and muscle activity in crew members while working on the International Space Station (ISS). This study will provide a better understanding of the bone a nd muscle loss in the lower extremities experienced by astronauts in microgravity. E ARTH BENEFITS The human body is designed to bear weight. Without the stimulation caused by placing weight on lower extremities, whether because of the microgravity envir onment or lack of use on Earth, bones lose mass, and muscles lose strength. The results of this experiment will help in future spaceflights as well as have significance for understanding, preventing, and treating osteoporosis on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS The loss of bone mineral in the lower extremities is widely viewed as one of the critical factors that may limit long - term human habitation of space (upper extremity changes in bone mineral density [BMD] appear to be minimal or to increase). Deficiencie s in lower extremity muscle function as a result of prolonged exposure to microgravity also have implications for performance and safety during space missions. The information derived from this study is expected to shed new light on possible solutions to bone mineral loss and drops in muscle function of the lower extremities. These results will lay an important foundation for the further development of countermeasures for lower extremity muscle and bone loss. R ESULTS The Foot investigation collected foot reaction forces data from four crew members during exercise with the Treadmill with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (TVIS), Cycle Ergometer with Vibration and stabilization (CEVIS), and Interim Resistance Exercis e Device (iRED) over their 6 - month missions over the period from Increments 6 -12 (November 2002 and April 2006) on the ISS. A ground -based study collected baseline data from crew members performing prescribed ISS006E11018 - Expedition 6 Mission Commander Kenneth Bowersox, wearing a body harness, runs on the Treadmill Vibration Isolation System (TVIS) while conducting the Foot/Ground Reaction Forces During Spaceflight (Foot) experiment in the Zvezda/Service Modul e. 503 exercises and wearing the Lower Extremity Monit oring Suite (LEMS) system. Results show the LEMS is capable of providing valid and useful biomechanical information on long -term exercise activities aboard the ISS (Cavanaugh 2009). Normal daily activity ground -reaction forces on the feet are measured for each crew member for 4 days prior to going to space, and approximately 4-7 days' worth of data are recorded while the subject is performing daily activities on the ISS. Experimental data show that foot forces, based on direct in- shoe force measurements, are greatly reduced, upward to nearly half in some cases, for the same activity as on Earth. These mechanical loading reductions on weight -bearing bones are used to correlate the rate of bone loss of the most affected areas of the skeleton. The results demo nstrate exercise countermeasures with TVIS, CEVIS, and iRED are not adequate in preventing significant bone degradation over long -duration spaceflights. It is concluded that the lighter amount of force applied to bones and muscles during exercise and daily activities aboard the ISS plays a crucial role in the reduction of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) (Cavanaugh 2010). Additional results showed that foot loads were reduced by at least two -thirds while performing resistive exercises on these equipment with the exception of the CEVIS at its highest setting. It is concluded that the TVIS, CEVIS, and iRED, as designed, were not generating enough resistive loads equal to that on Earth, and the need for greater loading should be addressed for upgrades and the next generation of exercise equipment for the ISS (Genc 2010). Precise measurement of the forces exerted by the muscles and bones in microgravity provides a means to quantify the relationship between force reduction and the rate of atrophy of the musculos keletal system. Researchers are optimistic that the hypothesis of minimum -loading stimulus, in terms of exercise repetition and the amount of force being applied, can be confirmed and the threshold to maintain fitness can be accurately pinpointed. Already, the latest generation of exercise equipment with improved mechanical loading, individually tailored exercise programs, and crew -friendly setup and maintenance is being implemented on the ISS. The Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Tread mill (COLBERT) and Advance Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) are actively collecting data while giving crew members the high -intensity workouts they need in order to remain healthy over the course of their mission.

Measurements are compared to those taken before and after flight to improve understanding of t he effects of long -duration spaceflight on muscle fatigue. E ARTH BENEFITS Data from the investigation contribute to the development of new methods, protocols, and instruments for the study and treatment of upper limb problems on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS This investigation provides information on performance modification of the muscular system during long stays in microgravity and the characterization of motion strategies and postural behavior of the human body in weightlessness. Results may lead to the op timization of constructive criteria in the design of orbital modules, devices, and tools for use in space. R ESULTS The absence of gravity causes many inconveniences, generically referred to as \"space motion sickness,\" but collected data have shown crew members normally adapt to microgravity in about a week. The HPA was used extensively on the ISS during 2003 and 2004. The main objective of HPA is the assessment of upper limbs performance, specifically the holding or grasping movements, and muscular function since the upper limbs are the principal means of work and locomotion onboard the space station. Daily tasks and movements, as well as physically demanding extra -vehicular activities, can have a significant effect on the hand causing muscle fatigue. This degradation of muscular- skeletal performance can be easily recognized on t he upper limb. Another aspect is the adjustment of the brain and motor control system to microgravity on the upper limb, affecting not only bio -mechanics but in general the psycho -physical conditions. Overall, tests show prompt recovery after short -term flight and loss of force up to 40% after 6 months in space. These results provide a quantitative evaluation of the performance of the upper limb and provide the base to develop countermeasures (eg, tools to facilitate adaptation and make working in space easier) against the impairments due to change in gravity. Als o, the experience ISS008E21614 - ISS science officer Mike Foale is performing the HPA investigation during Expedition 8, using the hand grip dynamometer to test th e muscle fatigue of the forearm. 506 gained from these experiments can be applied for treatment of patients with local traumas or diseases of the central nervous system on Earth (Pastacaldi 2004).

The type and intensity of pain recorded after every day is related to the data on the physiological process of muscle adaptation as obtained from the Berlin Bed Rest Study. This study aims to measure changes in morphology and muscle volumes by means of MRI in the lower back and pelvic region and the same questionnaire on low back pain is used. Strong evidence for atrophy of the multifidus muscle is found in the Berlin Bedrest Study related to pain on the site of the iliolumbar ligaments. RESULTS The prevalence of Low Back Pain (LBP) in space (68%) is higher than on Earth. This is likely due to changes in the lumbar spine as adaptation to microgravity. Although these changes occur in response to microgravity, it is not clear when this will lead to the development of LBP in space. Data is lacking on both development and natural cause of LBP during microgravity. Aim of the current study was to describe the development and natural cause of LBP in microgravity during short flight (15 days) and compare this with similar data collected during the 2 Berlin bed rest studies (n=12). Twenty astronauts participated in the study and filled in a questionnaire 7 days prior to flight, during each flight day, and 7 days after flight. Besides pain levels (NRS), loc ation, neurological signs, provoking moments, and relieving countermeasures were also described. Results demonstrated that LBP, mostly experienced in the central area of the lower back spreading via the iliac crests, occured in 12 out of 20 astronauts with 2 astronauts who experienced 1 day, 6 experienced 2 -4 days, and 4 more > 6 days pain with a mean pain level NRS of 3 (min 1, max 6). The pain was self -limiting. No LBP was reported by any astronaut during the last flight days. No pain was reported 7 days after flight. No neurological signs were present. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. 508 SPINAL ELONGATION AND ITS EFFECTS ON SEATED HEIGHT IN A MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT (SPINAL ELONGATION ) Research Area: Expeditions: 19-28 Principal Investigator(s): Sudhakar Rajulu, PhD, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Spinal Elongation and its Effects on Seated Height in a Microgravity Environment (Spinal Elongation) study provides quantitative data as to the amount of change that occurs in the seated height because of spinal elongation in microgravity. EARTH BENEFITS This study provides data and insight on spinal elongation and compression for people who suffer from back pain on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS This seated height data in microgravity is considered necessary to correctly identify the seated height projections of the crew in the Orion configuration. Correct projections of seated h eight should lead to proper positioning of the seats within the vehicle; adequate clearance for seat stroke in high acceleration impacts; providing proper fit in seats; proper placement of seats with respect to each other and the vehicle; and proper orient ation to displays and controls. Additionally, data concerning the effects of spinal elongation on seated height would aid in the design of suit components, habitation requirements, and tool specifications. R ESULTS Data analysis is ongoing for the Spinal E longation investigation before conclusive results are prepared. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication.

E ARTH BENEFITS Data gathered from the Sprint investigation help scientists develop/enhance aerobic training and resistance protocols that may be used on Earth to aid in muscle, bone, and cardiovascular health. S PACE BENEFITS Upon completion of this study, investigators expect to provide an integrated resistance and aerobic exercise training protocol capable of maintaining muscle, bone, and cardiovascular health while reducing total exercise time over 180 days of spacefligh t. This evaluation provides valuable information in support of space exploration's long -term goal of insuring human fitness for even longer space exploration missions.

Lang, PhD, University of California, San Francisco, California RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Bone density scans are taken preflight, soon after landing, and again 1 -year postflight to understand the effects of microgravity on bone loss because of long -duration spaceflight. This is a long -term study to understand the distribution of bone loss resulting from long -duration spaceflight; the recovery of bone mass postflight in the year after landing; and the extent to which these changes compare to the spread of bone mineral density measures in healthy Earth - bound individuals. EARTH BENEFITS Additionally , comparison of bone mineral density in the hip and spine between space -flight crew members and healthy normal subjects improves understanding of the prevalence of osteoporosis between different race and gender sub -groups on Earth as well as in space crews . S PACE BENEFITS Bone loss, which can increase the risk of fracture by weakening the skeleton, is an established medical risk in long -duration spaceflight. There is little information regarding which sub- regions of the most important skeletal sites, the s pine and hip, are most affected. Moreover, there is little information about the extent to which the lost bone is recovered after spaceflight. This study provides the first information on spaceflight related compartmental bone loss (magnitude and distribut ion) in the axial skeleton and on the extent to which lost bone is recovered in the year following return. Furthermore, this study has implications for the frequency of assignment to long -duration missions and for the health of the astronauts in older age. It may also be of use in designing exercise or medicine countermeasures to prevent bone loss. ISS009E17466 - Expedition 9 Commander Gennady Padalka performs an ultrasound bone scan on Flight Engineer and Science Officer Edward (Mike) Fincke's heel using the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Micro-G (ADUM) setup in the Destiny U.S. Laboratory Module. The ADUM keyboard, flat screen display, and front control panel are visible in the right field of view. 511 RESULTS This investigation used noninvasive quantitative computed tomography (QCT) scans and finite - element (FE) structural engineering modeling to compare the pre -flight and post -flight geometry and strength of the proximal (segment joining the hip) femur of 13 astronauts who had not taken any medical countermeasures to prevent bone loss during missions (this area of the femur typically experienced the highest rate of bone loss while in space). FE cal culations determined up to a 2.6% per month decrease in proximal femoral strength while standing, and up to a 2.0% decrease against falling for crew members exposed to microgravity for 4 to 6 months aboard the ISS. Over long -duration missions, the cumulative effect represented a significant reduction in bone strength. The authors considered estimates of bone strength by this method would be more revealing since complex 3 -D and nonlinear changes in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) were taken into account. Furtherm ore, QCT scans showed that while overall bone mass appeared recoverable after 1 year back on Earth, the regained bulk was from volumetric growth and the corticoid bone portion, but the reductions in trabecular bone mineral density (tBMD) and strength, did not necessarily follow suit, and these losses could potentially be permanent (Keyak 2009). An affiliated study augmented previous investigations by Lang (2007) with the first long -term volumetric measurements of human bone mineral status and bone geometry of the hip and spine of an 8 -crew member subset for up to 4.5 years after long -duration spaceflights. Observed time points at landing, 1 year, and 2 -4.5 years later showed bone recovery rate and characteristics for the spine and proximal femur in line with previous findings (Sibonga 2007) in that the intergral bone mineral density (iBMD) regained near preflight status over the following 2 -4.5 years along with net gains in total volume and trabecular bone for the hip region. However, volumetric density measu rements by QCT showed an overall trabecular bone density average decline to 88% of the preflight value over the same period, and there were no indications that this quantity of tBMD loss would eventually be recovered. Researchers also proposed that the per sistent deficits in trabecular bone and bone strength coupled with natural aging osteoporosis may significantly elevate the risk for astronauts who underwent extended or repeat missions and predispose them to premature osteoporosis later in life (Carpenter 2010).

Karemak er, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Physiological Parameters That Predict Orthostatic Intolerance After Spaceflight (Aorta) plans to predict orthostatic intolerance due to microgravity before and after return from microgravity. This investigation categorizes the cardiovascular reaction patte rn of a crew member and acts as a predictor for the outcome of the test. R ESULTS Data indicated that blood pressure (BP) levels in space were not very different from preflight; the circadian BP rhythm appeared dampened. Only daytime diastolic pressures and nighttime heart rate (HR) were significantly lower in space. However, compared to the effect of a control tilt maneuver on the ground, even lower BP values might have been expected. Striking were the BP and HR surges during the working days in space, often related to stressful moments such as live appearances on public broadcast. Syst emic vascular resistance (SVR) dropped during the night, unlike HDT. Thus, actual spaceflight refutes earlier findings in HDT, both for BP levels and for daytime to nighttime changes.

E ARTH BENEFITS The crew health care technology for the biological rhythm disruption during spaceflight provides the general public with useful hints to promote a healthy daily lifestyle. S PACE BENEFITS Monitoring cardio autonomic functions is important for improving crew health technology during long -duration spaceflight. R ESULTS Three Data collection periods of ECG readings using the Digital Holter ECG aboard the ISS were conducted to provide trends for long -duration, microgravity exposure. Over 24 hours, the average main (large heart pulse) RR interval periods were kept almost within circadian range. The circadian rhythm contain ed in RR intervals was signif icant ly stronger in the latter period than in the early and middle periods . The study of circadian rhythm on RR i ntervals in a microgravity, long -duration environment will be analyzed to assist astronauts in the recover y of normal circadian rhythms in a prolonged space stay in the future.

Card tests the hypothesis that cardiac output is increased and arterial resistance is lowered in microgravity. Blood vessel volume reduction causes higher sympathetic nervous activity and the sensitivity of the arterial resistance vessels to this increase is reduced by weightlessness. Another hypothesis is that high sympathetic nervous activity is a compensatory response to the increased cardiac output and blood flow in the upper parts of the body on the expense of the lower body parts and that thi s causes some degree of vasoconstriction in the arms and legs to maintain an adequate blood pressure. R ESULTS The team observed in 8 astronauts a decrease in 24 - hour ambulatory blood pressure of 10 mm Hg corresponding to a low -dose antihypertensive medication effect, a 30% increase in cardiac output and stroke volume, and a 30% decrease in peripheral systemic vascular resistance. Thus, the conclusion was that long -term spaceflight (3 -6 months) has a vasodilatory, antihypertensive (lower blood pressure) effect, which purely from a cardio vascular point of view is healthy. At the same time, an unchanged level of efferent sympathetic nervous activity was found, which is surprising considering the vasodilatory effects, and which thus requires further investigation.

This investigation examines stress, and cognitive and physiological reactions of crew members during short - duration space missions. RESULTS In view of the limited data about autonomic cardiovascular control in relation to mental stress in space, a hypothesis that mental load may alter cardiovascular neural response in microgravity was tested on 5 crew m embers before, during, and after spaceflight over three 10 - to 11 -day European Space Agency missions (Odissea, Cervantes, and Delta) to the International Space Station. This investigation examined cardiovascular responses to mental arithmetic tasks and fou nd no effect in space when compared to baseline testing results for heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters. Parallel studies on the same subjects for up to 25 postflight days found heart rate (HR) increased only with the standing position in early postflight, and researchers concluded this as typical response to upright stress after returning to gravity and full tolerance was reestablished after 4 days. Symptoms such as dizziness, loss of balance and/or vision, or consciousness from uncompensated fall in blood pressure disappeared rather quickly after flight, but it was unclear how long changes in dynamic HR control needed to recover. A simple paced - breathing method was used to study respiratory control on the autonomic heart rhythms and data collected 10 days prior to launch, then 1 and 25 days upon return to Earth showed that in spite of increased HR and associated reduction in the rh ythmic fluctuation of heart rate with breathing (known as Respiratory Sinus Dysrhythmia or RSD), respiratory -mediated blood pressure dynamics were unchanged after short -duration spaceflight. Results suggested that a fundamental neural control deficit from microgravity deconditioning was less likely, and post -flight reductions in RSD and blood -pressure control of heart rate were actually appropriate autonomic adjustments that accounted for the altered blood flow regulation after spaceflight, which typically resolve within 25 days after landing.

This investigation examines stress and cognitive and physiological reactio ns of crew members during long - duration space missions on the International Space Station. R ESULTS Cardiocog -2 was a comprehensive in -flight study with 6 astronauts/cosmonauts who took part in 6 long -duration increments for up to 6 months. In this study, primary cardiovascular data were measured as a function of body position preflight and in weightlessness. The main findings were that heart rate and blood pressure in weightlessness did not change significantly compared to the supine (lying face upward) preflight values during these extended stays. Howeve r, long -term space missions seem to induce chronic relaxation of the circulation in humans, which was nicely demonstrated by one of the subjects having borderline high blood pressure before flight and subsequently showing normal blood pressure in space. On e interesting (and unexpected) result was the blood pressure neural feedback linked to controlling heart rate appeared to slow significantly in space but the cause(s) was (were) unclear and needs further investigation. No astronauts in the studies showed symptoms or signs of impending fainting the first days after landing, which strongly supported the involvement of effective exercise countermeasures in the adaptation process to prolonged space missions. It was suggested that individual performance on coun termeasures should therefore be shared between scientists in the future to improve the depth, scientific outcome, and overall conclusion of these studies ( Verheyden 2009, 2010) .

Bogomolov, PhD , Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Comprehensive Study of the Pattern of Main Indicators of Cardiac Activity and Blood Circulation (Cardio -ODNT /Cardio -ODNT Perfection) identifies the associations in regulation of human systemic and pulmonary circulation during the stages of indiv idual adaptation to conditions of long -term microgravity using functional load testing along with the application of negative pressure to the lower part of the body (LBNP) in order to assess and predict orthostatic intolerance (dizziness upon standing up). E ARTH BENEFITS The scientific results of the Cardio -ODNT experiment are intended for doctors working mainly on the medical support of manned spaceflights. New knowledge is expected to be the major benefit of this investigation. S PACE BENEFITS The adaptation mechanisms of various levels of the human circulatory system in microgravity can be clarified from studying the functional capabilities of the human body in spaceflight. The scientific information obtained make it possible to analyze and evaluate the functional state of the cardiovascular system overall, and in particular the filling capacity and tone of blood vessels of various sizes in each region tested in accordance with criteria generally accepted in normal clinical practice, including determining functional state ranges (high, normal, and low blood pressure, high and low blood volume). Results from this study adds substantially to the knowledge of the impact of microgravity on the functional state of various parts of the cardiovascular system of crew members in long -term spaceflights. R ESULTS Objective information was obtained for the first time enabling the functional state of various regions of the syst emic and the pulmonary circuit to be comprehensively evaluated with LBNP Cosmonaut Sergey Volkov perfor ms the C experiment . Roscosmos image. 522 in microgravity. The feedback mechanisms of vessels in the systemic and pulmonary circuits were clarified. Results showed that the hemodynamic state of the body was significantly different before and during flight. The features of adaptation reactions for each region studied and their relationships upon simulating a vertical position using LBNP were identified, depending on the original hemodynamic state of the body. The regions that a re the most impacted by long -term microgravity were determined. The data obtained highlighted the positive benefits of exposing the lower body to negative pressure during flight on the hemodynamic equilibrium in the body in general, and in particular on circulation in the pulmonary circuit, which is most affected by microgravity. Data confirmed the effectiveness of LBNP sessions on the circulatory system during crew member training for the return to Earth.

Kim Prisk, PhD, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES Cardiorespiratory Adaptation to the Space Environment (CardioRespir) examines the alterations of the preload conditions of the hearts of space explorers in microgravity. Results from previous space missions have shown that early in weightlessness cardiac filling and stroke volume increase, there is a decrease in resting heart rate. These changes are the onset of complex adaptation mechanisms in the cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary systems, which play a role on mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance, one of the most important physiological problems endured by astronauts after spaceflight and a potential hazard for longer spaceflight, especially for future exploration missions. RESULTS Measurements were performed on 3 crew members with preflight, inflight, and postflight sessions recording ECG and respiratory measurements with imposed and con trolled breathing protocols. Analysis shows that the amplitude of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) showed a linear relationship with the breathing period (T resp). In flight, the slope of this relationship was slightly decreased, with a difference mor e pronounced for the (on- ground) standing than the supine posture. For the first days after return, a significant decrease of the slope was observed compared to both supine and standing preflight slopes. Between the 15th and 25th days after return, there w as a progressive return to normal values of the RSA relationship with breathing period. The results of decreased amplitude of RSA and decreased slope of the relationship between RSA and T resp during and after exposure to weightlessness support the hypothesis that the parasympathetic activity of the autonomic nervous system is decreased. The science team showed also that simultaneous knowledge of HR and T resp is required for the analysis of RSA as a tool for following up the progressive readaptation to normal gravity of HR autonomic control. This result stressed the importance of the influence of respiration on the interpretation of changes in heart rate variability, and the necessity for its co ntrol. 524 PUBLICATION (S) Pattyn N, Migeotte PF, Morais E, Cluydts R, Kolinsky R. monitoring: Putting some feeling N, performance d uring spaceflight: How psychophysiology sheds new light on an old question.

Learning more about the cardiovascular and cer ebrovascular systems could lead to specific countermeasures that might better protect future space travelers. This experiment is a collaborative effort with the Canadian Space Agency. E ARTH BENEFITS The risk of fainting and falling is increased in older adults. Falls are very serious because they often cause a hip fracture, which is a major cause of prolonged disability and loss of independence; unfortunately, for a high percentage of individuals, the complications from the fracture often lead to disability and possibly death. Gaining better knowledge of the causes of loss of blood pressure and the warning signs that might predict risk helps reduce the incidence of fainting and falls in the elderly. S PACE BENEFITS Information from this study improves the understanding of the effects of spaceflight on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular functions. B y gaining increased knowledge of the specific components of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems that deviate from the normal Earth baseline responses, it is possible to recommend specific countermeasures that might better protect future space tr avelers after experiencing the effects of gravity on Earth or landing on the moon or Mars. R ESULTS Early evidence from long -duration spaceflight indicated general cardiovascular fitness reduction; chronic elevations in arterial blood pressure in the brain ; and elevated inspired carbon dioxide (CO 2) compared with normal upright posture on Earth. Recent studies investigated the spontaneous blood pressure feedback and markers of cardiovascular control, changes in heart rate (HR), as well as dynamic autoregulation of brain blood flow and CO 2 ISS015E14753 - View of Expedition 15 astronaut and flight engineer Clayton Anderson working with a Continuous Blood Pressure Device (CBPD) and computer during hardware set -up for the Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Control on Return from the International Space Station (CCISS) experiment in the U.S. Laboratory/Destiny. 526 responsiveness in astronauts living for 2 -6 months on the ISS. Overall, there was no change in indicators of cardiovascular stability during long -duration spaceflight and only relatively small changes postflight at rest in the seated position. In- flight measurements of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and BP regulation versus preflight revealed no significant changes. Very small increases in resting HR and a 25 -34% reduction in the arterial blood pressure reflex respons e postflight reflected relatively modest levels of decreased cardiovascular muscle tone and fitness. It was also found that astronauts maintained their preflight heart rate during daily activities while living on the ISS (Fraser 2012). These postflight cha nges suggests that while the current countermeasures on ISS maintain cardiovascular stability in resting conditions in space; key aspects of cardiovascular health with potential long -term consequences are not yet protected (Hughson 2012). Studies have shown a consistent impairment of dynamic cerebrovascular autoregulation and CO 2 reactivity in astronauts chronically exposed to elevated atmospheric CO 2 from long -duration spaceflight; however, there were between -person differences in the magnitude of impairment. Evidence also suggests possible cerebrovascular damage, such as thickening of the cerebral arteries, from pro -longed elevation in cerebral blood pressure. It is unclear, at the moment, whether these changes have harmful effects associated with the complications in vision attributed to increased intracranial pressure. Future studies should investigate in- depth pre to postflight changes in cerebral blood flow and CO 2 reactivity to determine whether they are predictors of health complications resulting from long -duration spaceflight (Zuj 2012).

Karemaker, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands Claude Gharib, Lyon Grange Blanche, Lyon, France RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 24-hour Pattern of Blood Pressure and Heart Rate in Weightlessness (Circa) aims to measure the pattern of blood pressure and heart rate during a 24 -hour period in an astronaut. The combined data from 2 instruments used in this experiment enables the scienc e team to unravel the underlying physiology of circadian cardiovascular control in weightlessness. R ESULTS This study showed that astronauts on short -duration missions may be subject to strong psychological stimuli. In particular, official moments like press conferences can induce surges of blood pressure and heart rate. The initial hypothesis is that spaceflight would show the same day/night chan ges as had been observed earlier in ground -based bed rest studies. However, unlike the simulations, blood pressure and heart rate were not very much changed inflight from preflight. Only daytime diastolic pressures and nighttime heart rate were significant ly lower inflight than preflight. Actual spaceflight did not confirm the earlier bed rest findings for blood pressure levels and for daytime to nighttime changes. Daytime blood pressure levels were definitely higher than was expected. Strikingly, blood pre ssure and heart rate surges during the working days in space were often related to stressful moments like live media events but were not restricted to these moments. The authors hypothesized that the busy work schedule of short-stay astronauts added to the general level of excitement that was apparent from the measurements. Systemic vascular resistance dropped during the night, unlike bed rest study findings . Thus, actual spaceflight refuted earlier findings in bed rest studies both for blood pressure level s and for daytime to nighttime changes. None of the postflight results were duplicated during preflight venous occlusion. In conclusion, some crew members showed abnormal orthostatic response 1 and 2 days after spaceflight. Overall, there were indications of increased sympathetic response to standing, even though it was expected that (partial) restoration of plasma volume may have taken place. Spanish European Space Agency astronaut Pedro Duque is wearing the experiment equipment . ESA image . 528 The combined observations led to the hypothesis that short- duration spaceflight may induce strong psychological stress in astronauts. When interpreting space -physiological observations this must be taken into account. This study also showed that extensive in -flight cardiovascular measurements were feasible, even in busy astronauts, while they were performing their n ormal duties. From these observations, researchers have learned to take the psychological aspects of spaceflight more into account when judging the adaptation to microgravity.

Baranov, PhD , Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow , Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Study of the Regulation and Biomechanics of Respiration in Spaceflight (Dykhaniye) investigates upper respiratory functions in long -term orbital flight on the International Space Station (ISS) in order to improve the medical monitoring and countermeasures system for future long -duration crew members. E ARTH BENEFITS Dykhaniye studies the condition of the respiratory system in weightlessness, but knowledge gained from the experiment can also benefit respiratory research on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS Investigating how weightlessness affects the respiratory system and regulation (including voluntary control) of this function in long -term spaceflight is import ant both for the study of space physiology and space medicine, since new findings serve as the basis for improving and developing special countermeasures for the deconditioning and rehabilitation of the respiratory muscles. R ESULTS A large amount of scien tific information was obtained during the experiment, and analysis showed that no statistically significant changes occurred in the volume/rate of breathing at rest or breathing reserve indicators in the group under spaceflight conditions. Analysis of spir ometry (method in which breathing is voluntarily controlled after breathing at rest) parameters showed that in both the transition from Earth to spaceflight conditions and vice versa, voluntary control of respiratory movements was destabilized. Therefore, as a result of carrying out the Dykhaniye experiment on the ISS, no significant changes were found in external respiration volume/rate in the crew members tested. The increase in the duration of holding the breath, the decrease in variability of breathing pattern time parameters, and shifts in the voluntary control of respiratory movements were likely caused by changes in the system of breathing regulation, which requires further in -depth study.

The current VO2Max protocol for determining astronaut fitness on a regular basis is quite time consuming. If EKE is successful in reducing the time spent on fitness evaluation in orbit, this will free up more time to be spent on other activities such as scientific research. Another goal of EKE is the development of a physiological model to explore the transport delay of the deoxygenated blood from the exercising muscle tissue to the lungs . This approach permits differentiation between the responses of heart, lungs, and exercising muscles for a more specific training prescription. E ARTH BENEFITS Data from this research also helps to improve our knowledge in general of the physiological me chanisms at work during the assessment of endurance capacity. The improvement of diagnostic techniques in space could also lead to improved diagnostic techniques of endurance capacity on Earth where VO2max is a standard technique. NASA astronaut Don Pettit, Expedition 30 flight engineer, performs a joint session of the European Space Agency 's (ESA) Thermolab and Assessment of Endurance Capacity by Gas Exchange and Heart Rate Kinetics During Physical Training experiments in conjunction with NASA's VO2max experiment while using the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolat ion System in the Destiny laboratory of the International Space Station. ESA/NASA image. 532 SPACE BENEFITS Assessment of crew member health and fitness (specifically their aerobic capacity) is a vital part of any mission, not only to secure the well -being of the crew member in question, but also to secure the aims and goals of the mission such as undertaking sc ientific research. The EKE experiment should help to reduce the amount of time that is spent making this type of cardiopulmonary health assessment on long -duration missions (thus increasing the time available for research activities) by the development of an improved diagnostic method for the assessment of endurance capacity which is less time intensive than currently used method (VO2max). R ESULTS Data from the experiment is currently being analyzed and processed prior to results publication. This invest igation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. 533 PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS THAT PREDICT ORTHOSTATIC INTOLERANCE AFTER SPACEFLIGHT (HEART) Research Area: Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems Expedition(s): 9 Principal Investigator(s): John M. Karemaker, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The objective of Physiological Parameters That Predict Orthostatic Intolerance After Spaceflight (Heart) is to predict orthostatic intolerance, ie, the inability to stand upright, of astronauts who have spent a long period in a weightless environment. Predictions are based on measurements of physical parameters such as blood pressure, electrocardiograms, thoracic impedance, and brain blood flow by ultrasound. This data serve as inputs for a computer model of blood circulation to assist in diagnosis of unexplained fainting in patients. R ESULTS Two of 5 space explorers showed abnormal orthostatic response 1 and 2 days after spaceflight. Although all subjects compl eted stand tests, 2 of 5 subjects had drastically reduced pulse pressures and an increase in heart rate of 30 beats/min or more during standing. None of the postflight results were mimicked during preflight venous occlusion. Overall, there were indications of increased sympathetic response to standing, even though we can expect (partial) restoration of plasma v olume to have taken place. Blood pressure levels in space were not very much changed from preflight; the circadian blood pressure rhythm seemed dampened. Only daytime diastolic pressures (both subjects) and nighttime heart rate (1 subject) were significant ly lower in space. However, compared to the effect of a control tilt maneuver on the ground, even lower blood pressure values might have been expected. Striking were the blood pressure and heart rate surges during the working days in space, often related to stressful moments like live appearances on public TV. Systemic vascular resistance dropped during the night, unlike during bed rest research. Thus, actual spaceflight refuted earlier bed rest findings both for blood pressure levels and for daytime to nig httime changes. The combined observations led to the hypothesis that short- lasting spaceflight may induce strong psychological stress in astronauts. When interpreting space -physiological observations this must be taken into account. PUBLICATION (S) Karemaker JM, Berecki- Gisolf J.

Levine, MD, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas Michael W. Bungo, MD, University of Texas Medical School, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Cardiac Atrophy and Diastolic Dysfunction During and After Long -Duration Spaceflight: Functional Consequences for Orthostatic Intolerance, Exercise Capability, and Risk for Cardiac Arrhythmias (Integrated Cardiovascular) aims to determine the extent, time course, and clinical significance of cardiac atrophy (decrease in the size of the heart muscle) associated with long - duration spaceflight and identify the mechanisms of this atrophy and the functional consequences for crew members who spend extended periods of time in space. E ARTH BENEFITS The information obtained from these spaceflight experiments has relevance for patients after prolonged confinement to bed rest, or chronic reduction in physical activity, as well as for patients with disease processes that alter cardiac stiffness such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and normal ageing. S PACE BENEFITS Once the magnitude, time course, and inciting factors for cardiac atrophy are determined, effective countermeasures currently being developed by the investigators in parallel ground - based experiments may be applied to focus on maintaining cardiac health during long -duration spaceflight. Upon completion of these experiments, a number of important risks for long -duration spaceflight, such as cardiac function and arrhythmia risk, are deemed as manageable by current preventive measures or clearly defined for future countermeasure research. ISS026E015923 - NASA astronaut Catherine (Cady) Coleman, Expedition 26 flight engineer, performs tasks in the Kibo Laboratory of the International Space Station (ISS) while participating in the ambulatory monitoring portion of the Integrated Cardiovascular research experiment. 536 RESULTS To date, several subjects have completed data collection for the Integrated Cardiovascular experiment.

If successful, it will be employed as a countermeasure to the dizziness caused by the blood pressure decrease that many astronauts experience upon returning to the Earth's gravity. E ARTH BENEFITS In addition to benefits for astronauts, millions of people on Earth suffer from orthostatic hypotension and may benefit from information gained from this experiment. S PACE BENEFITS Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure while standing) is a significant problem to astronauts returning from even short- term spaceflight, and the symptoms are more prevalent with longer -term flights. Often when returning home, an astronaut's body is unable to maintain blood pressure above the heart, which leads to decreased blood flow in the brain, resulting in lightheadedness and even fainting. Currently used countermeasures to the problem, such as increasing blood volume with saline, have not proven completely effective. If effective, postflight Midodrine administration may provide a relatively simple method for preventing a significant obstacle to long -term spaceflight, especially explorato ry trips to the moon and Mars. R ESULTS Midodrine is an FDA approved drug used for treating orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is a sudden drop in blood pressure (BP) upon standing or stretching causing dizziness or fainting. This study administered 10 mg of Midodrine to a female space shuttle crew member after landing in a second flight who had experienced head rush or dizzy spell after a previous flight to see if the drug is effective in alleviating these symptoms.

Krikalev participate in tilt table tests on April 11, 2005, in Baikonur, Kazakhstan. 538 cardiac volume were compared between the 2 flights. Data show Midodrine prevented severe falls in stroke volume, cardiac output, systolic pressure, and severe increases in heart rate without increasing blood flow resistance, thus preventing orthostatic hypotension. The significance of this finding is that Midodrine appeared to protect a previously susceptible crew member from post -spaceflight OH. It appeared to do this primarily by maintaining venous blood return without causing increase in blood pressure. These results suggest a single, 10 -mg oral dose of Midodrine shortly after landing may protect crew members from post- spaceflight orthostatic hypotension without causing a rise in blood pressure. A follow -up study with 5 male crew members who had not been susceptible to OH following their previous spaceflights shows there were no statistically significant differences between BP or cardiac output. No subject experienced reduced blood pressure or fainting symptoms during any test. These results, combined with bed rest studies, suggest that Midodrine m ay help prevent post- flight fainting and the drug appeared to be well tolerated in test subjects and could potentially be made available to crew members before reentry, allowing for the maximal benefit at landing (Platts 2004, 2006).

To study the effects of the inhaled dust particles in space, investigators examine the amount of the gaseous nitric oxide, which indicates airway inflammation, exhaled by crew members. During orbital space flight, and in future spac e exploration missions, crew members are exposed to an increased risk of airway inflammation due to inhalation of free -floating dust and particles. Analysis of Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FENO) is a simple method to monitor inflamed airway. R ESULTS Results showed that during microgravity, FENO was significantly lower and fell to nearly half that of preflight value. In the centrifug e experiments, FENO was significantly elevated during exposure to 2 and 3 times the normal gravity. The findings of decreased exhaled NO in space, increased exhaled, and estimated alveolar NO values in hypergravity suggested that gravity - induced changes in alveolar- to-lung capillary gas transfer greatly affect FENO, but there was no clear trend over time during the stays on the International Space Station or after landing. According to current models of NO transport, NO originates from conductive airways and alveoli, each source having a different impact on the exhaled amount. Additionally, NO is taken up by blood in the alveolar compartment. Thus, a change in FENO may come from an alteration of the overall balance between production and blood recapture as well as by a change in the airway production. The principal observation was that exhaled NO is gravity dependent: its values are lowered in microgravity and elevated in seated humans during hypergravity.

It is unknown if astronauts experience the same type of phenomenon from extravehicular activities (EVA). NOA- 2 is designed to compare the amount of nitric oxide that is exhaled before and after an EVA to determine if the astronauts experience decompression sickness. R ESULTS Exhaled nitric oxide was reduced in microgravity (it is important to know the baseline if exhaled nitric oxide is used to monitor airway health in future space activities). A baseline of exhaled nitric oxide in microgravity and reduced pressure was established. Molecular diffusion played an important role in nitric oxide turnover; this has implications for diagnosing and treating airway inflammation. Nitric oxide turnover with multiple exhalation flows and lung nitric oxide diffusing capacity were determined. EVA in the US space suit did not increase exhaled nitric oxide after EVA was completed (increased exhaled nitric oxide values could mean presence of venous gas emboli = decompressions sickness).

Baevsky, MD, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Studying and monitoring the cardiorespiratory system of crew members in microgravity is dependent not only on the central role of this system in the adaptation responses of the entire body, but also on the specific living and working conditions. Loads on the cardiorespiratory system during physical loading (physical exercise, assembly work in outer space) can be extremely high, and optimizing them may become the priority for the medical support system. The goal of the Pnevmocard/Pnevmocard Perfection invest igations is to obtain new scientific information to deepen the understanding of the mechanisms of cardiorespiratory system adaptation to long -term spaceflight conditions. E ARTH BENEFITS The results obtained can be applied to various medical fields, such as clinical and preventative medicine, environmental medicine, and medicine of extreme conditions. The method enables ECG heart rhythm, rate of capillary blood flow in the finger, and air flow rate during breathing to be recorded. This method enables pre - morbid conditions to be diagnosed that precede the development of cardiovascular and respiratory system diseases. S PACE BENEFITS The task of the medical monitoring system is not only to i dentify the occurrence of irregularities in a timely manner, but also to predict them if possible. For space medicine and the practice of crew member medical monitoring, it is desirable to establish patterns of cardiorespiratory interaction in various func tional states of the body, since it is known that disruptions in the regulation of physiological functions usually precede the development of dangerous health conditions. Further study of the cardiorespiratory system on the International Space Station (ISS) using the more modern Pnevmocard equipment makes it possible to obtain new scientific data on the processes of the body's adaptation to long -term spaceflight and develop assessment criteria to predict possible anomalies in the regulatory mechanism. It is presumed that the Pnevmocard experiment will be a model for developing and improving the medical monitoring system for crew members. This involves introducing a prognostic approach to Russian cosmonaut performing the Pnevmocard space experiment on board the ISS . Roscosmos image. 542 evaluating the functional state of crew members; the research goal is t o identify prenosological and premorbid conditions (ie, conditions preceding disease) rather than pathological deviations. These data have practical importance for medical monitoring applications, and in the future it would make sense to apply them in the ongoing work of the medical team at mission control. R ESULTS To date, the main focus of researchers has been on investigating peripheral blood flow as the leading activation mechanism for the body's reaction to orthostatic loading, and virtually no attention has been paid in studies of heart function in microgravity. The investigations carried out on the ISS using the Pnevmocard system were fundamentally a first in space medicine in which comprehensive material was obtained on hemodynamics, heart contract ile function, and its regulation. The results of the Pnevmocard experiment showed that crew members tolerated flight well, fairly fully adapted to long -term microgravity, and their reactions to various flight stages is entirely adequate. This points to the high functional reserves of regulation systems during flight. In the postflight period according to data from orthostatic testing, the body's functional reserves were also maintained at a sufficiently high level.

West, MD, PhD, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Various breathing tests are performed before, during, and after flight to see if pulmonary function is affected by long -term exposure to microgravity or extravehicular activity (EVA or space walks). Changes because of long stays in -orbit, either from removal of gravity itself or from exposure to contaminants in the closed spacecraft environment, adversely affect crew health. Changes associated with spacewalks could indicate an increased risk o f decompression sickness, commonly known as the bends. E ARTH BENEFITS On Earth, many people experience decompression sickness or \"the bends\" while diving. This is a result from the gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and small amounts of other gases) that are breathed in while diving. The gases are under pressure, causing not all the oxygen to be absorbed. Plus, nitrogen produces bubbles in the blood stream when the body is decompressed. The results from PuFF may help develop an improved SCUBA system that can maximize the amount of oxygen absorbed by the body while diving. S PACE BENEFITS There is a large difference in pressure between the inside of the International Space Station (ISS) and in the spacesuit used for EVA. The effects of that difference in pressure pose a significant risk of decompression sickness for spacewalking astronauts (similar to a scuba diver getting the bends) including bubble formation within the blood. Even if symptoms of decompression sickness do not occur, venous gas m icro bubbles can alter pulmonary function. Noninvasive tests of pulmonary function that are altered by changes in the pulmonary blood vessels are an ideal way to follow a subject over the course of multiple EVAs, especially since many EVAs are required for ISS construction and maintenance. This study also investigates the effects on pulmonary function of the buildup of particulates or other contaminating gases that can occur in the closed spacecraft environment. Results from this experiment help to develop countermeasures for pulmonary problems that occur aboard the ISS, further safeguarding crew health. ISS006E07133 - Expedition 6 Flight Engineer Donald Pettit is performing a Pulmonary Function in Flight (PuFF) in the U.S. Laboratory/Destiny. The purpose is to measure changes in the evenness of gas exchange in the lungs and detecting changes in respiratory muscle strength. 547 RESULTS To determine if long -term exposure to microgravity aboard the ISS had any detrimental effects on lung function, pre -and post- flight measurements of lung function were performed on 10 crew members who lived for 130 -196 days on board the ISS. The same crew members also performed lung function measurements while in microgravity. Lung volumes, maximum inspiratory and expiratory flows, respiratory muscle strength, resting gas exchange, and numerous indices of the uniformity of lung function were measured on several occasions before fligh t, and again on several occasions following return to Earth's gravity. Results show that, unlike many other organ systems in the human body, lung function returns to normal almost immediately after long -duration exposure to microgravity. The most important, and somewhat surprising, aspect is the almost complete absence of a change in lung function before and after spending 4 -6 months in low -Earth orbit, despite the fact that the lung is highly sensitive to gravity, as shown by previous in- flight studies. The magnitude of the observed changes in the 10 subjects were so small that the conclusions, of no lasting effect of microgravity on lung function, would hold even if the study had included a greater sampling group. Investigators uphold that the subtle chang es in lung function that persist soon after landing are possibly due to a reduction in circulating blood volume and alterations in lung fluid balance, and while statistically observable, have little physiological consequence. This finding is significant an d encouraging since it proposes that lung function is not a concern under the normal oxygen and pressure environment such as that inside the ISS (Prisk 2005, 2006, 2008).

Baevsky, MD, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia Irina I. Funtova, PhD, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The cardiovascular system and respiration play a central role in the body's life support during changes in the environment. Establishment of ideal conditioning in the cardiorespiratory system depends on the regulatory mechanisms' ability to effectively control the interaction between the activity of the heart, vascular system, and respiratory apparatus. The Study of Vegetative Regulation of the Cardiorespiratory System in Weightlessness (Puls/Puls Perfection ) obtains new scientific informatio n to improve the understanding of the cardiorespiratory system's mechanisms for adapting to long -term spaceflight. E ARTH BENEFITS In the process of the examination, pneumo -tachograms, electrocardiograms, and photoplethysmograms are recorded, both at rest and during functional loadings. Using contemporary mathematical models of the regulation of the cardiovascular system, the following are evaluated: current functional status of the cardiovascular system, status of the sympathetic and parasympathetic compo nent of cardiovascular system regulation, and the reserve capabilities of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. S PACE BENEFITS For space medicine and for the practice of medical monitoring of crew members, it is important to establish patterns of ca rdiorespiratory interaction when the body is at various functional statuses, since, as is well known, disruptions to the regulation of physiological functions usually precede the development of dangerous disruptions to homeostasis. The scientific results obtained are used to improve the system for medically monitoring spaceflight crew members. In addition, the materials obtained are highly important for understanding individual particulars Cosmonaut during the Study of Vegetative Regulation of the Cardiorespiratory System in Weightlessness experiment session on the International Space Station. Ros cosmos image. 549 of the process of human adaptation to long -term weightlessness and o pen the door to creating a system for predicting the risk of developing health problems during flight. RESULTS Ten ISS Russian crew members took part in the Puls experiment. The results of this scientific experiment showed that one important factor for evaluating the functional status of a crew member's body was the degree of stress on regulatory mechanisms at various stages of flight. In addition, it was demonstrated that lo ng-term stress on the regulatory system leads to reduced functional reserves in the body. It was established that the tests performed in flight, involving set tempos for breathing and holding the breath at the inhalation and exhalation, were highly informa tive. One of the most important results of the experiments is the discovery of a direct link between the nature of adaptation to weightlessness and the individual's type of involuntary regulation. The results of these studies were highly important not onl y theoretically, but also practically. First, knowledge of the individual type of involuntary regulation made possible the prediction of the nature of the crew member's adaptation reaction during flight. Second, evaluation of the status of autonomous regul ation provided important information for the medical monitoring system, since disruptions to the involuntary balance that was developed in flight, shown as changes in the cardiac rhythm, significantly precede metabolic and structural disruptions in affecte d organs. Given an existing decline in self -regulation, the body is still capable, for a time, of maintaining high performance (while stress on the regulatory system is increasing). But then a break in adaptation may occur, in the form of various disruptio ns, including disruptions in the cardiovascular system. Thirdly, the increasing stress on the regulatory system during the flight required serious attention from the medical monitoring service, as a risk factor for the development of pathological changes. The data obtained showed there was promise in further development of the proposed methods as applied to the task of improving the system for medical monitoring of crew members' health during long -term spaceflight.

Despite many studies, the origin of the cardiovascular deconditioning syndrome still remains unclear. A better knowledge of orthostatic intolerance following microgravity is crucial to the health of future space explorers on long -duration space expeditions. R ESULTS In this study, the non -linear dynamical control of heart rate fluctuations, quantified by the approximate entropy method, was demonstrated to be affected immediately after spaceflight in orthostatic tolerant cosmonauts. The difference in approximate entropy between standing and supine (lying face up) in baseline conditions was shown. The diffe rence in approximate entropy was not present in the first days after return to Earth. The differences between standing and supine position disappeared immediately after spaceflight. If these changes are part of the mechanism to help maintain orthostatic to lerance, they should be explored further in the future. Up until now, no methods have been found successful in either detecting the sudden onset of orthostatic intolerance or even the prediction of it. Therefore, the exploration of non -linear fluctuations might be of interest in an orthostatic intolerant population. After 25 days the stand response was again similar to the preflight situation, indicating that the astronauts recovered rather quickly after their spaceflight. The fact that even orthostatic tol erant cosmonauts present with changes in non- linear heart rate control might open possibilities to study these control mechanisms in orthostatic intolerant astronauts.

Muscle fiber samples are taken from crew members before and after flight, and analyzed for changes in structural and chemical properties. MRI and ultrasound tests and electrode stimulation are conducted to help assess muscle and tendon changes caused by microgravity exposure . E ARTH BENEFITS By improving the understanding of the mechanisms behind loss of muscle mass in space and developing appropriate and effective countermeasures to any adverse effects, we can also draw conclusions and get insights into certain muscular conditions on Earth. An adaptation of countermeasures originally developed for in -space use by astronauts, or newly developed ground -based countermeasures, could be used within rehabilitation of patients affected by such medical conditions. S PACE BENEFITS By improving the understanding of the mechanisms behind loss of muscle mass in space, we in turn can develop more effective countermeasures for the crews, whether pharmacological, dietary or exercise -based in order to alleviate such adverse effects and hence improve/maintain the health and performance of our astronauts in orbit. R ESULTS No results are available yet as the investigation is still ongoing. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication.

During the Sonocard, microscopic oscillations associated with heart rate, respiration, and motor activity are recorded. The study focuses on cardiorespiratory homeostasis and mechanisms for regulating the cardiorespiratory system. E ARTH BENEFITS The results obtained are useful in various fields of medicine: clinical and preventive medicine, environmental medicine, and medicine for extreme environments. S PACE BENEFITS Implementation of the experiment has opened the door to creating a fundamentally new type of medical monitoring system, one that allows the acquisition of information necessary for assessing the functional status of the crew during nighttime, with a minimal amount of work time required for performing medical ex periments. In addition, this system could become an important element for assuring safety of manned flights, since it allows for the transition from periodic to constant monitoring. R ESULTS The main scientific result of the Sonocard experiment was confirmation of the capability to evaluate sleep quality and the effectiveness of restoring functional reserves without the use of cumbersome polysomnography equipment and the reality of using this new approach to perform practical tasks of medical monitoring. Fundamental scientific results included obtaining systematic data on pulse and respiratory rate during sleep in long -term microgravity and obtaining systematic data on the status of various ele ments of the involuntary regulation system during sleep in long -term weightlessness. Sonocard was also used in determining the Russian cosmonaut put the Sonocard device into place before sleep during performance of the Pneumocard experiment during spaceflight.

Finally, it was utilized in obtaining the first nighttime recordings after the performance of an extravehicular activity (EVA); it was shown that each subsequent EVA was characterized by higher stress on the regulatory mechanisms. This required appropriate mobilization of the body's functional reserv es. Overall, the results of the experiments performed showed the possibility of obtaining real -time information on cosmonauts' functional status and on processes for restoring functional reserves at various phases of flight .

A newly developed thermosensor for core temperature is applied, which enables non - invasive study and is very convenient for core temperature measurement during rest and exercise in weightlessness. S PACE APPLICATION The information obtained by this study leads to a better basic understanding of heat transfer and the thermal regulation in humans under weightless conditions. Such data helps with monitoring and maintenance of astronaut health and well -being in orbit. E ARTH APPLICATION By studying alterations in heat balance, thermoregulation and circadian temperature rhythms in space, we also get a greater understanding behind the mechanisms by which these systems work on Earth. R ESULTS Core body temperature rises faster during exercise on the ISS than on Earth, probably caused by fluid shifts and modified heat flow away from the body. Data indicated that adaptation can be seen in the first 6 weeks on the ISS with an increase in core body temperature by around 1 -1.5\u00b0C though this settles down to an increase of around 0.5 - 1\u00b0C above preflight core body temperature as the mission extends. With the core temperature rising faster on the ISS, it was also noticeable that the body temperature to ok longer to cool back down to core temperature after exercise. The measurement of the core body temperature together with cardiovascular measurements during the NASA VO2Max protocol can be used to evaluate the subject's state of fatigue, which is very important for optimizing mission success. The non- invasive double sensor could be a very useful diagnostic tool for recognizing early warning signs of fatigue during, for example, spacewalks in orbit. On Earth, firefighters (to recognize exhaustion/overheat ing) or jet pilots, steel workers, miners, soldiers in combat, divers, etc, working in extreme conditions could all benefit from this technology. It could also be used for monitoring during critical hospital operations such as heart surgery or for monitoring babies in incubators. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. 560 TEST OF REACTION AND ADAPTATION CAPABILITIES (TRAC) Research Area: Cardiovascular and Respiratory System Expedition(s): 14 and 15 Principal Investigator(s): Otmar Bock, PhD, German Sport University, Cologne, Germany RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Test of Reaction and Adaptation Capabilities (TRAC) tests the theory of brain adaptation during spaceflight by testing hand- eye coordination before, during, and after the mission. E ARTH BENEFITS The results of this investigation may lead to improved medical treatments for patients who suffer from coordination deficits and neurological disorders. S PACE BENEFITS Understanding how the brain undergoes long -term adaptation to weightlessness will lead to improvement in procedures that require precise motor skills. R ESULTS The TRAC data suggested that this problem is caused by the brain having difficulty simultaneously processing a nu mber of different challenges. This difficulty is also observed under conditions of stress. The process of adaptation itself may also introduce an extra neural \"cost\" that decreases performance of certain tasks.

Spaceflight accelerates the aging process and we must understand this to determine the need for specific countermeasures. Data will be collected before, during, and after spaceflight to assess inflammation of the artery walls, and changes in blood vessel properties and cardiovascular fitness. EARTH BENEFITS This experiment will contribute to obtaining a better understanding of the mechanisms that might contribute to premature ageing of the cardiovascular system and detect early markers of potential atherosclerosis (condition in which fatty material collects along the walls of arteries) and inflammation. S PACE BENEFITS The expected long -term outcome of this research involves the development of appropriate countermeasures to prevent astronauts undertaking long -duration spaceflights from experiencing long -term cardiovascular health problems as a result of their time spent in space. RESULTS After 6 months in space, pulse wave transit time was increased while carotid artery distensibility was significantly reduced (P= 0.03, n= 6). Because walking or jogging for 4 0 minutes a day for 3 months reduces carotid and peripheral artery stiffness in older sedentary subjects, Vascular investigated whether astronauts who maintained physical fitness exhibited less change in pulse wave transit time to the finger. Although puls e wave transit time from preflight to postflight tended to be faster post- flight, there was no relationship to the change in physical fitness. Multiple factors are speculated to contribute to increased arterial stiffness with aging, including increased vas oconstrictor or reduced vasodilator factors, structural breakdown of elastin, accumulation of collagen, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and increased extracellular matrix cross -linking. Animal models for unloading (spaceflight analogs) indicate cellular hypertrophy in the middle cerebral artery and increased cross -linkage in major elastic arteries. The possible roles of these factors related to the increased arterial stiffness with spaceflight have not been investigated in astronauts, and the Vas cular experiment provides data to test these mechanisms. 562 PUBLICATION (S) Hughson RL, Shoemaker JK, Arbeille P.

A Lower Body Negative Pressure program runs in parallel to Vessel Imaging. Flow velocity changes in the aorta and the middle cerebral and femoral arteries are used to quantify the cardiovascular response to fluid shifts. Vessel Imaging aims to optimize the countermeasures used routinely during long -duration space missions. The aim of the Integrated Cardiovascular experiment is to determine the degree, development, and clinical significance of cardiac atrophy and identify its mechanisms. E ARTH BENEFITS In response to gravitational stress and exercise, human blood vessel diameters change. After spaceflight it seems that vessels that normally should contract to maintain blood pressure do not perform as well as they did before the (long -duration) spacefligh t. This research holds significance to similar conditions on Earth as they are the same processes that occur in elderly patients. As such findings from this experiment will help in improving and maintaining the health and well -being of an elderly populatio n and provide insight into other cardiovascular conditions on Earth that encompass a similar impaired cardiovascular function. S PACE BENEFITS By improving the understanding of the mechanisms behind changes to the cardiovascular system in space we in turn can develop more effective countermeasures, whether pharmacological, dietary or exercise -based, in order to alleviate such adverse effects and hence improve/maintain the health and performance of astronauts working and living in orbit. RESULTS Following conclusion of the in -orbit activities for the Vessel Imaging experiment in May 2013, the data has been undergoing analysis prior to publication of results. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication.

Moore Jr, PhD, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake and Submaximal Estimates of VO2max Before, During, and After Long Duration International Space Station Missions (VO2max) documents changes in maximum oxygen uptake for crew members aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during long -duration missions. E ARTH BENEFITS The data obtained from this study provides valuable insight into the aerobic capacity of teams in closed environments on Earth such as arctic bases and submarines. S PACE BENEFITS The results from this experiment provide NASA and the ISS International Partners definitive data to determine if submaximal exercise testing provides an accurate assessment of aerobic capacity during and following long -duration spaceflight. R ESULTS VO2max declines very early upon arrival to microgravity and slowly recovers during flight, but the mean change for all subjects tested does not recover to preflight levels. The mean change in VO2max on R+1 is - 14%. This is not significantly different than that observed during the last flight test. A substantial amount of variability exists between subjects in their responses during flight. Apparently, submaximal estimates of VO2max do not reliably track change in actual VO2max. Analysis of data from PFE -OUM is ongoing, conclusive results will be published upon completion of data analysis. P UBLICATION (S) Moore Jr AD, Lynn PA, Feiveson AH.

Orthostati c intolerance occurring after spaceflight can interfere with normal brain function of crew members during re -entry and landing. E ARTH BENEFITS This study has great implications in the medical community on Earth. Currently, there are no specific tests for orthostatic intolerance for it is not completely understood what causes orthostatic intolerance. What this experiment may lead to is a better understanding and improved treatment programs for orthostatic intolerance. S PACE BENEFITS While a person is standing (orthostasis), blood has a tendency to pool in the legs and feet. This collecting of blood in the lower body can lead to a blood pressure drop in the upper body, and, if less blood gets to the brain, a n individual may experience dizziness or fainting. It is a condition called orthostatic intolerance, and it can affect crew members for several days after returning from space. The exact mechanism that creates orthostatic intolerance is still not completely understood. When blood pooling is detected in the lower limbs, the body's normal response is tightening blood vessels below the skin to maintain blood pressure and blood supply to the brain. Treatments for this condition are currently under investigation (one is the drug Midodrine, which is being tested on crew members). This study's method of visualizing blood flow of the subcutaneous vessels and the venoarterial (V -A) reflex allows for possible treatments in the future. During the Xenon1 experiment, the crew member is injected with small amounts of 133Xenon, which will act as a tracer. Xenon1 will test the local veno- arteriolar reflex in an effort to understand the source of, and ways to combat, postflight orthostatic intolerance. NASA's J ohnson Space Center image. 567 RESULTS The last group of subjec ts for this experiment returned after Expedition 5. Data from all subjects were collected successfully. Findings show venous -arteriolar reflex reduced subcutaneous blood flow by 37 +/ - 9% before flight and by 64 +/ - 8% following landing, with no statistical difference between the 2 responses. The mean arterial pressures and heart rates in supine astronauts were very similar before and after flight. These data indicate that this reflex is not attenuated by weightlessness and suggests that the venous -arteriol ar reflex is not a contributor to postflight orthostatic intolerance (Gabrielsen 2006).

Goncharov, PhD, Institute of Medical and Biolog ical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Study of Processes for Informational Support of In -Flight Medical Support using an Onboard Medical Information System Integrated into the Information Control System of the ISS Russian Segment (BIMS/BIMS Perfection ) uses telemedicine technologies to collect information by non- contact means from the ear, nose, and throat (ENT), gums, teeth, and small areas of skin from International Space Station (ISS) crews for medical support of manned spaceflights and in- flight biomedical research. E ARTH BENEFITS The experience gained and data obtained from analyzing the experiment results can be used to develop procedures and equipment for telemedicine service in remote locations o n Earth where medical diagnostic capabilities are limited. S PACE BENEFITS Procedures and software developed for the BIMS experiment are used to carry out baseline and routine examinations of crew members in the MARS- 500 experiment by the BIMS medical supp ort team. An integrated information support network for the biomedical support of manned spaceflights is being developed from this work, which increases the effectiveness of the medical support of manned spaceflights, enables modern real- time information t ransmission methods and technologies to be introduced into the practice of medical support of space missions, and it standardizes the information support of biomedical research aboard the ISS Russian Segment. R ESULTS BIMS experimental sessions confirmed the feasibility of performing otoscopic, nasal, pharyngeal, dental, and dermatoscopic examinations in spaceflight conditions. At the same time, a large amount of scientific information was obtained Example of static images of an ear (top), n ose ( middle), and throat (bottom ) examination.

BMI aims to investigate blood pressure circadian rhythms in microgravity. RESULTS The Blood Pressure Measurement Instrument was successfully tested on the Marco Polo (Soyuz 4S/3S exchange) and Cervantes (Soyuz 7S/6S exchange) missions i n 2002 and 2003 and also used as part of the Circa experiment during the DELTA (Soyuz 8S/7S exchange) mission in 2004. This International Space Station (ISS) experiment investigated blood pressure circadian rhythms and was dedicated to finding out if, and in which way, these change in weightlessness. The repeated use of the BMI by astronauts on the ISS successfully showed that permanent monitoring of cardiovascular activities can be achieved without major interference in daily activities, even while perform ing a highly demanding job.

It is a non -gravity dependent exercise device that has been designed for resistance exercise training primarily to counter neuro -muscular de -conditioning. The exercise device provides resistance ag ainst the subject through the use of a spinning mass which must be rotated by winding up and releasing an actuation belt. The Flywheel Exercise Device is a compact lightweight, resistive exercise device using the flywheel principle, which allows for back, trunk and upper and lower limb exercises. It is a multi- exercise device that will be tested as an onboard exercise countermeasure allowing for the squat, dead lift and heel raise and other important exercises. RESULTS The purpose of the on- orbit activities is to verify the proper operational use of the hardware onboard the ISS and assess a subset of the device's exercise modes from an operational point of view and with regard to vibrations. Frank de Winne, who was the E SA astronaut who undertook the on -orbit activities, was able to confirm that the exercise device withstood transportation to the ISS and was working normally. The vibrations caused by the Flywheel Exercise Device exercise protocols on board the ISS were me asured. Such measurements are performed for each new training device as the strong movements caused by the device during use may disrupt the vibration- free condition for other experiments. This investigation is complete and all results are published. Frank de Winne training on t he Flywheel Exercise Device in October 2009 aboard the International Space Station .

This hardware is a prototype that will give flight surgeons more options to treat ill or injured crew members during future long -duration exploration missions. E ARTH BENEFITS IVGEN technology could be used on Earth to generate IV fluid in Third World countries where medical resources are limited. S PACE BENEFITS Because of mass and volume limitations, space vehicles cannot carry sufficient IV fluid for medical contingencies. A filtering and mixing system that can make IV fluid in situ provides the treatment capability without the mass and volume const raints. IVGEN was designed and will be tested to meet that need. R ESULTS IVGEN generated intravenous (IV) fluid from ISS Water Processing Assembly (WPA) potable water using a water purification technique and pharmaceutical mixing system. The system operated onboard the ISS during May 2010 and produced 6, 1.5 liter bags of purified water. Two of these bags were mixed with sodium chloride to make 0.9% normal saline solution. These 2 bags were returned to Earth to test for contamination compliance with United States Pharmacopeia (USP) requirements. On -orbit results showed IVGEN met the experimental success criteria with the exception of the salt concentration. Problems with a large air bubble in the first bag of purified water resulted in a slightly too salty solution of 117% (USP permits a range from 95% to 105% of the target value ) of the target value of 0.9 g/L. This problem can be resolved by placing a gas - liquid separator filter immediately upstream of the liquid inlet to the accumulator. The Glenn researchers test the effectiveness of an IV fluid mixing method on NASA's zero- gravity aircraft. NASA's Glenn Research Center image. Seen is the IVGEN subassembly that purifies water coming from the space vehicle. This subassembly also quantifies water cleanliness, the water flow rate within the system, and mix ing uniformity in the IV solution. NASA's Glenn Research Center image. 574 second bag did not have enough salt premeasured in the mixing bag resulting in a slightly low salt concentration of 93.8% of the target value. Improvements for an operational system are being carried out based on lessons learned from the ISS experiment and include testing of the purification capacity and shelf life storage technique for the deionization (DI) resin cartridges (McQuillen 2011).

The medical data collected aboard are sent to the ground immediately, whereby doctors can quickl y monitor and check health status of the ISS crew members. E ARTH BENEFITS This mission establishes that space explorers can receive medical healthcare utilizing commercial off the shelf (COTS) medical equipment and communicating with medical doctor s on the Earth to share test results using a Windows -based application. Although further user -friendliness needs to be improved, this system could allow people in remote communities to receive expert advice and support from medical doctors in a distant place. S PACE BENEFITS Crew healthcare is one of the most important things for long -duration stays in space, or to explore other planets in the future. Therefore a platform of integr ated medical systems needs to be constructed. Monitoring cardio autonomic functions is important for improving crew health technology during long -duration spaceflight. RESULTS Various medical data was collected and downlinked to investigate the performance of the system. After measuring the data , the crew recorded their feedbac k and suggestions to assist in the evaluation and upgrade of the system. JAXA astronaut Satoshi Furukawa's 5 and a half -month miss ion allowed for the execution of an initial checkout of equipment and 3 sessions of data acquisition. A digital Holter, a pulse oximeter, a USB camera, a stethoscope, and an electroencephalograph were used to measure each healthcare data. Astronaut Satoshi Furukawa with an Electroencephalograph . JAXA image. 577 The collection of medical data was loaded into the ODK software on the laptop and several graphs were generated. Astronaut Furukawa, a medical doctor, evaluated the operability, visibility, and data interfaces of the ODK system and had discussions with ground support medical doctors while reviewing the electronic medical recoding system (electronic chart) simultaneously through the real -time health consultation between ISS and Tsukuba Space center. Astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, who is not a medical doctor, has performed 3 to 5 sessions of data acquisition. He has also evaluated the operability, visibility, and data interfaces. Real -time downlink from the Electric Stethoscope was performed using the wireless communication technology that allow ed ground support doctors to clearly hear the sound of astronaut Akihiko Hoshide's heartbeat. This was the first time the clear sound of a heart's beat was simultaneously shared between ISS and the ground. In this session, we used S -band for the voice comm unication and K -band for data downlink of USB camera image and auscultated heart sound. This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected.

For example the explanation for the use of non- specialist was added on the electric chart, such as some reference nominal values of each medical measurement data and some brief description that measurement data means. In addition, a thermometer, a myodynamometer, and a sphygmanometer were newly added into ODK system JAXA image Pictured is a r eal-time health examination using electric stethoscope.

Kozlovskaya, MD, PhD, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Acade my of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Mechanism of Activity and Effectiveness of Various Countermeasures Intended to Prevent Disruptions to the Motor Apparatus in Microgravity (Profilaktika) investigation is designed to assess the effecti veness of various physical exercise regimens in maintaining the body's adaptive capabilities in microgravity through the use of tests based on the use of modern measurement technologies. Each session of the experiment consists of several tests: locomotion (on the treadmill), cycle ergometer (on the cycle ergometer), and strength (using the force loader). During each test, gas analysis and blood analysis are performed, and an EKG was recorded. E ARTH BENEFITS The results of the experiment may be used for spo rts medicine, training civil aviation pilots, and training people for work in extreme conditions. S PACE BENEFITS The countermeasures system for short-term missions prevents the development of dehydration, orthostatic instability, physical deconditioning, and loss of muscular and vascular tone. If the duration of the flight extends to several months or a year, the countermeasures program is aimed at minimizing the effects of weightlessness and other detrimental factors, reducing the medical risk in flight, and easing the process of readaptation after return to Earth. Despite the use of countermeasures, during and after long -term spaceflights various bodily systems consistently exhibit a number of changes that are the residual manifestations of the effects of weightlessness. Based on the experimental data obtained, updates are being performed in the program for training cosmonauts for long -term spaceflights. Performing a test on the treadmill. Roscosmos image. 579 RESULTS The results of the Profilaktika experiment indicated that the crew member's state of physical conditioning has clearly marked phases. During the first phase, their performance declined significantly, with su bsequent restoration of the preflight (or near -preflight) level. This pattern was clearly reflected in the results of all tests. It must also be noted that the cost of the locomotion load was significantly higher than that of the cycle ergometer. This may be related to the fact that during performance of a running test with a load equivalent to 70% of one's body weight \u2014a load that is absent during the cycle ergometer test\u2014 the physiological cost was determined through activity, not just dynamically, but thro ugh the tonic muscle system, which required greater expenditures to support its functionality. Comparative analysis of the various modes of physical training used aboard the International Space Station demonstrated the high effectiveness of intense exerc ise characterized by sequencing intensive walking and quick running (so -called interval training) and the significantly lower effectiveness of training in the moderate capacity zone with an aerobic energy supply. Interval training provides a high level of physical performance and levels out the negative changes in the oxygen transport system caused by microgravity. The mechanisms of energy supply for muscle activity remained at the preflight level in a group of crew members who performed interval training in the course of one flight, while another group who trained at lower intensity exhibited a significantly higher physiological and energy costs (less efficient). Analysis of physical performance showed a significantly higher level in the locomotion test, which makes it possible to assess not only the level of physical conditioning. It was also possible to asses the physiological load caused by the need to maintain posture, which is reflected in the magnitude of shifts in autonomous functions and in energy su pply mechanisms.

This helps researchers deve lop more stable and reliable pharmaceutical countermeasures suitable for future long -duration missions beyond low -Earth orbit. E ARTH BENEFITS The results of this investigation help to understand the effects of adverse environments on medicines, and assists Earth -based explorers in making healthy choices for long -term exploration of remote and adverse habitats like the Antarctic, Arctic, and the world oceans. S PACE BENEFITS Results of this investigation provide important information on the susceptibility of select pharmaceuticals to adverse environmental factors encountered during space missions. R ESULTS The Stability -Pharmacotherapeutic investigation studied the effects of radiation in space on medicine at varying time intervals. Thirty -five medications were examined in this experiment. The study found that 6 medic ations stowed for the longest duration of 28 months aboard the ISS showed physical alterations as compared with only 2 medications stowed on the ground for the same length of time. Also, 9 medications stowed for 28 months aboard the ISS met United States P harmacopeia (USP) potency standards versus 17 medications stowed for the same length of time on the ground. Several formulations had lower potency, in general, after storage in space, and a larger amount of formulations failed USP potency requirements afte r each storage period interval in space than on Earth. The potency degradation rate was found to be faster for several medications in space than on Earth; this was the particular case for light - sensitive medications and may be the result of exposure to hig her amounts of radiation aboard the spacecraft than on the ground. Repackaging of solid dosage forms from the original commercial containers into the custom -manufactured containers used to store medications in the space medical kits may also have had an influence on the stability of the medications. These findings will contribute to the future development of space resilient medications and medicine packaging technology (Du 2011).

Harris, PhD, York University, North York, Ontario, Canada RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Bodies in the Space Environment (BISE) aims to find out how input from the senses is combined and used to make judgments of object orientation in space. Tes ting before going into space, in the early and late periods of long periods of spaceflight, as well as after returning to Earth, enables researchers to find out how judgments of orientation change as a result of weightlessness. E ARTH BENEFITS Tools developed for the BISE can also help people on Earth who experience balancing problems or are prone to falling, including seniors and people with conditions such as Parkinson's disease. S PACE BENEFITS Findings from BISE are expected to help astronauts perceive up and down in microgravity, which creates a safer work environment in space. BISE uses the space environment to improve the safety of space travel by designing countermeasures against specific problems. R ESULTS BISE measured perceived orientation in 7 astronauts before, during, and after long -duration spaceflight using the oriented character recognition test (OCHART), shape from shading, and luminous line probes (Dyde 2006). OCHART measured the orientation at which a letter probe was perceptually upright. On Earth, OCHART was performed while upright and lying right -side- down. By varying the background orientation and the orientation of the subjects, the relative contribution of vision, gravity, and the body were determined. On the International Space Station (ISS), crew members performed OCHART early and late in flight. A reduction in visual influence was observed in flight, with lower -than- baseline levels maintained throughout 6 months in orbit. Visual influence w as still lower than baseline levels several months after returning to Earth. It was concluded that sensory weightings were altered by long -term exposure to microgravity and did not recover within 6 months of return to Earth.

The effects are often compounded by the isolation, confinement, and the lack of normal psychosocial interactions on space missions. Cardiac Adapted Sleep Parameters Electrocardiogram Recorder ( CASPER) investigates the use of cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC) as a surrogate marker for sleep stability in comparison to a variety of other traditional markers of sleep and circadian rhythm disruption in extreme environments. The two primary study measurements are a single lead e lectrocardiogram and a subjective sleep diary that was completed both pre -sleep and post -sleep. S PACE APPLICATION CASPER also resulted in the development of a non -contact, non -invasive, state -of-the-art Radio Frequency Impedance Interrogation (RFII) hemodynamic monitor. The chest -mounted unit is worn on various missions as a technology demonstrator and in conjunction with traditional electrocardiogram ( ECG) to correlate both signals. Both the peak and period of the RFII signal are used for analysis as the signal results from hemodynamic motion as opposed to cardiac autonomic activity. The RFII signal and data correlate significantly in both the low - and high- frequency spectrums against both CPC and traditional ECG HRV. Preliminary research is also completed using the RFII signal for unique subject identification. E ARTH APPLICATION The results and technology developme nt from CASPER and this research create groundbreaking advancements and remove many of the impediments involved in the monitoring of physiology and performance in extreme operational environments ranging from spaceflight to remote habitats on Earth. RESULTS CASPER showed the effective use of CPC in a variety of extreme operational environments by demonstrating the strong correlation between traditional ECG heart rate variability (HRV) and CPC high -frequency components across all missions. In contrast there was a weak correlation between ECG HRV and CPC low -frequency components across all missions . This was ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter wear s the Cardiac Adapted Sleep Parameters Electrocardiogram Recorder vest right before going to sleep. ESA image. 585 contr ibuted largely to the noise component in the low- frequency band of ECG HRV signal. In an examination of individual nights from all missions, the ECG HRV signal measured 51 nights >80% in the low frequency range. In contrast, the CPC signal measured only 1 night >80% in the low - frequency range. Correlation for the CPC signal was also much stronger to responses from the subjective sleep diary questions than traditional ECG HRV. It was clear that that the CPC signal was far more closely aligned with the subjec tive feedback of the crews across all environments in regards to their sleep quality, patterns, and experiences. The data also strongly indicated that CPC is a valuable and useful tool for monitoring sleep stability in extreme and operational environments. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. 586 CULTURAL DETERMINATIONS OF CO-WORKING , PERFORMANCE AND ERROR MANAGEMENT IN SPACE OPERATIONS (CULT) Research Area: Human Behavior and Performance Expedition(s): 13, 14 Principal Investigator(s): Gro M. Sandal, PhD, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway RESEARCH OBJECTIVES One of the complex and previously neglected areas in aerospace research concerns the effect of cultural variability within the astronaut corps a nd in the more complex environment of multinational space operations. The overall aim of the proposed project is to assess the potential effects of individually and culturally related values, attitudes and behavioral preferences on operational and interper sonal factors in relation to multinational space missions, including such aspects as crew interaction and cohesion, group identification, leadership, conflict resolution, decision -making, and error management. Specifically, Cultural Determinations of Co -working, Performance, and Error Management in Space Operations (Cult) investigates the impact of such differences for co -working and co -living of resident crews aboard the International Space Station (ISS). E ARTH BENEFITS Results can also be used in international diplomatic relations as well as in international business ventures to better understand other countries and their cultures. S PACE BENEFITS This research gives us a better understanding of the way the different agencies work together, the trouble spots to work on, and the cultural differences to respect. This will provide more efficient use of the station because there will be less conflict. R ESULTS Data from the experiment is currently being analyzed and processed prior to results publication. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication.

Kanas, MD, Veterans' Affairs Medical Center and University of California, San Francisco; San Franc isco, California RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Weekly questionnaires are completed to identify and define important interpersonal factors that may impact the performance of the crew and ground support personnel during International Space Station (ISS) missions. Results are used to improve the ability of future crew members to interact safely and effectively with each other and ground support personnel. The results may also be used to improve methods for crew selection, training, and in -flight support. E ARTH BENEFITS Results from this study help to improve the behavioral performance of people living and working under similar isolated conditions here on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS The Interactions studies are expected to yield information about the importance of language and dialect commonality and the relationships of crew heterogeneity and cultural comfort to crew tension and cohesion. Emphasis on culture and language is included on the ISS where there are more international interactions. Identification and defi nition of these important interpersonal factors leads to improved methods for crew selection, training, in -flight support, and transitioning back to society insuring successful space missions. R ESULTS Long -duration stays aboard an orbital space station re present but one step in the evolution of human space exploration, which also aims at much more ambitious endeavors such as an outpost on the moon or an expedition to Mars, and these can produce serious psychological and interpersonal consequences. After re viewing the body of behavioral research results for space crew members, the International Academy of Astronautics Study Group on Psychology and Culture in Long -Duration Space Missions issued a final report outlining a set of recommendations for long -durati on future human space missions, including both transit and planetary surface operations on the moon, Mars, and beyond. This information is designed to provide guidelines for astronaut selection and training, in- flight monitoring and support, and postflight recovery and re -adaptation. (1) Group survival training should be considered since crew members had mentioned its cohesive effect on a team. (2) Future spaceflight crew members should train together in flight operations. If they can better know each other and understand their strong and weak points, they can learn to solve problems in space. The longer they train together, the smoother their future interactions will be. (3) Training should also involve people from mission control to enhance the bonding and improve the communication 588 between crew members and people on the ground. (4) Group sensitivity training for astronauts and cosmonauts could reduce the influence of personal, cultural, national, and other peculiarities of behavior during the mission. (5) C onflict resolution and communication training already widely used in modern industry could be tailored for use among space crews, with special attention to cultural differences. This includes the necessity to study the language of one's foreign crewmates, with special focus on words and terms describing everyday life so that crew members can discuss not only their work, but also talk about other social aspects of their lives. (6) The opinion of crew members should be solicited and taken into account regardi ng access to logistics, fair workload distribution, etc, so that potential sources of quarrels can be identified and offset. (7) Crew members sharing space aboard the ISS should have many lines of communication, both among themselves and with people on Ear th. (8) Finally, research needs to be done involving the effects of increased crew autonomy during manned space missions. Crew members working on the lunar surface or participating in an expedition to Mars will be more autonomous and less dependent on miss ion control direction and support than crew members engaged in an in- orbit mission. Little is known about how this autonomy will affect operations, and the ISS could provide a test bed for studies that explore this issue (Kanas 2008, 2009).

Stuster, PhD, CPE, Anacapa Sciences, Inc, Santa Barbara, California RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Behavioral Issues Associated with Isolation and Confinement: Review and Analysis of Astronaut Journals (Journals) obtains information on behavioral and human issues that are relevant to the design of equipment and procedures and sustained human performance during extended-duration missions. Study results provide information to help prepare for future missions to low - Earth orbit and beyond. E ARTH BENEFITS Results from this study help to improve the behavioral performance of people living and working under a variety of conditions here on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS Studies conducted on Earth have shown that analyzing the content of journals and diaries is an effective method for identifying the issues that are most important to a person. The method is based on the reasonable assumption that the frequency that an issue or category of issues is mentioned in a journal reflects the importance of that issue or category to the writer. The tone of each entry (positive, negative, or neutral) and phase of the expedition also are variables of interest. Study results will lead to recommendations for the design of equ ipment, facilities, procedures, and training to help sustain behavioral adjustment and performance during long - duration space expeditions to the ISS, asteroids, moon, Mars, and beyond. R ESULTS Results from the Journals investigation provided the first measurable data from space operations on which to base a rank -ordering of behavioral issues. Personal journals generated by 10 NASA astronauts who lived and worked aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for an average of 188 days were analyzed to obtain information concerning a wide range of behavioral issues. Responses to questions asked before, during, and after the expeditions suggested that living and working aboard the ISS were not as dif ficult as the astronauts anticipated before starting their 6 -month tours of duty. Astronauts reported that they benefited personally from writing in their journals because it helped them maintain perspective on their work and relations with others. It was apparent from the journal entries analyzed that conditions aboard the ISS were far better than tolerable but short of what was necessary to support optimum human performance for sustained periods of routine operations. Crews performed admirably, as expecte d, and the journals contained many positive statements about living and working in space; however, the tone and content of some entries described problems and conveyed levels of frustration and annoyance. It was also noticed that the crew members 592 shared an unusually well- developed sense of self- awareness. The crew members participating in this study demonstrated a keen awareness of their capabilities and limitations, a personal quality believed to distinguish them from nearly everyone else. Recommendations include application of study results and continuation of the experiment to obtain additional data as crew size increases and operations evolve. P UBLICATION (S) Stuster JW.

Salnitsky, PhD, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Study of the Individual Features of the Psychological and Physiological Regulator of State and Reliability of Work Performance in Crewmembers in Long -term Spaceflight (Pilot) assesses and predicts the reliability of crew members performing complex and critical dynamic vehicle manual control tasks in various stages of long- term spaceflight and to study the features of crew member psyc ho-physiological reactions when exposed to stressful requirements in flight. Pilot is composed of 3 distinct investigations. Pilot- Regulatiion studies the individual features of crewmember psycho - physiological reactions when exposed to stress factors in fl ight; Pilot -Activity studies the reliability of crewmember performance during simulated manual control tasks for the final approach and docking of a Soyuz vehicle to the ISS; Pilot -Robot studies the dynamics of critical operator skills to manually control a robotic arm simulator in various stages of space flight. EARTH BENEFITS New insights, equipment, and training developments for maintaining work performance and reliability in space can be applied to remote manipulation tasks on Earth such as robotic handling of hazardous materials or robotic surgery. S PACE BENEFITS Diagnosing the current status of crew member skills at various stages of long -term spaceflight and maintaining them at the highest level is an effective way of increasing the likelihood of successful and safe robotic arm operation. Effective ways to enhance and personalize onboard training programs are to diagnose the status of critical skills, determine deteriorating skills, and restore them to the required level for subsequent integration into overall performance. The results of this work are used to develop recommendations on improving the onboard simulator and to optimize the procedure and timeline for training sessions to refresh and maintain work skills in flight.

Typical of the majority of crew members is a continuous increase in the quality of performing simulated final approach and docking tasks during flight. An interval of 30 - 35 days in training sessions to refresh space vehicle final approach/docking manual control skills enabled work skills to be maintained at the required level.

Dinges, PhD, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the International Space Station (Reaction Self Test) is a portable 5 -minute reaction time task that will allow the crew members to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while aboard the International Space Station (ISS). E ARTH BENEFITS The principal investigator (PI) developed the original 10 -minute Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT), which the Reaction Self Test was derived from, to measure changes in psychomotor speed, lapses of attention, wake state instability, and impulsivity induced by fatigue and other performance -degrading factors commonly found in operational environments. Based on research supported by federal and non- U.S. federal agencies as well as the pharmaceutical ind ustry, the 10 -minute PVT has been extensively validated in laboratory studies, simulators, and operational environments to be sensitive to a variety of performance -degrading fatigue -related factors. S PACE BENEFITS The Reaction Self Test aids crew members to objectively identify when their performance capability is degraded by various fatigue -related conditions that can occur as a result of ISS operations and time in space. The project addresses a number of high -priority NASA Behavioral Health and Performan ce (BHP) research gaps including: (1) identification of the best measure for assessing decrements in cognitive function because of fatigue and other aspects of spaceflight; (2) determination of an individual crew member's vulnerability to sleep loss; (3) establishment of cognition decline or change during long -duration missions (LDM); and (4) facilitation of ways for crew members and ground support to detect and compensate for decreased cognitive readiness to perform in space. R ESULTS Results from Reaction Self Test are pending completion of testing on all subjects before conclusive results are published. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication.

Czeisler, MD, PhD, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusets Laura K. Barger, PhD, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusets R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES Sleep -Wake Actigraphy and Light Exposure During Spaceflight examines the effects of space flight and ambient light exposure on the sleep -wake cycles of crew members during shuttle missions and long -duration stays aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Advancing state - of-the-art technology for monitoring, diagnosing, and assessing treatment of sleep patterns is vital to treating insomnia on Earth and in space. E ARTH BENEFITS A better understanding of insomnia is relevant to the millions of people on Earth who suffer nightly from insomnia. The advancement of state -of-the-art technology for monitoring, diagnosing, and assessing treatment effectiveness is vital to the continued treatment of insomnia on Earth. This work has the potential to greatly benefit the health, productivity, and safety of groups with a high prevalence of insomnia, such as shift workers and the elderly. S PACE BENEFITS The information gained from this study leads to a better understanding of the effects of spaceflight on sleep -wake cycles. The countermeasures that may be developed based on the findings of this study could improve sleep during missions, which, in turn, help to maintain alertness and lessen fatigue of the crew during long -duration spaceflights. R ESULTS Even when speeding at over seventeen thousand miles an hour, astronauts find it tough to catch enough Z's. A comprehensive analysis of results, collected over a ten -year span, shows that Shuttle and International Space Station crew members have difficulty falling asleep and typically do not get the full amount of sleep recommended for them each night. Sleep researchers studied diary entries and rest/activity S104E5114 - Astronaut Janet Kavandi on STS - 104 is wearing an Actiwatch on her right wrist for recording activities. 597 monitor data of 78 individual crew members from 80 shuttle flights (from 2001 to 2011) and 21 ISS missions (from 2005 to 2011) and found that, on average, space travelers get about 6 hours of sleep per night while in space and only slightly more during the data collect interval scheduled about three months prior to launch. The intensity of the pre -flight training and travel schedule may have contributed to insufficient sleep in the pre -flight data collection interval. During space missions, roughly three quarters of shuttle and ISS crew members reported taking sleep -promoting medication. Shuttle crew members reported taking sleep - promoting medications on about half of their nights in space, including nights prior to performing extra vehicular activity (EVA) work the next day which were extra mentally and physically demanding. The sleep -aid drug Zolpid em (brand name Ambien) was reported as the most often taken by shuttle crew members. The high prevalence of sleeping pill use during spaceflight, despite chronic sleep deficiency and improved sleeping conditions and quarters on the ISS, may suggest that some other aspect of the space environment, such as microgravity itself, might contribute to sleep disturbance. The use of sleep- promoting medication did not significantly increase the amount of sleep that astronauts obtained and only increased the sleep efficiency of shuttle crew members by about one percent. The minimal sleep improvement on nights when sleep- promoting medications were used emphasizes the need for further investigation into the stability, absorption, and effectiveness of such drugs in- flight. Sleep and the use of sleep- promoting medications during spaceflight needs further investigation, including the effect of chronic sleep deficiency and hangover effects from sleep promoting medications on operational performance, to develop and recommend best practices for ISS crew members. The sleep duration of crew members aboard long duration ISS missions was similar to that of crew members aboard short -duration shuttle missions. Monitoring and assessment of sleep duration and timing should continue in future spaceflight missions as a medical requirement, including collection of baseline data before astronaut selection for flight to estimate more accurately individual baseline sleep duration. Development of other more effective countermeasures to promote sleep in- flight is crucial, and might include sc heduling modifications, strategically timed exposure to specific wavelengths of light and behavioral strategies to ensure adequate sleep, which is essential for maintaining optimal health, performance, and safety. Further research of sleep is planned for the future 1 -year ISS missions, twice the normal length of previous ISS missions, which might provide information on trends in sleep over longer durations, which is especially relevant for future exploration class missions beyond low Earth orbit.

R ESULTS Since 2008, these meals have formed part of the NASA food list for crew bonus containers. The food was not only used in bonus containers and special meals for the crews but also used to support scientific experiments when the experiment requires a special imposed diet, such as within the ENERGY experiment. For the ENERGY experiment, the crew was eating this food first during the baseline data collection before flight and then during the flight (normally after having passed 3 months in space). The ENERGY menus' container was composed of 4 meals (2 breakfasts, 1 lunch, and 1 dinner), which was taken by the crew at the beginning of the experimental session (ie, day 0 and day 1). In 2006, 10 different recipes were available; today 25 recipes are available either for physiology and nutrition experiments support or for bonus containers.

Gushchin, MD, PhD, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Monitoring Group Activity by Crewmembers During Spaceflight (Vzaimodeystviye) obtains new data on interpersonal interaction and behavioral patterns of the ISS crews during long -term spaceflight. Results are used to improve the ability of future crew member s to interact safely and effectively with each other and ground support personnel. The results may also be used to improve methods for crew selection, training, and inflight support. E ARTH BENEFITS The individual experimental data that are obtained make it possible to conduct research on individual psychological parameters; these can be used to develop effective and reliable methods of diagnosing and predicting the organization level of small groups having various purposes that are involved in mutual act ivities (expeditions, sports, manufacturing, experiments, etc.). S PACE BENEFITS The results o f the Vzaimodeystviye are used to improve systems for psychological selection and monitoring of group activity in flight, and also to identify sociopsychological problems and determine the presence of stress in interpersonal relationships within the crew. Consideration for the particulars related to the increasing number of crewmembers, and their different nationalities improves the effectiveness of joint habitation and work by the crew, particularly during long -term spaceflights. ISS037E028227 - Nine crew members gather for a group portrait in the Kibo laboratory following a joint crew news conference. Pictured clockwise (from bottom right) are European Space Agenc y astronaut Luca Parmitano and NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg, both Expedition 37 flight engineers; Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin, Expedition 37 commander; Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin, Russian cosmonaut Sergey Ryazanskiy, NASA astronaut Rick Mastra cchio, Expedition 38 flight engineers; Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kotov, Expedition 38 commander; Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Koichi Wakata and NASA astronaut Michael Hopkins, both Expedition 38 flight engineers. 602 RESULTS In order to fulfill the approved objectives of the experiment, it is necessary to study at least 20 ISS crew members. Scientific analysis of the results is performed upon accumulation of sufficient amount of data for statistical analysis in order to determine general patterns of group dynamics in an international ISS crew. It is shown that the most marked changes took place over the course of the first month of flight. During the following 4 months of the increment, assessment oneself remained virtually unchanged. Dur ing the last month of flight, more marked changes describing communication, mood, and self -control come to the foreground. Thus, the results obtained confirm the proposed hypothesis that under the influence of stress at various stages of long -term spaceflight, a partial change takes place in self -perception and perception of other crewmembers, including the most significant criteria reflecting the person's basic values. Experimental data confirm the high significance and relevance of studying the degree of psychological closeness (similarity) of members of an international space crew, particularly taking into account the specific features of the current phase of work on the ISS, which are characterized by an increased number of cosmonauts and astronauts and their different nationalities.

E ARTH BENEFITS Investigation of the effects of bone loss on blood cell production helps to improve the effectiveness of treatments for similar conditions suffered by patients on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS Spaceflight crew members traveling to the moon or Mars may experience degradation of their immune system function because of disruption of blood cell production mechanisms. The results of this experiment help in the development of medicines to counteract disruptions to blood cell production and to minimize potential crew sickness from exposure to altered or new bacteria and viruses. R ESULTS Experiments were carried out in vitro (outside the living animal) over the course of a 2 -week space shuttle mission, on macrophage s (a type of white blood cell) from mice bone marrow stem cells, to test the theory that changes in the receptor for macrophage colony stimulating factor (M -CSF) may have been responsible for the effects of spaceflight on bone marrow macrophage enhanced growth. Bone marrow cells were analyzed in this study as a complete bone marrow population and as cell subpopulations distinguished by size and internal complexity. Results showed the number of bone marrow -derived macrophages increase faster during spaceflig ht compared to ground controls confirming previous findings. S126E008304 - Astronaut Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper, STS-126 mission specialist, works with Gro up Activation Packs (GAP) on the middeck of Space Shuttle Endeavour while docked with the International Space Station (ISS). 604 Macrophage cells counts in both living and preserved cell cultures increased an average of 5.7 fold in flight and an average of 3.9 fold on the ground after 14 and 17 day periods. However, no changes in receptor expression for M- CSF and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded macrophage differentiation (the process of cells becoming more specialized) during spaceflight were found. There also was a surprising pattern of spaceflight influence on genes involved in coagulation. Observed changes in gene duplication suggest impacts on the cells from spaceflight were of a global nature not just on specific cellular communication pathways. There were no significant differences in gross bone morpholog y between treatment groups or changes in the bone marrow cell numbers between flight and ground- control mice. So, spaceflight did not radically disrupt the distribution of bone marrow cell subpopulations. These data confirm spaceflight can impact the in vi tro development of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells (Ortega 2009, 2012). P UBLICATION (S) Ortega MT, Lu N, Chapes S.

This investigation examines the response of human immune cells in microgravity to new chitosan -based antibacterials. EARTH BENEFITS Where textile dressings stem the loss of blood by direct pressure, chitosan bandages actively clot the wound. These bandages are now standard issue for U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. This investigation provides a test of chitosan as a cell culture matrix and more information into its bacter iological properties, which further development of chitosan for military and civilian uses. S PACE BENEFITS Spaceflight crews traveling to the moon or Mars in microgravity may experience injury or trauma. The chitosan -based experiment results help to find new and improved wound -healing treatment for crew members as well as for the needs of military personnel in space and for future space travel. R ESULTS Preliminary results from CCM - Immune Response show that the cells were successfully cultured and returned to Earth. Monocytes without chitosan did not survive the bacterial infection; whereas, the monocytes with chitosan were protected and survived. Preliminary analysis shows the potential for a new pharmaceutical to fight large - scale bacterial infections. This investigation is complete; howev er additional results are pending publication.

Hoying, PhD and Stuart K. Williams, PhD, The University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Cell Culture Module - Effect of Microgravity on Wound Repair: In Vitro Model of New Blood Vessel Development (CCM -Wound Repair) is a Department of Defense Space Test Program research that uses cell culture in microgravity as a model of wound healing. This investigation is directed at the use of adipose -derived adult stem cells for use in injury repair and how the microgravity alters new blood vessel development, which is a key component of wound and tissue repai r. E ARTH BENEFITS This unique cell culture in microgravity serves as a model system for understanding necrosis of tissue following severe injuries. Using adipose -derived adult stem cells may accelerate new blood vessel development, which is a key componen t of wound and tissue repair. Results will be applied to help prevent the loss of limbs following severe injuries with life -changing benefits in military and civilian applications. Pictured is new capillary formation in response to wounding.

The blood vessel experiment seeks potential treatments to reduce any negative effects of microgravity on wound healing and blood vessel formation. R ESULTS Preliminary results from CCM -Wound Repair show that the cells were successfully cultured and returned to Earth. Data analysis is ongoing to determine deviations in cell pathology between flight and ground cells used to characterize the microgravity induced stresses on the flight samples.

Stowe, PhD, Microgen Laboratories, La Marque, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The -Induced Reactivation of Latent Epstein -Barr Virus (Epstein -Barr) experiment performs tests to study changes in the human immune function using blood and urine samples collected before and after spaceflight. The study provides insight for possible countermeasures to prevent the potential development of infectious illness in crew members during flight. E ARTH BENEFITS This type of study sheds light on infectious diseases, how they are related to stress here on Earth, and how they can be treated. S PACE BENEFITS In the United States, approximately 90% of adults have been infected with Epstein -Barr virus (EBV), one of the most common human viruses. It estab lishes a lifelong dormant infection inside the body, but can be reactivated by illness or stress. Once active, it can cause infectious mononucleosis (also known as mono). Decreased cellular immune function is observed during and after human spaceflight. Wi th longer -duration space missions, latent viruses are more likely to become reactivated, placing the crew at risk of developing and spreading infectious illness. If this is the case, drug therapies must be created to protect crew members during long -term a nd interplanetary missions (ie, trips to Mars). This study will help provide information related to immune function and virus activity in space to develop such remedies and ensure future exploratory space missions. R ESULTS A goal of the Epstein- Barr Virus (EBV) study was to determine whether changes in EBV gene expression (reactivation) occurred after short - and long -duration spaceflight. All astronaut and control subjects (24) tested positive for antibodies indicating past EB infection. In shuttle astrona uts, a pattern of immediate -early and early viral gene transcription (the first step in gene production) was observed indicative of EBV reactivation. Altogether, there was a significant increase in the number of immediate early and early gene replications in shuttle astronaut samples as compared to healthy control samples. Although EBV reactivation did occur in shuttle astronauts, productive EBV replication in peripheral blood B -lymphocytes did not. In contrast, samples from 3 ISS astronauts after flight sh ow strong evidence that complete productive EBV replication is occurring in the peripheral blood B cells of these astronauts, and data clearly show full activation EBV in the B -cells of ISS astronauts. For these crew members who flew longer (6 months) in s pace, latent gene expression and late lytic (involves the destruction of the host cell) gene transcripts were both more frequent and diverse. Overall, 609 there was a significant increase in the number of immediate early and early gene transcripts in ISS astronaut samples as compared to healthy control samples and shuttle astronauts at landing. A related study focused on \"monocytes,\" a type of white blood cell, which play multiple roles within the immune system. Evidently, the more complex and greater the work load and associated stress crew members experienced, the more their immune function (in this case monocyte parameters) appeared to be compromised, mainly in the reduction of the body's defense signaling capability and pronounced suppression of the i mmune system's ability to identify and neutralize potential pathogens. Researchers also found increases in the stress hormone cortisol in shuttle crew members, presumably due to the rigors of preflight training, which were accompanied by significant change s in white blood cells even days prior to launch. It is important to note, however, that for short -duration crew members, these immune system changes do not appear to linger beyond a few days after mission completion. (Stowe 2011, Crucian 2011).

The investigation will also provide insight into the disease process of immune -compromised humans on Earth. SPACE APPLICATION Immuno aims to provide the understanding for the development of pharmacological tools to countermeasure unwanted immunological side effects during long -duration missions into space. E ARTH APPLICATION The Immuno investigation will provide insight into the disease process of immunocompromised humans on Earth. R ESULTS Thirty cosmonauts on short -duration (8 - 11 days) and long -duration (125 -195 days) missions to the Int ernational Space Station (ISS) were studied before launch and after landing in order to detect changes in the immune system, which had been reported in previous studies with short- and long -duration space missions in low - Earth orbit. The first results on the Humoral Immune Response (HIR) of ISS cosmonauts focused on peripheral blood antibodies, T - and B -lymphocyte white blood cell (WBC) populations, cytokines (cell-signaling agents), as well as natural killer (NK) cells activity in the body's defense again st bacteria, viruses, and toxins. No notable changes in the antiviral antibody levels after long - and short- term missions were observed, and specific antibodies for Epstein- Barr viruses (EBVs), which were often reactivated Blood sample show s white blood cells: Lymphocytes (L) and Granulocytes (G). ESA image. 611 in microgravity, also did not ch ange. Although the total number of WBCs increased significantly upon landing, the overall population of T and B lymphocytes did not change appreciably after long -duration spaceflights. However, T -lymphocyte function was decreased, which supports previous o bservations and recently confirmed from a study of 12 Russian cosmonauts after long -duration missions. Researchers proposed that a long -duration spaceflight, perhaps coupled with several extravehicular activities (EVA), activated and suppressed T -lymphocyt es' response to proliferate, thus resulted in an immune deficit against potential infections. The investigation also showed gross individual differences in concentration of cytokines before launch possibly due to preflight stress. The random changes after short - and long -term missions suggest that cytokines may be highly sensitivity to the factors associated with re -entry and readaptation to Earth's gravity. Also, a decrease in natural killer (NK) cells population and activity in the long -duration crew memb ers may be an indication of a weakened immune system, plus the reduced NK activity in some subjects on the first day after short- duration could very well be an acute response to landing stress. Many improvements have been made to the living conditions of orbital vehicles and the scope of spaceflight immunological research expanded since the first human was flown into space 50 years ago. However, ISS crew members still exhibit negative shifts in the immune system during initial readaptation to gravity. Such alterations, scientists suspect, could lead to compromised defenses against infections by limiting the immune system's communicating and disease fighting capabilities. In light of these results, full characterization of all aspects of the innate and adapt ive immune system after prolonged and brief flights appears essential for understanding the relationship of microgravity and stress effects of spaceflight on human space explorers.

Sams, PhD, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Validation of Procedures for Monitoring Crew Member Immune Function (Integrated Immune) estimates the clinical risks resulting from the adverse effects of spaceflight on the human immune system to validate a flight- compatible immune monitoring strategy. Immune system changes are monitored by collecting and analyzing blood, urine, and saliva samples from crew members before, during, and after spaceflight. E ARTH BENEFITS The data collected during this investigation lead to a greater understanding of how the immune system is affected by different factors from stress to the environment. This data could potentially be used to help develop new treatments and preventative measures for immune dysfunctions. S PACE BENEFITS The study validates a monitoring strategy that allows the development of effective countermeasures. When implemented, this safeguards the health of the crew during long - duration space missions. R ESULTS Researchers collected multiple preflight and postflight samples from shuttle and ISS crew members from 2007 onward. They found that shuttle crew members on short missions of about 2 weeks experienced greater initial stress, even prior to launch, than crew members leaving for a longer 6 -month tour on the ISS. Af ter short -duration missions, white blood cell (WBC) counts were elevated and typical stress- induced shifts were observed, and a general immunity assessment confirmed a parallel decrease in immune function. Changes in monocyte, a type of ISS030E257695 - In the International Space Station's (ISS) Destiny Laboratory, NASA astronaut Dan Burbank (foreground) and European Space Agency astronaut Andre Kuipers prepare for venous blood sample draws in the Columbus Laboratory of the ISS. Following the blood draws, the samples are temporarily stowed in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1 (MELFI -1) and later packed together with saliva samples on the Soyuz TMA -22 for return to Earth for analysis. 613 WBC, parameters and defense signaling capacity may also have an impact on overall crew member immune system health. ISS crew members, by contrast, did not show increased cortisol stress hormone levels at any time prior to launch. A plausible explanation is the training, whic h differs greatly for these astronauts who are prepared mentally for long -duration flights that are psychologically challenging, is much longer and diverse than shuttle astronauts. Stress hormones returned to preflight levels for both groups after a few da ys back on earth. Also, approximately 50% of the subjects had very high WBC counts, which have typically been associated with increased stress hormones, at landing. Unexpectedly, some subsets of white blood cells did not show normal response to the rise in stress hormones for long -duration crew members. Further study is needed to determine if this is a failure of these WBCs to properly respond to acute stress or if the blood production process is altered during long -duration spaceflight. The authors conclude the current ISS training successfully reduces stress and interventions employed during this period in which astronauts are most accessible would likely produce the desired effects. These results agree with prior studies demonstrating the significance of mission duration in the magnitude of these immune system changes.

Buravkova, MD, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Research on Intercellular Interaction in Spaceflight (Intercellular Interaction) investigation assesses the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes isolated from human blood when co -cultured with -562 myeloblasts in microgravity. EARTH BENEFITS Laboratory experiments and inflight experiments demonstrate the possibility and effectiveness of using a modified method of studying the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells in vitro . The results of the studies performed on the cytotoxic activity of NK cells co -cultured with -562 myeloblasts in microgravity allow for more in -depth understanding of certain processes that form the foundation of intercellular interactions. S PACE BENEFI TS The studies performed opened up new opportunities for researching the role of stimuli in the functioning of immunocompetent cells in vitro in microgravity conditions. The results of the work corroborate theoretical ideas regarding the effect of microgravity conditions on the intercellular interaction of NK lymphocytes and target cells of line -562. The data obtained are of practical significance, since they substantiate the methodological approaches to direct, in -flight research on the status of anti -viral immunity in space explorers, which is the foundation for developing medical monitoring equipment at various phases of long -term missions. RESULTS A number of researchers on cultures of isolated mononuclear cells discovered that the functional activity of T -cells was inhibited by the disruption of their interaction with helper cells, which occurred through signals necessary for expression of regulatory molecules. The study performed showed that the microgravity factor did not have an inhibitory effect on the function of NK lymphocytes; in fact, half of the inflight experiments demonstrated a significant activation o f the functional activity of NK cells.

Pierson, PhD, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Incidence of Latent Virus Shielding During Spaceflight (Latent Virus) study supports and expands information on latent viruses \u2014or those inactive in the human system \u2014that can reactivate in spacefligh t such as a cold sore. Latent virus reactivation could be an important threat to crew health during extended space missions, as crew members live and work in a closed environment. Potential applications of this research include the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method for identifying crew members at increased risk of illness because of viral infections. New technology from this investigation benefits both NASA and commercial applications. E ARTH BENEFITS The viral- specific saliva DNA test currently used for spaceflight investigations are applied to the rapid diagnosis of herpes virus disease in clinics. These studies of latent virus reactivation in the very healthy, superbly -conditioned flight crews provide new insight into stress, immunity , and viral disease in the general population. S PACE BENEFITS This investigation helps determine the clinical risk of asymptomatic reactivation and shedding of latent viruses to astronaut health and the need for countermeasures to reduce or eliminate the risk. Stress -induced viral reactivation may also prove useful in monitoring early changes in immunity prior to onset of clinical disease. R ESULTS Saliva samples collected from crew members traveling on the shuttle to and from the International Space Station (ISS) have provided valuable data for the Latent Virus investigation. Epstein -Barr (EBV) and Varicella zoster (VZV) viruses were studied and res ults indicate that these latent viruses can become active under stressful conditions such as spaceflight. The pattern and amount of EBV shedding in the astronauts are likely related to spaceflight conditions. The types, levels, and combination of stresses experienced before, during, and after flight, as well as the different ways individuals cope with stress may result in changes in the EBV shedding frequency. Healthy astronauts from 3 shuttle missions along with ground volunteers were also studied to deter mine Electron micrograph of a Varicella -Zoster Virus.

Before flight, all samples from the experimental subjects were negative for VZV DNA, during flight VZV DNA was detected in 87% of the astronauts; following return to Earth VZV DNA was detected in only 19% of the astronauts tested. During this same time frame, no VZV DNA was detected from the control subjects. In conclusion, both VZV and EBV can reactivate during stressful situations such as spaceflight (Mehta 2004, Pierson 2005). P UBLICATION (S) Pierson DL, Stowe RP, Phillips TM, Lugg DJ, Mehta SK.

Dulchavsky, MD, PhD, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM) experiment involves crew members conducting ultrasound exams on one another to determine the accuracy of ultrasound use to diagnose certain types of in- orbit injuries and illnesses, as well as to assess the feasibility of ultrasound for monitoring in- flight bone alterations. E ARTH BENEFITS The use of a relatively small piece of medical equipment to diagnose various health problems, in the absence of nearby specialized medical personnel, could save lives and reduce healthcare costs. Patients could transmit ultrasound information to doctors over great distances, resulting in efficient remote medical diagnosis and treatment to a high degree of confidence. This technology essentially allows anyone in the world the potential to access unique clinical imaging expertise remotely. S PACE BENEFITS Aboard the International Space Station (ISS), there is not enough room for a fully functioning hospital or staff of doctors. It is also not feasible for a crew membe r to return quickly to Earth for medical diagnosis. This experiment allows for efficient testing for medical problems with minimal use of onboard resources. The ability of crew members to use an ultrasound machine with remote instruction, along with ground analysis, promotes timely treatment and averts unnecessary evacuation. Using a modification of this technology, crew members as far away as Mars could obtain remote examinations from doctors on Earth. This type of capability is essential for long -term spa ce exploration. R ESULTS The ISS ADUM experiment demonstrated that minimal training, along with audio guidance from a certified sonographer, produced ultrasound imagery of diagnostic quality. The ISS crew members, acted as operators and subjects, completin g comprehensive scans of the The techniques established by the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM) research on the International Space Station (ISS) can rapidly and economically improve medical care in underserved areas. This photo shows an obstetrical examination conducted on an Inuit mother in the high Arctic Circle. A just -in-time training program developed for the astronauts was modified to allow novice operators to perform ultrasounds to deter mine the status of pregnant women. This technique will provide important guidance as to whether the delivery will be safe in her village or whether potential complications will require the mother to travel, seeking additional attention from a higher level of care. Scott A. Dulchavsky, MD, PhD, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan image. 620 cardiothoracic and abdominal organs as well as limited scans of the dental, sinus, and eye structures. The experiment also included multiple musculoskeletal exams such as a detailed exam of the shoulder muscles. Analysis of ult rasound video downlinks to ground teams at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) TeleScience Center showed excellent results. Many trauma centers around the world use ultrasound technology as a first -line diagnostic procedure to assess abdominal trauma. The use of ultrasound does not require performance by a radiologist for accurate results. Previous research studies cover this topic of expanding ultrasound technology use by non- radiologists in remote locations to provide diagnostic information on acute clin ical conditions. The use of ultrasound technology as a diagnostic tool on the ISS required an onboard proficiency enhancement program, visual cue cards, procedures, and direction from ground -based trained radiological personnel (Sargsyan 2004). The high -fidelity image captures of the thoracic, cardiac, and vascular systems from the Expedition 8 crew demonstrated the capability of minimally -trained, non - medical personnel ultrasound operations. This investigation laid the groundwork for using ultrasound as a diagnostic tool, without an available physician, in microgravity and remote locations on Earth. There is a scientific paper discussing these results, which crew members sent directly from orbit (Foale 2005). Crew members' ultrasound images of the shoulder during Expedition 9 showed the diagnostic quality of the ultrasound imagery for the evaluation of shoulder integrity. An example application of this technology is if a crew member were to sustain a shoulder injury during a strenuous extravehicular activity (EVA or spacewalk), these techniques would enable evaluation and diagnosis of possible injuries (Fincke 2005). Following a traumatic event to the head or face, eye examination is a very important component of the physical examination. Significant orbital or facial swelling can complicate the examination. The Expedition 10 crew's examination of the eye thr ough a closed eyelid using ultrasound addressed this issue. This examination can determine a number of problems with the eye that are signs of other more significant trauma of the head (Chiao 2005, Sargsyan 2009). The educational program and remote expert guidance concepts developed for Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM) on the International Space Station (ISS) was modified for terrestrial use. There are a great number of medically under -served regions on the Earth. For example, high altitude climbers are at risk of serious lung problems, because of the thin air at heights. This photo shows a Swedish climber performing a comprehensive chest ultrasound examination at Advanced Base Camp on Mt. Everest. The climber operator had never seen an ultrasound before and was remotely guided to perform the examination over the Internet via a satellite phone and a solar panel charged portable ultrasound device. The exam was completed in 10 minutes and showed increased lung fluid because of exposure to high altitudes. Scott A. Dulchavsky, MD, PhD, Henry F ord Health System, Detroit, Michigan image. 621 In addition to the importance of establis hing ultrasound techniques for examination and diagnosis on the ISS, this study established ultrasound as a key tool for clinical medicine on future vehicles, the moon, and eventually Mars. The success of ADUM may also lead to additional applications of ul trasound on Earth as users adapt the remote guidance paradigm for patients in rural/remote areas, disaster relief, and the military. Using existing communication systems, a minimally trained person (eg, nurse, physician's assistant, military medic, etc.) c ould perform an ultrasound exam on a patient with guidance from an expert at a medical facility hundreds or thousands of miles away. This would expand the tools for the rural medical community, provide the ability to triage a mass casualty, and help in the decisions to conduct medical transport of patients.

Larina, PhD, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Biochemical Status of Humans in Long -term Spaceflight (Biotest) studies metabolic adaptation to extended spaceflight conditions to broaden the existing information base on changes in metabolism and its hormonal regulation in microgravity. E ARTH BENEFITS Biotest promotes the development of space and ground medicine. S PACE BENEFITS Biotest data improves medical monitoring, training, and postflight rehabilitation of crew members for long -term spaceflight. R ESULTS Ground laboratories measured the hormonal, metabolic, and biochemical indicators of the space adaptation process in blood samples collected from crew members. Overall results were found to be within accepted normal standards. In the final stage of long -term space flight, no increase in the secretion of the stress hormones, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids of the adrenal cortex was noted. The association between reproductive hormones and pancreatic hormone indicators was also not affected during long -term spa ceflight. The pattern of the changes in thyroid hormones before, during, and after long -term spaceflight reflected the state of metabolism, functional activity, and the main metabolism level in crew members while the thryotrophic hormone -thyroid hormone re gulation feedback loop remains normal. The dynamic of water/salt metabolism parameters and its regulation correlates to flight duration and the age of crew members. P UBLICATION (S) Smith SM, Westney ME, O'Brian KO, et al.

Blood and Oxidative Stress (BOS) aims to determine the degree of stress that the red blood cells have undergone to bring about cell damage, the quantity of substances in blood serum that would prevent this damage (antioxidants), the damage to red blood cell membranes, and the time it takes to recover. BOS aims to find methods to reduce the current effects of oxidative space anemia by integrating appropriate dietary elements and natural compounds that act as antioxidants. These results also impact medical planning for future longer d uration space missions beyond low -Earth orbit. R ESULTS To determine the effects of spaceflight on the erythrocyte antioxidant potential, an assay of the glutathione content and the enzyme connected with Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) detoxification was made. Spaceflight reduced glutathione content and also the activity of glutathione peroxidase. Both these parameters were recovered 15 days postflight with an increase of peroxidases activity. It was possible to observe that all the activities were signifi cantly reduced in other enzymes involved in ROS detoxification after flight, in particular the activity of glutathione reductase. All the enzymes were increased at 15 days postflight. Also erythrocyte cell membrane was affected by spaceflight with a reduct ion of the cholesterol and phospholipid contents indicating that the phospholipids/cholesterol ratio was maintained constant. At 15 days postflight, there was an increase of phospholipids and consequently of the phospholipid/cholesterol ratio. All together these data indicated that a short time spaceflight might induce \"space anemia\" with a reduction in hemoglobin content of red blood cells. Over the past 15 years, space medicine has become increasingly concerned with the effects of spaceflight on hematological processes; astronauts have consistently returned from spaceflight with a decreased red blood cell mass spaceflight anemia and plasma v olume. Although plasma volume is known to be labile, current theories for the control of erythropoiesis cannot account for a decrease in red blood cell mass of 10% in <10 days. Experimental data confirmed these observations and point out: a decrease of ant ioxidant defenses in red blood and a modification of cell membrane composition. These might be the consequences of increased cell aging due to exposure during flight to increased oxidative stress. The data on enzyme activities could be the first reported i n literature, even though they need further investigation to confirm their importance. If these observations are confirmed, they might be utilized to integrate astronaut's diet with appropriate antioxidant aliment or supplements. 624 PUBLICATION (S) Rizzo AM, Adorni L, Montorfano G, Negroni M, Zava S, Berra B.

Larina, PhD , Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Diurez gathers new data on the state of fluid and electrolyte metabolism and hormonal regulation of the body's fluid volume in microgravity conditions and in the readaptation period after spaceflight. Analyses of bio samples (venous and capillary blood, and urine) help to characterize the final stage of fluid and electrolyte metabolism in microgravity. E ARTH BENEFITS Diurez promotes the development of medicine to counteract space -induced metabolic changes, which may also be applied to related ailments on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS The results obtained from Diurez help to improve the medical support system for long -term spaceflight, including how work and rest schedules, medical monitoring, training, and postflight rehabilitation of crew members are organized. R ESULTS Initial data showed that, during fl ight, the volume of morning fluid consumption decreased significantly, which could be caused by activity features of the work/rest routine. Data showed a close connection between the age and the BMI of crew members with other studied indicators. These fact ors must be considered when evaluating the nutritional status and the physical activities of the crew members. In microgravity and postflight, a decrease was observed in the blood concentration of prolactin, which indirectly indicates an increase in dopa minergic (signaling) activity of the central nervous system. These effects must be considered when planning the level of postflight physical and mental activity of the crewmembers. P UBLICATION (S) Morukov BV, Nichiporuk IA, Tret'yakov VS, Larina IM.

Energy also measures adaptations in the components of total energy expenditure of crew members, so that an equation to determine the energy requirements of crew members during spaceflight may be derived. Such knowledge of energy requirements is of a great importance to ensure health, good performance, and the overall success of a mission, and also contributes to ensure adequate exercise load and cargo allotments for food during spaceflight. E ARTH BENEFITS The techniques used within this research for assessment of energy expenditure are also used for assessment of energy expenditure on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS The knowledge of energy requirements for spaceflight is needed to ensure health, performances, and the overall success of a mission. In addition, it will contribute to ensure adequate, but not excessive, cargo supplies for food. In this regard, the determination of energy requirements as a function of exer cise load is a prerequisite for planned long -term manned spaceflight. RESULTS No final results are available yet as the experiment is ongoing This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication.

Goncharov, PhD, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Research on the Particulars of Pharmacological Effects During Long -term Spaceflight (Farma) provides information on absorption, distribution, and excretion of pharmaceuticals during spaceflig ht. The objective is to conduct an integrated study of the mechanism of change in the pharmacokinetics of drugs during long -term spaceflight. E ARTH BENEFITS If a long -term (1 month or more) course of drug therapy is necessary, a non -invasive method for evaluating the kinetics of pharmaceuticals makes it possible to constantly monitor the level of the medication in the body, thereby determining its therapeutic efficacy. The use of non -invasive methods for evaluating the effectiveness of medications in order to optimize the schedule of preventive and therapeutic assistance and to minimize medical risks is justified not only in conditions of orbital and interplanetary spaceflight missions b ut in other extreme conditions: at polar stations, during long -term submarine voyages, etc. S PACE BENEFITS The information obtained on the particulars of absorption, distribution, and excretion of the drug make it possible to note general patterns of changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in microgravity, to determine the main tiers of disruption of these processes, and to develop corrective measures. The results obtained must be considered when determining a schedule of drug therapy during long -term manned spaceflights as well as for pharmaceuticals having negative side effects complicating the ingestion of acetaminophen. The complex, non -invasive studies performed aboard the International Space Station of the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen make it possible to optimize dosages and schedules of drug therapy and to minimize medical risks when selecting non -narcotic painkiller medications in spaceflight conditions. Reflotron -4 set used in the Farma investigation. Roscosmos image. 628 RESULTS For the first time during spaceflight, the bioavailability of a drug was studied. It was shown that after a single dose of the drug in spaceflight conditions, the relative biological availability of acetaminophen was significantly higher in the majority of flight test subjects than in baseline studies. Research on liver functio n after ingestion of acetaminophen showed that spaceflight conditions did not lead to disruption of liver function, therefore it was unlikely that a change in the first- pass effect, which occurs in the liver, would be the key point in the change observed i n the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen. It was also the first time a comparative study was performed on the pharmacokinetics of tablet versus capsule forms of acetaminophen. It was shown that the capsule form of acetaminophen was preferable to the tablet form when taken for treatment purposes in spaceflight. P UBLICATION (S) Kovachevich IV, Kondratenko IV.

Bloomberg, PhD, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Physiological Factors Contributing to Postflight Changes in Functional Performance (Functio nal Task Test) payload tests crew members on an integrated suite of functional and physiological tests before and after long -duration spaceflight. The study identifies critical mission tasks that may be impacted, maps physiological changes to alterations i n physical performance, and aids in the design of countermeasures that specifically target the physiological systems responsible for impaired functional performance. E ARTH BENEFITS A better understanding of the physiological factors that influence functional performance aids in defining more effective rehabilitation interventions in clinical populations. For example, in the elderly p opulation, activities of daily living are often impaired by multiple physiological causes. The information obtained from this study helps in the design of clinical interventions and rehabilitation programs that can target specific systems responsible for decline in functional performance. S PACE BENEFITS Information obtained from this study aids in the design of targeted countermeasures which can reduce bodily changes that can have a negative impact on wellbeing and function of crew members in space. R ESUL TS Ongoing data collection continues to improve the statistical power required to map changes in functional task performance to alterations in physiological systems. The information obtained from this study will be used to design and implement countermeasures that specifically target the physiological systems most responsible for the altered functional performance associated with spaceflight.

Ivanova, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Study of Morphofunctional Properties of Blood Cells and Intensity of Erythropoiesis in Humans Subjected to Sp aceflight Factors (Gematologiya/ Gematologiya Perfection ) obtains new data on the effect of spaceflight factors on the human blood system in order to expand its diagnostic and predictive capabilities and uncover the mechanisms of shifts in hematological indicators. E ARTH BENEFITS Although the Gematologiya facilitates the development of space medicine, it is conceivable that results can help reveal the mechanisms of shifts in hematological indicators for medical conditions such as anemia and lymphocytosis on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS The data obtained from the Gematologiya experiment make possible the solution of a number of practical issues in the medical care system for long -term spaceflights, particularly medical monitoring, training, and postflight rehabilitation of crew members. R ESULTS Stimulation of erythropoiesis (increased erythropoietin, reduced level of iron in the blood, removal of poor -quality and old erythrocytes) during the re -adaptation period was aimed at supporting the optimal level of red blood cells necessary for the increased oxygen demand in tissues subjected to terrestrial gravity and increased muscular loads. Thus, the results obtained from the Gematologiya experiment indicated that the observed effect of spaceflight factors corresponded with the expected effect. The assumption that the cause of space anemia has Taking samples of capillary blood . Roscosmos image. 632 many factors in addition to the decrease in RBC production was confirmed. The reduction in the number of erythroc ytes may also be linked to the activation of ineffective erythropoiesis, the disruption of iron exchange, a shift in the metabolic status of the cells, and destabilization of the cell membrane, which may lead to premature removal of erythrocytes from the bloodstream.

The hair shaft has an advantage in that it records the metabolic conditions of the environment where the subject resides. The purpose of this experiment is to examine the effect of long -duration spaceflight on gene expression and trace element metabolism in human body by analyzing human hair. E ARTH BENEFITS In space experiments, hair is one of the most suitable specimens, for there are neither special hardware nor handling necessary to collect samples and retrieve them from the orbit. The research is expected to support the development of an effective and easy diagnostic measure for the ISS crew. S PACE BENEFITS The results obtained from this research will facilitate the understanding of the relations between human metabolism and hair. The research is expected to support the development of alternative diagnostic methods for blood or urine tests. R ESULTS Sample collection from 10 ISS crew members have been completed. As preliminary results, RNA was extracted successfully from the samples and some changes in gene expression have been already detected. Distribution of trace elements has been evaluated with E lectron Probe Micro Analyzer (EPMA). Additional detailed analysis of these samples is underway. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication. Sample collection in the ISS by astronaut.

Smith, PhD, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Nutritional Status Assessment (Nutrition) is a comprehensive in -flight study designed to understand changes in the human body during long -duration spaceflight. This study includes measures of bone metabolism, oxidative damage, chemistry and hormonal changes as well as assessments of the nutritional status of the crew members participating in the study. The results have an impact on the definition of nutritional requirements and development of food systems for future exploration missions to the moon and Mars. This experiment also helps researchers understand the effectiveness of measures taken to c ounteract the effects of spaceflight, as well as the impact of exercise and medicine countermeasures on nutritional status and nutrient requirements for crew members. E ARTH BENEFITS Increased understanding of the role of nutrition in physiological adaptation to spaceflight has a broader application on Earth. One example is that understanding the relationship of nutrition to bone loss is potentially valuable for patients suffering from osteoporosis on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS The inclusion of in- flight blood and urine collections, and expansion to include additional samplings to better monitor nutritional status, are required in order to better understand the role of nutrition in bone health, changes in body composition, oxidative damage, and to better define nutritional requirements for spaceflight. Maintaining and monitoring nutritional status is important for ensuring crew health during spaceflight and is critical as we embark on exploration missions of much longer duration in the future. R ESULTS This exper iment is ongoing; urine and blood samples for several crew members have been collected before, during, and after ISS Expeditions. Since the experiment design calls for the combination and comparative analysis of data from all Expeditions, final results are not yet available. Preliminary results have been presented, reviewed, and published in multiple forums. Operationally, the data have been valuable in troubleshooting the Urine Processing Assembly (UPA) after the unit developed problems in orbit in 2009, a nd also in developing operational plans for using this unit. Vitamin D results from spaceflight and ground -based analog studies led to revised vitamin D supplementation recommendations on ISS, and the results of this experiment have documented the effectiv eness of this new dose. The ground -based findings from Antarctic research were cited in the Institute of Medicine's revision of the recommended dietary intakes for North Americans. 636 PUBLICATION (S) Smith SM, Heer MA, Zwart SR.

Volozhin, PhD , Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Significant changes in the local immunity and microbial (bacteria) system of the periodontium (tissue near the teeth) qualify as risk factors for the development of inflammatory diseases of the periodontium and possibly are one of the specific manifestations of the postflight readaptation state of crew members' bodies. Paradont studies the condition of local immunity and microflora in the mouth of crew members participating in missions on the International Space Station (ISS). E ARTH BENEFITS The studies make it possible to open new fields of research to monitor the condition of microflora in the mouth. A beneficial application kit is developed from the research, lactobacterin immobilized on a collagen sponge, and successfully underwent clinical testing (for the prevention of periodontitis). S PACE BENEFITS A preventative probiotic product, a periodontal patch, is developed, in the form of a lyophilized substance as a strip containing lactobacilli immobilized on collagen. Results obtained from the study help researchers to conclude that the use of the periodontal patch is the best way of locally treating chronic generalized periodontitis in the flare -up st age. R ESULTS Laboratory analysis of the returned materials are performed on the ground and involved quantitative measurements of the concentration of opportunistic pathogenic microflora in the mouth. The Parodont experiment established that during spaceflight significant changes occurred in local immunity and microflora in the tissues that surround and support the teeth of crew members, which increased the risk factors for the development of inflammatory diseases of the dentomaxillofacial system in crew members. It was noted that after flight the beneficial microflora in crew members was reduced against the growth of harmful microflora. This phenomenon i ncreased the likelihood of periodontal disease.

Smith, PhD, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect Against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery (Pro K) investigation is NASA's first evaluation of a dietary countermeasure to lessen bone loss of astronauts. Pro K proposes that a flight diet with a decreased ratio of animal protein to potassium will lead to decreased loss of bone mineral. Pro K has impacts on the definition of nutritional requirements and development of food systems for future exploration missions and could yield a method of counteracting bone loss that would have virtually no risk of side effects. E ARTH BENEFITS Given the growing trend in the United States toward diets high in animal protein, the proposed research has direct public health significance. S PACE BENEFITS If successful, the study could lead to improvements in bone health during spaceflight, with use of a c ountermeasure that requires no additional stowage, crew time, power, or other constrained resources. R ESULTS Pro K is an ongoing investigation data, and conclusive results will be published following completed data collection and analysis. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication. 639 RENAL STONE RISK DURING SPACEFLIGHT : ASSESSMENT AND COUNTERMEASURE VALIDATION (RENAL STONE ) Research Area: Integrated Physiology and Nutrition Expeditions: 3-6, 8, 11- 14 Princ ipal Investigator(s): Peggy A. Whitson, PhD, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Renal Stone experiment collects urine samples from crew members and tests a possible countermeasure for preventing kidney stone formation. E ARTH BENEFITS Understanding how the disease may form in otherwise healthy crew members under varying environmental conditions provides insight into stone -forming diseases on Earth. SPACE BENEFITS Human exposure to microgravity results in a number of physiological changes. Among these are changes in renal function, fluid redistribution, bone loss, and muscle atrophy, all of which contribute to an altered urinary environment and the potential for renal stone formation during and immediately after flight. In -flight changes previously observed include decreased urine volume and urinary citrate and increased urinary concentrations of calcium and sodium. The formation of renal stones could have severe health consequences for crew members and negatively impact the success of the mission. This study gives a better understanding of the risk factors associated with renal stone development during and after flight, as well as test the effectiveness of potassium citrate as a countermeasure to reduce this risk. R ESULTS The Renal Stone investigation contained 2 sequential sampling groups in its single -trial, 2 -phase design. Phase 1 of the study sampled 12 male astronauts and cosmonauts during NASA -Mir spaceflights in 129 - to 208 -day missions and served as a control group with no treatment. Phase 2 collected data from 18 ISS crew members in a double -blind study that included control and treatment with potassium citrate (K -Cit) pill supplements in 93 - to 215 -day missions from ISS Expeditions 3 -14. Urine samples were collecte d and analyzed before, during, and after mission, as was dietary information from crew members to document urine chemistry and mineral - nutrient throughput. As a safety measure, all phase 2 participants were K -Cit-tolerance tested before launch, and none showed any adverse reactions. Renal stones come in the forms of calcium stones (calcium oxalate (CAOX) and calcium phosphate (Brushite)), uric acid stones, and ISS013E56052 - ISS Expedition 13 Flight Engineer Thomas Reiter, seen aboard ISS, processes samples for the Renal Stone investigation. 640 struvite stones (ammonium magnesium phosphate), with the CAOX type being the most common. Astronau ts are at an increased risk for developing calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid stones during space missions when crew's urine typically becomes supersaturated with the chemical species of these stone -forming salts as a result of decreased ur ine output and pH. Potassium citrate is known to bind with calcium to impede the growth of calcium -containing crystals, which can become kidney stones. The Renal Stone study quantifies the effectiveness of K -Cit in lowering the elevated risk factors for re nal stone formation during space missions, and shows significant decrease in CAOX and uric -acid superstaturation risks in crew members ingesting K -Cit versus the control groups. K -Cit also increases urinary pH without elevating the risk for forming brushite stones, and appears to be well tolerated over the entire course of the study. Results from this investigation suggest that supplementation with potassium citrate may decrease the risk of renal stone formation during and immediately after space exploration missions. Renal stones can be extremely debilitating and medical therapy options, widely availab le on Earth, are severely limited during long -duration space exploration, hence prevention is the most logical and cost -effective approach. The Renal Stone study, while collecting valuable scientific data, stresses the importance of maintaining a balance b etween pharmacological safety and effectiveness in conducting medical research involving crew members. Related results are expected from an ISS investigation in progress with bisphosphonates for mitigating bone loss, and a bed rest clinical ground study pr escribing magnesium potassium citrate (MKCIT) for reducing the risk of renal stone formation (Whitson 2009).

McMonigal, MD, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Biological Specimen Repository (Repository) is a storage bank that is used to maintain biological specimens over extended periods of time and under well- controlled conditions. This repository supports scientific discovery that contributes to our fundamental knowledge in the area of human physiological changes an d adaptation to a microgravity environment and provides unique opportunities to study changes in human physiology spanning many missions. This investigation archives biosamples, including blood and urine from the International Space Station (ISS), for use as a resource for future spaceflight -related research. E ARTH BENEFITS Advances in space biomedical research often lead to medical advances to better serve patients on Earth. Future research investigations that can help ensure the health and safety of cre w members as well as enable exploration class missions provide valuable health benefits to society. S PACE BENEFITS The development of Repository allows for the collection, processing, storage, maintenance, and ethical distribution of biosamples to meet goals of scientific and programmatic relevance to the space program. Arc hiving of the biosamples provides future research opportunities including investigating patterns of physiological changes, analysis of components unknown at this time, or analyses performed by new and improved methods. R ESULTS Results from Repository are pending completion of testing on all subjects before conclusive results are prepared.

Noskov, PhD, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Study of Changes in Body Composition and Distribution of Fluids Within the Human Body During Long -term Spaceflight (Sprut -2) studies the change in body composition and fluid distribution in the human body during long -term spaceflight in orde r to evaluate adaptation mechanisms and improve countermeasures. Gravity plays the most important role in the restructuring of many metabolic parameters, including the hydration status of the body. E ARTH BENEFITS The use of the polysegmental impedancemetry, apart from the evaluation of gravitational displacement of bodily fluids, allows one to significantly reduce the margins of error in evaluating body composition caused by a different electrical properties of various regions of the body, and a new diagram for placing the electrodes increases the precision of the analysis through consideration of the individual parts of the subject's body. S PACE BENEFITS A study of the fluid spaces of the body is not only of great scientific interest but has practical applicability in correcting the hydration status of crew members in order to increase their postflight orthostatic stability. Performing Sprut -2 facilitates direct, real- time medical monitoring of the state of the crew's metabolism and their hydration status during long - term spaceflights. The results of the experiment make it possible to predict and substantiate targeted corrections to the hydration level at v arious stages of flight in order to improve crew members' performance. This study shows it is possible to perform autonomous medical monitoring during long -term expeditions, including interplanetary ones, and to perform targeted correction of water -salt ex change and the training regimen at various stages of flight, in order to improve crew performance.

Upon completion of each session of the experiment, electronic files were created, containing data suitable for further analysis. It was discovered that the body's total water content as well as the volume of extracellular and cellular fluid decreased in flight in the majority of subjects studied. A deficit in body mass developed due to the loss of lean body mass and a decrease in fatty components. Report materials on t he experiment as a whole will be presented after all the results obtained are fully analyzed. Performance of the Sprut- 2 space experiment is slated to continue among members of subsequent ISS expeditions. P UBLICATION (S) Noskov VB, Nichiporuk IA, Grigoriev AI.

Noskov, PhD, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Study of the State of Fluids in the Human Body During Long -term Spaceflight (Sprut - MBI/Sprut -MBI Perfection) obtains data on the status of fluid systems of the human body during long -term spaceflight in order to evaluate adaptation mechanisms of human physiology and improve microgravity countermeasures aboard the International Space Station for crew health. EARTH BENEFITS New results for the changes in the body's hydration level and composition that are obtained via bioimpedance analysis align well with results previously obtained via invasive methods and do not conflict with long -standing ideas on the nature of the adaptation of water -electrolyte homeostasis to microgravity. This investigation demonstrates the advantages bioimpedance analysis has over other methods in the field of space medicine due to its safety and adaptability. The metho d of 2 - frequency bioimpedancemetry is a non-invasive, quick, and safe method for determining body composition and the volume of bodily fluids, based on the electrical properties of biological tissues. Moreover, it provides the necessary precision, and the information obtained is processed immediately during the examination. The portability and high interference -resistance makes the use of Sprut technology possible in field conditions \u2014for example, in ambulances \u2014and also for performing specific tasks of disas ter medicine and other extreme situations causing disruption of water - electrolyte homeostasis. S PACE BENEFITS Water -electrolyte homeostasis plays an important role in the processes of general adaptation of the human body to new living conditions and to mi crogravity in particular. Spaceflight causes restructuring of water -electrolyte homeostasis, ie, the lack of gravity and other spaceflight Cosmonaut during the Study of the State of Fluids in the Human Body During Long-term Spaceflight experiment session a board the International Space Station . Roscosmos image. 646 factors have a specific effect on the fluid systems of the body. In turn, these changes have direct and indirect effe cts on the physiological and metabolic functions of the body. Studying the changes of restructuring water -electrolyte exchange during spaceflight and the early postflight period is of great practical significance, since changes in water -electrolyte balance play an important role in developing postflight orthostatic instability and other detrimental changes in the cardiovascular system. Impedancemetry experiments aboard the space station using the Sprut -K Set demonstrate that it is possible to perform automa tic measurement of the main fluid volumes of a crew member's body in real time in long -term spaceflight conditions and show the possibility for using the bioimpedance method in weightlessness. The results of this experiment make it possible to use bioimped ance analysis for real -time medical monitoring since a crew member's hydration status can be determined using the onboard impedance meter multiple times and at any moment. R ESULTS Results of SPRUT -MBI showed that the gravitation factor played the most imp ortant role in reaching another level of water- electrolyte homeostasis. The use of a non -invasive, spaceflight - compatible method of bioimpedancemetry for the first time in the world's space programs made it possible to evaluate the hydration status of the human body directly during long -term spaceflight. Use of the Sprut- K onboard impedancemeter allowed the first repeat measurements in real time of the main fluid systems in 12 cosmonauts during 6 -month orbital flights and the diagnosis of the development of dehydration of the body. Analysis of the obtained results showed that all 12 cosmonauts exhibited hydration decrease, and the range of individual changes during flight was quite narrow: from 5 to 10% for various fluid systems. The results showed the unifo rm loss of fluid from various fluid systems in the body during long -term spaceflight. The maximum values for the shortage of fluids were noted immediately after the cosmonauts returned to Earth, which spoke to the particular intensity of the effects that the final phase of flight and landing have on water -electrolyte exchange. The development in weightlessness of hypohydration was discovered, expressed as a uniform decrease in fluid spaces, and characteristic changes in body composition. Moreover, the cha nges in and tempo of the reduction of fluid volumes, as well as the fat and muscle mass of the body, were closely comparable in character and magnitude. The majority of cosmonauts studied showed, despite individual variations, a clear reduction in the leve l of hydration during long -term exposure to weightlessness accompanied by a simultaneous loss of muscle mass. One week after flight completion, all parameters being studied showed a clear trend towards restoration of preflight hydration status and body mas s.

Smith, PhD, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Stability of Nutritional Compounds (Stability -Nutrition) studies the effects of the spaceflight environment, including radiation, on complex organic molecules such as vitamins and other compounds in food. This helps researchers develop more stable and reliable foods, packaging materials, and nutritional countermeasures suitable for future long -duration missions beyond low-Earth orbit. E ARTH BENEFITS The results of this investigation help in understanding the effects of adverse environments on food, this information assists Earth -based explorers in making healthy choices for long -term exploration of remote and harsh places like the Antarctic. S PACE BENEFITS Results of this investigation provide important information on the susceptibility of select foods and vitamins to adverse environmental factors encountered during space missions. R ESUL TS The Stability investigation studied the effects of radiation in space on complex organic molecules such as vitamins and other compounds in food at varying time intervals. Nutritional items examined were tortillas, salmon, almonds, broccoli au gratin, dried apricots, a multivitamin, and vitamin D supplements. In general, the study found that, while there were differences between the vitamin concentrations of food flight samples and ground samples, the degradation rates of nutrients were comparable in both sets. These results made it clear that long duration storage had a considerably larger impact on nutrient stability than flight in space. Prominent changes as a result of storage included the approximate 50% decrease of both folic acid and thiamin in tortillas, 15% to 20% decrease of folic acid and vitamins K and C in broccoli au gratin, 10% to 35% decrease of riboflavin and vitamins A and C in the multivitamin, and 200% increase of hexanal, which indicates that an increase in lipid peroxidation (and flavo r) occurred in almonds. Exposure to low -Earth orbit radiation had no effect on nutrient quantities. The results from this study will aid in the design of future food packaging and preservation systems for both ISS and long -term space exploration missions ( Zwart 2009).

The objective of this study is to evaluate the risk of microorganism inhalation, and adhesion to exposed skin, to the ambient air during stays aboard the ISS. E ARTH BENEFIT The result is possible to be applied to air quality and radiation exposure measurements in terrestrial air travel and other environments. S PACE BENEFIT This provides a standard for the basic data collection in space environmental measurement, the space medicine field, and the life science field. It is possible to use this information for the verification, and the operation method, of the radiation exposure prediction calculation model. R ESULTS Preliminary results showed that t he number of Colony Forming Units ( CFU) tended to decrease aboard the ISS and recovered after the return. On the other hand, the amount of fungal DNA extracted from skin samples increased during spaceflight.

The focus is on potentially pathogenic and destructive microbes, looking at the origin and distribution of species on different sample sites and looking at the changes of normal micro -biota of space explorers and the relation with the micro -biota in the International Space Station (ISS) during spaceflight. E ARTH BENEFIT S Sample will generate knowledge and tools to investigate hygienic conditions in hospitals. Sample techniques are currently being used to analyze the spread of microbes in intensive care units (ICUs) with special attention to methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). S PACE BENEFITS Based on Sample results, a machine may be designed that can monitor microbial growth in space without sending samples to Earth. Developers of future habitability procedures can use the knowledge gained from thi s experiment to better protect crew health on long -duration missions R ESULTS Two problems occurred that would affect the results of the experiment. The culture swabs taken were not stored in tubes with storage medium to enable survival, and the culture sw abs, body samples, and the specimen case were transported from the landing site in a cool box with a temperature that dropped below 0\u00b0C, which would damage the living bacteria present in the samples.

Image courtesy of ESA. 652 Primary data analysis was, however, undertaken, cosmonaut samples were cultured, and DeoxyriboNucleic Acid ( DNA) -analysis performed. The swab samples of the ISS were analyzed by conventional culturing and by DNA analysis methods. Culturing showed that some of the sites were colonized with bacteria, yeasts, and fungi. However, the actual number of microbes present could be higher than was found, as storage and transport issues may have resulted in possible death of part of the microbes. The DNA methods were far less hampered by cell death and enabled very accura te samples analysis. One method, quantitative real -time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), showed that surfaces were colonized with human bacteria, such as staphylococci , in some samples in relatively high numbers. This was in concordance with the culture re sults although the culturing numbers were a few orders of magnitude lower. Another method, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH method), showed a similar picture of high numbers of bacteria, human bacteria, yeasts, and fungi. The results showed that the microbial contamination of the ISS can be monitored with these methods and so optimizes the hygiene and health status. Both DNA methods are robust, can be automated, and have a potential to be used in space. In addition, the analysis of the bacteria in the specimen case showed no adhesion adaptation following exposure to space conditions for ten days.

The absence of the gravitational frame of reference during spaceflight could be responsible for disturbances in the mental representation of spatial cues, such as the perception of horizontal and vertical lines, the perception of an object's depth, and the perception of a target's distance. The results of this study could have important consequences for human performance during spaceflight. R ESULTS Visual illusions bas ed on perspective are less intense in microgravity. This suggests that the perspective cue is less crucial for depth perception. When a subject in space adjusted the dimensions of a 3 -D cube so that it looked normal, its height was shorter and its depth was greater than when performing this test in normal gravity; when a subject in space drew a Necker cube with the eyes closed, its height was shorter and its depth was greater. This indicated that the cognitive and the sensory - motor representations of 3 -D ob jects both adapt to space. It is well known that perception of size and distance are usually related. When underestimating the distance of an obj ect, people tend to attribute a small size to this object. In agreement with this, it was observed that space subjects indeed underestimated (by up to 20%) distance more than on Earth. These results indicated that the visual space of the astronauts (ie, the visual component of the perceptual representation of the world around them) was distorted in space. Interestingly, similar effects have been recently reported in spatial neglect and vestibular -defective patients. The speed of drawing and writing was less in microgravity compared to ground. The asymmetry between up and down vertical motion also tended to disappear in microgravity. These results confirmed those obtained previously in pointing experiments. European Space Agency astronaut Paolo Nespoli, conducts the Mental Representation of Spatial Cues During Spaceflight (3D -Space) experiment in the Columbus laboratory of the International Space Station. 3D -Space involves distance, written and illusion exercises, and is testing the hypothesis that altered visual perception affects motor control.

This study has important implications for understanding basic mechanisms of motor control in microgravity and for rehabilitative training of neurological patients with impaired motor control. EARTH BENEFITS This study has important implications in understanding basic mechanisms of motor control in microgravity and for rehabilitative training of neurological patients with impaired motor control. S PACE BENEFITS Examination of the orientation of the Listing's Plane during the course of a prolonged s pace mission is of particular interest; as on Earth, the Listing's Plane appears to be dependent on input from the vestibular system, ie, detected through the head position with relation to gravity. By exposing the astronaut to the weightlessness of space, this experiment can follow the subsequent adaptation of the astronaut's vestibular system during the flight and after re - entry. R ESULTS Visual functions were observed in flight for 31 astronauts under prolonged microgravity conditions. The precision and speed parameters of visual tracing such as fixational rotations of the eyes (saccades), smooth tracking of linear and curved movements of a focal point stimulus, and following a vertical pendulum -like movement stimuli became worse. In a number of cases, a complete disintegration of the smooth tracing reflex occurred as well as an increase in the time taken to fix the gaze on a target (by fac tors of 2 or more) and decreased in the frequency of stimulus tracking. During the initial period of European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Reiter wear s the Eye Tracking Device on the International Space Station in 2006. ESA image. 657 adaptation to spaceflight and periodically during prolonged flight, the system of smooth visual tracking was found to undergo a transition to a strategy of saccadic approximation ( abrupt rapid movements of both eyes) . These impairments, seen in virtually all the crew members, were apparently due to vestibular deprivation in space. Pre and postflight examinations of 9 cosmonauts participating in ISS missions were completed using a computer -aided method to investigate eye motion control and vestibular function after long -term stay in microgravity (126 -195 days). Studies of the vestibular function, intersensory interactions, and the tracking function of the eye s in the crew members were performed on days 1 -2, 4-5, and 8 -9 after return to Earth. The role and significance of the vestibular system (the vestibule and semicircular canals of the inner ear and the vestibulocochlear nerve that work with the brain to mai ntain balance and orientation) in eye tracking were determined. Results of the postflight examinations showed a significant change in the accuracy, velocity, and temporal characteristics of eye tracking and the muting of the vestibular response. Althoug h, microgravity does not directly influence visual functions, changing the level and pattern of inner ear sensory /receptor input leads to a decrease in the accuracy and velocity of all forms of visual tracking. Eye destabilization related to an increase in slow drift, the appearance of a great number of saccadic (abrupt fast) movements, and the emergence of spontaneous nystagmus (involuntary eye movement) was found. Similar disturbances, as those previously seen during flight, in the accuracy of saccadic an d smooth tracking (especially in the vertical plane) and the development of a new tracking strategy (the gaze approaches a target and follows its movement using a set of saccadic movements) were demonstrated and lead to a considerable increase (by a factor of three or more) in the time required for examining and identifying a target and setting the gaze on targets post landing. In the selected period of examination (9 days after the flight), no recovery of the indices of the tracking eye function to the bas eline level was observed; however, a tendency for normalization was recorded.

These conditions can cause reduced spinal cord excitability, which can lead to loss of loco - motor function in the legs. Spinal cord excitability was isolated and measured to study possible ways to reverse the process while still in flight. Reversal of this process will result in a healthier crew following long -duration spaceflight. E ARTH BENEFITS The information gained by this investigation may help researchers develop countermeasures to overcome decreases in spinal excitability. There are many disorders that involve decreases in nerve impulses and loss of sensitivity. Countermeasures that are used in orbit may lead to advances on Earth in treatment of various nerve disorders and spinal injuries. S PACE BENEFITS The most basic unit of exercise is the contraction of a small group of muscle fibers innervated by the projections of a single nerve cell. If this and other nerve cells in the spinal cord become less excitable during spaceflight, it would be more difficult to make muscle fibers contract. As a result, more effort would be required to produce the same level of exercise, or if the same apparent effort were maintained, the actual level of exercise would decrease. If present after landing, it would be more difficult to stand and walk. However, depending on the underlying mechanisms, it may be possible to reverse the process while still in flight. R ESULTS Spinal Cord Excitability (SCE) was measured with the H -reflex (Hoffmann reflex) method: 60 shocks of varying lengths were applied to the posterior tibial nerve and the electromyography response detected at the soleus. H -Reflex was conducted repeatedly before, during, and after flight. There was high variation between subjects but the H -reflex was observed to decrease by about 35 percen t after 5 days in space and remain at the new level for the duration of the flight. Upon return to 1 g, full recovery took about 10 days. This indicates a reduction of spinal cord excitability in microgravity due to a partial response to signals from the n ervous system. The consequence is that muscle mass decreases at 0 g even with exercise and implies there JSC2001E34377 - Expedition 3 commander Culbertson sits in the shuttle middeck performing the Effects of Altered Gravity on the Spinal Cord Excitability experiment. 659 may be limits to the capacity of exercise to maintain muscle and bone mass as well as cardiac muscle strength on long -duration missions. The decrease in SCE is observed in space but not in prolonged bed rest, suggesting it may be partly a nervous system response and not simply due to disuse of the legs. Decreased SCE is therefore of high concern for long -duration missions and will require more adequate c ountermeasures. P UBLICATION (S) Watt DG.

Researchers are documenting, for the first time, any changes in the skin sensitivity of each astronaut's foot sole in order to identify which receptors may be influenced by a period of weightlessness. Coupled with tests that assess changes in astronauts' a bilities to maintain their balance, these measures will help establish how increased skin sensitivity contributes to balance control. E ARTH BENEFITS Project results are expected to add significantly to existing studies of the aging process, which includes reductions in information relayed by skin sensors that lead to a loss of balance control and, among the elderly especially, a greater incidence of falls. S PACE BENEFITS Anecdotal eviden ce from astronauts suggests that the tingling sensation some feel in their feet while in space and for short periods back on Earth may be the response of different sensory receptors in the skin that naturally compensate for the re -weighting of sensory information due to the decreased input from the vestibular, or inner ear, system in an environment of microgravity. The resea rch has the potential to impact future applications to further understand skin contributions to balance control in an altered gravity -inertial environment for space exploration. R ESULTS Vibration frequencies were chosen to target the 4 classes of mechanoreceptors: 3 and 25Hz for slowly -adapting receptors; 60 and 250Hz for fast- adapting receptors. Functional balance test scores (computerized dynamic posturography [CDP]) were compared to sk in sensitivity changes. It was hypothesized that skin sensitivity would increase following spaceflight and Image shows the set up for the vibrotactile sensitivity threshold test performed during the experiment. Changes in sensitivity were assesses on 3 locations on the plantar surface of the foot using a mini shaker applying vibration through a probe with a contact surface area of 2 mm in diameter. Foam templates were developed for each crew member using orthopedic foam. Holes were made to allow room for the insertion of the vibration probe for each of the three testing locations on the plantar surface of the foot. Image courtesy of Leah Bent, University of Guelph. 661 correlate to balance changes. Data from 11 astronauts before and after short missions (12 -16 d) indicate decreased skin sensitivity on landing day at 3 and 25Hz on the great toe. Hypersensitivity was found only for a subset of astronauts (n = 6) with significantly increased sensitivity to 250Hz at the heel. This subset also displayed substantially reduced CDP equilibrium scores on landing compared to n on-hypersensitive participants (mean= 39 versus 68). Selective changes in skin sensitivity are apparent after spaceflight. Observed hyposensitivity of slowly adapting receptors may indicate a strategy to reduce pressure input during periods of unloading. H ypersensitivity of fast- adapting receptors coupled with reduced equilibrium scores may reflect targeted sensory re -weighting. Altered gravito -inertial environments reduce vestibular function in balance control, which may trigger increased weighting of fast- adapting receptors. Understanding modulations to skin sensitivity has translational implications for mitigating postural disequilibrium following spaceflight.

Bloomberg, PhD, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES Promoting Sensorimotor Response to Generalizability: A Countermeasure to Mitigate Locomotor Dysfunction After Long -duration Spaceflight (Mobility) studies changes in posture and gait after long -duration spaceflight. Anticipated results help in the development of an in - flight treadmill training program for International Space Station (ISS) crew members, which could facilitate rapid recovery of fu nctional mobility after long -duration spaceflight. E ARTH BENEFITS As people age on Earth, they sometimes experience instabilities in standing and walking. The development of unique walking and balance training procedures like the ones proposed in this study can be used to help prevent falling and injury in the elderly population. S PACE BENEFITS Following long -duration spaceflight, crew members have trouble standing and walking . The magnitude and duration of postflight instability increases with longer exposure to microgravity and can pose a risk to crew safety and to mission objectives during extravehicular operations during planetary exploration. Presently, no operational coun termeasure is available to mitigate these balance and locomotor disturbances. This study proposes to develop a unified, multi -disciplinary countermeasure system designed to enhance postflight adaptive locomotor function that can be easily integrated with t he existing ISS treadmill procedures without requiring more commitment of valuable crew resources. If successful, this experiment will provide methods for overcoming one of the most significant obstacles to long -term spaceflights, including trips to the mo on and Mars. R ESULTS Following their return to Earth, astronauts experience disturbances in their ability to walk and maintain postural stability due to the brain's adaptation floating weightless in space. The goal JSC2004E51814 - On November 24, 2004, astronaut John L. Phillips (left), Expedition 11 NASA space station science officer and flight engineer, participates in a mobility session of the Integrated Treadmill Locomotion Test (ITLT) at NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC). Jacob Bloomberg (center) and Brian Peters assisted Phillips. 663 was to characterize the effects of long -duration spaceflight on astronaut locomotor control and functional mobility. The Mobility investigation was conducted with 18 ISS crew members over the course of Expeditions 5 -12. Locomotor function was assessed before and after spaceflight using 2 tests o f gait function. The first test characterized alterations in several systems responsible for the control of locomotion. For this test, subjects walked on a treadmill to assess changes in dynamic visual acuity and lower limb coordination strategies. The se cond test provided a corresponding assessment of overall functional mobility by testing the subjects' ability to negotiate a complex obstacle course. Toe clearance (minimum height of the toe as the foot swings forward) during treadmill walking was assessed to determine whether astronauts are at an increased risk of tripping after their return from long -duration spaceflight. Test performed on landing day showed reduced toe clearance and an increased risk of tripping during walking one day after spaceflight. However, tripping risk on subsequent days was not different than preflight (Miller 2010). Postflight changes in gaze control produced decreases in the ability to see clearly during walking. Recovery in visual performance occurred during the 2 -week postflig ht recovery period (Peters 2011). Results from the obstacle course indicated adaptation to spaceflight led to a 48% increase in time to traverse the course one day after landing, and recovery of function took an average of 15 days to return to within 95% of their preflight level of performance. This recovery was characterized by a 2 - stage re -adaptation process characterized by a fast learning response using cognitive superv ision followed by a slower learning process designed to ultimately automate re -learned gait patterns (Mulavara 2010). This research provides valuable data on the extent of postflight locomotor dysfunction, the rate of improvement, and the expected duration of dysfunction of crew members following long - duration spaceflight. These findings will be important in the design of interventions to reduce or eliminate spaceflight related locomotor disturbances. P UBLICATION (S) Cohen HS, Bloom berg JJ, Paloski WH.

Adaptation will be assessed by rating motion perception as a result of body movements. MOP will also correlate susceptibility to space adaptation syndrome (SAS) with susceptibility to sickness induced by c entrifugation (SIC). The results will allow the team to establish the time course of the adaptation process and thereby set a further step in the determination of key parameters in vestibular adaptation. R ESULTS The main results concern the correlation between SIC and SAS. Eight astronauts rated their individual susceptibility to SIC and SAS on an 11 -point rating scale in both the in- flight study and the ground- based centrifuge study. Other than the previous observations, where susceptibility to SAS was reported in a binary way (\"yes\" or \"no\"), the ratings from the MOP questionnaire allowed for a more detailed comparison. Data showed that the correlation between the maximum SAS- rating reported in flight and the maximum SIC -rating reported post- centrifuge is statistically, highly significant (R=0.89; p=0.003). This indicated that the extent to which an individual astronaut suffered from SIC after centrifugation, was related to that from SAS in flight. The detailed ratings obtained within the MOP study provided scienti fic evidence for previous anecdotal observations that, different from sickness induced by car, ship, or aircraft motion on Earth, SIC is highly correlated with the in- flight SAS. It was concluded that any transition from Earth's gravity to another causes v estibular adaptation problems. Additional tests performed during the Baseline Data Collection showed that the centrifuge run affected orientation responses, which depend on vestibular information about the direction of the Earth vertical. With these result s, space authorities and researchers now have a validated paradigm available to assess and study SAS on Earth, which was lacking so far.

At the level of individual sensors and effectors, the coordinate systems employed are well defined. It is not in the coordinate system of an individual receptor, but rather, in examining the coordination of sensory and motor activity that the question of reference frames becomes interesting. This experiment tests the role of gravity in defining the reference frames used for 3 -D navigation and for representing the orientation of our own bodies and the orientation of visual stimuli. A series of psychophysical tests are used to compare how human subjects perform these types of task both on the ground and in the weightless conditions of orbital flight. Evoked potentials are also meas ured through surface electrodes applied to the scalp in order to measure the spatial and temporal components of information processing in the brain in the absence of gravity. RESULTS Three main results were shown in the Neurocog experiment. First, weightlessness specifically affects visual- evoked potential related to the presentation of a virtual 3 -D navigation tunnel: subjects observed a simulated passive movement through a virtual tunne l. Each tunnel contained a bend. After subjects emerged from the end of the tunnel, they were asked to report the perceived turn angle by adjusting a visual indicator with a trackball. On Earth, the estimation of pitch turns is greater for forward (nose -down) turns versus backward (nose -up) turns. This asymmetry does not exist to this extent in weightlessness. Second, weightlessness increases the alpha rhythm gain during the transition between eyes -closed and eyes -opened states. Finally, moving in virtual n avigation induces midfrontal N200 event related potentials supported by a transient theta ringing altered in weightlessness. The research from this experiment is continuing with a follow -on experiment (Neurocog -2), which is embedded within the ESA -sponso red Neurospat experiment.

The experiment invo lves recording of the electroencephalographic activity of the brain (EEG dynamics) and event related potentials (ERP) during performance of a visual- orientation perception and visuo -motor tracking task that humans and astronauts may encounter on a daily basis. Specifically, 5 cognitive processes (perception, attention, memorization, decision, and action) are studied. EARTH BENEFITS Understanding how the neural processes of perception adapt to weightlessness in turn provides an insight into exactly how perc eption is altered by the presence of gravity. This research could therefore improve our fundamental knowledge of how the human central nervous system functions on Earth. Furthermore drawing similarities between the disorientation experienced by astronauts when first adapting to weightlessness and certain 669 medical conditions on Earth where disorientation can be an important symptom, can provide important information of the areas of the brain responsible, which could help with the treatment of such conditions. The development of these electrophysiological experimental protocols promises to provide a new tool for clinical testing of spatial cognition, altered in pathological conditions and in normal aging. S PACE BENEFITS Previous neuroscience research has highlighted various differences between perception on Earth and in space. Without gravity to act as a stimulus, some of the most important neural sensors in the body cannot provide the assistance they would normally provide for orientation purposes. Astronauts therefore rely more heavily on visual perception for orientation. For this reason understanding what altered visual perception occurs in weightlessness, and what areas of the brain are responsible, is an important element in making sure that this does not present any issues for undertaking mission activities, especially key activities such as spacewalks and dockings/undockings. Results generated could form a key part of mission planning and therefore optimize the chances of achieving all mission goals and s ecure optimal mission success. It could also potentially feed into the design of equipment for use in orbit. RESULTS Data from the Neurospat experiment is currently being analyzed and processed prior to publication.

Clarke, PhD, Charite Medical School, Berlin, Germany RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Otolith Assessment During Postflight Re -adaptation (Otolith) explores the adaptive processes in the human vestibular (inner ear) system as it readapts to ground conditions after spaceflight. Given that the loss of the gravitational force represents a loss of this sense for the otolith organs, the working hypothesis is that the dynamic otolith -ocular reflex (OOR) will be enhanced in microgravity. Immediately after return to the 1 -g environment, a corresponding increase in the OOR gain should be observed, and over the course of the following days return to preflight baseline level. This should also be the case with subjective visual vertical (SVV) estimation. The same theory applies to the vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs); an increase in their amp litude is expected during the period after re -entry. The re -adaptation process is expected to proceed largely over the first 12 days after landing. RESULTS The SVV findings indicated that after a 10 -day mission, the readaptation of otolith function proceeded over a period of 8 -10 days. Considerable interindividual variability in response change and adaptive time constants. The SVV data support the idea of a labyrinth dominance, rather than a morphological asymmetry, as proposed previously. PUBLICATI ON(S) Clarke AH, Just K, Krzok W, Schonfeld U.

From a theoretical perspective, the experiment tests a specific hypothesis from experimental psychology, which states that human visual perception is tuned to invariants of the visual field to determine what actions are afforded (offered or permitted) by the environment. The experiment examines how perception strategies have evolved within the constraints imposed by gravity. From a more practical viewpoint, the experiment tests w hether Earth -adapted strategies lead to modifications or outright errors in the perception of visual space during spaceflight. Passages is based on a known observation that human beings unconsciously use eye height to calibrate physical dimensions in the v isual field. The perceptual mechanism relies on the fact that on Earth eye height above the floor can be known by the observer through proprioception and an internal representation of body scheme. R ESULTS At the time of compilation of this document the ex periment data was still being analysed prior to publication of results. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication.

NASA/ESA i mage and Vestibular Systems Expedition(s): 14-15 Principal Investigator(s): Barry Fowler, PhD, York University, North York, Ontario, Canada RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Perceptual -Motor Deficits in Space (PMDIS) investigates why astronauts experience difficulty with hand -eye coordination while in orbit. In -flight data distinguishes between 3 possible explanations: the brain not adapting to the near weightlessness of space ; the difficulty of performing fine movements when floating in space; and stress due to factors such as space sickness and sleep deprivation. E ARTH BENEFITS Understanding how the brain adapts to physiological changes that the International Space Station (ISS) crew members undergo are applicable on Earth as well as space. The results from this experiment will give insight on how the brain overcomes stresses that are not normally part of the day -to-day life. This new information can be applied in many areas of research that deal with neurological diseases in order to provide improved treatments. SPACE BENEFITS A mini -centrifuge with daily sessions has been suggested as a means for countering the physiological effects of long -term spaceflight, eg, a Mars mission. This raises the possibility of continual changes in eye -hand coordination as the gravity signal changes on a daily basis. Understanding the cause of coordination loss is therefore critical to developing countermeasures. RESULTS The results from PMDIS contradict the microgravity hypothesis because a major prediction of this hypothesis, that performance would be degraded using either the stylus or the joystick, was not supported. Rather, performance degradation only occurred with the more mentally demanding dual task using the joystick. These results suggest that the loss of hand- eye coordination in space can be attributed to a variety of interacting stressors that lead to cognitive overload. These factors include lack of body stability, degree of learning on the task and its complexity, space sickness, and sleep deprivation. PUBLICATION (S) Fowler B, Meehan S, Singhal A.

The Space Headaches experiment improves our understanding of such conditions, which helps in the development of methods to alleviate associated sympto ms and improve the well- being and performance of crew members in orbit. This can also improve our knowledge of similar conditions on Earth. SPACE BENEFITS Headaches during spaceflight can negatively affect mental and physical capacities of crew members, which can influence performance during a space mission. Data from this experiment impro ve our understanding of such conditions, providing a stepping stone to development of countermeasures to alleviate associated symptoms, thus improving the well- being of our crew members in orbit and in turn improving astronaut performance. E ARTH BENEFITS Headaches are also common on Earth, either as an isolated condition or as one symptom of another medical condition. Improving the knowledge we gather in space of the nature and occurrence of headaches could also provide an insight to associated conditions on Earth. RESULTS No results are available yet as the investigation is still ongoing. This investigation is ongoing, and additional results are pending publication.

The effect of microgravity on subjective perception of verticality is also researched. R ESULTS Statistical analysis showed a significant decrease of intervals between 2 heart beats (RRI) during the counter -clockwise rotation measured preflight, compared to before rotation stimulus. Comparison of the preflight data with those measured postflight revealed a trend that is reoccurring during each postfligh t measurement (Return+1, +4 and +9 days), ie, a decrease of RRI during both rotations compared to the baseline recordings. The decrease was significant for data measured on Return +9 days. Statistical analysis revealed no significant effects for the phase of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA - a naturally occurring variation in heart rate that occurs during a breathing cycle). The Final check before centrifugation of cosmonaut Youri Malenchenko who is seated on the Visual and Vestibular Integration Sys tem (VVIS) in Star City GCTC - Moscow. ESA image. 676 effects seen on the heart rate during the first counter -clockwise rotation could be explained by an \"anticipative\" stress ef fect of the subjects, causing an increase of sympathetic activation and thus increased heart rate. The subsequent heart rate decrease during the clockwise rotation could be attributed to a habituation of the subjects to the rotation. Interestingly, this ef fect was not observed during the testing days after their re -entry. On the contrary, the heart rate increased even more during the second rotation. This reflects a delayed or hampered recovery of the sympathetic nervous system after activation. It might be possible that spaceflight is at the base of this recovery problem because of a vestibular and a cardiovascular deconditioning. As expected, the analysis revealed that the influence of T resp is larger (and more significant) than the possible effect of micr ogravity on RSA amplitude. With the small number of subjects and the large inter -subject variability the statistical power is too low to permit a proper multifactorial statistical analysis for RSA. Imposing a particular breathing pattern to the subjects is not feasible during centrifugation. Therefore, more subjects are necessary to increase the power to elucidate possible effects.

Christensen, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Sympathoadrenal Activity in Humans During Spaceflight (Sympatho) studies the influence of microgravity on adrenal activity in the sympathetic nervous system, which has importance for cardiovascular system regulation such as accelerating heart rate, constricting blood vessels, and raising blood pressure in short -duration space explorers. Ground- based experiments have shown that the sympathetic activity is decreased in response to displacement of the blood from the lower part of the body to the heart- lung area after changing from the upright or sitting position to the supine (lying on back) position. In space, sympathetic activity is expected to be decreased but experim ents have suggested that it actually increases during weightlessness. This is the core element of the Sympatho experiment. R ESULTS Long -term changes in sympathoadrenal activity were measured through platelet norepinephrine and epinephrine levels. Ten normal, healthy subjects were studied before and during head- down bed rest (HDBR) of 2 weeks duration, as well as during an ambulatory study period of a similar length. Platelet norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations (preflight and postflight) were studied in 5 cosmonauts who participated in 3 different Soyuz missions to the International Space Station (ISS). Due to the long half- life of norepinephrine and epinephrine in platelets (approximately 2 days), data obtained early after landing would still reflect the microgravity state. Platelet norepinephrine decreased markedly during HDBR. During microgravity platelet norepinephrine increased the 5 cosmonauts. Platelet norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations expressed in percentage of preflight and pre -HDBR values, respectively, were significantly increased during microgravity as compared to HDBR. The increas e in platelet norepinephrine and epinephrine during microgravity is most likely due to an increase in sympathoadrenal activity. The reason why sympathoadrenal activity does not decrease to low levels during microgravity as one would expect remains to be re solved. The exact interrelationship in microgravity between the increase in cardiac output, the decrease in plasma volume and the increase in sympathoadrenal activity during spaceflight remains to be clarified. Plasma volume decreases inflight, but this change is unlikely to explain the increase in sympathetic nervous activity. There did not appear to be a pronounced early Freezer Kriogem -03 for storage of blood samples . ESA image. 678 increase in urine output during weightlessness, but there may be a relative increase compared to the intake of fluid because the intak e of fluid and food tend to decrease. It is likely that vasoconstriction is maintained or increased in the lower part of the body inflight. Thus sympathetic activity may be increased to counteract the increase in blood flow to the brain and to other organs above the heart level during microgravity. In conclusion, a relative high sympathoadrenal activity as compared to preflight values seems to be an integrated part of the regulatory response to microgravity. Furthermore, HDBR cannot be applied to simulate c hanges in sympathoadrenal activity in humans during microgravity. P UBLICATION (S) Christensen NJ, Heer MA, Ivanova K, Norsk P.

Ground -based experiments have shown that the sympathetic activity is decreased in response to displacement of the blood from the lower part of the body to the heart- lung area after changing from the upright or sitting position to the supine (lying on back) position. In space, sym pathetic activity is expected to be decreased but experiments have suggested that it actually increases during weightlessness. This is the core element of the Sympatho experiment R ESULTS Eight male astronauts were studied between third and sixth months of flight on the International Space Station. It was observed that sympathetic nervous system activity but not plasma epinephrine values were very high during the mission and the level corresponded to values obtained in sitting position on Earth. This response was most likely related to the decrease observed in systemic vascular resistance and arterial blood pressure observed during the mission. The mechanism of the decrease in vascular resistance during spaceflight has not been clarified, but it is likely to be related to the blood and fluid shift to the upper part of the body as observed during microgravity. Clearly a high sympathetic nervous system activity is required for astro nauts to maintain an adequate blood pressure level in space. Further studies of the mechanisms involved are therefore of major importance. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication.

Antonov, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Study of the Typological Characteristics of ISS Crew Operator Activity During Long -term Space Flight (Tipologia/TipologiaPerfection ) identifies behavioral characteristics in the actions of crew members, which could be used to determine the current psychological state, to predict future states, and to modify the performance quality of skill tasks undertaken in spaceflight conditions. T he experiment aims to reveal the individual traits of the crew member's operational activity and to evaluate the forecasting capabilities of indicators, using the computer games Sapior (Sapper) and Tetris as models of skill activity. E ARTH BENEFITS Tipologia uses a new (for space medicine) strategy of breaking down the test subject's activity into statistical probability and predetermined. This new division is based on the neuropsychological approach to the functional role of different areas of the c erebral cortex. It should be noted that this approach is supported by multiple clinical and experimental observations and histological studies. S PACE BENEFITS The results of this experiment are connected to the development of new methods and tools used to increase the reliability of the operator's performance and decrease the risk of incorrect actions when solving skill problems. The experiment provides information necessary for gaining insight into such fundamental issues as the connection of the brain's electrical phenomenon and the behavioral act, the formation of readiness for skill activity, and understanding the mechanisms responsible for changing response quality while under the effect of spaceflight including weightlessness. It is possible that the results serve as a foundation for developing new Russian cosmonaut G.I.

R ESULTS Russian crew participants demonstrated a high level of professional skill training when performing logical and spatial types of tasks, as well as adaptive biological control. During preflight training, all subjects are able to successfully develop adaptive biological control skills and learned to control their readiness skill when solving logical and spatial problems. When solving spatial problems, the ABC effect was observed mostly starting from the third training session. This was confirmed by the increas e of the productivity indicators. When solving logical problems, the ABC effect was observed starting from the third or fourth training session. By the last training session, the ABC skill, when solving logical and spatial problems, had been developed in a ll cosmonauts. However, in spaceflight conditions, adaptive skill suffered in all subjects: the ABC effect was not observed in the type of activity, which is difficult for the cosmonaut because of his particular behavioral characteristics. The logical ac tivity proved more difficult for most cosmonauts. Only one subject was able to reproduce the ABC skill he had developed earlier when solving logical problems in spaceflight conditions. It should also be mentioned that during postflight analysis, the ABC sk ill, when solving spatial and logical problems, was expressed distinctly in almost all of the subjects, regardless of how it was affected during spaceflight.

A further contribution to the detection of subjective vertical is observed from visceral receptors sensitive to blood mass shifts, mainly located in the kidneys and in the thorax, specific data on the contribution of visceral receptors to the detection of subje ctive vertical in a specific environment is still lacking. The aim of this experiment is the analysis of visceral receptor performance in weightlessness. RESULTS The subjective visual vertical (SVV) can be significantly influenced by the presence of a displaced visual field, as in the case of the rod and frame test (RFT). A series of studies showed the effects of blood mass shifts to and from the lower limbs on SVV due to visceral mechanoreceptors (VM) located at the level of the kidneys and of the thorax. These sensors may be artificially activated with a lower body negative pressure (LBNP) device. In this study, the role of visual and VM cues to orientation perception were evaluated using the RFT and the LBNP devices under a microgravity environment. A preliminary investigation was conducted in a sample of military pilots to develop a RFT protocol to be used in mic rogravity environments. This protocol was adopted to evaluate the contribution of VM to the SVV in a cosmonaut before, during, and after a 10 -day spaceflight, with and without concurrent activation of LBNP.

NASA image. 683 The same test sequence, including LBNP exposure, was repeated a few months later on Earth on the same subject. As expected, the influence of the frame on rod positioning was statistically significant in all test conditions. During the in- flight experimental step, a substantial lack of significant changes compared to the preflight condition was observed. Moreover, substantially no effects due to LBNP were observed. A mild rod displacement from the body axis was detected under microgravity compared to the preflight recording. Such a finding was in part redu ced during LBNP. The same findings were observed during the postflight repeat of the experiment. Results showed an absence in this subject of significant effects on the RFT due to microgravity. In conclusion, no effects from subject's VM on the RFT and min or changes in the SVV could be detected. PUBLICATION (S) Lucertini M, De Angelis C, Martelli M, Zolesi V, Tomao E.

It also examines the effects of stimulus frequency (0.15 -0.6Hz) on adaptive changes in eye movements and motion perception and evaluates how a tactile prosthesis can be used to improve control performance. R ESULTS In summary, results were consistent with the hypothesis that adaptive changes in the neural integration of otolith input leads to perceptual illusions and impaired manual control after spaceflight. The postflight recovery of motion perception and manual control performance was complete within 1 week following short- duration space missions. Further study is needed to examine the effect of longer -duration missions. The results of the studies are also consistent with the otolith asymmetry hypothesis as contributing to the physiological basis for tilt -translation disturbances. The strong correspondence between tilt perception errors and manual control performance decline suggested that these adaptive changes in sensorimotor function have operational consequences for vehicular control. These measures are relevant to how impairments in otolith processing may affect other vehicular control tasks, such as driving with vestibul ar impairments. Finally, it was demonstrated that a relatively simple tactile prosthesis is sufficient to bring landing day performance to preflight levels. The refinement of a tactile prosthesis to improve spatial orientation can serve as a countermeasure for tilt -translation disturbances on a variety of acceleration platforms. Validation of simple sensory aids is applicable to balance prosthesis applications for vestibular loss patients and the elderly to mitigate risks due to falling or loss of orientati on.

ALTEA improves the understanding of t he impact that radiation has on the human central nervous system functions and will study the flashes from cosmic radiation that astronauts have reported since the Apollo flights. It also provides an assessment of the radiation environment in the Internati onal Space Station (ISS). E ARTH BENEFITS Data provided from ALTEA lead to further understanding of how radiation may affect brain function on Earth as well as in space. While the levels of heavy ion radiation are much higher in space than on Earth, any understanding into the way radiation may alter brain function is extremely us eful to neuroscientists. Ion therapies to treat brain tumors benefit from the ALTEA results. S PACE BENEFITS Crew members from Apollo missions onward have reported seeing unexplained light flashes (phosphenes), which were attributed to abnormal brain function caused by space radiation. Outside the protection of Earth's magnetic shield, ISS crew members are exposed to increased radiation, but the radiation environment is even more severe as exploration crews leave Earth's geomagnetic field and transit t o other planets. The tests conducted using the ALTEA hardware help scientists characterize how the heavy ion radiation of space impacts the brain and whether or not that radiation causes any temporary or permanent abnormalities in the brain function and th e visual system in particular. R ESULTS Since the Apollo flights to the moon, it has been known that most astronauts experience sudden visual light flashes during spaceflight. Described in early reports as occurring in darkness ISS128E007282 - View of astronaut Tim Copra with the Anomalous Long Term Effects in Astronauts' Central Nervous System (ALTEA) Silicon Detector kit in U.S. Laboratory Destiny. 687 and typically before falling asleep, these light flashes are thought to originate as an effect of high -energy particles, abundant in space, interacting with the eye and/or the visual anatomy. The ALTEA project, active on ISS since August 2006 and currently investigating the ISS- US La b radiation environment (ALTEA- DOSI, ALTEA -SHIELD/survey), has also been studying the risks of possible damage to the brain from particle radiation in space (ALTEA -CNSM). It is proposed that these interaction effects may go well beyond light flashes and co uld constitute a new kind of risk for longer space voyages. One study focus was on these abnormal visual perceptions and the impact on retinal and brain visual structures. ALTEA, with its 6 double detectors covering most of the astronaut's head, permits a 3-dimensional reconstruction of the energy released in the brain by ionizing particles. In addition, ALTEA monitors the functional state of the optical pathway in order to interpret the biophysical mechanisms generating abnormal perceptions. A survey was conducted in 2003 with 59 astronauts on the perception of light flashes, or \"phosphenes\", during missions. It was found that 80% of space explorers experience light flashes at some point (mainly before sleep when the eyes are night adjusted). As many as 20 % of the respondents thought that light flashes sometimes disturbed their sleep. Light flashes are predominantly white, but other colors are mentioned, in particular yellow (10%). Most light flashes have an elongated shape, like stripes or comets, and are associated with a perception of motion. The motion is left -right or in -out, but never up-down, and about 8% of light flashes have a \"blob\" shape. There is a positive correlation between light flashes and radiation flux, and the majority of light flash in space is most likely produced by a direct interaction of an ion with the retina, although there is indirect indication that light flashes can result from interaction between particles and brain structures as well. Solar Particle Events (SPE s) could represent a high radiation hazard for the ISS crew. During most of the December 2006 SPE, the ALTEA detector collected continuous data inside the U.S. Lab module. Results indicate that a SPE significantly affects radiation energy levels in the ISS, producing a substantial increase of low energy radiation rate, which reaches the highest values in quite short periods. This confirms the need to consider SPEs in those biological processes for which radiation rate plays an important role. These results provide the first information for charged radiation risk assessment in space habitats during a SPE.

Radiation exposure can have significant biological effects on living organisms, and on the biological investigations being done on ISS and on the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo; therefore, by installing area dosimeters at 17 fixed locations inside the Kibo Module, continuous area radiation monit oring can be provided throughout the ISS Kibo program. E ARTH BENEFIT The dosimeters have been applied to dosimetry for radiobiology experiments and ground performance test for study of shielding effect with heavy -ion particles. Dosimetric methods are also used for area radiation monitoring due to high energy accelerators. S PACE BENEFIT The measurement of radiation environmental parameters in space is essential to support radiation risk assessment for crew members and to be a benchmark of simulation codes of space radiation models for present, and future, human space activities. Full un derstanding of space radiation, and the doses surrounding crew members, is essential to dose management and space radiation protection. Accumulated data and knowledge are beneficial to design new active and passive types of radiation monitoring, shielding, and the design of future space vehicles. R ESULTS Radiation monitoring system was flown aboard Soyuz spacecraft, installed in the Kibo module aboard the ISS with Area and Exp PADLES dosimeters and collected data. Results from returned dosimeters found that the particle fluxes change more than twice depending on the installation orientation, since space radiation environment in low -Earth orbit aren't isotropic.

Neutron radiation is estimated to be 20% of the total radiation on the International Space Station (ISS). This study characterizes the neutron radiation environment to develop safety measures to protect future ISS crews. E ARTH BENEFIT The technology developed for BBND will also have application in monitoring the environment of high -radiation facilities on Earth . S PACE BENEFIT A neutron is an elementary particle. Since a neutron has no electric charge, it can penetrate most substances. Even low -energy neutrons can reach the internal human organs, including bone marrow. It is said that 5% to 30% of the whole radiation dose astronauts receive is neutron energy. The obtained data is to be used for the enhancement of space radiation exposure management technology, needed for further human activity aboard the ISS. R ESULTS BBND characterized the neutron radiation aboard t he ISS during Expeditions 2 and 3 and determined that galactic cosmic rays were the major cause of secondary neutrons measured inside the ISS habitats. The neutron energy spectrum was measured from March 23, 2001, through November 14, 2001, in the U.S. Lab oratory Module. The timeframe enabled neutron measurements to be made during a time of increased solar activity (solar maximum) as well as observe the measurements from a solar flare on November 4, 2001. BBND results show that the overall neutron environm ent at the ISS orbital altitude is influenced by highly energetic galactic cosmic rays, except in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region where protons trapped in the Earth's magnetic field cause a more severe neutron environment.

This unit will process and store neutron information recorded by six spherical detectors scattered around the Station. JAXA image. 692 However, the number of pa rticles measured per second per square cm per MeV obtained by BBND is consistently lower than that of the previous investigations. The average dose - equivalent rate observed through the investigation was 3.9 micro Sv/hour or about 10 times the rate of radio logical exposure to the average U.S. citizen. In general, radiation damage to the human body is indicated by the amount of energy deposited in living tissue, modified by the type of radiation causing the damage; this is measured in units of Sieverts (Sv). The background radiation dose received by an average person in the United States is approximately 3.5 milli Sv/year. Conversely, an exposure of 1 Sv can result in radiation poisoning and a dose of 5 Sv will result in death in 50% of exposed individuals. Th e average dose -equivalent rate observed through the BBND investigation is 3.9 micro Sv/hour, or about 10 times the average U.S. surface rate. The highest rate, 96 micro Sv/hour was observed in the SAA region. On November 4, 2001, a solar flare and the ass ociated geomagnetic activity caused the most severe radiation environment inside the ISS during the BBND experiment. The increase of neutron dose -equivalent due to those events was evaluated to be 0.19mSv, which is less than 1% of the measured neutron dose -equivalent measured over the entire 8 -month period. Although this experiment did not characterize the neutron radiation environment outside of Earth's magnetic field, the BBND sampling equipment provided results without return of equipment to Earth and proved that similar measurement systems could be used on missions to the moon and Mars to monitor real -time radiation risks (Expedition 2 and 3 One Year Postflight Report).

This in turn could lead to elevated risks of cancer and other disorders. Biodosimetry in Astronauts (Biodosimetry) measures the frequency of chromosomal aberrations preflight and postflight from short-duration mission space explorers. R ESULTS To evaluate the possible alteration of cellular response to ionizing radiation, extracted whole blood was exposed to X -rays before and after the mission. The previous data on chromosome aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes of the same astronaut after the Marco Polo mission in 2002 (Soyuz 4S / 3S exchange) showed a significant increase in the yield of total aberrations. This observation suggested a higher radio sensitivity of lymphocytes when collected after flight c ompared to preflight. However, this effect was not reproduced during the Eneide mission in 2005 (Soyuz 10S / 9S exchange). Similar results were obtained after exposure to gamma rays of blood samples of astronauts involved in short -duration missions. The results suggested that intra -individual variations in radiation sensitivity can be significant, but they cannot be related to the spaceflight. Follow -up data showed a reduced radio -sensitivity compared to both preflight and postflight Marco Polo data. This may be seen as a result of an increased resistance from repeat exposure or longer stay in space. This observation was consistent with data reported in Russian cosmonauts, also showing evidence for a possible acquired radiation adaptation. The yield of bas eline chromosomal aberrations in the blood not exposed on Earth was not modified after Marco Polo or Eneide, and this was consistent with the low dose absorbed in these short- term space missions. However, while no significant alterations were observed in metaphase samples, a slight increase was measured in premature chromosome condensation (PCC). This may reflect the occurrence of slowly cycling aberrant cells undetectable at mitosis and caused by the high- LET space radiation.

From this study scientists may be able to better assess risk factors for genetic damage in space and help develop new methods for protecting crew members through strategies such as radiation shielding, dietary supplements, pharmaceutical intervention, etc. Understanding and reducing the risk of radiation is important for safe long - duration space exploration. S PACE BENEFITS From this study, scientists may be able to better assess risk factors for genetic damage in space and help develop new methods for protecting crew members. Understanding and reducing the risk of radiation is important for safe long -duration travel in space , including stays on the moon and travel to Mars. E ARTH BENEFITS The knowledge gained from this investigation will give scientist's insight into the exact chromosome from which particular mutations arise. R ESULTS The lymphocyte cultures from the blood samples of the 4 short- duration crew members grew well and gave good preparations for scoring of chromosomal aberrations. The analyses of the blood samples of the 4 short -duration crew members revealed no overall increase of aberrations. For comparison, the mean values of 11 long -duration flight crew members were Multi -color fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) metaphase with a complex translocation pattern.

While the increase of mutated cells by a factor of 1.4 was significant for the latter group, no such increase was found for the 4 short- duration subjects. Before the flights, only chromosomal fragments were detected (all values in control range). After the flight, few dicentrics could be observed. No other aberration types (which are considered to be radiation induced) were found. These results are in contrast with the observations in long - duration crew members. Following missions of approx imately 6 -month periods, various types of aberrations increased after return to Earth. PUBLICATION (S) George KA, Rhone J, Chappell LJ, Cucinotta FA.

Chromosome -2 exam ines lymphocytes using different analytical methods to determine quantity and quality of genetic changes resulting from exposure to cosmic radiation, particularly ionizing radiation. From this study, scientists may be able to better assess risk factors for genetic damage in space and help develop new methods for protecting crew members through strategies such as radiation shielding, dietary supplements, pharmaceutical intervention, etc. Understanding and reducing the risk of radiation is important for safe long -duration travel in space. R ESULTS Frequencies of aberrant cells varied considerably between the experiment test subjects. An aberrant cell is considered to include any type of aberration, eg, fragments, dicentrics, ring chromosomes. The comparison of preflight and postflight scorings for individual crew members revealed increasing values with no clear tendency. There was no significant difference between short and long -duration crew members. Most of the aberrations obtained in preflight and postflight samples were simple chromatid breaks. T his aberration type is not considered to be a marker for radiation exposure. Dicentric chromosomes and other interchanges that are considered to be radiation indicators were found rarely and showed no significant increase after return from short- or long -mission flights. The final result after scoring the remaining samples will help to clarify this question. Dicentric chromosomes are considered to be the \"gold standard\" of radiation exposure. This aberration type was only found in a single postflight sample of a long -duration crew member. The frequency of dicentrics was therefore not elevated above the spontaneous level of unirradiated subjects. The mBAND method is used to detect aberrations within chromosomes as shown in the photo. An interstitial piece is lost from one of the two chromos omes 5. University of Duisburg -Essen image. 699 PUBLICATION (S) George KA, Rhone J, Beitman A, Cucinotta FA.

The resulting data help determine the best radiation shielding locations aboard the ISS, thereby providing the crew with the best possible protection during unusually high levels of radiation that is due to solar flares and other cosmic phenomena. E ARTH BENEFITS This experiment is teaching scientists more about the use of devices for data collection and how to monitor real -time data. This could prove beneficial to radiation monitoring of commercial airline crews and military flight crews. S PACE BENEFITS DOSMAP will produce a clearer image of the radiation environment aboard the ISS, revealing what segments pro vide better radiation shielding and examining the radiation levels immediately surrounding crew members. DOSMAP research will help scientists more accurately predict radiation exposure in long -duration spaceflight, both in low -Earth orbit and outside Earth 's magnetic field. With this information, it will be possible to develop countermeasures that will protect crews in space on longer missions to Mars and the moon, and it may also help lead to technologies to protect people working in potentially radioactiv e areas on Earth such as nuclear power plants and nuclear submarines. R ESULTS Radiation damage to the human body is indicated by the amount of energy deposited in living tissue by the type of radiation causing the damage. The background radiation dose received by an average person in the United States is approximately 10 microSv/day. An exposure of 1 Sv/hour can result in radiation poisoning and a dose of 5 Sv/hour will result in death in 50% of exposed individuals. An average dose from all detectors during Expedition 2 was found to be 532 microSv/day. Three impor tant conclusions were drawn from this experiment that will help with future monitoring activities: The corrections ISS002E7814 (June 26, 2001) - James S. Voss, Expedition Two flight engineer, sets up the Human Research Facility's (HRF) Dosimetric Mapping (DOSMAP) Power Distribution Unit (PDU) in Destiny. 701 that were needed measuring instrument errors were negligible and had only a small influence on dose rate estimates. About 15% of the tissue -damaging dose (effective dose) is from short -ranged neutrons and protons that were created within the spacecraft materials, and about 90% of the crew member dose is due to particles that deposit less than 150 keV/micron (Reitz 2005).

The data determined which parts of the human body are exposed to the highest radiation levels so that routine dosage monitoring in future missions can be done on the appropriate parts of the human body. E ARTH BENEFITS The shielding designed for this experiment can also be used to protect people who receive X -rays and CAT scans and people working in areas exposed to high levels of radiation, such as nuclear power plants. S PACE BENEFITS The information gathered will help determine which parts of the body are exposed to the highest levels of radiation, in order to improve spacesuit shielding. R ESULTS In the EVARM experiment, radiation was measured by means of 3 dosimeters in the form of small badges. These dosimeters are metal- oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) carried in pockets inside the astronaut's spacesuit during EVAs. Data re corded by these badges were then transferred to a laptop computer and sent to researchers. The EVARM experiment measured the radiation delivered to the most sensitive organs: the skin, eyes, bone marrow, and lymphatic organs. Spacesuit shielding influences the quantity and type of radiation absorbed by astronauts. Overexposure may burn the skin, cause cataracts in the lens of the eye and the immediate depletion of blood cells, as well as increase the risk of cancer. A comparison of the internationally recog nized limits of radiation exposure for workers and the maximum allowed doses for astronauts shows 0.50, 0.15, and 0.02 sieverts per year for skin, eye, and blood -forming organs in nuclear industry workers, while astronauts receive 3.00, 2.00 and 0.50 sieve rts per year. R adiation exposure for astronauts is therefore 6 ISS005E22017 - International Space Station Expedition 5 Commander Valery Korzun during an extravehicular activity (EVA).

Petrov, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences , Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Space radiation hazards are a key concern for human spaceflight. Accurate risk assessment requires knowledge of equivalent doses in critical radiosensitive organs rather than only skin doses or ambient doses from area monitoring. Matroshka measures space radiation doses from the diverse components of ionizing space radiation were measured at the surface and at different locations inside a human phantom positioned outside the International Space Station, thereby simulating an extravehicular activity of a space explorer. R ESULTS The relationships between the skin and organ absorbed doses obtained in such an exposure showed a steep gradient between the doses in the uppermost layer of the skin and the deep organs with a ratio close to 20. This decrease due to the body self- shielding and a concomitant increase of the radiation quality factor by 1.7 highlighted the complexities of an adequate dosimetry of space radiation. Matroshka data showed the interpolated depth distribution of dose rates including the skin measurement. It hi ghlighted the very steep decline within the first 8 mm by a factor of about 10. From this depth -dose distribution, an average organ dose rate was determined for each critical organ as the average of the dose rates in those volume elements that were assigne d to it in the voxel model. The calculated skin dose rate represents an average of the outermost 3 mm. With about 1 mGy/day, it is by far the highest, followed by the dose rate in the eye. With the exception of the breast and the salivary glands, the dose rates for the other organs were in the range from 0.2 to 0.3 mGy/day. ISS011E13009 - Cosmonaut Sergei K. Krikalev, Expedition 11 commander representing Russia's State Space Corporation , works with the European Space Agency (ESA) Matroshka radiation experiment in the Zvezda Service Module of the International Space Station. Matroshka, a human-torso -like device, was retrieved from the exterior of the station during an August spacewalk for return to Earth. The experiment is designed to better understand the exposure of astronauts, including those making spacewalks, to radiation. 705 The depth -dose distributions established by Matroshka serve as benchmarks for space radiation models and radiation transport calculations that are needed for mission planning.

Petrov, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences , Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Matroshka -2A measures the radiation dose distribution of crew members inside the International Space Station (ISS). Matroshka -2A combined with data from Matroshka -1 allows the comparison of skin and depth dose measurements performed with the same facility inside and outside the International Space Station. The results will give the radiation dose distribution inside a human phantom torso for a better correlation between skin and organ dose and for better risk assessment in future long -duration spaceflight. 708 RESULTS For MTR -2A, the phantom from MTR -1 was used again, but fitted with a fresh set of passive detectors. The data generated with passive thermoluminescence detectors at over 1 600 measurement points in the phantom gave an impressive view of the dose distribution through a human body (see figure). During a spacewalk the skin dose may reach values as high as 2.5 mGy/day (MTR -1), while inside the ISS the skin dose drops down to 160 - 260 Gy/day (MTR- 2A), depending on the local shielding conditions. In combination with results from plastic nuclear track detectors, the evaluated dose dis tributions served as data input to calculate organ dose equivalents and effective doses needed for radiation risk assessment.

The combined data from all Matroshka investigations allows the comparison of skin and depth dose measurements performed with the same facility inside an d outside the ISS.

The average dose rate recorded in the Zvezda Docking Compartment (MTR -2B) was about 40% lower than the dose rate measured earlier in the Pirs Servic e Module (MTR -2A).

Badhwar, PhD, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Organ Dose Measurement Using the Phantom Torso (Torso) measures the amount of radiation that a human received during an extended spaceflight. The measurements are taken using an anatomical model of a male head and torso that contains different types of radiation sensors. This experiment is important for future human long -duration space exploration. E ARTH BENEFITS This expe riment is teaching scientists more about the use of embedded devices for data collection and how to monitor real- time data. This could prove beneficial to radiation monitoring of commercial airline crews and military flight crews. SPACE BENEFITS The Torso experiment helps scientists more accurately predict the radiation exposure astronauts will experience inside their bodies, especially to critical blood -forming organs. No previous experiment has had the capacity to measure radiation doses in multiple , discrete locations in the body. By performing this experiment aboard the International Space Station (ISS), scientists also learn how long human beings can remain in space before the body absorbs dangerous levels of radiation. The experiment may lead to protective procedures to safely prolong human exposure to radiation. R ESULTS Torso results were combined with results from various experiments on previous missions to validate NASA's organ dose database for astronauts. Preliminary results suggest that organ dose and dose equivalent can be projected to a +/- 25% accuracy using a combination of dosimetry and radiation transport models. This accuracy is a great improvement relative to the current accuracy of organ - specific cancer risk projections. Further analyses and incorporation of these radiation results into operational planning for exploration is ongoing. Overall, the dose rates measured in Torso are in good general agreement with other measured values and with the models used to predict these values. So far, the largest difference observed between ISS002E6080 - The Phantom Torso, seen here in the Human Research Facility (HRF) section of the Destiny/U.S. Laboratory on the International Space Station (ISS), is designed to measure the effects of radiation on organs inside the body by using a torso that is similar to those used to train radiologists on Earth. The torso is equivalent in height and weight to an average adult male. 714 measured data and the simulations is 15%. In addition, a model that considers orbital altitude, attitude, and solar cycle emissions agrees within 25% of the measured data. It is determined that the majority of radiation energy deposited in human tissues (about 80%) was due to galactic cosmic radiation. This is because of spacecraft material providing effective reduction from the protons trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. Finally, this experiment indicated that the contribution to both skin and organ doses from secondary neutrons is not negligible. Radiation assessments from chromoso mal damage in lymphocyte cells of 19 ISS crew members were conducted as a follow -up study. These results were compared with space radiation transport models, irradiation of pre -flight blood samples, and results from the phantom torso experiments. The ISS c rew members sampled include the earliest missions near the solar maximum, and concluding with Increment 15 astronauts, near the solar minimum. During this timeframe, 67 Solar Particle Events occurred. However, the extended solar maximum (particular to this solar cycle) decreased the galactic cosmic ray levels. Average effective doses for a 6 -month stay on the ISS were 72 mSv. At least 80% of the organ radiation exposures come from galactic cosmic rays. Another important result shows that the models are pred ictive within about 10%. The authors conclude that many uncertainties about space radiation remain - both levels and types of radiation and effects inside the spacecraft.

IRIS will measure how astronauts respond to a series of optical illusions, and compare their image recognitio n time with data recorded while the crew was on Earth. E ARTH BENEFITS The experiment and its software were designed by a multidisc iplinary group of students, giving them valuable experience in developing science destined for space implementation. Furthermore, results from IRIS experiments that will allow the development of improved training methods, countermeasures and treatments for adaptation to changes in gravity will also find other applications in medicine and biotechnology. S PACE BENEFITS The IRIS payload supports the objective to explore and support decisions related to human exploration as well as promoting international part icipation in exploration. It also supports International Space Station (ISS) activities in terms of supporting space exploration goals with an emphasis on understanding how the space environment affects astronauts' health, capabilities, and developing coun termeasures. The results of this research will help minimize risks and optimize crew performance during transit and planetary operations. R ESULTS Preliminary results obtained with 1 crew member aboard the ISS suggest that the frequency of percept reversal decreases in -flight relative to pre -flight. New experiments will include 2 -D figures that should not be affected by 0 g.

Gagarin Research and Test Center for Cosmonaut Training, Star City, Moscow region, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Study of Cosmonauts' Capabilities when Performing Visual/Instrument Observations and Test Tasks during the First Orbits and Days of Flight (Vitok -2) consists of 4 distinct investigations which obtained experimental data on International Space Station ( ISS) crew members' capabilities when performing visual/instrument observations and test tasks during the first orbits and days of flight, when acute adaptation to spaceflight occurs. The most serious effect is weightlessness, accompanied by space motion si ckness. The goal of the Vitok -2 experiment is to obtain experimental data on the capacities of cosmonauts to conduct visual/ instrument observations and test tasks on the first orbits and days of flight during acute adaptation to spaceflight factors. On the first orbits and days of spaceflight, a crewmember works under conditions of acute adaptation to spaceflight factors, the most serious of which is weightlessness and its accompanying space motion sickness. At this time, flow of information a crewmember receives about the surrounding environment drops sharply, which is related to the distortion of the majority of perception by mechanoreceptors about the position of the body and its individual parts in weightlessness and structural limitations on position and locomotion activity. Under these conditions, the flow of information received through the visual analyzer significantly increases for the crewmember. It has been established that in weightlessness, no indicators from sensory organs, except vision, are providing reliable information for spatial orientation. The majority of tasks performed by crewmembers in flight involve the parti cipation of vision, including: controlling the position of a manned space vehicle, monitoring instrument readings, looking for, identifying, and recognizing various objects, etc. Therefore it is deemed that the visual analyzer provides the crewmember with up to 90% of information. The Vitok -2 experiment is the first attempt made to comprehensively assess the impact of spaceflight factors on the types of crewmember work skills enumerated above using cutting -edge equipment and procedures. Russian cosmonaut Yu.M. Baturin performs the Vitok -2 experiment a board the International Space Station. Roscosmos image. 718 1. -2 [Vitok -2(Z)] - Using a personal computer, dynamics of the functional state of the visual system is assessed, as are the functional psycho -physiological capabilities of operator higher mental functions and performance. 2. -2H [Vitok -2(N)] - Using a video camera and voice recorder, ground observation objects are noted and described (verbally). 3. -2() [Vitok -2()] - One of 10 space objects whose image is presented on a PC screen is identified and experiment results recorded on the PC. 4. -2() [Vitok -2()] - Manual final approach is performed during the simulated motion of a manned transport vehicle and an orbital station on a PC. EARTH BENEFITS The effects of space conditions on a person are the focus in this experiment. New knowledge is expected to be the major benefit of this investigation S PACE BENEFITS Vitok -2 experimental research characterizes crew members' physiological condition, their vision organs, and their ability to perform skill tasks aboard manned spacecraft, beginning with the first orbits and da ys of spaceflight during the period of acute adaptation to spaceflight factors . The data obtained in the experiment make it possible to update crew training methods. R ESULTS -2 [Vitok -2(3)]. In the -2 [Vitok -2(3)] experiment, for the first time both the functional state of the visual system and the interaction among different levels of its organization were studied in an integrated system. Analysis of the results indicates that there are some changes in the level of visual analysis function of a human operator in spaceflight compared to the pre - and post -flight periods. Results of the performed tests demonstrate sufficiently high stability of performance and resistance when exposed to negative work factors during short- term spaceflight, using visu al acuity as an integrated parameter of the visual system. Vitok -2(N). In this experiment, the operator used \"free search,\" in other words was not presented with specific objects on the Earth's surface for identification that are supposed to appear in the operator's field of view at a given time during Soyuz vehicle flight. The reliability of observation results was assessed by combining them with analogous results from previous studies, a coordinate reference point along the flight path in the observation area, analysis of video footage shot during the space experiment, and operator narration on a dictaphone. Vitok -2(). The results of the Vitok -2() experiment indicate that the Vitok -2() software enables the necessary experimental data to be obtained in order to determine the capabilities of the crewmember/operator to perform a task of identifying a space object in the first orbits and days of vehicle spaceflight. 719 Vitok -2(). The results obtained from the studies conducted make it possible to conclude that with an adaptive system of operator selection to perform tasks in the first days of flight, sufficient training with the crewmember reaching the necessary skill level, complex dynamic tasks can be performed on a vehicle during the acute adaptation per iod to spaceflight factors. The results of the Vitok -2() study indicate that in operators there is no failure of elements of operator skill, and they have the capacity to reliably perform dynamic vehicle control tasks beginning with the first orbits and days of spaceflight. The recording of the best indicators of all functional and physiological characteristics of crew members during orbits 8 -9 of a flight made it possible to conclude that the vision system achieved the optimal level of adaptation to spac eflight factors within this period. The data obtained showed that the vision system's resolving power and the visual acuity being assessed had a high level of stability and resistance to the effects of spaceflight and the effect of the particulars of visu al and skill activity of the crew member. Analysis of a crew member ability to identify space objects (simulation on the PC screen) showed that: A crew member is capable, during the first orbits and days of spaceflight, of confidently identifying space obj ects having angular dimensions of about 1\u00b0. The average time to identify space objects and the number of erroneous identifications during the first orbits of flight increases by 10 -27% and reaches baseline levels during the second day of flight (orbit 19) in the manned spacecraft. The number of unidentified objects during flight corresponds to the baseline values obtained during the training process. A crew member with a low (imperceptible) level of space motion sickness is able to perform visual/instrument observations immediately after a manned spacecraft is inserted into satellite orbit around the Earth. These investigations are complete; however no publications are expected. 720 PHYSICAL SCIENCES Much of our understanding of physics is based on the inclusion of gravity in fundamental equations. Using a laboratory environment found nowhere else, the U.S. Destiny laboratory on space station provides the only place to study long- term physical effects in the absence of gravity, without the complications of gravity -related processes such as convection and sedimentation. This unique microgravity environment allows different physical properties to dominate systems, and these have been harnessed for a wide variety of investigations in the physical sciences. 721 BURNING AND SUPPRESSION OF SOLIDS (BASS) Research Area: Combustion Science Expedition(s): 29-ongoing Principal Investigator(s): Paul V. Ferkul, PhD, National Center for Space Exploration Research, Cleveland, Ohio RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Burning and Suppression of Solids (BASS) investigation examines the burning and extinction characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity. BASS experiment will guide strategies for extinguishing accidental fires in microgravity. BASS results contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in microgravity and on Earth. E ARTH BENEFITS BASS results provide essential guidance to ground -based microgravity combustio n research efforts. Detailed combustion models are validated using the simpler flow environment afforded by tests in microgravity. Once validated, they can be used to build more complex combustion models needed to capture the important details of flames burning in normal gravity. These models have wide applicability to the general understanding of many terrestrial combustion problems. S PACE BENEFITS The current NASA spacecraft materials selection is based on a standard test method that segregates material based on 1 -g behavior without consideration of low -gravity effects. A critical element of this understanding is the radiative heat emission from the flame. These results are used in first-order models and predictions of heat release in spacecraft fires and as a means to extend heat release data from tests like the NASA cone calorimeter test to a performance -based material selection process. Using nitrogen as a flame suppressant in microgravity provides a direct link to current and planned extinguishment techniques. R ESULTS Flat cotton -fiberglass fabric samples were burned in long -duration microgravity tests aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The samples were burned with airflow in the same direction and in the opposite direction of the flame. The custom -made fabric performed very well, with none of the complicatio ns caused by the burnout of ordinary cellulosic fuel samples like paper. The main influencing factor was airflow speed and it had a major effect on the flame Comparison of 0 -g and 1 -g flames in opposed flow. Image sequences shows flames spreading from top down. National Center for Space Exploration Research image , Cleveland, Ohio. 722 as suggested in earlier studies. This is the first time that detailed transient flame growth data was obtained in purely forced flows in microgravity for a thin fuel material with uniform burnout characteristics. In addition, by decreasing same -direction airflow speed to a very low value (around 1 cm/s), quenching extinction was observed providing a direct verification of the theoretically predicted U -shaped flammability boundary for a thin fuel. For the opposed flow configuration, the flame quickly reached a steady spread for each flow speed, and the spread rate was fastest at an intermediate value of flow speed. These tests show the enhanced flammability in microgravity for this geometry, since, in normal gravity air, a flame self -extinguishes in the opposed -flow geometry (downward flame spread). For the concurrent- flow configuration, a limiting length and steady spread rate we re obtained only in low-flow speeds. However, flame base spread rate was constant and increased linearly with increasing flow for all tests. The valuable results from these long -duration experiments validate a number of theoretical predictions and also pro vide the data for a transient flame growth model under development (Ferkul 2013).

Within the combustion zone, a number of gravity -dependent phenomena occur including the convection of molten components, buoyancy of inert solid particles, droplet coalescence, and densification of liquid products. Under certain conditions, gravity -dependent secondary processes may also occur in the heat -affected zone se veral minutes after combustion. R ESULTS COSMIC focused on the synthesis of intermetallic matrix composites (IMCs) based on the Al -Ti-B system. Depending on the composition, different intermetallic compounds (TiAl and TiAl 3) can be formed as matrix phase w hile TiB 2 represents the reinforcing particulate phase. During the International Space Station mission, all 6 sample reactors with a relatively high \"green,\" or unreacted, density of 65% theoretical density (TD) were successfully processed. It was conclude d that reaction depths increased as the molar ratio of intermetallic component (Ti- Al) over the boride component (Ti -B) was increased. X- ray analyses showed that in some cases, the samples consisted of a reacted (liquefied) zone and a sintered (charred but not molten) part. Combustion front propagated relatively slower as the amount of aluminum in the mixture increases. This result confirmed the corresponding decrease in self -generated heat and system reactivity relative to the higher aluminum content in th e mixture.

Williams, PhD, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Flame Extinguishment Experiment (FLEX) examines the effectiveness of fire suppressants in microgravity and quantifies the effect of different possible crew exploration atmospheres on fire suppression. The goal of this research is to provide definition and direction for large -scale fire suppression tests and to select the fire suppressant for next -generation crew exploration vehicles. E ARTH BENEFITS FLEX will help us understand combustion- generated pollution and address fire hazards associated with using liquid combustibles on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS FLEX will help us develop more efficient energy production and propulsion systems on Earth and in space. R ESULTS Hot gases do not rise in microgravity, so an entirely different process called molecular diffusion drives flame behavior. So far, researchers have seen some unexpected phenomena from FLEX results. The most surprising discovery is the apparent continuous \"burning\" of heptane droplets after flame extinction under certain conditions. First, the droplet undergoes norm al transient (short -lived) burning with a visible flame surrounding the droplet and extinguishes at a relatively large droplet size. This event is followed by continuous, rapid, almost steady vaporization of the droplet without the visible flame, which ends abruptly at a point called \"cool -flame extinction,\" leaving behind a smaller droplet. It then either experiences normal evaporation in the surrounding hot environment or grows slightly through condensation of the vapor in the cloud that forms upon extinc tion or through migration of the vapor -cloud particles ISS024M041721519 - In this NASA video capture , a fuel droplet is dispensed on positioning wire prior to being set aflame by ring-wire igniters during Flame Extinguishment Experiments inside the Multi -user Drop Combustion Apparatus. 725 to the droplet surface. This behavior is not explained by conventional theories of droplet combustion and is hypothesized as a low -temperature chemical reaction (cool flame) that continues after the 'hot' flame extinction. Cool flames typically occur in premixed systems (this is a diffusion flame), are transient (this is quas i-steady), and lead to a hot -flame ignition (this is a hot- flame leading to a cool flame that extinguishes), which is a very unique observation with very significant theoretical and practical implications. Cool flames usually occur in premixed fuel systems where they are known to spread and eventually lead to ignition that establishes hot- flame combustion, generating ignition pulses commonly associated with engine -knocks in automobiles. Also, flames in space burn with a lower temperature, at a slower rate, and with less oxygen than in normal gravity. This means that materials used to extinguish fires in microgravity must be present in higher concentrations. Through microgravity flame investigations scientists hope to gain a better knowledge of droplet burning, improved spacecraft fire safety, and ideas for more efficient utilization of liquid fuels on Earth (Nayagam 2012).

Williams, PhD, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Flame Extinguishment Experiment -2 (FLEX -2) is the second investigation on the International Space Station (ISS) that uses small droplets of fuel to study the special burning characteristics of fire in space. FLEX- 2 studies the rate and manner in which fuel is burned, the conditions that are necessary for soot to form, and the way in which a mixture of fuels evaporate before burning. The results from FLEX -2 will help scientists better understand how fire behaves in space. It will also provide important information that will be useful in increasing the fuel efficiency of engines using liquid fuels. E ARTH BENEFITS FLEX -2 helps us understand and deal with combustion generated pollution, and addresses fire hazards associated with using liquid combustibles on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS FLEX -2 results will help in fire safety designs for future space exploration vehicles. RESULTS FLEX -2 data collection is ongoing; results will be published following data analysis.

Urban, PhD, NASA's Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Smoke and Aerosol Measurement Experiment (SAME) measures smoke properties, or particle size distribution, of typical particles from spacecraft fire smokes to provide data to support requirements for smoke detection in space and identify way s to improve smoke detectors on future spacecraft. E ARTH BENEFITS The smoke detectors developed from the results of SAME can also be useful in other extreme environments on Earth, such as submarines or underwater laboratories. Accurate detection of smoke in these environments can save lives. S PACE BENEFITS The SAME investigation will provide technology for an advanced fire detector for future spacecraft that will be used for long -duration missions. SAME will provide quantitative data on the sensitivity of these detectors to reduced gravity smokes that will allow evaluation of the adequacy of these existing technologies using relevant data. The current Fire Prevention, Detection, and Suppression (FPDS) program plan allows for the re -evaluation of future sensor technology to allow new technology and capability to be utilized. The results from SAME are needed t o provide the reduced gravity baseline data against which future detection technology developments can be evaluated. R ESULTS Overall, 30 samples were tested comprising of 6 samples each of 5 different materials: Teflon TM, KaptonTM, silicone rubber, cellulose, and dibutyl -phthalate (a chemical used to make flexible plastic) deposited on a porous wick were tested for SAME at different airflow rates, heating temperatures, and smoke aging durations (Urban 2008). A candle flame in Earth's gravity (left) and microgravity (right) showing the difference in the processes of combustion in microgravity. NAS A image . 729 Smoke properties from different materials were determined using detectors to measure different particulate sizes and their relative abundances in order to describe the overall smoke distribution. A substantial portion of the aerosol mass is in particles that are larger than 1 micron. Teflon smoke is comprised primarily of particles having diameters less than 1 um. The effect of aging is consistent with particle coagulation with limited wall loss; the overall number count decreases substantially while the mass con centrations remain relatively steady. This is reasonable given the broader size distribution for silicone smoke containing significant numbers of both large and small particles. Although the arithmetic mean diameters are all in the 100 to 200 nanometer (nm ) range, interpreting particle sizes by only 1 statistic can be deceptive due to the nature of the particle size distribution. In general, since the mass increases with the cube of the diameter, the larger particles do not affect the arithmetic mean diamet er (AMD) as much as they affect the light scattering signal that corresponds with the particle mass. Consequently, although the AMD for silicone rubber is 227 nm, almost half the particle mass is larger than 1000 nm. The lamp wick showed similar behavior in the experiment (Urban 2009). All samples produced significant numbers of sub -micron particulate that are better detected using an ionization smoke detector, however a light scattering detector would perform very well for most of the cases. Depending on the conditions, results suggest broader smoke particulate size distributions can be produced from pre -fire overheat events, thus detection methods that can measure a wider spectrum of particulate size might show more successful and reliable detection. Space craft and associated missions outside of low -Earth orbit will require increased reliability of fire detection systems in addition to robust false alarm resistance. Given the constrained space on any spacecraft, the target for the fire detection system is n ecessarily the early phase and not established flaming fires; consequently, the primary target for detection is the pre -fire heating products and not the soot and ash. This research will help to improve design of future detectors (Urban 2009). P UBLICATION (S) Mulholland G, Meyer M, Urban DL, et al . Pyrolysis smoke generated under low -gravity conditions.

The results from these experiments could lead to improved fuel efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions in practical combustion on Earth. E ARTH BENEFITS SLICE enables improvements in the design of practical combustion devices such as engines and furnaces . The improved design capability leads to reduced time and cost for the development of new products.

Urban, PhD, NASA's Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Smoke Point In Co -flow Experiment (SPICE) determines the point at which gas -jet flames (similar to a butane -lighter flame) begin to emit soot (dark carbonaceous particulate formed inside the flame) in microgravity. Studying soot- emitting flames is important in understanding the ability of fire to spread and for the control of soot in practical combustion systems space. EARTH BENEFITS Smoke -point phenomena is a classical metric in the understanding of the heat releas e and spread rate of fires. It is commonly used in fire modeling on Earth and to understand the soot growth and emission by flames. The dominant characteristics of many flames of practical interest are non -buoyant. SPICE seeks to extend our understanding b y looking at the interaction of ambient flow with the smoke point, enabling us to better predict heat release from non-buoyant flames in practical combustors (eg jet engines and furnaces). S PACE BENEFITS Current NASA spacecraft materials selection stems from a simplified test method that segregates material based upon behavior on Earth without real consideration of microgravity effects. A critical element of this understanding is the radiative heat emission from the flame. This heat emission is strongly i nfluenced by the extent of soot formation. Improved understanding of soot formation and thereby the heat release from microgravity fires will allow more complete and effective utilization of the flammability test results. These results can be used to create models of heat release during fires to learn the best methods of smoke control in microgravity. R ESULTS SPICE successfully completed over 250 combustion tests with gaseous fuel mixtures of ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, and propylene with nitrogen. More than 70 smoke points were found, and these are helping researchers understand the effects of microgravity and co -flowing (flowing in the same direction as fue l gas flow) air speed on smoke points. ISS018E035923 - View of the Smoke Point In Co -flow Experiment during Expedition 18. 733 The smoke point measurements yielded estimates of soot -forming conditions and flame dimensions. Flames of propylene and propylene mixtures were generally more luminous than the others, attributed to increased soot vo lume fractions. Periodic flame motion was observed in some flames, especially those with high air velocity, large burners, and long flames, and is attributed to unsteady co -flow air stream causing slight increase in the uncertainties in smoke points under these conditions. Smoke points for propane and ethylene were generally identified by the onset of gradual dimming, reddening, and rounding of the luminous flame tip. The brightest flames, generally for propylene and propylene mixtures, normally did not display significant dimming and reddening near their tips except when much longer than their smoke points. Smoke points for these flames were identified by the rapid transition to open -tipped flames. Open- tipped flames are common in both normal gravity and microgravity when smoke points are far excee ded and are generally associated with local flame extinguishment along the centerline and soot emission in an annular shell. For conditions sufficiently above the smoke points, a glowing stream of particles could be seen leaving the flame. Smoke -point leng ths in co -flow generally increase with decreasing burner diameter and increasing co -flow velocity in agreement with normal- gravity results. This is expected because a decrease in burner \u2014or an increase in co -flow velocity \u2014decreases the residence time (the t ime a fuel molecule takes to pass through the entire flame) available for soot formation. It also decreases the radiative heat loss fraction, making the flame shorter and narrower. Microgravity smoke points are of interest to spacecraft fire safety. Micro gravity allows improved control over residence time and provides better understanding of the different mechanisms responsible for smoke points in normal gravity and microgravity (Dotson 2011).

Pusey, PhD and Andrew B. Schofield, PhD, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom Arjun Yodh, PhD and Jian Zhang, University of Pennsylvania, University Park, Pennsylvania David A. Weitz, PhD and Peter J. Lu, PhD, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusets RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Binary Colloidal Alloy Test -3 (BCAT -3) hardware supports 3 investigations in which International Space Station (ISS) crews photographed samples of colloidal particles (tiny nanoscale spheres suspended in liquid) to document liquid/gas phase changes, growth of binary crystals, and the formation of colloidal crystals confined to a surface. Colloids are small enough that in a microgravity environment without sedimentation and convection, they behave much as atoms. By controlling aspects of colloidal mixtures, they can be used to model all sorts of phenomena. E ARTH BENEFITS The binary alloy (BCAT -3-BA) study provides information that may allow improvement of fiber optics and allow development of new computers that proce ss data with light instead of electricity. The surface crystallization (BCAT -3-SC) investigation provides information that may identify the use of fields and gradients to control order in self-assembled colloidal systems and microemulsions for advanced materials. The critical point (BCAT -3-4-CP) investigation has numerous applications in a wide variety of fields. Product shelf -life may be improved with a better understanding of colloidal suspensions and have an enormous commercial impact. S PACE BENEFITS BCAT -3 addresses basic physics questions, but some of the areas may eventually have applications for space exploration. The binary alloy (BCAT -3-BA) investigation examines colloids; colloids are technologically interesting because they are the right size t o manipulate light. The ISS008 -E-20613 (April 5, 2004) - Astronaut C. Michael Foale, Expedition 8 commander and NASA International Space Station science officer, works with a Slow Growth Sample Module for the Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-3 experiment. 735 surface crystallization (BCAT -3-SC) investigation examines whether materials in fluids prefer to first crystallize at a surface or in the fluid volume when gravity is removed. This impacts how fluids should be stored. Supercritical fluids, which are one of the applications of the critical point (BCAT -3-4-CP) experiment, are of potential application in propulsion systems for future spacecraft design. R ESULTS BCAT -3-BA (PUSEY) Unfortunately, the BCAT -3-BA sample dried before crystallizing could occur aboard ISS. BCAT -3-SC (YODH) During the surface crystallization (BCAT -3-SC) experiment, astronauts photographed samples of suspended colloidal particles in a liquid that contains a small amount of polymer to document the formation of colloidal crystals. Under the right circumstances t hese suspended particles will prefer to crystallize on the container surfaces, rather than in the sample volume. Three BCAT -3-SC samples will study the formation of colloidal crystals confined to a surface, allowing comparison with bulk 3 -D crystallization , to begin testing how geometry affects crystallization itself. Results will help scientists develop fundamental physics concepts previously hindered by the effects of gravity. Ordered arrays of these micron -sized particles might be ideal for switching and controlling light. Imagery for the BCAT -3-SC was collected over several missions and is still undergoing analysis. BCAT -3-4-CP (WEITZ) The BCAT -3-4-CP samples have yielded some surprising results; the samples that separated on Earth also separated in sp ace; the samples that did not separate on Earth also did not separate in microgravity, indicating that the tendency for phase separation is not linked to gravity. However, for those samples that separated into different phases, the rates of separation for the microgravity samples were very different from the same mixtures on Earth. Those samples with concentrations closest to the critical point took weeks to months in microgravity, compared with a couple of days on Earth (Lu 2007). ISS016E027863 - Astronaut Dan Tani photographing the Binary Colloidal Alloy Test - 3 Sample Module using his own design for a ceiling mount in Node 2 of the International Space Station. Great high contrast pictures of difficult -to-capture images resulted from using this setup. 736 This dynamic data will he lp determine the boundary conditions for future models of critical behavior. Present observations also include a determination of the shape of the interface and which part of the sample wets the cell. The long -term observation of which samples phase -separ ate will allow precise determination of the critical point of this colloidal mixture and will allow inference of the fundamental physics underlying critical point behavior. The BCAT Critical Point samples are comprised of colloids and polymers diffusing in a background solvent; this model system mimics the behavior of molecular liquids and gases in microgravity. The network structure that appears in the phase separation images has a characteristic length scale. How this length changes with time gives insight into the thermodynamics driving the phase separation and can be quantified using image correlation (an optical method that employs tracking and image registration techniques for accurate 2 - and 3-dimension measurements of changes in the length) compute r programs. By creating different program coding, running in parallel with various computing platforms, many orders of magnitude improvement in analysis speed were achieved over standard \"off -the-shelf\" programs. The speed increases allow for very rapid an alysis of images downlinked from the ISS and quick advantageous feedback to astronauts in orbit in time to make changes while the experiment is still running (Lu 2009, 2010).

Chaikin, PhD, New York University, New York, New York R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES Binodal Colloidal Aggregation Test -4 (BCAT -4-Poly) is an experiment of 2 samples containing microscopic spheres suspended in a liquid that are designed to determine how crystals can form from the samples after they have been well mixed. The 2 samples have the same average sphere size but 1 of them has a wider range (more polydisperse) of sizes in order to demonstrate the dependence of crystallization on particle size range. Results from these experiments help scientists develop fundamental physics concepts that will enable the development of a wide range of next generation technologies (such as in high -speed computers and advanced optical devices). E ARTH BENEFITS Generally, colloidal nucleation experiments seek an understanding of the most fundamental liquid/solid transition. Though direct applications of that understanding do not drive the research, growth of ordered colloidal phases has attracted interest in a number of areas like ceramics, composites, optical filters, and photonic bandgap materials. Moreover, there is currently great interest in using fields and gradients to control order in self -assembled systems such as diblock copolymers and microemulsions for advanced materials. S PACE BENEFITS BCAT -4-Poly will ultimately impact our understanding of the strength and thermal conductivity of materials by providing insight into the effects of size variation in dense suspensions of particles. For example, the careful selection of crystallization promoters for co ntrolling the crystallite size and size distribution may lead to improvement in materials fabrication processes. The suppression of crystal nucleation in polydisperse colloids has important implications for the morphology of polycrystalline materials. R ESULTS Data analysis is ongoing, and results are yet to be published. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication.

Weitz, PhD, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts Matthew Lynch, PhD, Procter and Gamble, Cincinnati, Ohio Paul M. Chaikin, PhD, New York University, New York, New York R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES Binary Colloidal Allot Test -5 (BCAT -5) is a suite of 4 investigations that will photograph randomized colloidal samples aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to determine their resulting structure over time. Scientists will be able to capture the kinetics (evolution) of their samples, as well as the final equilibrium state of e ach sample. E ARTH BENEFITS BCAT -5 takes advantage of the microgravity environment on the ISS to prevent the colloidal particles in these samples from encountering sedimentation, convection, and gravitational jamming. These samples will provide important data that is not available on Earth; data that can guide our understanding of phase separation (eg, shelf- life, product collapse), and how it competes with crystallization to impact production (eg, when making plastics). S PACE BENEFITS BCAT -5 will ultimately impact our understanding of the strength and thermal conductivity of materials by providing insight into the effects of size variation in dense suspensions of particles. For example, the careful selection of crystallization promoters for controlling the crystallite size and size distrib ution may lead to improvement in materials fabrication processes.

ISS025 -E-008239 (Oct. 19, 2010) - NASA astronaut Shannon Walker, Expedition 25 flight engineer, uses a digital still camera to photograph Binary Colloidal Alloy Test -5 experiment samples in the Kibo Laboratory of the International Space Station. 739 BINARY COLLOIDAL ALLOY TEST - 5: COMPETE (BCAT Complex Fluids Expedition(s): Barbara Frisken, PhD, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada RESEARCH OBJECTIVES For the Binary Colloidal Alloy Test - 5: Compete (BCAT -5-Compete) investigation, a crew member photographs microscopic particles (colloids) suspended in a liquid over time. This experiment investigates the competition between crystallization and the separation of solids from liquids. An improved understanding of these processes leads to improved manufacturing methods and commercial products. E ARTH BENEFITS These samples provide important data that a re not available on Earth, data that can guide our understanding of crystallization, which impacts production (eg, when making plastics). Production processes often have defects introduced when there is a competition between processes like phase separation and crystallization. Studying this competition in the absence of gravitational settling provides insights into how to control it. S PACE BENEFITS Microgravity is essential for colloid crystallization research because gravity greatly interferes with crysta l formation. The experiment looks to answer basic physics questions that could be applied to colloidal products used in the space program, including food and consumable products. R ESULTS Using samples containing 3 equilibrium phases, the BCAT -5-Compete project studied the interplay between phase separation and crystallization in a colloid -polymer mixture along one kinetic pathway. In analogy with atomic systems, the range of the effective attractive interaction between colloids was sufficiently long to allow for a stable liquid phase. On the International Space Station, direct imaging obtained in microgravity allowed the observation of a unique \"crystal gel\" that occurs when gas -liquid phas e separation arrests due to crystallites within the liquid portion spanning the cell. From the initial onset of spinodal decomposition ISS025E008239 - NASA astronaut Shannon Walker, Expedition 25 flight engineer, uses a digital still camera to photograph Binary Colloidal Alloy Test -5 experiment samples in the Kibo laboratory of the International Space Station. 740 until arrest caused by the crystal gel structure, the kinetics of phase separation remained largely unaffected by the for mation of the third phase. This dynamic arrest appeared to result from the stiffness of the crystalline strands exceeding the liquid -gas interfacial tension. Experimentation in microgravity has revealed the fundamental behavior of this system. The kinetic pathway was confirmed, but the small surface forces that were overwhelmed in Earth's gravity played a major role and led to the formation of a unique crystal gel structure. The phases observed reached their final concentrations, but macroscopic phase sepa ration was not achieved because the interfacial energy between the 2 lower -density phases was insufficient to overcome the stiffness of the cry stalline strands. This effect may occur in any 3 -phase system whose interfacial and elastic energies result from a single dominant system energy scale. P UBLICATION (S) Sabin J, Bailey AE, Espinosa G, Frisken B.

Weitz, PhD, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts Matthew Lynch, PhD, Procter and Gamble, C incinnati, Ohio Paul M. Chaikin, PhD, New York University, New York, New York R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES Binary Colloidal Allot Test -6 (BCAT -6) is a suite of 4 investigations that photograph randomized colloidal samples in microgravity to determine their resulting structure over time. Results will help scientists develop fundamental physics concepts previously hindered by the effects of gravity. Data may lead to improvements in supercritical fluids used in rocket propellants biotechnology applications, and advancements in fiber optics technology. E ARTH BENEFITS These samples will provide important data that is not available on Earth. The data may guide our understanding of phase separation. Additionally, product shelf- life may be dependent upon bi-nodal de composition and possibly upon Ostwald ripening in the emulsion samples. S PACE BENEFITS This experiment addresses basic physics questions, but some of the areas may eventually have applications for self -assembly of nanoparticles in space. Data analysis of the samples are ongoing. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. 742 DEVICE FOR THE STUDY O F CRITICAL LIQUIDS AND CRYSTALLIZATION - ALICE LIKE INSERT (DECLIC -ALI) Research Area: Complex Fluids Expedition(s): 23-ongoing Principal Investigator(s): Daniel Beysens, PhD, French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), Grenoble, France Yves Garrabos, PhD, Institut de Chimie de la Mati\u00e8re Condens\u00e9e de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Device for the study of Critical Liquids and Crystallization - Alice Like Insert (DECLIC -ALI) studies liquids at the verge of boiling. The flow of heat during boiling events is different in microgravity than it is on Earth. Understanding how heat flows in fluids at the verge of boiling will help scientists develop cooling systems for use in microgravity. E ARTH BENEFITS The use of near -critical fluids allows important parameters (eg, compressibility of supercritical fluids, density of gas and liquid phases, surface tension) to be easily varied in a scaled way by using small changes in temperature. The readily variable properties of near-critical fluids makes them appealing candidates for studying numerous interesting phenomena valid for all fluids, which will ultimately lead to the development of improved solvents for chemistry and the environment. S PACE BENEFITS The DECLIC facility provides power, communications, command/control, data storage, and multiple, flexible optical capabilities in support of each experiment. The knowledge gained will assist in the understanding of the behavior of cryogenic (of or relating to very low temperatures) rocket propellants for the study of dynamics regarding near -ambient temperature critical fluids. DECLIC is design ed for telescience from the ground and will offer scientists the capability to remotely control experiment conditions aboard the ISS provided by DECLIC lockers. R ESULTS DECLIC- ALI data collection is ongoing. This investigation is ongoing and additional r esults are pending publication.

Weitz, PhD, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts RESEARCH OBJECTIVES EXPRESS Physics of Colloids in Space (EXPPCS) studies the kinetics of colloidal (fine particles suspended in a fluid) crystal formation and growth. These experiments provide the critical information necessary to use colloidal precursors to fabricate novel materials in the new field of colloidal engineering. Industries using semiconductors, electro -optics, ceramics, and composites might benefit from this investigation. E ARTH BENEFITS EXPPCS will improve such colloids as paints, food products, drug delivery systems and ceramics by providing a better understanding of colloidal behavior. The EXPPCS investigation has contributed to Earth -based investigations of cataracts, which are caused by the buildup of damaged pro teins within the eye lens and are the single largest cause of blindness. Diagnosis of cataracts is normally carried out by looking for protein buildup via a standard ophthalmological device known as a slit - lamp microscope, which can only detect cataracts o nce they have formed. Fortunately, a new laser probe originally developed for the US space program to study protein crystal formation on the International Space Station (ISS), has been shown to detect cataracts before they are symptomatic. This new techniq ue uses dynamic light scattering (DLS) to detect small proteins called alpha- crystalline in the eye's lens, which is a reliable biomarker for cataracts. Laser light is shone into the lens of the eye while a highly sensitive photon detector is used to measure light backscattered at specific wavelengths. If the amount of alpha- crystalline proteins has lessened, this is an indication that cataracts are developing. If cataracts are detected early by this new technique, it may be possible to slow or stop the acc umulation of damaged proteins by reducing relevant factors. S PACE BENEFITS The colloidal engineering process will play a fundamental role in the creation of new materials and products in space, such as optical switches and lasers for communications and di splays. This is one of the first images from the EXPRESS Physics of Colloids i n Space on the International Space Station. During Expedition 2 , sample AB 6 was illuminated with white light to produce the image. The colored regions result from refraction of the white light by the sample and sample cell, splitting it up into its component colors. NASA Glenn Research Center image . 744 RESULTS Results are discussed by class of colloid material studied. Binary colloidal crystals : These alloy samples are dispersions of 2 differently sized particles in an index -matching fluid. Two samples were studied: an AB 13 crystal structure and an AB 6 crystal structure. Due to a hardware failure late in Expedition 4, the AB 6 experiment was not completed. Unexpected \"power law\" growth behavior that is still under investigation was observed in the AB 13 crystal structure sample. Colloid -polymer mixtures : These mixtures induce a weak attractive interaction that allows precise tuning of the phase behavior of the mixtures, and approximate the phase separation below the critical point of a gas -liquid mixture. The phase behavior is controlled by the concentration of the colloid, the concentration of the polymer, and the relative size of the colloid and the polymer. The results from the ISS experiments studied the spinodal decomposition, or phase separation near the critical point, unenc umbered by density differences of the phases. The growth of the phase separation was studied using both light scattering and imaging. Without gravity, the phase separation took 30 times longer than on Earth. The sample was mixed, then phase separation began, gradually coarsening until the container walls interacted with the mixture (at 42 hours) and the colloid -rich phase wet the container wall, completely coating it after 60 hours. Because the results follow very similar time evolution as a shallow quench of a binary liquid, they provide insight into the importance of the length scale of colloidal gels; separation depends more on coarsening rates than initial colloid size (Bailey 2007). Colloid -polymer gels : This sample was expected to be in a fluid- cluste r state, but unexpectedly formed a solid gel. The elastic modulus, which was estimated using the experiment's rheology capabilities, will be compared to ground samples. Aging characteristics of this gel were found to be similar to those formed on Earth. Colloid -polymer critical point : Immediately after mixing, the colloid -polymer critical point sample began to separate into 2 phases \u20141 that resembled a gas and 1 that resembled a liquid, except that the particles were colloids and not atoms. The colloid -poor regions (the colloidal \"gas\" phase) grew bigger until, finally, complete phase separation was achieved and there was just 1 region of each \u2014a colloid -rich phase and a colloid -poor phase. None of this behavior can This photo was taken with the 1X color camera of the AB 6 sample after crystallization had occurred. The different colors are the result of different wavelengths of the white light illumination satisfying the Bragg condition at different angles relat ive to the lights. Bright spots are large crystallites. Diffuse color occurs are due to small crystallites. This image was taken prior to launch. The circular outline is the 2 cm outside diameter of the sample cell. NASA's Glenn Research Center image . 745 be observed in the sample on Earth, because sedimentation would cause the colloids to fall to the bottom of the cell faster than the de -mixing process could occur. Knowledge gained from these runs was used to develop the BCAT -3 later operated on ISS. Fractal gels : Fractal gels may form when charged colloids have their electrostatic repulsions screened out by the addition of a salt solution, permitting aggregation. These can be formed at very low volume fractions and form highly tenuous aggregates that exhibit a remarkable scaling property \u2014their structure appears the same on all length scales up to a cluster size, and so can be described as a fractal. It was thought that the samples studied (colloidal polystyrene and silica gel) would, in the absence of sedimentation effects, ultimately form a continuous network of fractal aggregate; the polystyrene fractal sample never fully gelled as expected. Initial indications are that the volume fraction tested was too low. Large fractal clusters did grow (larger than they do on Earth), allowing measuremen t of the internal vibration modes of these structures. The silica gel is thought to have gelled, and is currently being evaluated. Colloidal glass : These samples are still under evaluation. Comparison to samples formed in one - g in the laboratory were needed to understand whether the crystallization observed was due to poor mixing or was a true microgravity phenomena.

Gast, PhD, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts Eric M. Furst, PhD, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Investigating the Structure of Paramagnetic Aggregates from Colloidal Emulsions (I nSPACE) suite of investigations studies the particle dynamics of magnetorheological (MR) fluids (fluids that change properties in response to magnetic fields) to help understand adaptable new fluids for use in such applications as brake systems and robotic s. E ARTH BENEFITS The study of MR fluids on Earth is difficult because the small magnetic particles remain suspended while the sediments (large particles) sink. The low -gravity environment that is provided on the International Space Station (ISS) will eliminate the effects of sinking sedimentation. After the magnetic field is applied to a MR fluid, the microstructures form a rigid lattice that causes the suspension to stiffen. The rapid transformation of these fluids without the iron oxide grains clumping have many possible technological applications on Earth, especially for actuator- type devices. This technology has promise to improve the ability to design structures, such as bridges and buildings, to better withstand earthquake damage. S PACE BENEFITS At the practical level, these fluids are used in electromechanical interfaces and devices in which the fluid is operationally exposed to similar fields that can affect their operation. Current commercial MR fluid products include tunable dampers and brakes , while future applications in robotics, clutches, and a host of vibration -control systems are envisioned. R ESULTS INSPACE (GAST) Magnetorheological fluids are colloidal suspensions that can form solid -like gels when they are exposed to a steady, uniform magnetic field. Unique gel structures such as colloid- rich cylindrical columns can form within the fluid and be maintained by changing the field strength to relieve any structural stress (Furst 2009). Video screen shot of the magnetic field that causes paramagnetic particles suspended in the fluid to collect into long chains. These long chains of clumps can interfere with the emulsions ability to stiffen as it should when magnetized. This image shows an end view of the larger aggregates that form during exposure to a pulsed magnetic field. Without the settling effects of gravity, the aggregates grow into complex low -energy structures. NASA' s Johnson Space Center, Houston, T exas video . 747 The collected data was processed, enabling a quanti tative assessment of the structural data, including aggregate sizes and shapes. These are key parameters for defining the aggregate kinetics and are used to test theoretical models of the microstructures. Furthermore, understanding the complex properties o f the fluids and the interaction of the microparticles will enable the development of more sophisticated methods for controlling and use of these fluids. Results suggest that InSPACE runs did not achieve steady -state structures. However, intriguing data suggesting the onset of instability at low frequency was collected. Both of these phenomena will be further addressed in InSPACE -2 (Vasquez 2008). I NSPACE -2 (FURST ) For the InSPACE -2 experiment, 2 distinct particle growth processes were observed: one where particle -rich and particle -poor regions form and become \"trapped,\" and the other where the system -spanning structure suddenly collapses and particle columns form. These 2 processes are separated by a distinct boundary that depends on the magnetic field st rength and magnetic frequency, and results demonstrate how energy barriers preventing colloidal phase transition can be overcome by changing the magnetic driving frequency and forces. As with other experimental studies of colloids in microgravity, the resu lts of the InSPACE -2 experiments show that in these gel systems, gravity plays a dominant role and would slowly compress and deform the gel structures when similar experiments are performed on Earth, whereas in space these structures can be maintained as l ong as the magnetic forces are applied. Through better understanding of the stable and unstable phase behavior in the absence of gravitational stresses, these results demonstrate how colloidal suspensions may be harnessed in the creation of unique materials and electro -mechanical devices by manipulating the magnetic forces holding them intact (Swan 2012).

McKinley, PhD, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Shear History Extensional Rheology Experiment (SHERE) is designed to investigate the effect of preshearing (rotation) on the stress and strain response of a polymer fluid (a complex fluid containing long chains of polymer molecules) being stretched in micr ogravity. The fundamental understanding and measurement of the extensional rheology of complex fluids is important for understanding containerless processing, an important operation for fabrication of parts (such as adhesives or fillers) using elastomeric materials on future exploration missions. E ARTH BENEFITS Fundamental understanding and measurement of the extensional rheology of complex fluids also allows Earth -based manufacturing processes to be controlled and improved. Ground -based work using varia nts of the Filament Stretching Rheometer includes studies of spinnability and the investigations of cohesive and adhesive instabilities that manifests themselves in adhesion and tackiness of materials. It has lead to the development of a Resin -spinning tec hnology that allows the formation of ultra -fine elastic threads analogous to spider -silks. Control of the fluid shear history and extensional rheology of test fluid is essential to optimizing the ultimate web properties. Extensional rheology is of critical importance in optimization of polymer processing operations that involve complex flows, ie, flows that contain both shearing (rotation) and elongation (stretching) components. S PACE BENEFITS Understanding the extensional rheology of a complex fluid such as a liquid polymer is key for containerless processing because the absence of the bounding walls of a container or vessel removes the shearing component of the deformation that typically domin ates Earth -based processing operations. The resulting flow is thus shear - free or extensional in character. Containerless processing is a central component in the development of in -situ fabrication technology, such as a means of producing new parts on deman d or replacing existing parts or tools. This represents a critical element in the evolution of an autonomous exploration capability. In -situ fabricated parts, which may include both new and recycled materials, will be composed of plastics, filled polymers, metals, ceramics and composites. SHERE plays a role in this area by measuring, in microgravity conditions, a material The Shear History Extensional Rheology Experiment (SHERE) operations team m onitoring the progress of the experiment from the NASA Glenn Research Center Telescience Support Center in Cleveland, Ohio.

In -situ manufacturing operations can occur in microgravity or reduced gravity levels (eg, on the moon or Mars) and may include, for example, the extrusion and processing of thermoplastic elastomer films, wh ich are very resilient and can be made thin and lightweight. These elastomeric materials may form the basis of adhesives and fillers utilized in a wide variety of repair applications, especially under a reduced gravity environment, such as the repair of space suits or other similar materials. Understanding and exploiting the ability to fabricate new parts in-situ from a limited number of precursor components is critical in future space missions where weight plays a critical role in the overall cost of a mission. Additionally, in -situ repair provides a means of maintaining systems during transport and while on long - duration expeditions beyond low -Earth orbit. R ESULTS Data analysis continues for the test points performed. This analysis involves the computation of the time evolution in the cross -sectional area of the filament from the radius data, a temperature correction for the relaxation time and the zero -shear rate viscosity to correct for thermal fluctuations in the ISS Glovebox environment, and the computation of the extensional viscosity together with the Trouton ratio (Hall 2009, 2010).

McKinley, PhD, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Shear History Extensional Rheology Expe riment -II (SHERE -II) investigation a non - Newtonian fluid that will undergo preshearing (rotation) for a specified period of time, followed by stretching. This combination of shearing and extensional deformations is common in many Earth -based polym er processing and manufacturing operations such as extrusion, blow - molding, and fiber spinning. However, in order to accurately predict the flow behavior of polymeric fluids under such deformation histories, an accurate knowledge of the extensional viscosi ty of a polymer system and its variation with strain rate is critical and will be measured during this experiment. The fundamental understanding and measurement of these complex fluids is important for containerless processing, a key operation for fabricat ion of parts, such as adhesives or fillers, using elastomeric materials on future exploration missions. E ARTH BENEFITS A fundamental understanding and measurement of the extensional rheology of complex fluids also allows Earth -based manufacturing processes to be controlled and improved. Ground -based work using variants of the Filament Stretching Rheometer includes studies of spinnability and the investigations of cohesive and adhesive instabilities that manifests themselves in adhesion and tackiness of materials. It has led to the development of a Resin -spinning technology that allows the formation of ultra -fine elastic threads analogous to spide r-silks. Control of the fluid shear history and extensional rheology of test fluid is essential to optimizing the ultimate web properties. Extensional rheology is of critical importance in optimization of polymer processing operations that involve complex flows, ie, flows that contain both shearing (rotation) and elongation (stretching) components. Suspensions of particles in viscoelastic liquids are used in many terrestrial processing operations: polymer melts with fillers, ceramic pastes, biomedical materials, food, cosmetics, or detergents. The final properties of the suspensions are greatly determined by the shape, concentration, and size of the filler. In particular, the fillers can range from nanoscopic to microscopic characteristic dimensions, and this leads to very different types of flow behaviors, filler/matrix interactions, and dynamics. The SHERE main hardware (Rheometer, Interface Box, Tool Box, Cables & Keyboard) along the SHERE II fluid modules and stowage tray are scheduled to come down from ISS on the Space-X Demo flight which successfully launch on May 22, 2012.

The primary focus is on the use of binary flui d solvent mixture as a growth medium, which may enable the development of fine -scale, tunable crystals resulting in an optically purer product. By examining the three -dimensional ordering and crystallization of colloids, this study intends to directly exam ine the mechanisms that could advance the development of photonic materials, which are useful in developing devices that confine and direct the optical propagation of electromagnetic waves and signals. E ARTH BENEFITS SODI- Colloid results potentially could improve such colloids as paints, food products, drug delivery systems and ceramics by providing a better understanding of the properties, and designing of colloidal products. S PACE BENEFITS Colloidal engineering processes have the potential to contribute to the creation of new materials and products that may enhance electronic communication hardware within various space architectures. R ESULTS The original concept of this experiment was that the strength of interactions between the colloidal particles could be tuned by using a binary mixture as solvent and increasing the temperature towards its spinodal decomposition. The critical Casimir effect resulting from the varying length scale o f the fluctuations in the solvent then increased the strength of attraction between particles and could be easily and continuously tuned over a significant range without changing the composition of the system. While the strength of the attractive force between particles was Metal nanoparticles produced in microgravity. The SODI - Colloid experiment is studying the growth and properties of advanced photonic materials, core elements of the super - fast optical computers to come. ESA image. 754 being increased, the growth rate of aggregates and the average feature of their structure were quantified by way of Near Field Scattering measurements. In microgravity, fractal structures formed by diffusion limited aggregation are always obtained, even at the lowest strength of inter -particle attraction, with a fractal dimension that decreases continuously with increasing attraction. This could not be ascribed to a change in a cluster - cluster aggregation regime. Simultaneously, ground e xperiments with the same samples showed only one type of aggregate with a constant fractal dimension, formed by a reaction- limited process. The experiment demonstrated the possibility of investigating aggregation mechanisms and the resulting structure of c olloidal solids by tuning interaction forces in a colloid suspension by changing the temperature of the mixture.

By understanding capillary fluid flow rates in microgravity, hardware can be developed for \"pumping\" liquids from one reservoir to another without the need for a pump with moving parts. The reduced cost, weight, and improved reliability of such equipment make this a particularly attractive technology for NASA. E ARTH BENEFITS Technologies for liquid management in space use capillary forces to position and transport liquids, since the hydrostatic pressure is absent which gives the liquid a defined surface and enables easy withdrawal from the tank botto m. But the effect of capillary forces is limited on Earth to a few millimeters. In space these forces affect free surfaces that extend over meters. For the application of open channels in propellant tanks of spacecraft, design knowledge of these limitation s are a requirement, predicated with a bubble free liquid restriction prior to entering the thrusters. S PACE BENEFITS CCF will significantly reduce cost and weight, while improving reliability of spacecraft tank designs that can supply gas -free propellant to spacecraft thrusters using capillary vanes. Technologies for liquid management in space use capillary forces to position and transport liquids, since the hydrostatic pressure is absent that gives the liquid a defined surface and enables easy withdrawal from the tank bottom. But the effect of capillary forces is limited on Earth to a few millimeters. In space these forces affect free surfaces that extend over meters. For the application of open channels in propellant tanks of spacecraft, design knowledge of these limitations are a requirement, predicated with a bubble -free liquid restriction prior to entering the thrusters. R ESULTS CCF invest igates forced liquid flow through partially open capillary channels aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The flow channel is made up of either two parallel plates or an open wedge conduit. Results collected show favorable agreement with predictions of critical flow rates and bubble separation rates. The results also indicate the nature of desabilizations and the myriad outcomes of gas liquid flows in the microgravity environment. Regarding critical ISS040E088856 - NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman installs CCF hardware in the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG). 756 flow rate limitations, in general, steady uninter rupted flow is possible as long as it is below the bubble -ingestion speed. However right at this \"critical\" point, the flow speed of the fluid is counteracted equally by resisting waves going the opposite direction and quickly gives rise to the instability , called choking, which causes ingestion of bubbles into the moving fluid. At this point, the maximum flow rate is achieved briefly before the free fluid surface collapses and ingests air. The results suggest that these limitations are primarily governed by flow velocity, intrinsic properties of the liquid (i.e., surface tension, density, viscosity, wetting condition), and the steady balance of directional forces exerted on the moving fluid. For passive bubble separations in wedge sectioned conduits the studies have suggest devices that can be applied directly to perform such task beyond such fundamental investigations. Researchers are continuing to experiment with different capi llary channel designs, fluids, and flow velocities to study and improve computational models for predicting capillary channel flow behavior in space which can translate into fabricating efficient fluid transport systems for fuel, life support, and energy systems for space exploration.

ISS040E088847 - NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman installs CCF hardware in MSG . 757 CAPILLARY FLOW EXPERIMENT (CFE) Research Area: Fluid Expedition(s): 9, 12 -16 Principal Investigator(s): Mark Milton Weislogel, PhD, Portland State University, Portland, Oregon RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Capillary Flow Experiment (CFE) is a suite of fluid physics experiments that investigate capillary flows and phenomena in low gravity and consists of 3 investigations: Vane Gap (VG), Interior Corner Flow (ICF), and Contact Line (CL). Results will improve c urrent computer models that are used by designers of low -gravity fluid systems and may improve fluid transfer systems on future spacecraft. E ARTH BENEFITS The results of the flight experiments are also expected to provide insights into terrestrial interfacial phenomena and may lead to models predicting fluid flows in porous media (i.e., ground water transport), complex capillary structures (i.e., high -performance wicks for heat pipes employed in electronics cooling), and Lab -On-Chip technologies (i. e., microscale biofluids processing). S PACE BENEFITS The knowledge gained from this payload has the potential to be instrumental in the design of future fluid systems for spacecraft -impacting fluid -bearing containers such as propellant and cryogenic fluid s tanks, thermal control system coolant reservoirs, water storage and management systems, liquid state low -gravity materials processing equipment, and biofluids handling instruments for inflight, human health systems. By performing this experiment, researc hers will gain information that will lead to improvements in system reliability with reductions in system mass and complexity. These applications of CFE are in direct support of NASA's mission to develop safe, reliable, and affordable spacecraft to pursue the greater exploration of our solar system and universe. R ESULTS Vanes are structures built along propellant tank walls or inside the tanks that liquid clings to and is \"wicked\" away from its source. They are used as a form of passive fluid control in ve ry low gravity to transfer wetting (ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface) fuels to resupply rocket engines. In space, acceleration forces can pool liquid propellant anywhere in the tank so the vanes, by having corners (such as the c orner formed by the side vanes and the tank wall), serve to create a flow path to the outlet. The CFE Vane Gap (VG) experiments identified the angles, known as critical wetting angles where a perfectly or partially wetting fluid is drawn up large or small corner gaps between the vane and cylinder wall and \"wets\" the entire length of the vane. Results showed critical angles were in close agreement with predictions for the perfectly wetting fluid, whereas these angles deviate substantially from predictions for a partially wetting fluid. Also, a bulk shifting 758 (transferring large amount of liquid) phenomenon was observed only for the highly wetting fluid at these critical junctions, which might be due to small irregularities in geometry and/or container surfac es, showing even small contact irregularities can influence fluid behavior in a significant way (Chen 2009). CFE Interior Corner Flow (ICF) experiments studied capillary flows in interior corners of 2 tapered containers. The migration rates of 4 differe nt flows (dry, wet, open loop, and bubbly) in the units were observed and compared. Flow rates were in good agreement with predictions for the dry tests, but faster than predicted for previously wetted surfaces and bubbly flow tests. In many cases, the bubbles were separated during the bubble tests of ICF but small bubbles were unhindered. The CFE Contact Line (CL) study observed the contact line (where the liquid and solid surface make contact) effect on fluid flow over a surface with and without pinning (a cut surface grove to disrupt smooth fluid movement). Results showed pinning produce d more rapid wave motions and less fluid damping in a container than the smooth free surface. Larger contact angles (angle between the liquid and the container surface) also produced the same trend as pinning with respect to frequencies and damping rates. Fluid depth in the container was found to have little effect on the fluid's response to disturbances except in cases where shallow depth tests were involved. In general, modeled and observed results were in best agreement for the more predictable and confi ned movement with pinned contact line (Weislogel 2008). CFE experiments were highly successful in uncovering microgravity fluid dynamics and the complex interaction of geometry, contact angle, asymmetry, and gap wetting in static and dynamic modes. Sub sequent VG tests determined critical wetting conditions for perforated sheets with perfectly wetting fluids. This combination is common in storage tanks and can serve as models for screens and perforated sheets, plates, or vanes. Characterizing porous wick ing structures will help in designing passive systems to manage highly wetting fuels, cryogens, thermal fluids, and contaminated aqueous solutions such as urine recyclers.

The results aim to improve current computer models that are used by designers of low -gravity fluid systems and may improve fluid transfer systems for water on future spacecraft. E ARTH BENEFITS Results of this study will improve the understanding of fluid flow in miniatu rized biological devices used for health screening and analysis; this class of devices is often referred to as lab-on-a-chip. S PACE BENEFITS Capillary resulting phenomena include critical wetting in discontinuous structures, and capillary flow in complex containers. Specific applications of these results center on particular fluid challenges concerning the storage, transport, and processing of liquids in space. The knowledge assists spacecraft fluid systems designers in increasing system reliability, decreasing system mass, and reducing overall complexity. R ESULTS The Vane Gap (VG) experiment identifies a fundamental wetting condition akin to the critical corner wetting condition identified by Concus and Finn (1969), but for interior corners formed by walls that possess a gap at the virtual axis of intersection of the two planar walls(i.e., vanes). Such a \"wall- vane gap\" is common in spacecraft systems, but is treated as an ideal corner. The Capillary Flow Experiment (CFE) involves many studies centered around a phenomenon called wetting. Wetting describes the ability for a liquid to spread across a surface. The original CFE tests were highly successful at uncovering the dynamics of wetting in microgravity. Capillary Flow Experiments - 2 (CFE -2) determines the critical wetting co nditions for screens and perforated plates for perfectly wetting fluids. The impact of such porous substrateshas The primary science goal for the Vane Gap experiments is to find the critical wetting angles at which fluid wi cks up the edges of a perforated vane. An unexpected phenomenon (seen left ) occurs when the perforations are filled prior to the running of the experiment. A bulk shift of the fluid is easily identified when the perforations are filled, and stands out dist inctly when compared to the relative symmetry of a test run with un-filled perforations. Mark Weislogel image. 761 immediate implications to the design of passive geometries to manage highly wetting fuels, cryogens, thermal fluids, and contaminated aqueous s olutions for urine processing. The unique vane gap critical wetting phenomena is greatly complicated by the presence of three - dimensional (3 -D) porous walls. The Interior Corner Flow (ICF) experiment determines the rates of 3 -D inhibition of wetting fluid s in complex containers, the dependence of the dynamical boundary conditions as a function of geometry, and the performance of such devices as passive phase (i.e., bubble) separators. The ICF experiments are designed to benchmark the analytical technique d eveloped to predict such flows. The benchmark theory aids in the design and analysis of capillary devices for positioning liquids passively in containers in microgravity environments by controlling the container geometry. The devices are useful in passive phase separation operations such as in the case of tapered screen galleries for bubble -free collection and positioning of fuels for satellites, to address propellant management aboard spacecraft. Spontaneous capillary flows in containers of increasing comp lexity such as ICF determine critical transients for low -g propellant management. The objective of the Capillary Structure (CS) experiment is to add another critical dimension of complexity, interconnectivity, to the ICF experiments. Liquid bearing contai ners can easily be interconnected by capillary structures. The crew studies the time dependent flows as functions of unit cell dimensions and geometry, unit cell interconnectivity, overall structure dimensions and taper. They also investigate passive phase separation characteristics of such construct. Capillary Structures studies full 3 -D wicking at micro -scales. The flows incorporate 3 -D capillary driven corner flow networks consisting of a matrix of interconnected pores (Weislogel 2009).

Wayner, Jr, PhD, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Constrained Vapor Bubble (CVB) aims to achieve a better understanding of the physics of evaporation and condensation and how they affect cooling processes in microgravity using a remotely controlled microscope and a small cooling devic e. E ARTH BENEFITS The project aims to achieve an improved understanding of microscale heat transfer, improved designs for wickless heat pipes, and an increased efficiency in heat transfer devices for cooling critical components. Targeted users are existing microelectronics industry and perhaps military applications. New designs should be able to be developed several months following the analysis and presentation of the results from the experiment. S PACE BENEFITS CVB has performed ground -based studies in a thermal vacuum chamber to determine the efficiency of the heater and cooler configuration. Larg e thermal response times that have been experimentally observed in space -based experiments cannot be obtained from these ground-based studies. Space -based experimentation is the only method available to ascertain internal low -gravity fluid mechanics within a heat pipe. R ESULTS CVB was specifically designed to look at the performance of a wickless heat pipe and to image the liquid/vapor distribution inside a heat pipe as it operated in microgravity. An unanticipated nucleate boiling phenomenon was observed in the microgravity environment on the International Space Station (ISS) during operation of the experiment. Surveillance images of constant volume, microgravity boiling dynamics over a 20 -hour time period show that nucleation (bubble formation) episodes o ccurred in a non -periodic but non- random way. Each nucleation event originated at the heater surface and new bubble growth was accompanied by a shock wave that passed through the heat pipe and partially collapsed the original vapor ISS020E 042647 - Photograph taken during the inspection of the Constrained Vapor Bubble module with the science sample on the Fluids Integrated Rack. 763 bubble. The maximum heat input to the heat pipe closely followed the timing of the nucleation event. The maximum heat loss, due to thermal radiation from the walls of the device, followed the timing of bubble motion and bubble coalescence. The whole process resulted in about a 10% increase in the overall heat transfer rate. Aided by these results, researchers developed simple models to describe the effect of main bubble location on the nucleation probability in the CVB and to determine the effect of intermolecular forces on the li quid film thickness needed to support nucleate boiling (Plawsky 2012). Precise control and timing of explosive boiling has already proven its use in inkjet printer technology. This behavior can also be used to produce mechanical work such as moving micro membranes. For NASA, long -term storage of rocket propellants in space is one of the key requirements for planetary space exploration missions. Bubble formation and explosive boiling due to localized heat leaks in storage tanks under microgravity over a long period can be a serious and potentially dangerous condition for space -based fuel depots (Chatterjee 2011). Results of CVB will help with fuel storage tank design for future microgravity missions. P UBLICATION (S) Kundan A, Plawsky JL, Wayner, Jr PC.

The measurement of diffusion properties in crude oils improves numerical models used by industries to characterize oil fields. Expected benefits are the reduction of the number of required drillings, and therefore reducing exploration costs, especially for deep off - shore exploration. Diffusion coefficients are studied in a model fluid representing typical crude oils. R ESULTS Telemetry data for the DCCO showed the presence of gas bubbles in the diffusion region of the cell. Therefore, valid re sults from the experiment could not be obtained. The origin of the gas bubbles was not definitive but probably due to permeation of at least 1 of the components through the O -rings of the hardware. Research into diffusion coefficients continues with the SODI-IVIDIL and SODI -DSC/DCMIX investigations. This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected.

SCN is a transparent organic substance in the liquid state that is used to study the phenomena related to solidification processes. EARTH BENEFITS DECLIC- DSI will establish the fundamental physics that govern the formation and selection of solidification patterns. This will provide an opportunity to gain an insight into the general problem of pattern formation, as solidification patterns are recognized to be similar to those forming in many other branche s of science. S PACE BENEFITS DECLIC- DSI involves investigating the birth and growth of morphological instabilities and the effects of coupling between the solidifying interface and the convection. By observing these phenomena in a microgravity environment, it will be possible to refine the theoretical models and numerical simulation predict ions, which will ultimately result in the improvement of the industrial ground -based material development processes. R ESULTS DECLIC- DSI is dedicated to the study of solidification to improve the understanding of metallurgical processes. It uses an organic alloy that freezes like metals but that is transparent to visible light so that the whole process of solidification is visible. 5C19CFD0 - SCN camphor of reduced concentration obtained by very slow solidification (nominal : 0.24 wt% camphor) - G = 12oC/cm. Marsh all Space Flight Center image. 767 DECLIC- DSI completed four successful solidifications by the end of November 201 0. The research team captured 7, 000 images during the final session meeting all scientific objectives. DECLIC- DSI contains a crucible filled with a dilute succinonitrile -camphor alloy of a well- defined concentration, which is solidified by motion from a hot zone to a cold zone at a constant pulling rate. In these runs, a large range of experimental conditions were explored to vary the resulting microstructure. Both long solidifications and solidifications with jumps in pulling rates had been performed to get the whole dynamics and mechanisms of microstructure formation or change, spacing adjustment, and pattern ordering. During 2 solidification runs at very low speeds, 2 types of exotic cellular patterns became evident. Latest data are currently under treatment (Bergeon 2011). The study of solidific ation microstructure formation is very important in the design and processing of new material. The interface patterns formed by solidification largely govern mechanical and physical properties, thus materials and processing conditions can be designed to ob tain specific patterns which give optimum properties and better reliability of the finished product. Experiments such as DECLIC provide a better understanding of the relationship between micro - and macrostructure formation during solidification processes. The experiment ultimately could result in new and better materials for use in manufacturing on Earth (Ramirez 2011). P UBLICATION (S) Mota FL, Bergeon N, Tourret D, Karma A, R, Billia B.

The DECLIC -HTI design is intended to be later compatible with the use of possible toxic samples. The main functions of HTI are: to isolate a sample from the shuttle atmosphere; to provide an adequate thermal environment to the sample material; to enable optical observation of the sample; and to enable temperature measurements for the control and safety of the experiment. E ARTH BENEFITS DECLIC- HTI will enable the development of supercritical water reactors to be developed to treat waste as part of applications on Earth (treatment of household waste, nuclear waste, and extraction of oil fuels). This research will lead to spin -offs in the field of clean technologies for producing energy and treating waste. S PACE BENEFITS The results obtained with the DECLIC -HTI scientific program should benefit fluid m anagement in space, and potentially the organic waste treatment considering the combustion in supercritical water processes, for future expeditions beyond low -Earth orbit.

Ethridge, PhD, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Fluid Merging Viscosity Measurement (FMVM) is designed to test a new method for measuring the vi scosity of high -viscosity materials by measuring the time it takes 3 nearly free -floating drops of a liquid to merge. The materials used are of known viscosities (corn syrup, glycerin, and silicone oil) so that the accuracy of the fluid merging test can be compared to the methods used on Earth. The FMVM experiment can lead to a greater understanding of glass formation from melted lunar soil. It will also lead to a better understanding of liquid phase sintering processes for in -space fabrication methods that can be used for constructing surface habitat structures. E ARTH BENEFITS This new viscosity measuring process is ideally suited for use with difficult glass forming liquids. It can be used to make measurements that are impossible by other methods. The droplet merging method of viscosity measurement might be applied to small glass samples melted in terrestrial containerless levitation processing facilities. It will also be possible to measure the viscosity of undercooled liquids much more rapidly than with other viscosity methods. Methods being developed by the FMVM experiment will make it possible to determine the viscosity of highly undercooled viscous glassy liquids at temperatures impossible with current methods. New methods to measure viscosity at very low shear rates also has technological significance. This method should pe rmit the investigation of the non- Newtonian viscosity behavior of glasses at very low shear rates. Such viscosity data will be very useful for the modeling of crystallization behavior of materials of scientific interest. Examination of the droplet shape changes with time can also lead to a better understanding of terrestrial industrial and in -space processes. The coalescence of drops has This image shows two 4 ml silicone oil viscosity standard liquid drops in the process of coalescing to a single spherical drop. Marshall Space Flight Center image . 770 direct application to the science of liquid phase sintering. It should be possible to test models for liquid drop coalesc ence used to understand liquid phase sintering. Insight into the materials deposition processes is also important to the industrial process of rapid prototyping. S PACE BENEFITS Understanding the viscosity of molten materials and coalescence of liquid drop s is important for everything from glass formation laboratory experiments to industrial materials processes such as sintering (a method of fusing together particles of material at lower temperatures and without melting). Viscosity is one of the key parameters that materials scientists must measure to create accurate models predicting the best methods for materials production. Understanding and controlling viscosity can even enable researchers to make new materials or improve existing ones. Microgravity adva ntageously eliminates the gravitational distortion of liquid drops, permitting liquids to be suspended in a free -floating condition. Scientists can measure the viscosity of low -viscosity liquids such as molten metal in low -gravity levitators, by measuring vibrations of liquid drops. However, the oscillation method cannot be used on more viscous liquids like molten glass, since they will not oscillate. The FMVM experiment can ultimately lead to a greater understanding of glass formation from melted lunar soil. It will also lead to a better understanding of liquid phase sintering processes for in- space fabrication methods that can be used for constructing surface habitat structures from sintered lunar soil and vehicle components for longer -term space missions. R ESULTS FMVM tests a new method for measuring the viscosity of high- viscosity materials by measuring the time it takes 2 nearly free -floating drops of a liquid to merge. Preliminary results from data analysis indicate agreement with the predicted coalesc ence time (Ethridge 2006). The experiments demonstrate that when the surface tension of a liquid is known, the coefficient of viscosity for that liquid can be determined by the contact radius speed. This data can be fit to numerical results to calculate the viscosity, thus validating the model for this new viscosity measurement method (Antar 2007). The original data tapes for the FMVM investigation were returned to Earth on space shuttle flight STS -114/LF -1 in August 2005; later experiments were carrie d out aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in July of 2004 and May of 2005. The behavior of two coalescing drops in microgravity was examined; calculations were run on 7 different conditions to determine the theoretical coalescence half time (time at which the neck diameter of the converging drops was half the original drop diameter) for each condition. These results were then compared with the observed times from experiments conducted aboard ISS and were found to be in close agreement, with the exc eption of the high- viscosity silicone oil condition (which may have been due to invalid initial conditions input to the analytical model). The results of this experiment validate this numeric model used to calculate the viscosity of a liquid from measured half time coalescence and known surface tension (Ethridge 2009). 771 PUBLICATION (S) Ethridge EC, Kaukler WF, Modeling of the Fluid Merging Viscosity (FMVM) International Space Station experiment with Comsol MultiPhysics. 47th Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit , Orlando, FL; 2009.

Foamability is an important property of liquids. Most liquids do not stabilize into foam structures because liquid films are drained by gravity until the liquid films break. Amphiphilic (surfact ant) molecules are commonly used to prevent rupture of the liquid films. These additives stabilize the films by forming layers of electrostatic charges at the molecular level along the liquid/air interfaces. R ESULTS The main process that controls the stability of foam on Earth is th e gravity drainage, which eventually causes film thinning of the bubbles toward a critical thickness at which they become unstable and burst. This process is not a factor in microgravity, and foams containing large amounts of liquid can be studied for a lo nger time. Foam experiments in space allow researchers to explore a new sort of very \"wet\" foam with liquid fractions around 30%. The high liquid fraction enables bubbles to keep their spherical shape. On Earth, such materials are unstable and most of the time not called foams but bubbly liquid. In space, drainage is suppressed, such that liquid films remain thick, but bubble coalescence events are nevertheless seen. However, after some time, bubble motions become rare events such that the foam is more stable even when shaken. In most cases, the foamability (the volume fraction occupied by the foam only) is almost two times larger on the International Space Station than on Earth. A striking and unexpected result is that a non- foaming solution on Earth makes significant foam in space. It was discovered that super stable aqueous foams can be created in microgravity conditions. On Earth, coarsening and film ruptures are always present for a solution even with foaming agents. In microgravity, the foam still evolves but the amount of foam does not appear to change significantly. Surprisingly, antifoaming agents have a reduced effect in microgravity, and the resulting foam appears to be stable. This behavior was completely unexpected since anti - foaming agents are meant to avoid foam creation and stabilization. These observations raise new fundamental questions that should be investigated in future works.

The main objective of the Geoflow investigation is to study the stability, patte rn formation, and transition to chaos of thermal convection in fluid-filled rotating spheres. Understanding how Earth's mantle flows is a major interest for geophysics because it could help to explain earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. The results, for example, could also benefit by improving spherical gyroscopes, bearings, and centrifugal pumps. R ESULTS In geophysical and astrophysical research, the setup of rapid rotating spherical shell convection, as part of dynamic flow, is of basic interest . Data analysis identifies first subcritical and supercritical fluid flow patterns. In addition, the fully developed supercritical states turn out to have buoyancy -driven polar exchange and complex drift behavior. If these convective flow patterns can be r econstructed, numerical simulations could show details on other properties of the fluid flow beyond the limits of what is available with in -orbit measurement techniques. Quality of the images is excellent and classifying of patterns into space and time is possible. Overall analysis will be done when the set of experiments is completed, including the ongoing GeoFlow II. P UBLICATION (S) Futterer B, Egbers C, Dahley N, Koch S, Jehring L.

Geoflow -II aims to improve computational methods that scientists and engineers use to understand and predict the processes in the Earth's mantle that lead to volcanic eruptions, plate tectonics, and earthquakes. E ARTH BENEFITS Understanding how the mantle flows is a major interest for geophysics because it could help to explain earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. S PACE BENEFITS A better understanding of this type of fluid flow could benefit the manufacturing methods of spherical gyroscopes, bearings, and centrifugal pumps for Earth and space applications. R ESULTS Using a spherical geometry set -up, experiments on electro -hydrodynamic driven fluid convection have been performed for both temperature - independent (GeoFlow -I) and temperature -dependent fluid a measured viscosity cont rast ratio of up to 1.5. Numerical simulations in three - dimensional spherical geometry were also carried out to reproduce the results obtained in the GeoFlow experiments. Observed flow patterns were distinctly different between these 2 experiments. A sheet-like thermal flow was seen in GeoFlow -I. For this case, convection patterns have been successfully reproduced by three -dimensional numerical simulations using 2 different and independently developed simulation programs. By contrast, plume -like structur es were observed with GeoFlow - II. Interestingly, numerical simulations do not yield this type of plume for the low -viscosity contrast. However, using a viscosity contrast of 2 orders of magnitude (or higher) in the numerical Geoflow -II image showing plume -like thermal upwellings.

An upper limit, called the critical heat flux, exists where the heater is covered with so much vapor that liquid supply to the heater begins to decrease, potentially destroying the heater. Microheater Array B oiling Experiment (MABE) determines the critical heat flux during boiling in microgravity to design optimal cooling systems for future space exploration vehicles as well as on Earth. E ARTH BENEFITS The proposed research has shown that transient conduction is the dominant heat transfer mechanism in boiling of refrigerants -like fluids. This research will provide insight into creating more efficient cooling systems on Earth. SPACE BENEFITS In microgravity, a bubble can cover an entire heater array instead of just a small area, resulting in burnout of components if local hot spots are present. The increased spatial resolution of these measurements will enable the extent of the dry spot to be measured along with the heat transfer from the liquid surrounding the dry spot. This technique can be applied to other areas including spray cooling, turbulence measurements and flow boiling. R ESULTS MABE completed over 2 hundred pool boiling tests aboard the ISS between March and April 2011. In the ISS microgravity environment, the heat transfer mechanisms during bubble formation can be determined more accurately since the level of g -jitter (ie, vibrations from the spacecraft, aboard machinery, and crew) is much less than with short- duration experiments using sounding rockets or drop towers. Surface tension dominated boiling (SDB), characterized by the formation of a non- departing coalesced Microheater Array Boiling Experiment Image: High -speed video image that is colorized with heater power data. Correlati ng the position of the vapor and liquid positions with the heater power data provides insight into the heat transfer and phase change mechanisms. University of Maryland image. 778 bubble, occ urs on small heaters in microgravity. It is found that once a stationary, coalesced bubble covers the heater, a small change in the gravity level would only change the bubble shape without significantly affecting the steady state value of heat transfer. B y comparison, if the gravity levels continuously fluctuate as is the case in parabolic flights where the g-jitter values are relatively large, the resulting continuous adjustments in bubble shape can produce flow around the bubble increasing the heat trans fer. In essence, the fluctuation in acceleration (g -jitter) affects heat transfer more than the absolute value of acceleration in the SDB case. Microgravity heat transfer predictions based on modified scaling law and taking into account g -jitter effects were shown to be in excellent agreement with experimental data. This is one of the most significant findings of the current work performed under space microgravity environments and may address the widely discussed problem of the effect of g-jitter on pool boiling studies (Rishi 2012).

The convection in liquid bridge of silicone oil is generated by heating the one disc higher than the other. Scientists are observing flow patterns of how fluids move to learn more about how heat is transferred in microgravity. E ARTH BENEFIT The obtained knowledge on the Marangoni convection is vital for the production of high- quality crystal growth such as semiconductors, optical crystal, and so on. Since the surface tension is dominant not only under the microgravity but also in the micro -scale, the results obtained on the nature of the Marangoni convection will significantly contribute to various micro -fluid handling techniques in micro -TAS ( Micro total analysis system) such as DNA examination and clinical diagnostics. S PACE BENEFIT The valuable knowledge from Marangoni space experiment is also applicable to the high -performance heat exchanger and heat pipe both in space and on the Earth. Fo r future space development, it should be necessary to design a more efficient and compact thermal management system, no doubt to help its development. R ESULTS Five series of experiments, Marangoni Experiment in Space w as carried out from 2008 to 2013 in the Fluid Physics Experiment Facility (FPEF) in the Kibo laboratory aboard the International Space Station (ISS). A set of new data on the transition to oscillatory flow wa s obtained by observing the traveling of the hydrothermal wave in several runs within the liquid bridges created between 2 plates at different temperature settings. Several flow visualization techniques have been applied to liquid bridge, and 3 -Dimensional Particle Tracking Velocimetry (3 -D PTV) was used to reveal highly 3 -D flow patterns that appear after the transition. Conventional 3 -D PTV and multi -frame ISS020E048792 - Canadian Space Agency astronaut Robert Thirsk, Expedition 20/21 flight engineer, holds Fluid Physics Experiment Facility/Marangoni Surface (FPEF MS) Core hardware in the Kibo laboratory of the International Space Station. JAXA image. 780 particle tracking were combined to obtain a better understanding of unsteady, 3 -D flow fields in a (standing or traveling wave) oscillatory state. As the result, it was observed that the flow patterns change from a 2 -D axisymmetric steady flow to a 3 -D non- axisymmetric unsteady flow, when the temperature difference exceeds a certain level. Temperature d ifference along the free (unbound) surface produces surface tension gradient, so that warmer material will move toward a cooler along the surface, which process is known as thermocapillary convection. Depending upon surface boundary conditions, the fluid m ovement may be uniform and steady or become wobbly and unstable. The MEIS hardware setup is designed to identify these critical conditions. In microgravity, it is possible to form floating silicone oil columns many times larger than on Earth allowing for a highly detailed study of convection and instability within these \"liquid bridges\" (LBs).

Oscillatory convection, three - dimensional (3 -D) flow and particle accumulation structure (PAS) formation are all ideally observed using the Fluid Physics Experiment Facility (FPEF) and the ideal convection characteristics afforded by the microgravity environment. Continued research and understanding of liquid flow characteristics may lead to the development of highly efficient industrial process and products involving semiconductors, optica l materials, bio materials, and thermal transport devices. E ARTH BENEFIT The obtained knowledge on the Marangoni convection is vital for the production of high- quality crystal growth such as semiconductors, optical crystal, and so on. Since the surface tension is dominant not only under the microgravity but also in the micro -scale, the results obtained on the nature of the Marangoni convection will significantly contribute to various micro -fluid handling techniques in micro -TAS (Micro total analysis syst em) such as DNA examination and clinical diagnostics.

R ESULTS The Marangoni Ultrasonic Velocity Profiler (UVP) produced data to advance the field of fluid physics and obtain knowledge co ncerning the aspect ratio effect on the onset of flow transition over a wide range of conditions. Marangoni UVP -2 was terminated after the eleventh experiment run when the experiment cell was damaged during a sample exchange operation. Marangoni UVP -2R (UV P-2R) provided experimental data showing a strong convection regime could not be accumulated because the experiment cell was re -damaged. The damaged experiment cell will be refurbished on the ground. UVP -2RR will be manifested on a later increment in order to continue the runs not performed during the UVP -2R experiment runs.

Pojman, PhD, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Honey and water are miscible fluids, that it, fluids that dissolve completely in each other. Miscible Fluids in Microgravity (MFMG) involves having water injected into honey to test if it will act like an immiscible fluid, such as water being injected into oil, and spontaneously form a spherical drop. The experiment needs to be performed in weightlessness. E ARTH BENEFITS The experiment may have relevance to microfluidics. S PACE BENEFITS If we show that convection can be caused by an effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids, then this fact might be important for materials processing and fluid handling in weightlessness. R ESULTS The goal of MFMG was to determine if interfacial phenomena seen with immiscible f luids could be seen with miscible fluids. The experiments had to be performed with existing materials on the International Space Station (ISS). Honey and water were chosen as the fluids, and urine collection syringes were used as the vessels in which the e xperiments were performed. Four experiments were performed under isothermal conditions to determine: if a stream of honey injected into water would exhibit the Rayleigh -Tomotika instability and break into small drops or if an aspherical drop of water in ho ney would spontaneously assume a spherical shape. Two sessions in which a stream of honey was injected into water while the syringe was attached to the surface of the Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) at approximately 31\u00b0C. No change in the stream shape was observed. No behavior beyond simple diffusion was observed. We performed simulations with the Navier -Stokes equations plus a Korteweg stress term. We estimated that the maximum possible value of the square gradient parameter was 10 -12 N f or the honey -water system (Pojman 2005). P UBLICATION (S) Pramanik S, Mishra M.

Dhir, PhD, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Nucleate boiling is bubble growth from a heated surface and the subsequent detachment of the bubble to a cooler surrou nding liquid (bubbles in microgravity grow to different sizes than on Earth). As a result, these bubbles can transfer energy through fluid flow; the Nucleate Pool Boiling Experiment (NPBX) investigation provides an understanding of heat transfer and vapor removal processes that take place during nucleate boiling in microgravity. This understanding is needed for optimum design and safe operation of heat exchange equipment that uses nucleate boiling as a way to transfer heat in extreme environments of the dee p ocean (submarines) and microgravity. E ARTH BENEFITS The proposed research provides a fundamental understanding of bubble dynamics and heat transfer during nucleate boiling in extreme conditions. Such an understanding optimizes the design and safe operation of heat exchange equipment employing phase change for transfer of heat in the environments of the deep ocean, extreme cold, and high altitudes. S PACE BENEFITS The experiments will give engineers the capability to achieve cooling of various comp onents and systems used in space in an efficient manner and thereby lead to smaller and lighter space exploration systems. R ESULTS In the Nucleate Pool Boiling Experiment (NPBX) single bubble dynamics (eg, inception and growth), multiple bubble dynam ics (lateral merger and departure, if any), nucleate pool boiling heat transfer, and critical heat flux using Perfluoro - n-hexane as the test liquid are investigated. The results of the experiments show that a single bubble continues to grow to occupy the size of the chamber without departing from the heater surface. During lateral merger of bubbles, at high superheats (heating the surface beyond the boiling point) a large bubble may lift off from Nucleate Pool Boiling eXperiment heater wafer. Polished aluminum wafer (reflecting a black background) that was manufactured with 5 nucleation cavities (~20 microns in diameter) to initiate boiling at specific locations. NASA's Glenn Research Center image . 787 the surface but continue to hover near the surface while pul ling smaller neighboring bubbles into it and growing in size consistent with predictions from numerical simulations. At low superheats, bubbles at neighboring sites simply merge to yield a larger bubble. The larger bubble mostly locates in the middle of th e heated surface and serves as a sink for vapor generated on the heated surface. The latter mode continues to persist when boiling is occurring all over the heater surface. This behavior of vapor removal is very different from that at Earth normal gravity where single or merged bubbles rapidly lift off from the surface. Heat fluxes for steady state nucleate boiling and critical heat fluxes are found to be much lower than those obtained under Earth's normal gravity conditions and also lower than previous data obtained on space shuttles, but higher than that predicted by the hydrodynamic theory extrapolated to microgravity. Aside from experimental conditions, rate of nucleate boiling heat transfer will be dependent on relative heater size and fluid confinement. This data is useful for calibration of results of numerical simulations with the condition that correlations that are developed for nucleate boiling heat transfer under microgravity conditions must account for the existence of vapor escape path (sink) from the heater, size of the heater, and the size and geometry of the chamber (Dhir 2012).

These studies represent part of a series of investigations on the International Space Station (ISS) on how heat and particles move through liquids in microgravity. SODI -IVIDIL investigates the effects of residual vibrations (g -jitter) on experiments involving diffusion in liquids. Researchers plan to characterize the spectral influence of g -jitter to increase the understanding of the kinetic mechanisms influencing diffusion effects in the presence of vibrations, therefore allowing for more successful science to be operated aboard ISS. E ARTH BENEFITS Based on previous studies, scientists have developed numerical simulations to help understand oil behaviors in a drilled well. The SODI -IVIDIL experiment allows scientists to confirm and refine the parameters of their models, leading to more accurate predi ctions about oil wells being considered for extraction. This investigation also data for applications to fields in mineralogy and geophysics for predictions about the locations of natural resources beneath the Earth's surface.

Researchers plan to characterize the spectral influence of g -jitter to increase the understanding of the kinetic mechanisms influencing diffusion effects in the presence of vibrations, therefore allowing for more successful science to be operated aboard ISS. Comparison between the co nvection flow without vibration (top) and with strong vibration (bottom) from IVIDIL. ESA image. 790 RESULTS Experimental runs focused on the evolution of the liquid's concentration field both with and without imposed vibrations. In the absence of vibration, there was no movement in the system and the concentration field mirrors the structure of the temperature field. Howeve r, in the presence of external vibration, more sophisticated flow patterns emerged. When vibration -free experimental data from the concentration profiles were compared with numerical predictions, the concentration profile was linear and in agreement with t he predicted profile, which suggested that g -jitter (residual vibration) had little effect on diffusion. However, high- frequency imposed vibrations did affect diffusion, as seen when the concentration profile deviated from the linear profile under the infl uence of relatively weak fabricated vibrations. A closer look at the effect of g -jitter on diffusion processes after the conclusion of each experiment revealed that during the nominal (or quasi -steady) vibration period of the ISS, g - jitter did not affect diffusion in experiments run without imposed vibrations. These results were duplicated when the experiments were repeated with large time lags and different temperature gradients. Furthermore, the experimental results were in agreement with numeric simulat ions. However, perturbations were evident in experiments without imposed vibrations that ran during periods with abnormal transient movements of the ISS such as orbit correction, docking, or undocking. SODI -IVIDIL was the first successful in- orbit experime nt to characterize the effect of onboard g -jitter. The results from IVIDIL shed light on the complex mechanisms behind vibration -induced convection and provide useful insight on how to control fluids in space to support future physical and life science experiments.

In order to perform controlled experiments, PLEGPAY provides a pressurized gas tank with dose controller and timer, such that the inert gas xenon can be released into the chamber where it becomes ionized by electrons emitted by an insert for ignition. R ESULTS The first runs of the first PLEGPAY experiment demonstrated the capability of the plasma contactor device to control the potential of a very large spacecraft such as the International Space Station (ISS) through the biasing of the plasma contactor. Furthermore, experiment 2 demonstrated the capability to lock the ISS potential around zero by small current emissio n, and the PLEGPAY Langmuir Probe measurements were found to match the independent floating potential measurements made by the NASA Floating Potential Measurement Unit. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. Plasma Electron Gun Payload instrument located on the outside of the International Space Station.

Fortov, the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Plasma crystals form under certain conditions in complex (dusty) plasma when electrically charged dust particles arrange themselves in a regular macroscopic crystal lattice under favorable parameters. This structure allows for an investigation of the prope rties of condensed matter on the kinetic level. This means that basic processes, such as melting and movement, can be followed by observing the motion of individual particles. Plasma Crystal Research on the ISS (PK -3) gives researchers a better understandi ng of plasma in space and helps to determine the critical points where crystalline structures appear in the plasma. E ARTH BENEFITS Plasma studies in outer space could provide answers to our questions about terrestrial plasmas such as lightning. S PACE BENEFITS Learning more about the space environment helps us better explore it. We can work safer, understand better, and ultimately travel further if we know more about the plasmas of space. R ESULTS The PK -3 Plus experiments were dedicated to observe basic, complex plasma conditions and provide much better insights into the properties of complex plasmas. The difference between using argon or neon as the neutral gas was clear to see. Argon plasma showe d a brighter glow, corresponding to a higher ionization rate close to the electrodes. The neon plasma showed a homogeneous distribution of the glow between the 2 electrodes. Although one could imagine that a homogeneous plasma distribution would cause a si milar distribution in a complex plasma, the experiments showed the opposite. The argon distribution gives the best conditions German ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter aboard the International Space Station with the PK -3 Plus laboratory. The Experiment Container is mounted in the Service Module. NASA image. 794 for homogeneous, void -free complex plasma, while the neon glow distribution unexpectedly resulted in a big void for identical gas and electrical parameters. The physical reason for this difference was not clear. There are a number of important differences between complex plasma parameters in neon and argon, eg, different ion mass and mean free path, different plasma density, differen t electron temperature, etc. PK-3 Plus showed that the \"void\" in the center of the complex plasma cloud could be easily closed under certain conditions, thus providing a much better homogeneity of the complex plasma, a feature that was hardly achievable before. This is very promising as it is essential for many precision studies and enables new manipulation possibilities for future experiments. Instabilities in the plasma (eg, heartbeat instability that causes continuous contraction and expansion of the void, which the microparticles follow) appeared at high microparticle densities and were strongly related to changes in the plasma glow. However, even though homogeneous and void -free plasma is advantageous for modelling solid (crystalline), fluid and gas phases and transitions between different phases, the reason for the void appearance in the neon distribution, has created an interesting field of study for the future by itself.

E ARTH BENEFIT There is an ongoing trend toward miniaturization and functionalization in the semiconductor industry. The technique demonstrated in space can be applied to the production of high performance semiconductor elements. S PACE BENEFIT It is expected that the nanotemplate produced in space will tend to have higher quality. The semiconductor material made of the space - produced nanotemplate should have higher quality and performance. Therefore, the experiment will lead to d evelopment of high- performance computers, application to the blue LED lights, and realization of cost reduction in manufacturing of semiconductor products. R ESULTS Amino acid chains (peptide particles) were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and were subjected to concentrated sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution and allowed to create peptide arrangements for 1 week in a microgravity environment. All samples were successfully retrieved and analyzed. The peptides formed in orbit in a microgravity environment showed similar nanoscaled patte rns with typical structures obtained on the ground in a 1 G environment . It indicates that the motion of the peptide is not influenced by microgravity in this experimental system. However, the suppression effect of convection in the microgravity environment was apparent. The formed nanopatterns were sophisticated by keeping away from adsorption of unexpected aggregates.

The photonic crystal will be widely used for optical devices such as optical spectral analyzers or pulse compression/extension devices. This study also demonstrates the effectiveness of the microgravity environment for industrial application. E ARTH BENEFIT The findings of this experiment, including numerous patents, led to industrial applications such as the research and development of a pen - shaped micro spectroscope that uses a millimeter - sized photonic crystal and the manufacturing of uniform- sized silica microparticles. Moreover, the findings also led to the development of a new colloid crystallization method, which in turn helped start several related venture companies. S PACE BENEFIT This investigation is applied to new knowledge, and not specifically to advances in space exploration. R ESULTS The 3DPC Experiment was flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Millimeter- sized photonic crystal s made with silica particle s were obtained. As a result of reflectance spectrometry, improvement in uniformity of g rid interval was observed. It was confirmed that uniform photonic crystal made with 200 nm -sized silica particle s was achieved for the first time in human history due t o the micro -gravity environment .

This provides the benchmark samples to validate numerical models that attempt to predict and describe this transition that is of high relevance to industrial alloys as the properties of a casting depend on the grain structure. R ESULTS Experimental results are obtained in space using Aluminum- Silicon alloys with, or without, a grain refining suspension directionally solidified under different conditions in the Materials Science Laboratory (MSL) on -board the International Space Station (I SS). The analysis of the space samples confirms the occurrence of a columnar- to-equiaxed transition, especially in the refined alloy. Temperature evolution and grain structure analysis provide critical values for the position, the temperature gradient, and the solidification velocity at the columnar to equiaxed transition. A sharp transition is detected when the rate of solidification is increased in contrast to the progressive transition seen when lowering the temperature gradient. Triggering the transiti on appears to be more difficult in the absence of grain refiner since none of the corresponding samples showed it whereas it was found in sample processed on the ground under similar conditions. This effect is potentially due to the detachment of fragment of dendrites that are less dense than the melt and float up due to gravity towards regions where they serve as nucleation sites for equiaxed grains. Such interpretation appears to be supported A typical microstructure obtained in a sample containing grain refiner is featured in the picture below. ESA Image. 802 by parallel experiments performed under X -ray diagnostics on so unding rocket flights. This unique data are used to improve modelling of solidification microstructures and grain structure on different lengths scales.

The patterns of the crystals resulting from transitions o f liquids to solids is of substantial importance to processes in producing materials such as solar cells, thermoelectrics, and metal alloys. E ARTH BENEFITS The transport industry is keen to use data from CETSOL -2 to reduce weight and increase strength of aircraft and road vehicles. S PACE BENEFITS Metal foams are already being used in cars and cranes and research on the International Space Station and is helping to develop newer alloys which can also be used for spacecraft materials and constructions. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication. 804 COARSENING IN SOLID LIQUID MIXTURES -2 (CSLM -2) Research Area: Materials Science Expedition(s): 7, 15 -17, 23/24 Principal Investigator(s): Peter W. Voorhees, PhD, Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill, United States RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Coarsening in Solid Liquid Mixtures -2 (CSLM -2) investigates the rates of coarsening of solid particles embedded in a liquid matrix. During this process, small particles shrink by losing atoms to larger particles, causing the larger particles to grow (coarsen) within a liquid lead/tin matrix. This study defines the mechanisms and rates of coarsening that govern similar processes that occur in materials such as turbine blades, dental amalgam fillings, aluminum alloys, etc. E ARTH BENEFITS On Earth, materials that contain pores created and trapped during solidification degrade properties and cause a distinct weakening in the overal l structure of the cast product. Determining what causes these problems will lead to the development of improved manufacturing processes for materials. S PACE BENEFITS In any mixture that contains particles of different sizes, the large particles tend to grow while the smaller particles shrink in a process called coarsening. Tiny oil droplets coalescing into a large blob are one illustration, but the process occurs in solids as well. Coarsening occurs on Earth during the processing of any metal alloy, and thus, the coarsening process affects products from dental fillings to turbine blades. Since the properties of an alloy are linked to the size of the particles within the solid, coarsening can be used to strengthen materials. This is the case with the majority of aluminum alloys used commercially today. Conversely, if the coarsening process proceeds too long the material can weaken. This occurs in jet turbine blades and is one of the reasons why turbine blades must be replaced after a certain number of hours of service. Thus developing accurate models of the coarsening process is central to creating a wide range of new materials from those used in automobiles to those used in space applications. The results of previous experiments performed on the shuttle have done just that. These models have been incorporated into a computer code that is being used to design many new materials, including materials of importance to NASA's s paceflight program. Solid -liquid systems are ideal ISS007E10467 - Side view of the sample chamber portion of the Coarsening in Solid/Liquid Mixtures -2 experiment installed in the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) of the Destiny L aboratory module. Also visible are cables attaching the hardware to the MSG and a vacuum valve knob. 805 systems to study this coarsening process. However, gravity can induce particle sedimentation and thus hamper the studies of coarsening in these mixtures on Earth. The microgravity environment of the space station allows scientists to study the process of coarsening with reduced interference from the sedimentation that occurs on Earth. R ESULTS Samples from CSLM -2 that were processed during Increment 7 were not able to be returned to Earth in time for evaluating the results. Although the data was lost, engineering data collected on equipment function can benefit subsequent experiments. The CSLM- 2 high volume fraction and CSLM -2R low - volume fraction samples were successfully processed and are currently under analysis at Northwestern University. Preliminary analysis of the low-volume fraction samples indicates that the furnaces performed as planned. Recent results show that the particle size distributions for a 30% volume frac tion of coarsening phase is very close to that predicted by theory. The particle distribution appears different, perhaps due to the nonspherical shape of the particles that are present at this high volume fraction. Analysis of both the low and high volume fraction samples is continuing.

E ARTH BENEFIT It is well known that crystals tend to develop structural defects and capture impurities when a new facet is generated. Because of this, it is necessary to examine the mechanism of the facet crystal growth process. The results will provide valuable data on creating high-quality materials for industrial use, such as solar cells or superconducting magnets. S PACE BENEFIT This investigation is applied to new knowledge of the facet crystal growth process and not specifically to advances in space exploration. R ESULTS Facet Growth experiments were conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in a micro -G environment. A brief summary of the obtained results at this point is as follows: (1) High-resolution Temperature and Concentration distributions in the vicinity of the solid/liquid (S/L) interface were successfully obtained. (2) The relationship between the growth rate and a kinetics undercooling at the S/L interface, which is known as a driving force of crystal growth, was obtained. (3) Breakdown of the growth interface occurred at the point with maximum kinetics undercooling. Splitting of the S/L interface was caused by the dense t-butyl alcohol, which decreased the melting point. (4) Numerical simulations based on a phase -field model validated t he observed effect of latent heat of fusion on the change of the S/L change.

Johnson, PhD, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif, United States RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Viscous Liq uid Foam - Bulk Metallic Glass (Foam) investigation tests and produces hardened foam from bulk metallic glass. The absence of gravity facilitates the creation of a more uniform metallic glass foam, a material with an extremely high strength to weight ratio . Developing lighter and stronger materials can lead to a more durable spacecraft that will require less propellant to travel long distances. E ARTH BENEFITS Bulk metallic glasses are extremely strong materials (2 -3 times stronger than conventional metals) that, when molten, are viscous enough to make well-constructed solid foam. While bulk metallic glass is strong, it is also brittle. A bulk metallic glass foam is very resilient, however, much like spongy human bone. Solid foams are the best materials to make large, stiff structures due to their high strength to mass ratio. Foaming also considerably increases a material's ability to act as a temperature insulator. Foam can be difficult to study on Earth because gravity can interfere with bubble formation, causing the bubbles to rise and the liquid to sink. This is especially true when conventional metal liquid (like aluminum or ti tanium) is foamed. A better understanding of foaming will help investigators improve a variety of materials used in everything from medical supplies to industrial processing, sports equipment and military vehicles. S PACE BENEFITS Hardened bulk metallic glass foam may be very useful as a material for building future spacecraft for long -term spaceflight. The foams can also be used to build permanent structures on the moon or Mars. Buildings and spacecraft fuselages made from bulk metallic glass foams can be extremely tough and light at the same time, thereby reducing costs while increasing the protection they provide to explorers. ISS009E14583 - Foam investigation setup in the Maintenance Work Area on the International Space Station during Expedition 9. 809 RESULTS The experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that amorphous metals exhibit foam-making qualities on the ground that mimic metallic foam textures made in microgravity conditions. The amorphous metals, when softened or melted, have a super - cooled state that has a very high viscosity \u2014ideal conditions for foam processing. Foam made from a Pd 40Ni40P20 glass- forming metallic liquid, was made both on the ground and aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Pellets of the material that contained 1 -atmosphere bubbles, were sealed in ampoules. The ampoules were made to thread into a soldering iron tip for heating aboard the ISS. The samples were heated at 360\u00b0C for 5 minutes, enabling foam creation, then allowed to cool. The ground samples contained textures tha t were similar to those produced in microgravity \u2014equally distributed bubbles dominated by surface tension forces; the bubbles did not experience sedimentation (floating). These types of foams have great potential for future exploration applications because of their great strength and light weight. In particular, such foams may make very effective shields against micrometeorite and orbital debris strikes. P UBLICATION (S) Hofmann DC, Roberts SN.

The main objective is a technological demonstration that the new technology is capable of producing particle st abilized aqueous foams under microgravity. The project focuses on the development of a multi- capillary foam generator that has already been successfully tested under normal and elevated gravity conditions. Results are utilized in the development of an alte rnative foam production technology for metallic and other foamable systems. R ESULTS Successful microgravity foaming experiment has been carried out aboard of the International Space Station (ISS) using a fully stand -alone equipment. The multi -capillary foam generators were pre-infiltrated with aqueous suspension using controlled gas flow produce foams under microgravity. On the basis of the comparison with terrestrial reference experiments, researchers noted that minimal foam structure differences were found at 0.08 l/min gas flow rate. At higher flow rates, foams blown in microgravity had the largest average bubble sizes. Gravity -insensitive foaming procedu re can be important at those technologies that use various foaming directions measured to gravity vector. Foam stability was not improved by eliminating gravity. Similar phenomenon has been found in previous macrogravity measurements using the same suspens ion. Foam decay in the case of this experiment's suspension was therefore not connected with gravity induced drainage. Foam volumes were increased during microgravity conditions. It was concluded that using the foam generators infiltrated with FOCUS Suspen sion, foam volumes depended on the gravity level as less gravity level gave more foam. This supports former results in increased gravity conditions. View of European Space Agency (ESA) hardware used for foam experiment.

E ARTH BENEFIT The formation process of ice crystals (the crystal growth process) is complex, and the detailed formation mechanism remains unknown. Understanding how ice crystals grow can lead to additional knowledge in understanding the growth of a wide variety of crystals for use in pharmaceuticals, or in the development of new materials. S PACE BENEFIT This investigation is applied to new knowledge of the ice crystal growth process and not specifically to advances in space exploration. RESULTS Ice crystal growth experiments were carried out 134 times from December 2008 to February 2009 in the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo of the International Space Station (ISS). Images taken during the experiments were analyzed to measure the growth rates of the tip of a dendrite (the branch- like arm) and thic kness between the basal faces (the flat front and back surfaces) of an ice crystal growing from heavy water (D 2O) in the range of 0.03 to 2.0 Kelvin (K) super -cooling . Observed tip growth velocities were higher than theoretical values at very low super- cooling of below 0.1 K. Tip velocities were in agreement with theoretical values for larger amounts of super - cooling. Researchers concluded that the tip growth velocity is significantly influenced by kinetics of basal face growth rather than by the tip's asymmetric shape. Researchers also observed that the growth rate of the thickness changed suddenly with time, which indicates that the growth rates of the 2 basa l faces are not identical to one another. This is a significant observation since the difference between the growth rates of the 2 basal faces has been proposed as a possible cause of the distortion (morphological instability) that leads to the growth of a n ice crystal from a round disk initially into the familiar hexagonal dendrite. There have been no reports to date on this time dependence of the basal face growth rate in experiments conducted under full gravity.

This investigation is ex pected to study the shape memory properties required to manufacture a new concept actuator (a device that transforms energy to other forms of energy). E ARTH BENEFITS Italian -Foam can be used as energy absorbers (panels and bumpers) and self expandable/deployable structures. Forms of foam are widely used in medical bedding and seating applications because of its unique attributes which can help aid comfort and sleep. S PACE BENEFITS Italian -Foam can be used in the aerospace industry for different applicatio ns from light actuators to structural parts with reduced size during shipping. This type of foam may be very useful as a material utilized for building future spacecrafts for long -term space flight missions. R ESULTS Experimental results aboard the International Space Station (ISS), along with results obtained on the ground, highlight the complexity in developing foams in microgravity for structural actuators. Foam heating system can behave very differently i n space and heat fluctuation is greatly amplified by microgravity. In future experiments, the maximum temperature will increase (at least up to 120\u00b0C) if a heating plate will be used again. In the current experiment the maximum temperature was strongly reduced for Comparison of foam shape recovery in the International Space Station (ISS) experiment after the torsion test to the ground experiment (series of video captured images) that clearly show the same results have been obtained in the ground and ISS experiments. University of Rome Tor Vergata images . 815 safety reasons. Overall, good results were obtained and important information were acquired for defining a multi -functional composite structure for future experiments. Foam actuator made in space can be tested for compression, torsion, and flexur e, but in the case of compression, attention has to be made to have a continuous contact between the foam walls and the heating walls during recovery. As a general conclusion, microgravity does not have much effect on the ability of the foams to recover th e initial shape but strongly influences the behavior of the heating devices and, therefore, the efficiency of the foam recovery.

The microgravity environment of the International Space Station (ISS) is of special importance to this project because only there are all gravity -induced convections eliminated and well - defined conditions for solidification prevail that can be disturbed by artificial fluid flow being under full control of the experimenters. Design solutions that make it possible to improve casting processes and especially aluminum alloys with well -defined properties will be provided. R ESULTS Preliminary data indicates the samples are homogeneously distributed under purely diffusive conditions, the longer precipitates appear clearly accumulated in the center of the sample when a rotating magnetic field is applied. The size and distribution of the precipitates as a function of the solidification velocity and the controlled flow of melt imposed by the magnetic field are produced by 3D tomographic reconstruction. The enrichment in Si and Fe resulting from the convective flows in the central part of the sample clearly lead to the formation of larger precipitates. These 2 pictures resulting from the treatment of images of the cross -section of samples processed in space, provide the sought for quantitative evidence of the influence of convection on the distribution of the precipitates in the solidified alloy. 817 PUBLICATION (S) Budenkova O, Baltaretu F, Steinbach S, et al.

The Microstructure Formation in Casting of Technical Alloys under Diffusive and Magnetically Controlled Convective Conditions -2 (MICAST -2) investigation will study a magnetic field's influence on the solidification of alloys containing aluminum -silicon (AlSi) and aluminum- silicon - iron (AlSiFe). The experiment will also inform computer models of metal casting, which could help the metals industry design better mixtures and processes. E ARTH BENEFITS The microgravity environment of the International Space Station is key for alloy research because gravity -induced actions are eliminat ed, and turbulence or convection can be carefully manipulated by the researchers. The experiments could improve ground -based development of new lightweight, high-performance materials that can be used in future space missions. S PACE BENEFITS The MICAST experiments produces data that enhances computer models simulating metal solidification on Earth. Knowledge gained from the MICAST experiments helps to improve ground -based metal casting processes, leading to new stronger, lightweight materials.

This is a cooperative investigation with the European Space Agency and NASA for accommodation and operation aboard the International Space Station (ISS). E ARTH BENEFITS These linked experiments aim to improve our understanding of the solidification processes of metallic alloys. As the mechanical properties, and therefore potential Earth -based applications, are directly related to solidification conditions, it is c rucial to validate the predictions of numerical models that describe solidification processes. Additionally, this research improve s knowledge of casting processes, so that future tailored metallic alloys can be created for several applications of our daily life. S PACE BENEFITS The MSL -CETSOL and MICAST investigations will provide a unique insight into microgravity solidification processes of cast alloys under well controlled conditions. R ESULTS When a molten metal or alloy cools and crystallizes, the resulting solid generally has 2 competing types of grain structures. At first, fast cooling of the melt normally forms columns of long branching grains growing inward from the side walls. Then as internal heat is Microstructure and grain structure in longitudinal cross -sections of flight samples showing columnar growth (top) and transition to equiaxed grain growth (bottom). ACCESS Technology, Aachen, Germany image . 820 shed from the remaining liquid fraction, the cooling rate decreases, which often leads to seeding and growth of equiaxed (having axes of about the same length) grains. This effect is described as a columnar -to-equiaxed transition (CET) and is very important, and highly studied, in metal forming processes and metallurgy since it greatly affects the physical properties and behavior of virtually all metallic products, including high -value parts such as single crystal turbine blades in aircraft engines. CET experiments to study and control this transitional process have been successfully performed in the Materials Science Laboratory (M SL) with the Low-Gradient Furnace (LGF) module onboard the ISS from November 2009 until April 2010. Turbulent melt flow is minimized in space, which enables growth of equiaxed grains free of sedimentation and buoyancy effects. The critical phases of each microgravity experiment, i.e. the homogenization and solidification phases, were performed during sleep periods of the astronauts to reduce, as well, vibrational disturbances. Gravity sensors data close to the MSL confirm that a gravity level below \u00b10.0005 g was achieved during all experiments, g = 9.8m/s\u00b2 on Earth. Aluminium -silicon (AlSi) alloys with and without grain refiners (particles added to limit crystal grain branching) were processed successfully in the LGF. First analysis shows that in the non- grain-refined samples columnar dendritic growth exists, whereas CET is observed in the grain refined samples. Critical parameters for the temperature gradient and the cooling rate describing CET are determined from analysis of the thermal data and the grain structure. These data are used for initial numerical simulations to predict the position of the columnar -to-equiaxed transition and will form a unique database for calibration and further development of numerical CET - modeling (Zimmermann 2011). Preliminary results of an AlSi mixture with grain refiners show that, during solidification, the columnar crystallization front advances forward and an undercooled liquid zone develops ahead the front, thus facilitating equiaxed crystal formation. Equiaxed nucleation with grain refiners follows the free growth model in simulation. In most castings, grain refiner particles may be engulfed or pushed by the growing solid liquid interface. So, these grain refiner particles cannot initiate grains and normally end up in the grain boundaries, thus general grain refiner efficiency is very low. It was found that the efficiency of the grain refiners is at a maximum when addition level is low. Experimental CET, in this case, is at a distance of ~128 \u00b1 2 mm versus the simulation distance of 127.5 mm. Hence, the agreement between ISS026E014918 - NASA astronaut Catherine (Cady) Coleman, Expedition 26 flight e ngineer, removes the Low Gradient Furnace and installs the Solidification and Quench Furnace in the Material Science Laboratory in the Destiny laboratory of the International Space Station. 821 model simulation and experiment is reasonably strong. The columnar length is approximately equal to the distance the furnace is moving at a slower velocity a nd, therefore, it is possible to suggest that CET is related to the velocity jump and resulting temperature change. More studies of alloy systems without grain refiners are being conducted, and the influences of grain refiners need to be evaluated further (Mirihanage 2011).

Nanoskeleton data will be added into a computational chemistry simulation for Nanoskeleton synthesis, and the simulation will be used for the prediction of the proper parameters for synthesis on the ground. E ARTH BENEFIT Nanoskeleton will lead to the development of the new Titanium Dioxide (TiO 2) photocatalyst. The experiment data will be input into the computational chemistry simulation for Nanoskeleton synthesis, and the simulation will be applied for the prediction of the proper parameter for Nanoskeleton synthesis on the ground. R ESULTS Samples were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS), whereupon polyethylene based films were immers ed in a solution to create the TiO 2 crystalline -based nanoskeleton samples. Some of the samples were infused with Trimethylbenzene (TMB) and Triethylbenzene(TEB) oil in order to increase the size of the pores of the nanoskeleton . All samples were successfully retrieved from the ISS and analyzed. The appearance of the ISS samples subjected to microgravity was almost the same with that of the Earth b ound control samples. However, the microgravity environment samples reve aled a significant effect on the distance between pores of the nanos keletons prepared with oil (TMB and TEB ), while uniformity and regularity of the pores was improved for the samples prepared without TMB . It was also noted that samples with more ordered structures had improved photo catalytic activity. P UBLICATION (S) Onodera M, Nagumo R, Miura R, et al.

Understanding the effects of convection and sedimentation during bulk -zeolite formation are necessary for optimization of existing syntheses. The investigat ion studies phase) and ZSM -5 / Silicalite -1 mixture phases under weightless conditions . R ESULTS Microgravity significantly slowed particle aggregation, confirming the sensitivity of the process to convection and shear forces. Microgravity also considerably enhanced the effect on aggregation of reduced temperatures and charge. Only the formation and presence of Ordered Liquid Phases (OLPs) before aggregation can account for these observations, and an on- ground study confirmed OLP occurrence. The strong effect of convection and shear forces in microgravi ty indicates the important role OLPs play, and their discovery is useful for optimizing zeolite synthesis and design of hierarchical, functional materials. No results were obtained for the Nanoslab investigations due to a failure. This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected.

Grugel, PhD , Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Using a transparent model material, this experiment studies the fundamental phenomena responsible for the formation of certain classes of defects in metal castings. Investigators examine the physical principles that control the occurrence of defects in manufacturing on Earth in order to develop methods to reduce flaws, defects , or wasted material. E ARTH BENEFITS On Earth, materials that contain pores created and trapped during solidification degrade properties and cause a distinct weakening in the overall structure of the cast product. Examples of these materials include semiconductors and aircraft turbine blades. S PACE BENEFITS PFMI provides insight on how materials solidify in the space environment. Once this process is understood and improvements are made, future manufacturing processes can take place in the microgravity environment providing robust products. R ESULTS Observed bubble migration up through the liquid column indicates that thermocapillary forces do play a role in bubble removal during solidification in microgravity, thereby providing a potential mechanism for avoiding porosity in space processing. Direct com parison between the ground -based thin (2 -D) samples and the flight bulk (3 -D) samples showed significant differences in the interface texture. The flight samples achieved planar growth, an emergence of dendrites (crystallizes in the shape of a tree or bran ch), in less time than ground- based samples. When comparing the planar interface recoil, the flight sample was steeper than the ground -based sample. Additionally, the dendrite spacing in the flight bulk samples were closer together than the ground -based thin samples. The use of 2 -D (thin) samples in one -g for comparison with theoretical models is not adequate, therefore solidification of bulk samples in a microgravity environment and in the lab setting is necessary for a suitable comparison. The bulk sol idification samples, which were filled with succinonitrile (SCN), were melted and re - solidified to observe the bubbles that formed. During controlled re -solidification, aligned tubes of gas were seen to be growing perpendicular to the planar solid/liquid i nterface, inferring that the nitrogen previously dissolved into the liquid SCN was now coming out at the solid/liquid interface and forming the little -studied liquid=solid+gas type reaction. Researchers expects that the results will be directly applicable to understanding solidification for materials processing by providing insights into fundamental behavior of bubbles. 826 PUBLICATION (S) Grugel RN, Luz PL, Smith GP, et al.

That is, inside SpaceDRUMS\u00ae samples of experimental materials can be processed without ever touching a container wall. E ARTH BENEFITS An already demonstrated capability of the combustion synthesis facilitated by SpaceDRUMS\u00ae is the production of advanced porous and glass ceramics for which patents have been awa rded. New innovations from this hardware can include a very light and strong new class of porous glass ceramic material, exhibiting high temperature tolerance, controlled porosity, functionally graded and acoustic absorption, and high wear resistance. Thes e materials are ideal for a wide range of potential applications, from dental and bone replacement, noise reduction in engines, filters, cutting tools and drill bits. S PACE BENEFITS Any new materi als developed using the SpaceDRUMS\u00ae technology may have significant applications in space as well as on Earth. Some of the advanced ceramics, lighter and more durable, may have applications in new spacecraft or extraterrestrial outposts, such as bases on t he moon. Advances in fluid physics stemming from SpaceDRUMS\u00ae may also have applications in future spacecraft propulsion systems. This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected.

Ostrogorsky, PhD , Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, N ew York RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Solidification Using a Baffle in Sealed Ampoules (SUBSA) provides experimental methods of crystallizing melts in microgravity are expected to result in reduced fluid motion in the melt, leading to better distribution of subcomponents and the potential for improved technology used in producing semiconductor crystals. E ARTH BENEFITS Semiconductor materials can conduct, stop or modify a wide range of electrical and optical signals. Therefore, all computer chips, sensors, and wireless communication devices, etc. are built from tiny chips cut from large semico nductor crystals. Improved semiconductor quality, well-formed crystals with few or no imperfections, are the key reason that the electronic devices today are so much smaller and more powerful than their predecessors. S PACE BENEFITS The SUBSA furnace, with its capability to control and visualize melting and solidification of semiconductor crystals, has increased our understanding of solidification phenomena. The transparent furnace coupled with the video downlink and real- time commanding capability provides a powerful tool for scientists and engineers. The scientists were able to watch the motion of the crystal -melt interface as semiconductor crystals were formed. The design of the SUBSA ampoule that includes a baffle and a system that prevents de -wetting resulted in crystals whose properties have not been disrupted by micro - accelerations at the Station, making it possible for future researchers to produce the high- quality semiconductor crystals that are in demand on Earth. One of the first materials science experiments on the International Space Station - the Solidification Using a Baffle in Sealed Ampoules (SUBSA)\u2014will be conducted during Expedition 5 inside the Microgravity Science Glovebox.

Completing these tasks will make it possible to develop technologie s for the formation of materials and compounds with given properties necessary for further space exploration. S PACE BENEFITS Establishing the mechanism of combustion and structural formation in self -propagating, high -temperature synthesis systems in weightlessness will make it possible to obtain high -melting materials with unique foam structures or granular frameworks, which are efficient heat insulating materials for use in space technology. Investigating the materials obtained through self -propagati ng, high - temperature synthesis in long -term microgravity demonstrated the potential for obtaining highly porous foam materials and coatings for use in the aerospace industry in weightlessness. R ESULTS In the framework of the experiments conducted, the mechanisms of combustion and structural formation in self-propaga ting, high- temperature synthesis systems in microgravity were established, and methods of synthesizing highly porous, high -melting, heat -insulating materials with unique properties were developed. Materials with granular structures and foam materials based on self- propagating, high -temperature synthesis systems were obtained, and experiments were conducted to obtain coatings and connections via self- propagating high - temperature synthesis, SHS welding, and SHS soldering in space conditions.

The microgravity environment allowed researchers to grow higher -quality crystals. These crystals have a number of useful commercial applications as catalysts and absorbents. E ARTH BENEFITS The 3-dimensional structure of a zeolite crystal allows it to act as a sieve t o selectively filter certain chemicals in applications such as petroleum processing. Larger crystals allow researchers to better define the structure and understand how it works, with a goal of producing improved crystals on Earth. Improved zeolites may have applications in storing hydrogen fuel, reduction of hazardous by -products from chemical processing, and more efficient techniques for petroleum processing. S PACE BENEFITS Multifunctional Titanosilicates may be used for Absorbtion/Separation of Carbon Dioxide and Water for Portable Life S upport System (PLSS) A lightweight fully regenerative water/carbon dioxide separator is a necessity for long duration, deep space exploration. One critical component is a regenerative water/carbon dioxide separator that can capture the water for recovery, and either capture and recover the carbon dioxide or vent it to a low pressure environment (i.e., Mars). Titanosilicates can be adjusted both with respect to size and shape, and with respect to pore size. These have been used commercially to separate water and carbon dioxide. By varying size and shape the pressure drop is minimized, while variations in the pore size for a given structure allows the customization of these high surface area (~500 m2/g) adsorbents. As a potential added benefit, the constituents to make titanosilicates can be obtained on the lunar surface from ilmenite (iron titanium oxide which crystallizes in igneous rocks out of magma in the bottom layers) reduction and silicates (compound of silicon and oxygen). R ESULTS ZCG produced zeolite crystals with a high degree of crystalline perfection in microgravity. During ISS Expedition 6, 19 zeolite samples were mixed and incubated. These samples were NASA Image: ISS005E19055 - View of Astronaut Peggy Whitson, Expedition Five Flight Engineer, as she places a cartridge into the Zeolite Crystal Growth (ZCG) experiment located in the U.S. Laboratory/Destiny on ISS. 835 returned to Earth at the conclusion of Expedition 6 and sent back to the principal investigator for analysis. Results from the samples mixed on ISS suggest that the Lewis acid catalytic sites are altered in microgravity, as indicated by lower catalytic activity in the MPV probe reaction compared to Earth -grown zeolite. This further suggests that th e control of fluid dynamics during crystallization may be important in making better industrial catalysts. Although space -grown zeolites had the same particle morphology and identical surface framework as zeolites grown on Earth, the average zeolite size o f the space -grown crystals was 10% larger than crystals grown on Earth (Akata 2004). Larger zeolite crystals allow researchers to better define the structure and understand how they work, with a goal of producing improved crystals on Earth. Improved zeoli tes may have applications in storing hydrogen fuel, reduction of hazardous byproducts from chemical processing, and more efficient techniques for petroleum processing (Akata 2009).

The steps of zeogrid formation have to be understood in detail to allow the design of specialized zeogrids. Structure and morphology of the obtained products are expected to be influenced by a weightless environment. Zeogrid studies the self- organization of nanoscopic zeolite slabs (nanoslabs). Structure directing agents (templates) are used promote the provided strong evidence for the self -organization of nanoslabs into ordered phases under microgravity conditions. In weightless conditions, millimeter - sized solid particles were formed that clearly showed orientational order when measured by small angle X -ray scattering. The discovery of correlated \"domains\" and its influence on the kinetics in microgravity was very attractive from a scientific point of view. Furthermore, the improved understanding of the self - organization of zeolitic build ing units in ordered liquid phases had significant impact on the development of new application-oriented materials. Through mastering of the formation of orientational order, designer zeolites appeared to be within reach. The form and structure of zeogrids and zeotiles were highly sensitive to the mixing conditions, suggesting a strong impact of convection on the nanoslab ordering process upon surfactant addition. It was observed that the samples obtained under microgravity conditions were larger in size , monolithic, and better ordered internally. These observations indicated that shear flow and convection effects have a major role in arranging the elementary building units before solidification occurs.

Fortov, the Russian Academy of Sciences , Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES PKE-Nefedov is designed for long -term investigations of complex plasmas in weightlessness. Complex plasmas contain ions, electrons, neutral atoms (or molecules), and small solid particles normally in the micrometer range. These microparticles attract thousands of elementary charges in the plasma and interact with each other via a screened Coulomb potential. Complex plasmas are of special interest because they can behave as liquid and crystalline states and are observable at the kinetic level. Thus, they form a new model system for strongly coupled states. R ESULTS During the 4.5 years of operation of the PKE - Nefedov laboratory on the International Space Station, 45 successful complex plasma experiment sessions in microgravity (typically 90 min each) were completed. The scientific outcome was very broad and fundamental. It covered many aspects of physics, like solid state and fluid physics, wave phenomena, physics of binary systems, particle growth, decharging of particles in the afterglow plasma, coagulation of charged particles in a neutral gas, additional to pure complex plasma phenom ena like the study of the ion drag force and the void formation. The scientific yield counts more than 30 publications in international journals. P UBLICATION (S) Ivlev AV, Kretschmer M, Rubin -Zuzic M, et al.

Fortov, Joint Institute for High Temperatures of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Studying Plasma Dust Crystals and Liquids in Microgravity on the ISS RS (Plazmenniy Kristall) is comprised of 30 distinct investigations. It is conducted within a framework of international cooperation with the German Space Agency (DLR), the Max Planck Institute fo r Extraterrestrial Physics, the European Space Agency, and Roscosmos. Several of the investigations are detailed below: M ACH CONES -PK Mach Cones -PK space investigates the interaction of individual particles moving at a speed that exceeds Mach 3 (the speed of sound of dust) in a large three -dimensional plasma dust system. P ROJECTILE -PK Projectile -PK studies the interaction between a str ongly charged dust particle and a dust crystal. P HASE TRANSITIONS -PK-1 Phase Transitions -PK-1 studies structural phase transitions in dust plasma when exposed to an external alternating electrical field. During this investigation a new state of dust plas ma was studied: electrorheological (ER) plasma, when a transition occurs from an isotropic plasma dust fluid to an anisotropic state. P HASE TRANSITIONS -PK-2 Phase Transitions -PK-2 studies non- equilibrium transitions in binary dust plasma. The interpenetra tion of particles 3.4 microns in diameter in a plasma dust system formed by large - diameter dust particles was studied under varying conditions. PHASE TRANSITIONS -PK-3 Phase Transitions -PK-3 studies the phase transition from a plasma liquid to a plasma crystal in a large three -dimensional plasma dust system. C RYSTALLIZATION FRONT -PK Crystallization Front -PK studies the possibil ity of discovering a crystallization front in a three - dimensional plasma dust system. Crystal domains with varying orientations (1, 2, 3). The number of dust particles in the system exceeds 106. Roscosmos image. 841 SEARCH -PK-3-2 Search -PK-3-2 conducts baseline experiments in the Plazmenniy Kristall 3 Plus science unit in which the parameters for plasma containing particles vary th roughout virtually the entire range. EARTH BENEFITS The experiment has great importance for fundamental science, because microgravity opens up possibilities for discovering entirely new effects in plasma with charged solid macroparticles. R ESULTS MACH CONES -PK The effectiveness of directly measuring the speed of sound in a 3 -D plasma dust system was demonstrated by measuring the mach angle that comprises the half- angle of the mach cone solution. The speed of the large particle exceeded 35 mm/s. The spee d of sound measured was 20-30 mm/s, ie, the large particle traveled in supersonic mode at a mach number ranging from 2.8-1.3. P ROJECTILE -PK Trajectories of small particles were studied in detail and a theory of their motion was developed based on hydrodynamic approximation. A comparison of the particle trajectories calculated on the basis of a classical solution with those obtained in the experiment demonstrates that motion of dust particles corresponds to the case of their non- viscous flow of a spherical Wigner - Seitz cell around a large particle in which the transfer of impulse moment between the environment and the outflowing medium did not occur. This situation explained the effect of drag force disappearing from the dust crystal. P HASE TRANSITIONS -PK-1 The phase transition isotropic medium -chain structure in ER plasma was studied in microgravity. Particles remained in a disordered liquid phase while the amplitude of the alternating field applied was lower than a giv en threshold. The subsequent increase of the field led to a reorganization of the particles. The particles became more and more ordered until well -defined chains along the field were formed. The transition between isotropic and chain liquid states was enti rely reversible; a decrease in the field returned the particles back to an isotropic state. Photograph of the dust particle cloud obtained with a quadrant camera with a field of view of 35.726.0 mm. On the left, a short path is observed in the large particle's leading edge section in the dust cloud. As can be seen in the photograph, the movement of the particle is accompanied by the appearance of a Mach cone. The cones shown in the figure were obtained by superimposing two sequential video footage frames. It is clear that the projection of the double cone on the plane deviates somewhat from the straight lines. Roscosmos image. 842 PHASE TRANSITIONS -PK-2 For Phase Transitions -PK-2, 3.4- micron particles penetrated the stable structure of large particles and traveled to the center of the plasma chamber. During observations, it was established that in the external area, when the speed of the penetrating particles was fairly high, the penetration of the small particles resulted in the formation of chains. The large particles also structured into ch ains and formed lanes. The formation of such structures is observed in nature, when 2 streams of particles move towards each other under the impact of a certain force. The phenomenon observed was a non -equilibrium transition, and was dependent upon the spe cific characteristics and dynamics of the particle interaction. It is of interest for various fields of physics. With experiments involving dust plasma in microgravity, it is possible to enable the movement of individual particles and study the dynamics of the transition. P HASE TRANSITION -PK-3 The increase in distance between particles (ie, the decrease in density of the dust co mponent) was the main factor responsible for the fusion of the plasma dust system with the increase in pressure of the inert gas. Similarly, the decrease in pressure resulted in compression of the dust system and stimulated crystallization. The interaction energy as a function of pressure was maximal with the lowest pressure p 11 Pa for both of the plasma dust systems studied. The increase in inert gas pressure resulted in the decrease in interaction energy between dust particles, as well as the decrease in pressure of the gas causing an increase in interaction. An analysis of the phase state of the plasma dust system observed (based on assessing the phase trajectories of the system in an equilibrium phase diagram) showed that when pressure increases both systems move in the direction of the fusion curve. The plasma dust system of small -size particles crossed the phase border at high pressures. C RYSTALLIZATION FRONT -PK The formations of a crystallization front and domains with varying orientations were discovered. S EARCH -PK-3-2 In the PK -3 Plus unit, three ways of closing off an area free of microparticles were successfully demonstrated, decreasing high frequency discharge power to the minimum possible level, using a symmetrical flow of gas and effect of an external low -frequency electrical field. Penetration of dust particles 3.4 microns in diameter into a structure of particles 9.2 microns in diameter in an argon plasma at a pressure of 30 Pa. The formation of chains and lanes is visible. Frames were obtained by superimposing sequential images: small particles are identified in the form of long bands, and large particles appear as points.

Studies on the ISS can test a variety of technologies, systems, and materials that will be needed for future Exploration missions. Some of the technology development experiments have been so successful that the hardware has been transit ioned to operational status. Other experimental results feed new technology developments. 846 AMINE SWINGBED Research Area: Air, Water and Surface Monitoring Expedition(s): 27-ongoing Principal Investigator(s): Jeffrey Sweterlitsch, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas John Graf, PhD, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Amine Swingbed investigation determines if a vacuum -regenerated amine system can effectively remove carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the International Space Station (ISS) atmosphere using a smaller, more efficient vacuum regeneration system. EARTH BENEFITS Although designed for human spaceflight missions where ample access to the vacuum of space is available, the technology can be used in Earth applications if access to a clean -purge gas supply is available. S PACE BENEFITS This technology and hardwar e provides environmental control of the spacecraft's habitable volume by removing metabolically produced CO 2, a requirement of all human spaceflight missions, and minimizing losses of ullage air and humidity. This payload is capable of removing the amount of CO 2 produced by 6 crew members and so is directly applicable to the ISS. Because of air save and water save, it is also applicable for longer- duration human spaceflight missions. R ESULTS Data is still being collected from this investigation, and analy sis is ongoing.

The experiment tests the accuracy and reliability of this technology as a potential next - genera tion atmosphere trace -gas monitoring system for the station. E ARTH BENEFITS ANITA provides an improved multi- component gas measuremen t system for various purposes, such as workplace monitoring (including airplanes and submarines), environmental monitoring, and control of industrial processes. S PACE BENEFITS ANITA will lead to new atmospheric monitoring systems for future spaceflight. R ESULTS ANITA was a flight experiment precursor for a permanent continuous air quality monitoring system on the ISS, developed to help ensure crew health and safety. Because ANITA was an experimental system, ANITA's air analyses were compared to results fr om other sources of analyses, including archival samples captured in grab sample containers and analyzed on ground, and real- time instruments aboard ISS, such as the Volatile Organic Analyzer and the Carbon Dioxide Monitor. For the first time, many gases in the ISS air were measured with high - time resolution. The observed results showed effects from spacecraft visits to the ISS, crew activities, the number of crew members present, and the functioning of the air revitalization systems. Of the 13 gas compounds quantified by ANITA and the 12 gases detected and quantified by the archival samplers, only 4 were in common. ANITA measurements of carbon ISS015E29193 - Expedition 15 Flight Engineer Clayton Anderson beside the ANITA equipment in the US Laboratory/Destiny. 848 dioxide, methanol, ethanol, and perfluoro propane (PFP) were in close agreement with grab sample readings. After extensive cross -checking and analyses, ANITA's estimates for carbon monoxide, methane, and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) showed from small to large differences from the grab sample analyses; however, the origin of these differences are unknown. Freon 11 and Halon 1301 were both measured at low levels by ANITA and the grab samples but with higher values from ANITA. Designed to detect and quantify 33 gas compounds in the air, ANITA's first measurements on ISS gave warnings for gas compounds the system was not calibrated for since significant concentrations were not expected. The previously unknown presence of the gas SF 6, a chemical used in certain medical investigations, was discovered by ANITA in the ISS atmosphere. ANITA also detected a leak of Freon 218, also known as PFP, from the Russian air conditioner and was used to monitor the timeline of PFP concentrations in relation to Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) operations and shuttle docking. The ANITA data helped to determine that the zeolite bed in the CDRA was not effective in scrubbing the PFP leak from the air, but that dilution of the ISS air after shuttle docking did substantially reduce the level of PFP. Prior to ANITA, PFP levels in the ISS atmosphere had only been estimated (Honne 2008, 2009, 2011; Stuffler 2009). P K, Mosebach H, Kampf D.

Ryan, PhD, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The JPL Electronic Nose (ENose) is a full -time, continuously operating event monitor designed to detect air contamination from spills and leaks in the crew habitat in the International Space Station (ISS). It fills the long -standing gap between onboard alarms and complex analytical instruments. ENose provides rapid, early identification and quantification of atmospheric changes caused by chemicals to which it has been trained. ENose can also be used to monitor cleanup process es after a leak or a spill. E ARTH BENEFITS Many important and diverse Earth - based applications exist for ENose technology. One major driver is the current need for advanced detection devices for security (both civilian and military) and health safety applications, such as the detection of explosives and infection monitoring. This technology can also be integrated with other devices, suc h as analytical instruments and environmental monitoring and control systems, to monitor enclosed environments. S PACE BENEFITS The ENose is envisioned to be one part of a distributed system for automated monitoring and control of the breathing atmosphere in inhabited spacecraft in microgravity. It is designed as an event or incident monitor, capable of providing rapid, early identification and quantification of changes in the atmosphere caused by leaks or spills of compounds targeted by the device. The flexibility of the device includes the ability to be programmed to detect new compounds, the possibility of providing sens or sets for particular analyte suites, and a wide dynamic range from fractional parts per million (ppm) to 10, 000 ppm, making ENose a valuable part of an air quality Images of JPL Electronic Nose taken during testing with Express Rack 7 at the SPACEHAB Payload Processing Facility. Expedition 34 Flight Engineer (FE) Roman Romanenko working with the ENose and Nose Target Book hardware in the Service Modul e (SM). 851 monitoring and control system comprised of several types of instruments. Such a system can be included in an environmental control system, which actuates remediation of anomalous events. RESULTS Analysis of ENose monitoring data showed regular, periodic rise and fall of humidity. Occasional releases of Freon 218 (Perfluoropropane), used in ISS cooling systems, were detected by ENose and the Analyzing Interferometer for Ambient Air (ANITA) payload, another air quality monitoring instrument. Formaldehyde, which is not detectable by any other instrument in the US Lab, was frequently detected by EN ose at low concentrations and may result from off - gassing of polymeric seals or o -rings heated by operating equipment. Similarly, the presence of methanol was detected by ENose but could not be correlated to any specific activities aboard. ENose and ANITA detected the unexpected presence of sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6). Sulfur hexafluoride was not on the JPL ENose target list of compounds, so it was reported as an \"unknown\" event for the in- flight analysis. In postflight, based on sensor response modeling inputs and experimental verification, it was determined these unknown events could be related to SF 6 (Shevade 2010). Each detected event lasted from 20 to 100 minutes, which is consistent with the air replacement time in the US Lab (Ryan 2009, 2010a).

E ARTH BENEFITS Many important and diverse Earth -based applications exist for E -Nose technology, including the current need for advanced detection devices for security (both civilian and military) and health safety applications, such as the detection of explosives and infection monitoring. S PACE BENEFITS The Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) E -Nose is envisioned to be one part of a distributed system for automated monitoring and control of the breathing atmosphere in inhabi ted spacecraft in microgravity. Such a system can be included in an environmental control system, which actuates remediation of anomalous events. R ESULTS Onboard tests of the prototype included a simple experiment aimed at measuring the air in the close e nvironment of the instrument. This verified functionality and sensor stability in the experimental sessions with the device in different positions. During the 3 runs, the temperature remained in the range of 21 -26\u00b0C and the relative humidity between 65% and 85%. The temperature of the sensors chamber was maintained in the range of 25 -29\u00b0C. In each run the sampling tube was moved around in a circular path sampling the air. As temperatures varied slowly and little in absolute value, this did not influence the responses of the sensors. The presence of a unique cluster of data indicated a substantial constancy of the air quality during the 3 runs and the same good reproducibility of the \"ground version\" electronic nose. This is because the in -orbit prototype differs from the \"ground version\" of the instrument only for the packaging and the electronic circuit design. Functionality and sensors are the same for both prototypes. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication.

E ARTH BENEFITS Earth -base d applications include the detection of dangerous gases emitted from substances like pesticides, paints, glues, and other hazardous building materials. S PACE BENEFITS The ability to monitor the International Space Station (ISS) air quality provides the o pportunity to improve the ISS cabin air conditions and to identify potential real -time anomalies that may occur in the ISS air quality. R ESULTS The I -ENOSE experiment was performed on ISS in May 2011. No anomalies in air quality were observed. However, an alysis of I -ENOSE data showed that responses of the I -ENOSE sensors could be correlated to certain crew activities performed in close proximity to the sensors. Analysis of data are complete and results are pending publication. P UBLICATION (S) Martinelli E, Pennazza G, Sintonico M, et al.

Wainwright, PhD, Charles River Laboratories, Charleston, South Carolina RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Lab-on-a-Chip Application Development - Portable Test System (LOCAD -PTS) is a handheld device used for rapid detection of biological and chemical substances on surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Astronauts swab surfaces with a specialized swabbing unit, which dissolves the sample in water and dispenses it into the LOCAD- PTS. Within 15 minutes, results are displayed on the screen. The study's purpose is to effectively provide a rapid indication of biological cleanliness to help crew monitor microorganisms in the ISS cabin environment. E ARTH BENEF ITS Currently, the technology is being used to assess fluids used in pharmaceutical processing. The technology has been used to swab the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER), for planetary protection, and to assess microbial contamination in the NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) project. This technology will provide quick medical diagnostics in clinical applications. It will also provide environmental testing capabilities that may serve homeland security. S PACE BENEFITS This commercial, off -the-shelf technology is applicable in many areas related to microbial detection, crew health diagnostics, and environmental monitoring. The drastic reduction in time for detection (minutes versus days) will provide a capability on ISS that does not cur rently exist and may help risk mitigation in the event that some type of microbial build -up is observed. Eventually, it is planned that LOCAD -PTS be used to assess water, air, and food supplies in addition to surfaces. Other cartridges are being developed to perform limited crew health diagnostics and monitor other biological molecules, such as protein and peptidoglycan, and specific chemicals that pose a potential hazard to the crew, such as hydrazine and ammonia. Astronaut Suni Williams, Expedition 14 flight engineer, works with the LOCAD -PTS. Williams is placing the sample mixed with water from the swabbing unit into the LOCAD -PTS cartridge. 856 RESULTS The testing of ISS cabin surfaces occurred in 2 phases using various combinations of Contact Slides and LOCAD -PTS with Gram -negative bacteria (LAL), fungi (beta- glucan), and Gram - positive bacteria (LTA) cartridges. The first phase involved extensive swabbing and sampling of limited sites with both cartridges and contact slides (like Petri dishes). When LAL cartridges were used with contact slides, low levels of endotoxin were found at 5 sites with the cartridges and at 3 sites with the contact slides. When beta - glucan and LTA cartridges were used with contact slides, low levels of fungi were detected on the beta -glucan cartridges, no bacteria or fungi colonies grew on the contact slides, and very low levels of endotoxin were on the LTA cartridges. The very low values were expected because the cartridges produced for this study had a lower sensitivity to its targeted microbial cells than the other 2 cartridges. The results for this phase were not expected to correlate because the cartridges measure the presence of both live and dead microbes, and the slides measure live microorganisms; more so, re sults were expected to generate a bigger picture of microorganisms present at different sites. The second phase involved a single swab using cartridges only of various crew -selected sites expected to have high microbial growth. Moderate to high levels of e ndotoxin were observed at sites mostly associated with exercise, hygiene and dining facilities, where microbial nutrients such as sweat, food remnants, and water were generally present. A surprising observation from both phases was that endotoxin was distr ibuted throughout the ISS, despite previous indications that most bacteria on ISS surfaces were Gram- positive. Lastly, parallel analysis of at least 1 site with all 3 cartridges and contact slides was performed. Although the values from all 3 cartridges we re different from each other, the majority of the results were still low or very low. Analysis of all the data collected from the LOCAD -PTS experiments showed 31 samples had low or absent levels of endotoxin, and 11 samples had moderate to high levels at s ites with frequent crew contact, demonstrating that most surfaces on the ISS are relatively free of microbial molecules (Maule 2009; Morris 2012).

Maule, PhD, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, DC RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Lab-on-a-Chip Application Development - Portable Test System - Exploration (LOCAD - PTS-Exploration) is a handheld device for rapid detection and quantification of biological substances aboard the International Space Station (ISS). LOCAD - PTS-Exploration tested procedures aboard the ISS that will ultimately support scientific activities during the human exploration of other planets. For the first time, external surfaces of a spacecraft were sampled for biological material during extra -vehicular activity (EVA or spacewalk), followed by analysis within the cabin environment. E ARTH BENEFITS The procedures used in this study to detect biological material in the hostile environment of space have many other applications for similar tests performed in extreme environments on Earth. These include the investigation of hyperthermophiles (organism that thrives in extremely hot environments from 60\u00b0C and higher) in active volcanic craters and fumeroles (opening in Earth's crust that emits steam and gases such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrochloric acid, and hydrogen sulfide); the detection of lethal viral outbreaks; the exploration of deep sea flora and fauna by deep divers on the ocean floor; and the evaluation of biological attacks in a military or civilian situation. S PACE BENEFITS The extent to which human space exploration transfers biological material to other planets is currently unknown. T he data obtained with LOCAD- PTS-Exploration serves as a foundation for planetary protection procedures that will be performed during future human exploration of other planets. Lab-on-a-Chip Application Development -Portable Test System -Exploration principal investigator Jake Maule swabs a handrail of the S6 Truss. 859 RESULTS LOCAD -PTS analysis of 15 sites on the S6 Truss prior to launch detected no endotoxin at any test site. However, the fungal marker glucan was found at some sites, especially on gap spanners (fabric straps that span the gap between handrails to assist movement of extra -vehicular crew). After the launch and installation of the S6 Truss on ISS, swabs were performed on the right -hand gloves of both EVA suit s before and after the first spacewalk. LOCAD -PTS analysis showed that the absolute level of glucan on the spacesuit gloves was low, especially when compared with other surfaces within the station. Interestingly, there was a 50% decrease in glucan on the g loves from pre - EVA to post -EVA, despite the EV crew's contact with many sites on the S6 Truss that tested high for glucan preflight. This might be because of glucan on the S6 Truss being destroyed after a few days in space and to glucan on the spacesuit gl ove (detected pre -EVA) detaching during a spacewalk. These insights will help design contamination control strategies for the human exploration of other planets. P UBLICATION (S) Eigenbrode J, Benning LG, Maule JG, Wainwright NR, Steele A, Amundsen HE.

SATS is achieving this by developing software called Interact, which allows a single, ground -based operator to command a team of remote nanosatellites working on a common mission. E ARTH BENEFITS The research performed under SATS applies to a broad range of remote autonomous robotic agents, such as remote underwater vehicles and remote ground vehicles operating in hazardous conditions. S PACE BENEFITS Results from SATS, specifically the In teract software, enable a more efficient method of controlling a group of nanosatellites that can be tasked to perform services such as satellite servicing, spacecraft assembly, and emergency repairs. R ESULTS Data collection for SATS -Interact is ongoing. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication. 861 EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF THE POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT OF MICROSCOPIC DETERIORATION OF ISS RS MODULE STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS WHEN IMPACTED BY THE COMPONENTS OF THE STATION 'S EXTERNA L ATMOSPHERE AND CONDITIONS PROMOTING THE LIFE OF MICROFLORA ON PRESSURE HULL SURFACES UNDER MLI (TEST) Research Area: Air, Water, and Surface Monitoring Expedition(s): 25, 26 and 29- ongoing Principal Investigator(s): Oleg A. Saprykin, PhD, Central Research Institute for Machine Building, Korolev, Russia Elena V. Shubralova, Central Research Institute for Machine Building, Korolev, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Experimental Studies of the Possible Development of Microscopic Deterioration of ISS RS Module Structural Elements when Impacted by the Components of the Station's External Atmosphere and Conditions Promoting the Life of Microflora on Pressure Hull Surface s under MLI (Test) examines the chemical, toxicological, and microbiological samples taken from the exterior surface of the pressure hull on and underneath MLI in deposition areas of corrosive life support system products and components of the station's external atmosphere. S PACE BENEFITS Information obtained on anomalous processes that reduce the life specifications of pressure hulls will be applied to spacecraft with extended lifetimes and high autonomy, such as a system for a mission to Mars or on the surface of the moon or Mars. R ESULTS Viable spore -forming Bacillus licheniformis bacteria was discovered in a sample taken near a Vozdukh system valve. This demonstrates that on a space station using a system that vents out air environment components after cleaning it, microorganisms contained in the living compartment air can be tran sferred to the surface of the station. This important factor should be taken into consideration when conducting planetary quarantine measures in Martian and other far- away missions. The experiment enabled direct proof confirming that viable spores of micro organisms, whose resilience to unfavorable environmental factors is extremely high, and can be present on the exteriors of unmanned and manned space stations.

Experience in monitoring the ISS environment provides a new understanding of the closed environment and will be applied to operations of future spacecraft and long -duration human exploration missions. E ARTH BENEFITS Instruments larger than VCAM monitor the air in enclosed systems on Earth, such as onboard submarines. Small portable units are used in the field to monitor the environment. S PACE BENEFITS VCAM will protect crew members by informing them of the slow buildup of potentially harmful chemicals in their breathing air. While VCAM's library contains species that are known to be present in the various life -support systems, VCAM can provide data that allow ground scientists to identify compounds that were not expected. These same functions of detection, identification, and quantification can be used in the event of a chemical spill or release. R ESULTS VCAM's performance was sufficient to detect and identify 90% of the target compounds at their 180- day Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentration levels. About 1 month into operations, VCAM suffered a mass spectrometer heater failure. VCAM was recalibrated to operate without the heater and returned to nominal operations after a patch cable, delivered on STS -134/ULF6, was installed to power a backup heater. VCAM and Grab Sample Container (GSC) analytical results were in good agreement for 10 compounds: not 6 compounds (1 2 -butanone, 2 -propanol, ethyl acetate, hexamethylcyclotrisilazane, and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) prior to the heater View of VCAM during gas supply change -out during Expedition 30. 864 repair, post repair measurements of these compounds by VCAM and GSC yielded concentrations at least 20 times less than VCAM requirements. VCAM also did not report any \"false positives\" for the 17 chemicals detected by GSC measurements that were below the quantification limit of 0.05 mg/m 3. Measurements of the compound perfluoropropane showed only fair agre ement between VCAM and GSC data. VCAM also detected a large number of unknown chemical species not part of the original VCAM requirements list, which were later identified during ground analysis. Additionally, VCAM performed autonomous measurements of the major constituents of the ISS atmosphere. VCAM's measurements of N 2 and O 2 were in excellent agreement with measurements taken by the Major Constituents Analyzer (MCA) of the same constituents. CO 2 measurements were in agreement as well through February 2011, but thereafter, VCAM measurements diverged and the instrument error increased, likely because of instrument contamination (Darrach 2011, 2012).

The DTN program establishes a long -term, readily accessible communication test -bed aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Two Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA), CGBA- 4 and CGBA -5, serve as communications test computers that transmit messages between the ISS and ground Mission Control Centers. All data is monitored and controlled at the BioServe remot e Payload Operations Control Center (POCC) located on the Engineering Center premises at the University of Colorado - Boulder. E ARTH BENEFITS DTN Earth -based applications include sensor networks, mobile devices, use of data mules, and military communications that involve stressed, disconnected, and disrupted networks. S PACE BENEFITS For Exploration, DTN enables network communications using multiple communication assets and network paths that increases the robustness of the communication network. DTN also improves the timeliness of data return from operating spacecraft, which reduces risk, reduces cost, increases crew safety, improves operational awareness, and improves science return. Expedition 28 Flight Engineer Ron Garan is seen during periodic servicing of the CGBA -5 with its CSI (Science Insert). 866 RESULTS The first experiment, which occurred on July 10, 2009, involved downlinking images of a previous CGBA- 5 experiment over a planned Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) handover, during which the space -to-ground and ground- to-space links were interrupted for several minutes. The CBGA -5, which had no feedback regarding the state of the space -to- ground link, responded to the disruption as designed, by custodial retransmission of the data after a configurable timeout. This initial deployment of the DTN -on-ISS network demo nstrated the success of the bundle protocol in handling disruptions. The next test involved using DTN for unattended operations. The CGBA -5 downlinked its status telemetry files via the non - DTN transmit -in-the-blind configuration as well as via a DTN confi guration. During a 3 -day period in which 14 files were generated per hour, the non- DTN scheme resulted in an average of 3 504 redundant receptions per file. The DTN scheme performed much better at an average of 0.06 redundant receptions per file. During the next phase of investigation, the DTN -on-ISS network will be extended to include a second payload, CGBA -4, which will expand the network to 2 space nodes and 2 ground nodes and enable experimentation with cross -node routing and 1 -way custody transfer (Jenkins 2010).

The EST is a technology demo nstrator validating an electronic high - density power system, new generation batteries, advanced calculus devices for real - time computing, programmable and re - programmable devices for microsatellite and picosatellite subsystems and different kinds of sensor s typically found aboard spacecraft. R ESULTS The experiment results were very positive as no failures of the commercial components were recorded during the mission. No failures were logged by the Italian astronaut Roberto Vittori during the 10 days aboard mission (Soyuz 10S/Soyuz 9S exchange), and all the scheduled data were recorded by EST components. Once back on ground, the EST stored data were analyzed and verified the success of the experiment. P UBLICATION (S) Fortezza R, Pontetti G, Martinelli E, Lo Castro F, Di Natale C, D'Amico A.

E ARTH BENEFITS The STELLA software simplifies payload development for the ISS by providing an off- the- shelf software interface between the payload and the ExPRESS rack. S PACE BENEFITS STELLA integrates with payload flight and ground software to correctly format and package commands and data for uplink from the ground to ISS and telemetry from a payload for downlink from ISS to the ground. R ESULTS There are no published results at this time. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. For flight operations, Ethernet data transmitted via standard protocols are transparently redirected by STELLA through the NASA systems so the i n- orbit \"Controller Computer\" and ground-based \"Manager Computer\" operate unchanged, as if the experiment software is still operating in the ground laboratory. 869 DETERMINING AND ANALYZING THE MAGNETIC INTERFERENCE ON THE ISS (ISKAZHENIYE ) Research Area: Technical Research and Experimentation Expedition(s): 1-9 Principal Investigator(s): Mikhail Y. Belyaev, PhD, S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, Korolev, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Determing and Analyzing the Magnetic Interference on the ISS (Iskazheniye) investigation determines and analyzes the magnetic interference on the ISS to improve the accuracy of determining orientation using magnetic measurements sensors and to support the high- quality analysis of scientific experiments, in which Earth's magnetic field (EFM) is used, or accounted for. SPACE BENEFITS The mathematical model created and updated based on the ISS magnetic interference data obtained in the Iskazheniye experiment during various equipment operati ng modes will make it possible, in the stage of nominal station operations, with an accuracy acceptable for flight control, to adjust station orientation using sensors that require minimal energy consumption. In addition, this model will make it possible n ot only to account for the impact of interference on some scientific research devices, but also to support optimal planning of operations with them. The results of this space experiment may be used to design and control other spacecraft and to conduct rese arch on them. R ESULTS During Iskazheniye , information was obtained on the actual magnetic interference during the operation of station service and scientific equipment, and the contribution of ISS RS systems and equipment to the distortion of magnetometer readings with regards to orientation errors was determined. Location of magnetometers on the Service Module of the ISS RS. Roscosmos image. 870 Based on the experiment results, mathematical models were developed that describe the magnetic interference occurring on the ISS in flight, the Earth's magnetic field , and methods for processing the obtained measurements [data] accounting for disturbances from magnetically hard materials, magnetically soft materials, and current loops. Based on the obtained data, the mathematical model was created and updated to account for the ISS own magnetic field during various operating modes of its equipment and systems, which facilitated the increase of the station orientation control accuracy. To date, based on the considerations of the ISS own magnetic field, according to specially developed methods and mathematical models for the current station configuration, the accuracy of orientation control using magnetometers was increased from 14 - 12\u00b0 to 2 - 1.5\u00b0 (according to the results of periodical updates of the deviation vector, which increases as the asse mbly of the ISS goes forward). Therefore , the results obtained in the Iskazheniye provide additional capabilities for solving flight control issues, experiment planning, and analysis of obtained research results. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. 871 SERIAL NETWORK FLOW MONITOR (SNFM) Research Area: Avionics and Software Expedition(s): 9-ongoing Principal Investigator(s): Carl Konkel, The Boeing Company, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Serial Network Flow Monitor (SNFM), using a commercial software CD, monitors the payload local area network (LAN) to analyze and troubleshoot LAN data traffic. Validating LAN traffic models allows for faster and more reliable computer networks to sustain systems and science on future space missions. E ARTH BENEFITS Locating and correcting computer network problems alleviates data downlinking issues, which allows scientists on the ground to receive data from their experiments. S PACE BENEFITS SNFM extends International Space Station (ISS) accommodations to sub - rack payloads, provides a set of standard interfaces and resources for sub-rack payloads, supports the simultaneous and independent operations of multiple payloads within the rack, and accommodates multiple science disciplines. This information will allow monitoring and improvement in the data transfer capabilities of in -orbit computer networks. R ESULTS Data analys is is ongoing. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication. Computer screen capture image provides a graphic example of network load monitoring. 872 PRELIMINARY ADVANCED COLLOIDS EXPERIMENT (PACE), THREE INVESTIGATIONS Research Area: Characterizing Experiment Hardware Expedition(s): 25-30 Principal Investigator(s): William V. Meyer, PhD, NASA's Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio Jacob N. Cohen, PhD, NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California Paul M. Chaikin, PhD, New York University, New York, New York RESEA RCH OBJECTIVES Preliminary Advanced Colloids Experiment (PACE) is a technology demonstration that sets the stage for the Advanced Colloid Experiment (ACE) by testing the Light Microscopy Module (LMM) in the International Space Station (ISS) environment. PACE 100X OIL TEST TARGET (MEYER) PACE 100X Oil Test Target establishes the capabilities of the LMM that are used for high resolution image magnification in ACE. PACE -2 3D PARTICLE TEST (COHEN AND CHAIKIN ) PACE -2 characterizes the resolution of the high -magnification colloid experiments with the LMM to determine the minimum size of the particles that can be resolved by ACE. There is a direct relationship between magnification, particle size, test duration, and in- orbit vibration that is quantified. PACE -LMM- B IO (COHEN ) PACE -LMM -Bio is a NASA Rapid Turn Around (RTA) engineering proof -of-concept proposal in preparation for ACE. In Bio, crew members image 3 -D biological sample particles, tissue samples, and live organisms. The goal of this experiment is to indicate the microscope's capabilities for viewing biological specimens. E ARTH BENEFITS The PACE investigations set the groundwork for ACE, which will provide data that can advance the understanding of phase separation (eg, shelf- life, product collaps e) and how it competes with crystallization to impact production (eg, when making plastics). A better understanding of Expedition 29 commander Mike Fossum works on the Fluids Integrated Rack/Fluids and Combustion Facility, conducting a session with Preliminary Advanced Colloids Experiment. Fossum is working at the Light Microscopy Modul e in the U.S. Laboratory Destiny. 873 crystallization and phase -change processes could have an enormous commercial impact in a wide variety of industries. PACE -LMM -Bio may exp and our understanding of the effects of the space environment on biological systems. Since all life evolved under the effects of gravity, the absence of gravity may identify novel pathways that are important for a fundamental understanding of life's basic processes on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS The knowledge from the PACE investigations serve as preparation for the experimentation in ACE, which will fly samp les of colloid systems that serve as larger scale models of atomic systems. These samples are used to model the factors that influence phase changes. Researchers anticipate these experiments will have a significant impact upon our understanding of fundamental physics as it pertains to how matter transitions from solid to liquid to gas. An immediate space application for this technology demonstration is in extending the shelf life of consumables on future long -duration missions. PACE -LMM -Bio improves the ability to analyze the effects of microgravity on biological systems. The ability to analyze samples on ISS also removes the effects of return on samples and may eliminate the need for sample return altogether. R ESULTS There are no published results at this time. This investigation is complete, and results are pending publication.

An atomic clock is a precision clock that depends on an electrical oscillation r egulated by the natural vibration frequencies of an atomic system. Atomic clocks are the most accurate time keepers in the world. E ARTH BENEFITS DOD SPHERES -CSAC results may aid in the development of small -scale inertial navigation systems (INS) for use on vehicles such as ships, aircraft, and submarines. S PACE BENEFITS The development of Chip- Scale Atomic Clock enables ultra-miniaturized (wristwatch in size) and ultra -low power time and frequency references for high -security, ultra -high frequency (UHF) communication and jam- resistant global positioni ng system (GPS) receivers. The use of these ultra -miniature time reference units could greatly improve the mobility and robustness of any system and platform with sophisticated UHF communication and/or navigation requirements. Results from DOD SPHERES -CSAC may also help in the development of small -scale INS for use on small satellites (mass 1 -10 kg). R ESULTS There are no published results at this time. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. Front view of DOD SPHERES -CSAC Reference Clock. The goal of the CSAC program is to create ultra- miniaturized, low -power, atomic time and frequency reference units.

The objective is to measure and verify in low-Earth orb it, the GPS and EGNOS signals, which will be used in the combined GPS/EGNOS navigation system for spacecraft control and guidance. R ESULTS The experiment exploited the EGNOS signals with the use of a space -borne Global Navigation Satellite System receive r developed by Thales Alenia Space in 1999. This verified the performance of the GPS/EGNOS receiver aboard the Soyuz spacecraft and compared results from the combined receiver during different phases of the mission with equivalent data received from the sp acecraft and the International Space Station (ISS). All the analyses conducted up to now make it possible to confirm that the ENEIDE experiment was carried out successfully. Being based on a new instrument concept of integrated GPS/EGNOS -WAAS tracking, the possibilities of real -time use of this instrument for critical space operations in which safety is a critical component have been addressed. ENEIDE provided a benchmark for the validation of the TAS -I receivers of LAGRANGE class. The different environmental conditions in which the receiver operated (sun -pointing attitude, orbital attitude, peculiar antenna pointing constraints, etc) make the experiment an important laboratory for different applications like attitude analyses, atmospheric sounding, space weather, real -time navigation and control. In detail, the set -up (receiver + laptop) worked properly and tracking of the WAAS- EGNOS satellites allowed the download of the full GEO navigation message. The tracking of L1 and L2 frequencies proved to be efficient according to the expectation of the predicted link -budget.

The secondary objective is to transmit environmental data such as vibration, acoustic noise, and temperature of the computer in ord er to analyze the computer reliability. R ESULTS The ERNOBox was installed in March 2008 and ran successfully during the planned 6 months, sending its telemetry regularly. In order to correct a software failure and prepare for its future role as data relay hardware for the Vessel Identification System experiment, a new software version had to be loaded. However, the ERNObox suffered a hardware failure, which following analysis, pointed to a defective memory chip, a manufacturer design flaw. The ERNOBox was returned to Earth on shuttle mission STS -127, repaired, and the new software was installed. The refurbished hardware was returned to the International Space Station on STS -132 in May 2010 and activated in Columbus in May 20 10. The research is currently ongoing as part of the Vessel ID System. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication. The ERN OBox.

In addition, the GTS data services, based on a unique coding scheme, could ultimately lead to commercial services, such as blocking of stolen cars or lost credit cards, directly from space. R ESULTS Testing showed a lower than expected signal strength traced to interference from the hull of the Russian Service Module on which the GTS antenna was launched to the ISS, as well as additional field of view blockage from the Pirs Docking Module and its atta ched Soyuz spacecraft (not originally scheduled to be at the ISS during the GTS testing). This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication. Location of the Global Transmission Services antenna and Electronics Units .

Sumerin, Research and Production Corporation Systems of Precision Instrumentation, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Testing of the Laser Communications System for Transferring Large Data Files from ISS RS Hardware, or Laser Communications System (SLS), is a prospective new direction for space communications systems with the development of systems based on transferring i nformation using a laser channel. In the future, such systems could support a large throughput while consuming less energy and have smaller dimensions and mass of transmit/receive equipment than is currently used by radio communications systems. SPACE BENEFITS Successful tests of the onboard laser communications ter minal hardware on the International Space Station (ISS) and a demonstration of the receiving -transmitting technology for transferring information using the space laser communications line will allow us to begin the actual implementation of laser communicat ions technologies in space lines used for information transfer. The use of laser communication links between spacecraft will allow us to decrease the mass, dimensions, and energy consumption as compared to the existing options of its design when using radio channels. RESULTS During testing, it was possible to demonstrate the capability of the systems to operate in scattered cloud conditions, both through the clouds (in low density) and with interruptions in communications while passing through high -density clouds. The first se ssion with the transfer of target information (test -image) with a speed of 125 Mb/s took place on October 2, 2012. The test-image was being transmitted continuously throughout the cycle, which allowed for quasi- quantitatively assessing the changes in the q uality of the line based on the noise level of the incoming images. The total volume of information transmitted was 2.6 GB. The amount of useful data transmitted was 732 MB. The largest unit received with no errors was 38 998 937 Examples of the transmitted digital images that were obtained by the ISS RS crewmembers earlier during Earth observation experiments and the shooting of onboard operations. Roscosmos image. 880 bytes. The probability of error varied between 3.2 x 10-9 and 3 x 10-3 depending on the distance between the ground laser terminal and the ISS. This experiment is ongoing. To date, over 100 test sessions were performed, with the accumulation and processing of statistical data.

Belyaev, PhD, S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, Korolev, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Study of a High- Precision System for Predicting ISS Motion (Vektor -T) verifies the International Space Station (ISS) motion prediction methodology that has been developed for improving the ISS motion determination and prediction accuracy as compared to the nominal orbital determination and prediction system currently in operation. To accomplish this task Vektor -T utilizes navigational measurements of ISS motion using both the ground tracking station radar systems and the Global Position System (GPS) and GLONASS navigation satellite system receivers. S PACE BENEFITS As a res ult of the Vektor -T experiment, a pilot high -precision system for predicting the ISS motion will be developed. Operating this system will improve the ISS motion determination accuracy and will provide precise navigational correlation for the results of the experimental and research activities performed on the ISS, as well as for other station flight control tasks. RESULTS The phase of development testing of navigation satellite data processing methodologies to address ISS motion determination tasks has currently been completed, and work has begun on the task of configuring a high- precision system for predicting the ISS motion using the following as a basis: the developed models of perturbations impacting the ISS; the motion determination and prediction meth odologies; and the experimentally refined ISS motion prediction model parameters.

Olsen, Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, Kjeller, Norway RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Vessel Identification System is testing the means to track global maritime traffic from space by picking up signals from standard Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders carried by all international ships over 300 tons, cargo vessels over 500 tons, and all types of passenger carriers. Meanwhile various service entities have been asking to get access to the Vessel ID data, which is continuously acquired on the Columbus module. E ARTH BENEFITS Data from this ship -monitoring device could be combined with data from satellites to provide better surveillance of ships at sea. Current AIS technology is only designed to monitor vessels in coastal waters, but the Vessel Identification System will incorporate ships in open waters. S PACE BENEFITS The Vessel ID System tests a new mechanism that can be used to install small passive experimental payloads on the International Space Station's exterior. The Grappling Adaptor to On-Orbit Railing (GATOR) could attach small payloads to International Space Station handrails, Positions of all ships being tracked by Norwegian Automatic Identification System using their Automatic Identification System transmissions a s of mid -November 2010.

This would provide an additional space on the station to conduct passive experiments or collect data. R ESULTS The 2 operational phases with the NORAIS receiver, which was operated by FFI/Norway, have been extremely successful, with data telemetr y received by the Norwegian User Support Operations Center (N -USOC), in Trondheim, Norway, via ESA's Columbus Control Centre in Germany. Data has been received by NORAIS in almost continuous operation, and all modes of operation have worked extremely well. On a good day, approximately 400, 000 ship position reports were received from more than 22, 000 different ship identification numbers (Maritime Mobile Service Identity, or MMSI). The in -orbit data of the NORAIS Receiver v18 has been analyzed since and show very good results. As of March 2013, the Vessel Identification System acquired an extensive amount of data for nearly 3 years since its installation in and on Columbus. Meanwhile, various service entities have been asking to get access to the Vessel ID data, which is continuously acquired on Columbus.

SkinCare was designed to examine these changes and use the data collected to create a model for skin aging. This model can be used to create countermeasures to protect skin on Earth and in spa ce. RESULTS Apart from itching and dryness of the skin (possibly partly due to the special skin care being used in the ISS), a thinning of the skin and increased sensitivity combined with delayed healing of wounds and also an increased tendency to skin infections have been reported after a long stay in space. A pilot study, involving one subject, applied non-invasive skin testing methods before, during, and after a long -term mission using single measuring parameters of the skin and at the same time examined the effects of a skin protection cream. Tests concerning the skin hydration, trans -epidermal water loss, and elasticity states were carried out, and ultrasound measurement of the fine structure of the skin was also done. Measurements were made on predetermined different skin areas on both inner forearms with the right forearm being treated daily with a skin care emu lsion. The measurements in the ISS, performed by the trained crew member, were done in more or less stable environmental conditions throughout the measuring period. However, before and after measurements, done during the astronauts' stay in different countries showed that local environmental conditions can have extreme influence on the results. All skin elasticity parameters increased postflight, from different to normal ageing of the skin, which indicates a clear loss of elasticity. Elasticity measurements and especially the ultrasound images of the skin showed signs of a decrease of density of the skin fiber system. Epidermal measurements provided evidence of a thinning of the top skin layer and a prolonged molting time of the cells from the base layer tow ard the top. These results correlated with the reports from astronauts about the state of the skin during their stay in space. Comparison of the mean values of the hydration measurements before, during, and after the mission showed that there were only minor differences between the sides (right versus left). However, there was a clear hydration effect of the applied skin care emulsion. Treatment with the emulsion over the course of the mission led to an improvement The SkinCare Experiment is uploaded to the ISS during ESA's Astrolab Mission with German ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter. NASA/ESA image. 885 in the hydration of the outermost layer as well as in the barrier function (moisture retention) of the epidermis. Due to logistical and technical reasons and also because the measurements were carried out on only one subject, further tests with more test subjects, using optimized test conditions and additional measuring methods (eg, for the determination of capillary blood flow and oxygen saturation of hemoglobin) are necessary. This way, the general medical risks can be determined via skin physiological parameters and the side effects on the skin due to long -term stay in space can be minimized.

Urban, PhD, NASA's Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Dust Aerosol Measurement Feasibility Test (DAFT) releases particles in the International Space Station (ISS) atmosphere to test the ability of different equipment to measure the levels of dust and air quality. Accurate fire detection requires bei ng able to distinguish dust particles from soot particles and being able to detect smoke particles of the appropriate size. This experiment will provide the first systematic measurements of the sizes of particles in the air aboard ISS over time and prove t he usefulness of the P -Trak Ultrafine Particle Counter (a small handheld, commercial device). If successful, the detector will be used in the Smoke and Aerosol Measuring Experiment (SAME). E ARTH BENEFITS The smoke detectors developed from the results of this experiment can also be useful in other extreme environments on Earth, such as submarines or underwater laboratories. Accurate detection of smoke in these environments can save lives. S PACE BENEFITS Extended duration spaceflight missions with larger vessels will require fire detection systems with increased reliability and sensitivity. DAFT is the first step in the development of an Advance Fire Detection System for use on future space exploration missions. Additionally, the devices in this experiment can be used to provide more detailed information about the character of the particulate in the atmosphere aboard the ISS. Video screen shot of ISS Commander and Science Officer Leroy Chiao performing DAFT operations on station during Expeditio n 10. 887 RESULTS Preliminary DAFT results showed the P -Trak Ultrafine Particle Counter (a device that counts ultra -fine dust particles in a microgravity environment) could be successfully built into the Smoke and Aerosol Measurement Experiment (SAME) payload and established the optima l ranges for particle detection using this instrument. The data collected also indicate very low - particulate levels in the ISS environment relative to that previously measured on the space shuttle. This low particulate level was not surprising due to the s mall crew size on ISS (2 or 3 vs 7 on space shuttle) and the High -Efficiency Particular Accumulator (HEPA) filtration system on ISS. The particulate level was expected to rise with the larger ISS 6 person crew. In later experiment runs, DAFT showed the ave rage size of the particles was larger on orbit than on Earth. These results could be due to the inefficiency of the large particle filter. Once the average particulate level throughout ISS is known, it can be used to design future smoke detectors that accurately distinguish normal dust from the presence of dangerous smoke particles. A series of events (malfunction of the electronic data transmitted, crew time limits, and an alcohol wick that did not open) shortened the overall experiment, but adequate data was collected to label the demonstration successful (Urban 2005).

The Food Tray in Space experiment was demonstrating that food items, produced from high -quality products, are tasty and nutritious and don't lose their quality under spaceflight conditions. R ESULTS As part of the experiment, ESA astronaut Roberto Vittori completed a feedback form, which covered 3 questions: 1) Did the products change characteristics (smell, taste, consistency)? 2) Would you change anything in the food tray (quantity, form and type)? 3) Would you include items on the ISS menu? While the first question provided no change in any characteristics of any of the food items, the nougat did prove too crumbly to be easily eaten in response to the second question. Preferences were also provided for the final question. This investigation is com plete; however additional results are pending publication. Food items from the Food Tray in Space experiment.

Van Erp, TNO Human Factors, Soesterberg, Netherlands RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The goal of the Tactile Display -aided Orientation Awareness ( SUIT) project is to support astronauts with a vibrotactile suit to help with orientation in space. The technology demonstration consists of a vest with 56 vibrating elements covering the torso of the astronaut. These elements provide cues to the astronaut of a given predefined \"downwards\" direction within the International Space Station (ISS) by vibrating in that direction. As the vibration of one of these elements is directly mapped to the astronaut's body position, this makes it a fast and intuitive way t o present spatial information. R ESULTS Data showed that spatial orientation in microgravity differs from that on Earth, possibly facilitating space motion sickness and degrading performance. It was found that artificial touch information in the form of a localized vibration on the torso that indicates downward direction can make orienting in microgravity faster, better, and easier. The importance of the artificial touch information seemed to increase over the initial 7 days of staying in microgravity while the weight of visual information decreased over the same period. The results underlined the capacity of the brain to adapt to unusual environments and to use and integrate artificial cues. The data showed that the support tool results in: a faster completion of the tasks; better task performance; and tasks being subjectively rated as easier than the control conditions in which the support tool was off. It is concluded that the support tool i s able to enlarge the astronaut's orientation awareness and that the experiment was both a successful proof -of-concept as well as a successful technology demonstration. The results also showed that, on average, the astronaut responded faster in microgravit y than on Earth. However, the experiment did reveal that the vest fit could be improved and the tool has more potential in challenging situations, as compared to daily operations. Spin- off to applications can be envisaged for pilots, divers, individuals with a visual or vestibular dysfunction, emergency services, and the automobile and sports industry.

R ESULTS The 3D Camera performed extremely well during its tests on the ISS, producing an extensive amount of high -quality three dimensional imagery of internal and external views of the ISS and Earth. This has been used as part of public outreach activities with images used as standalone products or embedded within three dimensional ISS simulators. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. ESA 3D Camera hardware.

The camera experiment compares the quality of file -based camcorders, as opposed to videotape recorders, and examines how well the camera's sensors perform in space. The video also provides a unique virtual view of the International Space Station (ISS) in 3 -D. E ARTH BENEFITS High -definition video in 3 -D provides a realistic representation of life on the ISS, which could be used for public outreach programs. S PACE BENEFITS The experiment compares the Panasonic camera's metal- oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensor to other charge -coupled device (CCD) cameras. Historically, cameras with CCD imaging sensors have been susceptible to radiation damage, resulting in damaged pixels noticeable as white d ots in the picture. Observing the frequency and decay rate of the MOS sensor allows the determination of whether a MOS -based camera provides a more robust spaceflight imaging system than a CCD -based camera. Additionally, file - based workflows allow more fle xibility for managing motion imagery and eliminate the need for returning tapes to Earth, thus lowering costs and increasing efficiency. This investigation is ongoing; however no publications are expected. 3DA1 Camcorder delivered to the ISS by shuttle flight STS - 135/ULF7. 893 ERASMUS RECORDING BINOCULAR (ERB) 14 Principal Investigator(s): Massimo Sabbatini, European Space Research and Technology Centre , Noordwijk, Netherlands RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Erasmus Recording Binocular (ERB) is a three -dimensional (3 -D) video camera that is used to take images of the environment aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The images are used to create an accurate map of the interior of the ISS. R ESULTS All images were received by mid -January 2007 in the Erasmus Centre and were made available at various venues all over Europe. The use of ERB resulted in the several conclusions. It was indeed possible to build a demonstrator with relatively reduced resources and prove the validity of the design for space. The ergonometry used proved successful, and astronauts appreciated the ERB unique feature of having onboard stereo viewing capa bilities. Radiation was of a transitory nature even though many Single Event Upset (SEU)s where visible. The SEU's were cleared and reset after a reboot of the system. The potential for outreach achieved by 3 -D images was very high, and all audiences fro m children to professionals have enjoyed them and found them very engaging. It was proven that the sense of presence in an environment not easily reachable is guaranteed even with low - resolution cameras. Astronauts found images useful in assessing the cons traints that an environment like the ISS poses to space payload designers and to the people that work in such conditions. This ambitious goal has not been achieved yet. The images of the whole ISS have been useful to visually map the ISS, but an accurate 3 -D model reconstruction is ambitious and began in 2009, in preparation of the high- resolution images coming from the succe ssor of ERB. The positive feedback received from the astronaut and from the all people who saw the stereo images encouraged the team to develop a new -generation ERB: the ERB2. Erasmus Recording Binocular (ERB) 3-D video camera for use in the ERB experi ment during Astrolab. The camera will be used to accurately map the interior of the International Space Station in its current configuration. These images will be used to improve the models available on the ground.

ERB -2 is an upgrade of the ERB device first tested on the ISS in 2006. This new -generation video camera offers improved resolution and sensitivity in low -light conditions as well as the possibility of 3 -D live streaming. EARTH BENEFITS These technologies are helping to feed into astronaut training programs and improving ISS simulators. S PACE BENEFITS Thre e-dimensional cameras proved a popular choice for astronauts to use during their free time in orbit; they act both as a central element of relaxation for astronauts while at the same time producing valuable imagery for use in education and promotion activ ities. R ESULTS Commissioning of ERB -2 was successfully finalized on September 10, 2010. Since then, ERB -2 has been successfully filming life and work on the International Space Station, which is proving very useful for education and promotion activities and stimulating the public's interest in space activities. On August 6, 2011, ERB -2 successfully undertook the first 3 -D live streaming from space, transmitted to ESA's Erasmus User Support and Operations Centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. The quality of the high- definition (HD) video material was very convincing. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication.

The Earth Viewing Camera forms part of an overall program of development and testing of imaging technologies for extreme environments. R ESULTS Following activation of the Earth Viewing Camera in orbit, the camera experienced some problems of overexposure and lack of resolution in pictures produced that could have been due to mis -alignment of the optics in the integration/launch phase, as well as an unpredictable data link p roblem. That being said, important data was gathered within the Earth Viewing Camera project that could help with the possible future development of external camera technologies. This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected. Second Image to be generated by the Earth Viewing Camera.

The HDTV image and audio that is transmitted to the ground by MPC is converted to HD- SDI signal, so that a HDTV monitor can display the signal through a commercial HDTV/HD -SDI Decoder in real time; the downlinked images are also able to be watched and edited by commercial software on personal computers. E ARTH BENEFIT The HDTV MPC represents a new way to transmit HDTV and Ethernet signals that record experimental data to be sent back to earth. S PACE BENEFIT This investigation is applied to new knowledge, and not specifically to advances in Space Exploration. R ESULTS In cooperation with NASA, the transmission to the ground of the HDTV image by MPC was successful in October of 2007. After that, MPC capability was evaluated in detail by NASA and became the standard system equipment of ISS. Furthermore, MPC was used during the repair mission of the Hubble space telescope mission, STS- 125, in 2009. From 2007 to the present, most of the HDTV images such as live -broadcast from ISS cabin, reports of ISS missions, and Earth observation images by astronauts, which are broadcas t on television and shown in science museums are transmitted to the ground through MPC. The MPC system continues to be used in order to transmit HDTV image of HDV Camcorder from ISS to the ground. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are p ending publication.

Image sensor samples are returned to the ground and analyzed for the relation between space radiation and the damage (hot pixel) on the image sensors. E ARTH BENEFIT New knowledge is expected to be the major benefit of this investigation. S PACE BENEFIT This new video recording technology can document future long -duration exploration missions. HDTV can provide improved imagery for spacecraft surveys while inflight. R ESULTS The HDTV in SM investigation showed that the number of hot pixels (image data caused by cosmic radiation hits) increases in proportion to the quantity of radiation. It was also observed that the number of hot pixels increases in proportion to the storage days in the ISS cabin. However, after the camera was returned to the ground, it was stored at room temperature, then the damage on CCD were recovered, and the hot pixels were shown to have decreased (Nagamatsu 2011).

It is a camera support for which position can be adjusted via 3 axes. The in- built tracking mechanism can be programmed with attitude and altitude data of the ISS so that it would follow any target point. E ARTH BENEFITS The imagery of the Earth at night has a large number of potential applications, from the original motivation to build NightPod, ie, taking images of cities at night to create a map of the distribution of the population, to mapping fishing activities, light pollution, and fires. S PACE BENEFITS Because a dedicated satellite is not foreseen in the near future, the most likely candidate suppliers of high -resolution, global, nocturnal imagery are the crew aboard the ISS. The NightPod device has been commissioned by ESA to assist the crew in such tasks: tracking visual targets on the Earth and neut ralizing the effect of ISS motion, allowing for an increase in exposure time, and therefore the quality of the nocturnal images. R ESULTS Photographing the Earth with the support of NightPod has resulted in very sharp high- definition photos of the planet's surface. The quality of photos far exceeded previous missions, and given the added clarity, comparisons of the imagery can start to be ma de over time. Possible scenarios include: cities at night, vegetation fires at night, visual analysis of maritime traffic/road traffic, volcano activity at night, urban pollution, squid fishing at night, day/night transitions. The system has been designed to be adaptable, and astronauts on the space station Top: NightPod tracking device situated in the Cupola Module on the International Space Station .

Graziani, University of Rome La Sapienza, Rome, Italy RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The objective of the Specular Point-like Quick Reference (SPQR) experiment is to evaluate the possibility of improving the resolution of ground -based telescopic imaging of manned spacecraft in orbit. The concept is to reduce image distortions due to atmospheric turbulence by evaluating the Point Spread Function (PSF) of a point -like light reference. This is provided by a laser beam emitted by the ground station and reflected back to the telescope by a Cube Corner Reflector (CCR) mounted on an International Space Station (ISS) window. R ESULTS The experiment was successfully performed from March to May 2005. A beam splitter installed on the 25 -inch telescope allowed the incoming light to be divided, filtered, and simultaneously imaged with 2 10 -bit high frame rate digital cameras. The first camera used a broad -band filter centered at 532 nm and provided an image of the spacecraft, which was distorted by atmospheric turbulence. The second camera used a notch filter at 532 nm and simultaneously provided a point spread function for processing of the broadband, visible light image. The broadband image was the one to be processed in order to achieve the best possible quali ty image of the spacecraft, while the narrow band picture was the one need to get the point spread function (PSF) from the laser beam reflection. The actual PSF had to be compared with the theoretical one (the one we would have if no atmosphere disturbance s were present). Therefore the distortion affecting the picture could be assessed, hence the deconvolution needed to process the rough image. The figure above shows the result of deconvolution for an ISS pass that occurred on May 3, 2005. On the left, an a tmospherically distorted image of the ISS is shown under optimal atmospheric conditions (very stable and clear) and nighttime imaging conditions. On the right is an image that has been obtained by superimposing several frames and deconvolving them with a P SF. It is important to note that no matter the perfect tracking and the excellent atmospheric conditions, the image quality without processing with the PSF would be poor. The SPQR experiment proved for the first time that a powerful laser could be fired to wards the ISS without problems for the astronauts or the attitude control sensors of the ISS. Furthermore, the use of the PSF and image Partially improved image of the International Space Station obtained using a bright feature as a point reference.

The SS -HDTV camera takes images of Earth at night capturing phenomena like auroras, meteor showers, etc., and broadcasting the images as a TV program. E ARTH BENEFIT SS-HDTV records the natural phenomena of auroras, lightning, sprites, airglow, meteor showers, and others for additional study and observation. S PACE BENEFIT This investigation is applied to new knowledge and not specifically to advances in space exploration. R ESULTS SS-HDTV was flown to the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2011 by Russian cargo ship Progress for operations in the ISS pressurized module cabin including JEM and Cupola. The SS- HDTV system was used to take the high -resolution images, such as luminous cloud, lightning, sprite, aurora, atmospheric airglow, meteor shower, the zodiacal light, night view, sunset, and the moon images.

The experiment's goal is to understand imperfections that existed in the technology in a similar way to the instabilities f rom the Plasma Crystal Research (PK) experiment series of experiments. These cause uneven light emission and instabilities that could cause cracks in the burner wall leading to non -functionality. R ESULTS The experiment in which electronics company Philips and Eindhoven Technical University were participating, was a 100% success and yielded to very promising results. The instabilities in the lamp were expected to be shaped as a rotating helix, and instead they appeared to be a singly bent curve that was not rotating. This fact is very important in improving the performance of the lamps, especially since the instabilities occurred mainly in the most efficient lamps. Analysis afterwards indicated that the rotation in the metal was caused solely by convection and the curving was caused by self-generated magnetic fields. For one condition, residual gravity caused a very slow rotation. As expected, the axial de - mixing did not occur during the in- orbit mission experiments, so the radial demixing could indeed be studied undisturbed. The first results from the experiment actually concluded that one of the main problems/influences causing flickering in the lamps was gravity.

Saprykin, PhD, Central Research Institute for Machine Building, Korolev, Russia Elena V. Shubralova, Central R esearch Institute for Machine Building, Korolev, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Selecting and Testing Procedures and Equipment for Detecting Locations of Module Depressurization on the International Space Station (Bar) investigation supports Internatio nal Space Station (ISS) safety by developing means and methods to detect the location of leaks. One of the causes of leakage can be micro -destruction of the ISS pressure hull. B AR-1 The goal of the Bar -1 investigation is the experimental verification of the performance and ergonomic properties of the Bar scientific equipment set, as well as the methods of leak locations in full- scale conditions using the database of the background conditions. This set of the Bar scientific equipment is designed to detect leak locations in the ISS Russian Segment (RS) modules, investigate the inner environment, and identify and control potentially hazardous zones of microdestructive growth in the ISS RS module pressure hull. B AR-2 The goal of the Bar -2 investigation is the formation of a database of the background conditions based on the results of monitoring the physical environment parameters and the pressure hull surface microconditions in zones of potential leaks. E ARTH BENEFIT S The Bar scientific equipment can be used in civic aviation and shipbuilding as a diagnostic tool to detect ship hull microdestruction, find corrosion growth on structural elements, and assess conformity to permissible acoustic levels . S PACE BENEFITS The goal of the Bar investigation is to provide safety for the ISS Russian Segment. The Bar equipment can be used as a prototype for detecting leak locations inside the ISS RS modules ISS Crew member Yevgeny Tarelkin operat es the ultrasound analyzer during International Space Station Expedition 34. Roscosmos image. 907 and, in combination with the database identifying areas of potential leaks, as a system for control of the ISS pressure hull condition. RESULTS The performance and ergonomic properties of the Bar equipment were verified, and 56 potentially hazardous zones of leaks were identified and examined. Additional zones of potential micro-destruction growth on the ISS pressure hull were also identified. Several databases were created to track the background physical environmental parameters in the potentially hazardous zones of leak and micro -destruction growth, the current state of the ISS pressure hull (including microbiological and corrosive conditions on the hull), and train cosmonauts to identify surfaces in which microorganism colonies have expanded.

Mitschdoerfer, European Space Research and Technology Centre , Noordwijk , Netherlands RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The objective of the Crew Restraint experiment is to test new equipment that uses astronaut's knees to hold them in position during operational activities. Almost all current restraint devices use the feet to restrain the body, and it is generally perceived that this un naturally overloads the smaller muscle groups of the feet. Restraining the crew member at the knee level lowers the forces needed since the knees are closer to the center of gravity of the astronaut, and larger muscle groups are relied upon to a greater ex tent. R ESULTS Attaching the Crew Restraint was one area where improvements to the design could be made. It was designed to attach to seat tracks on the front of station racks. However, due to the width of the restraint at the base, this meant that it didn't fit easily on most racks, espec ially where covers on racks interfered with the process. The process of reconfiguring equipment to make the restraint's installation possible also meant that there was a risk of disturbing other crew members. However, Pedro expanded the possibilities for the device by incorporating handrail to seat track adapters that were available in orbit. Using these adapters showed that the crew restraint could be used in many more locations, which made it possible to use equipment available at the site rather than first relocating it (obviously possible with mobile equipment). From a crew perspective, this would not be necessary for using laptop computers as they are able to use them easily without the use of a restraint. The device itself was comfortable, though quite a lot of effort was needed to perform a pitch (forward) move. It was however quite easy to move from side to side and reach different areas without having to change restraint configuration (being able to reach to racks either side of the rack you are w orking in front of). For example, Pedro found it easy to undertake procedures using the crew restraint for working on the Microgravity Science Glovebox in orbit. The overall Left: Crew Restraint attached to the front of an International Space Station rack. Right: E SA astronaut Pedro Duque works on the Micr ogravity Science Glovebox while testing the new Crew Restraint device. ESA image. 910 feedback from the test proved it was a good idea in general, though it will need t o be evaluated for a longer period of time in order to make design improvements and realize its full potential. This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected. 911 FORWARD OSMOSIS BAG (FOB) Research Area: Life Support Systems and Habitation Expedition(s): 27-ongoing Principal Investigator(s): Howard G. Levine, PhD, NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Forward Osmosis Bag (FOB) system is designed to convert dirty water into a liquid that is safe to drink using a semi -permeable membrane and a concentrated sugar solution. FOB looks at the forward osmosis membrane in a spaceflight environment and compares its performance against ground reference controls. EARTH BENEFITS Hydration Technology Innovations (HTI), the manufacturer of the Forward Osmosis membrane, has used the same technology to create a lifesaving water filter for use in disaster relief situations. This product has been successfully used in disaster relief efforts for the 2010 earthquakes in both Haiti and Chile and was tested in the waters from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. S PACE BENEFITS Forward osmosis technology has several potential applications for spaceflight. In the near term this technology extends existing non-potable water resources on the International Space Station (ISS), thus providing a low -mass alternative for the re duction of stockpiled water on the ISS and flexibility during off- nominal situations, such as in the event a resupply vehicle is delayed or the primary water- recycling system becomes nonfunctional. A small forward osmosis device could be incorporated into new long -exposure spacewalk suits in order to recycle metabolic wastewater (ie, sweat and urine) into drinkable fluid. A forward osmosis device product could be incorporated into new return vehicles as a mass and volume -efficient method of providing crews with post -splashdown fluids. The existing lightweight COTS product can be tethered in seawater to produce a drinkable fluid. R ESULTS A microgravity test of the FOB was completed during shuttle flight STS- 135 in July 2011. Postflight analysis showed the i on rejection rates, which are measures of how well a membrane rejects the passage of dissolved ions, in microgravity to be the same as measured during ground testing. However, the flux rates (rates of flow per unit area) declined in microgravity by up to Mission specialist Rex Walh eim uses the Forward Osmosis Pump Syringe to inject the Challenge Liquid into the FOB during STS - 135/ULF7. 912 50%, although the exact amount of reduction remains to be determined due to significant scattering of the flux data. Considerable fluid wicking, which was not seen on the ground, also occurred during the bag filling process in orbit. While it did not affect the experiment results, fluid wicking could be a problem in the future if the bag is not filled completely (Flynn 2012). Results from FOB will be applied in future water recovery methods for both ground and space missions as well as help reduce mission co sts by recycling used materials.

Belyaev, PhD, S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, Korolev, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Integrated Research on Low -Frequency Acoustic and Electromagnetic Fields in the ISS Habitation Compartments ( Infrazvuk -M) investigation develops and tests the tools and methods of creating a real- time system for monitoring the spatial -temporal structure and energy spectral parameters of low -frequency physical background fields in the International Space Station (ISS) Service Module (SM) habitation compartments. S PACE BENEFITS Based on Infrazvuk -M results, recommendations were provided to introduce improved systems, as part of the nominal acoustic noise control system, into the ISS RS modules, for crew protection from the adve rse effects of exposure to the interior physical environment, including the acoustic noise in the ISS RS module habitation compartments. R ESULTS The measurements showed that the noise generated by the new fan as installed in the SM ventilation system was significantly lower than that of the nominal fan. The reduction in overall noise level, measured at a distance of 50 cm from the fan with the interior panel open, was 2.8 dB. The noise reduction values as obtai ned have demonstrated a satisfactory noise -reduction effect through the use of the low -noise fan, which had previously been identified during the ground -based tests.

Saprykin, PhD, Central Research Institute for Machine Building, Korolev, Russia Elena V. Shubralova, Central Research Institute for Machine Building, Korolev, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Investigation of Early Symptoms of Microdestruction of Structures and Instrument Modules in the Russian Segment of ISS (Expert) investigates the early symptoms of the surface microdestruction of the pressurized body and structures in the International Space Station (ISS) modules while monit oring temperature -humidity parameters, acoustic fields of ultrasound band and other spaceflight factors, which can affect the microdestruction processes. Secondly, Expert will lead the development of an onboard system to reveal early symptoms of microdestr uction and update methods to prevent microdestruction of the pressurized body and structures in the ISS. E ARTH BENEFITS The diagnostic equipment and the method of its usage can be used in civic aviation and shipbuilding . S PACE BENEFITS The results of the Expert provide the long -term ISS safe operation. R ESULTS Results of Expert included the development of methods for the monitoring of background physical environmental parameters, which can affect the microdestruction processes. These parameters were trac ked in a database. Thirty zones of possible microdestruction growth were added to the previously identified potentially hazardous zones of leaks. These zones were subjected to regular inspections. Fifty percent of the test samples taken from the newly iden tified zones of possible microdestruction growth contained decomposer fungi and bacteria.

It was proven that circulations of air flow in instrumentation behind - panel areas affected topology of microorganism contamination of the ISS pressure hull. Additionally, conditions of the pressure hull in the potentially hazardous zones were inspected and the surface conditions recorded in a database. Finally, a fungi database was created to store images of the microconditions of the test samples and to be used in training ISS crew members to preliminarily identify microorganisms and assess growth of decomposer microorganisms on the pressure hull s of intravehicular environment influence on pressure body state studies conducted in space experiments \"Bar\"and \"Expert\" on -board ISS in 2008 -2011.

Pierson, PhD, NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES A Comprehensive Characterization of Microorganisms and Allergens in Spacecraft (SWAB) uses advanced molecular technique s to comprehensively evaluate microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS) including pathogens (organisms that may cause disease). SWAB also tracks changes in the microbial community as spacecrafts visit the station and new station modules are add ed. This study assesses the risk of microbes to the crew and the spacecraft. The determination of risk from infectious disease during spaceflight missions is composed of several factors including both the concentration and characteristics of the microorgan isms to which the crew are exposed. Thus, having a good understanding of the microbial ecology aboard spacecraft provides the necessary information to mitigate health risks to the crew. While stringent steps are taken to minimize the presence of pathogens on spacecraft, medically significant organisms have been isolated from both the Mir and ISS. Historically, the method for isolation and identification of microorganisms from spacecraft environmental samples depended upon their growth on culture media. Unfo rtunately, only a fraction of the organisms might grow on a specific culture medium, potentially omitting those microorganisms whose nutritional and physical requirements for growth are not met. To address this bias in our understanding of the ISS environm ent, the SWAB Flight Experiment was designed to investigate and develop advanced monitoring technology to better characterize the ISS environment. E ARTH BENEFITS The results of this study provide insight into changes that occur in the microbial ecology of semi -closed systems. The development of specific primers for bacterial enumeration and fungal identification during this study advance the ability of ground -based investigators to diagnose ISS0515E07586 - Astronaut Sunita L. Williams, Expeditions 14 and 15 flight engineer, conducts a Surface, Water and Air Biocharacterization (SWAB) air sampling in the Destiny laboratory of the International Space Station. 917 the potential sources of microbial contamination and give insight into the causes of health -related microbial contamination issues such as \"sick building syndrome.\" SPACE BENEFITS Knowing the microorganisms that the crew encounter is crucial in assessing the health risks of the crew and performance of the spacecraft sy stems. By studying the types of organisms and the change in this ecosystem over time, preventative and disinfection regiments are developed to mitigate the accumulation of medically significant organisms or microorganisms that foul filters or degrade compo nents of the spacecraft. R ESULTS For the SWAB flight experiment, it was hypothesized that environmental analysis using non -culture -based technologies would reveal microorganisms, allergens, and microbial toxins not previously reported in spacecraft, allowing for a more complete health assessment. Key findings during this experiment included: Sample analyses using the culture -based and advanced molecular methodology, which provided simi lar results, indicating the current monitoring methods are not \"missing\" medically significant bacteria and fungi. Dust samples taken from the HEPA air filters identified 17 different microbial mold species, most commonly P. chrysogenum and A. pullulans. Other opportunistic pathogens were also detected including a particularly high concentration of A. flavus and A. niger . Fortunately, to date there have been no known health effects from mold as a result of living aboard the ISS (Vesper 2008). Molecular tech niques have tremendous potential for microbial monitoring; however, sample preparation and data analysis present challenges for spaceflight hardware. Results indicate that some molecular techniques, such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), c an be much less sensitive than culture -based methods, and More sensitive molecular techniques, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), were able to identify viral DNA from ISS environments, suggesting potential transfer of the organism betwe en crew members.

Alekhova, PhD, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES Creation of an Express Water- Toxicity Monitoring System for Spaceflight Conditions (Toksichnost') evaluates water toxicity in spaceflight conditions. This investigation was performed on water samples obtained from the ISS condensate water processor (downstream from the purification units, before the addition of preservatives), as well as on water samp les delivered from Earth, for comparative analysis . SPACE BENEFITS The results of Toksichnost' (the method for integral evaluation of the toxicity of water and water solutions) will have great practical significance for assuring safety and supporting the health of cosmonauts during long -term spaceflights. R ESULTS The experi ment confirmed the viability of the method of express environmental monitoring designed for an integrated evaluation of the aqueous solutions and water without preservatives in microgravity through measuring the illumination intensity changes of the Ecolyu m microbial biosensor as it interacts with substances in the sample test tube, as compared against a standard. The results of the first session of the experiment (ISS -Expedition 8) were used to improve experimental technique with regard to collecting water samples. It was found to be necessary to mechanically mix the solution being studied, which consisted of 2 liquids of nearly identical density, to provide the required homogeneity in microgravity.

Bushnell, The Boeing Company, Seattle, Washington RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Constant microgravity conditions are essential for many International Space Station (ISS) experiments. Very small changes in acceleration (such as normal crew activity) can cause subtle vibrations to echo through the ISS. Active Rack Isolation System (ARIS) can protect these delicate experiments by absorbing the shock of motion before it can affect an experiment. This capability enables accommodation of fut ure research that is sensitive to vibration disturbances. E ARTH BENEFITS Experiments ranging from protein crystallization (which can lead to vast advancements in medicine) to the way different fluids behave when mixed are conducted on the ISS. In order for these experiments to lead to improvements in our lives on Earth, they must be conducted as close to undisturbed as possible in space. The AR IS can lead to better science by protecting those experiments from sudden movements and disturbances that can occur aboard the ISS. ARIS- ICE will allow for the ARIS to better perform its function. S PACE BENEFITS Even though ISS orbits the Earth in relativ e microgravity, it is subjected to various sources of disruptive movements that can compromise sensitive experiments. Simple daily activities, like crew exercise, can cause enough vibration to potentially interfere with a particular experiment's results. A RIS allows experiments to remain as undisturbed as possible, and the data collected from ARIS- ICE allows for more successful science to be performed aboard the ISS. R ESULTS ARIS -ICE operations were performed for over a year during Expeditions 2 -4. During that period, more than 1 700 test runs were completed, ranging from short 1 -second stability tests to 5 - hour isolation characterization tests. Station vibrations were isolated to levels well below the science requirements of investigations in EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments to Space Station (EXPRESS) racks equipped with ARIS. Through a series of acceleration characterization Cosmonaut Vladimir Dezhurov performs ARIS -ICE hammer tests in the US Destiny laboratory during Expedition 3. 920 experiments conducted during ARIS -ICE, investigators determined that the ARIS facility provides the ability to predict and pre vent the potentially damaging effect of station vibrations. It was also determined that sensitive experiments installed in ARIS would be isolated and protected from both vibrational and acceleration movements. These capabilities are critical to make ISS a unique, world -class research laboratory in microgravity.

Likhoded, PhD, Central Research Institute for Machine Building, Korolev, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Identification of Sources of Disturbances During Disruption of Microgravity on the International Space Station (Identifikatsiya) measures accelerations and microaccelerations performed during dynamic operations: docking, undocking, orbital reboost, and other operations during which the International Space Station (ISS) structures are exposed to force loads. Telemetry analysis is used to determine dynamic characteristics and update the mathematical model of the ISS, taking into account changes to its configuration. S PACE BENEFITS The results of the experiments will be useful in the creation and use of large -scale structures in space. The performance of Identifikatsiya is the only opportunity to experimentally confirm the reliability of the assessments of actual spectra of cyclical loading (in terms of loading levels and the number of cycles experienced) and for assessment of the conditions of microgravity in various working compartments in the station. These results are the foundation for assessing the degree of reliability and experimental monitoring of the depletion of the lifetime of ISS structure, which is particularly relevant with regard to extending the station's life. R ESULTS During the course of Identifikatsiya, a large amount of factual material, requiring systematization, was compiled on force loading and acceleration fields, which were recorded by onboard ac celerometers that were located on ISS RS modules. Essentially, a database of samples of various external force loads was created. The measurement results obtained made it possible to determine the dynamic characteristics for various ISS configurations and to obtain data on the level and nature of propagation of dynamic S135E011814 - International Space Station in the early hours of July 19, 2011. 922 disturbances from typical sources of external loads, based on the measurements of acceleration parameters in various modes. In order to identify sources of micro -gravitational disturbances a nd other off- nominal dynamic loads on the ISS structure, methodological and software/algorithmic means were developed for mathematically recreating unknown parameters of external force loads, based on analysis of telemetry from onboard microacceleration se nsors. Inverse problems of this type are of independent interest and have important applications in various areas of technology. It was established that during dynamic operations, the level of loading on the structures of modules did not exceed design values.

Belyaev, PhD, S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, Korolev, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The A Study of the Effects of Onboard System Operating Modes on ISS Flight Conditions (Izgib) determines the gravitational environment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) by studying both heterogeneous and homogeneous (in terms of density) fluid flows in microgravity using the Dakon- M science equipment. S PACE BENEFITS The knowledge of microacceleration levels, their spectral composition, and their spatial distribution is a necessary condition for the effective utilization of manned space complexes as a means for achieving scientific and applied objectives, as well as fo r refining mathematical models and dynamic characteristics of various ISS stack configurations and for monitoring the structure's remaining operating life. R ESULTS The results obtained during the sessions using this equipment have demonstrated that microaccelerations caused by dynamic station operations can excite convective flows in a heterogeneously heated gas environment. The root causes of convective flow excitat ion have been validated by comparing the Dakon -M results with angular rate sensor measurements. In particular, the tests have demonstrated that convection can occur as a result of continuous microaccelerations existing aboard the ISS, as well as of the acc elerations related to boosting the station's orbit and to docking and undocking with Progress -M and Soyuz vehicles. A study of convective and isothermal flows caused by small inertial forces aboard the ISS RS was completed using the Dakon- M science equipment during the 2011 ISS increments. The performed studies show that the microgravity environment aboard the ISS RS is unfavorable for a number of experiments.

Roscosmos image. 924 Progress vehicles are proposed as a platform for such experiments after the spacecraft has fulfilled its primary functions. The performed experiments has shown that the Progress attitude control methods developed for this use can ensure microacceleration levels of at least 10 -6 g, which is a unique achievement opening up broad possibilities for the implementation of science programs. The expected scientific and engineering results of the Izgib experiment are related to the ability to obtain the inputs required for the developme nt of both mathematical micro g -load models and a database on hardware -related impacts on micro g -load levels for different science hardware locations.

R ESULTS The right -hand graph shows the experiment's results performed on Earth, the left- hand graph in orbit. Sequentially, the Mouse Telemeter was moved as indicated in 3 orthogonal positions (to test the 3 orthogonal accelerometers). From the graphs, it became clear that the accelerometers acted the same way on Earth as under microgravity conditions. Unfortunately, the X -axis accelerometer did not respond during the space experiment. The only logical conclusion is that a malfunction occurred in the X- axis acceleromet er or in the subsequent electronics. Further, the vertical lines at the left side of the space graph do not occur on the terrestrial graph. They may be caused by repeatedly on and off switching before the tests. The conclusion from the experiment was that the piezo electric accelerometers tested are suitable for use in the STAR mouse implant developed for ESA by TeleMetronics Biomedical.

Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, Korolev, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Telemetry Data -Based Determination of the Dynamic ISS Characteristics (Tenzor) investigation was carried out in order to test the methods for determining and updating the ISS dynamic characteristics based on the telemetry data reflecting the motion con trol system operation. The rationale for initiating Tenzor was the proposed changes in the ISS dynamic characteristics required because of the ISS reconfigurations for Progress or Soyuz vehicle docking/undocking operations, cargo transfer, operating fluids consumption, installation activities aboard the station, etc, which have an indirect impact on the interrelation of the ISS moments of inertia, aerodynamic characteristics, and center of mass position. S PACE BENEFITS The method for updating the dynamic spacecraft characteristics developed during Tenzor performance and results review is applicable not only to the ISS, but also for controlling other spacecraft. R ESULTS The data obtained by Tenzor are used to increase the effectiveness of ISS flight control, since more accurate dynamic parameters entered into the mathematical simulations at the ground complex and into the station computer system increase the reliability and predictability of station behavior when maintaining a specified angular position or changing the ISS attitude. Based on the data obtained by Tenzor a feasibility study was carried out on controlling the Yamal- 200 spacecraft attitude based on the mathe matical simulation of its motion. To increase the accuracy of this simulation and of the motion control system operation, the dynamic characteristics of the spacecraft were refined. The study results demonstrated the feasibility of controlling the Yamal -200 spacecraft using the mathematical simulation of angular motion. Therefore, the results obtained for the ISS (method for updating the mass value based on the mass of the launched satellite) provide additional capabilities to perform flight control tasks, plan experiments, and analyze experiment results obtained.

Karelin, S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Developing New Technologies for the Optimization of Gaseous Environment in Living Compartments of the International Space Station Russian Segment (Veterok) investigat ion studies the capability of destroying pathogenic microbes, dust, fungi, and odors. By depriving the air of ions, living organisms may die. Veterok ionizes the purified air of the spacecraft to confirm the equipment operational capability and the effectiveness of new technologies for the gas environment parameters optimization under the International Space Station (ISS) orbital flight conditions. S PACE BENEFITS The use of the fan/purifier as a nominal device will make it possible to essentially decrease the throughput of the main life support system and significantly enhance the parameters of the living environment for crewmembers. R ESULTS During the experiment, the claimed equipment characteristics were confirmed and experiment data were obtained on ISS gas environment parameters using the developed equipment. The experiment was conducted in three ISS RS modules - the SM, R1, and R2. Based on the measurement results, it was established that the concentration and polarity of air ions in the area of equipment operation (at a distance of 1 m from the equipment window) were at the lower threshold of the nominal values range, and under the d evice, they were below nominal. During the comparison of ion concentrations before and after equipment operation in the mode of pumping air through the equipment's electrostatic filter, it was established that this process does not result in the ionization of the air environment in the pressurized volume of R2. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. Air outlet opening Control panel External view of the fan/air purifier .

A focus of this research is to understand the effect space radiation has on human brain function by combining a silicon particle detector with EEG data for measurements on brain function and astronaut feedback on visual disturbance. R ESULTS The cosmic -ray detector was placed in the Pirs module. From the particle acquisition rate observed with Sileye -3, it was possible to see the radiatio n characteristics due to the station's passage between the low -latitude regions (geomagnetic equator), where the rate is lowest and the high- latitude regions, where the geomagnetic cut -off is lower and particle rate is higher. The highest peaks were observ ed during passage in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The data showed high energy (E kin>100 MeV) events, obtained requiring that the energy released in the first and the last planes does not differ more than 20% and plotting the total energy released in t he telescope. At relativistic energies, the energy lost in the silicon detectors was negligible if compared to the kinetic energy of the particles and therefore the energy loss in the silicon planes was constant and proportional to Z 2 (the square of the el ectric charge). The highest peak was due to protons and helium, composing more than 90% of observed radiation. PUBLICATION (S) Casolino M.

ALTCRISS will also continuously measure the cosmic radiation flow and its changes over time, especially in relation to long - and short -term solar activity, induced respectively by the solar cycle and solar eruptions. R ESULTS Data collection began in December 2005 during Expedition 12. As part of the preliminary results, data capture by the Sileye -3 experiment hardware in its unshielded configuration during an eleven day period in the Pirs Docking Compartment was used to create an all- particles map that correlates particle flux, the rate of transfer of particles through a unit area, with latitude. The map showed that the highest flux peak occurred in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), the region where the inner Van Allen radiation belt comes nearest to Earth and where the particle flux rate increases more than one order of magnitude. Smalle r peaks also occurred at the poles, where geomagnetic shielding is lower than nearer the equator, which also results in higher particle flux rates. Researchers also derived a spectrum of atomic nuclei identifiers with atomic numbers up to and above that o f iron from the Pirs Docking Compartment data acquisition session. The spectrum also showed that nuclei with even atomic numbers were more abundant than those with odd atomic numbers, which is characteristic of cosmic rays. Analysis of data is currently on going. The data gathered from the ALTCRISS project will be useful in not only determining the radiation environment aboard ISS but will contribute to the determination of the effectiveness of shielding materials in space (Casolino 2007).

ALTEA -Shield monitors the radiation environment around our planet and tested different types of shielding materials against the effects of radiation. EARTH BENEFITS This type of research is providing those on Earth with a more detailed picture of the radiation environment in low -Earth orbit, which can help to better understand how this planet works. By comparing this data with data on Earth it could help to determine the impact that Earth's radiation environment may have on climatology and thus help to improve climate models. S PACE BENEFITS The development of better shielding materials is a necessity for making improvements in future spacecraft and satellite design and essential mission planning. In addition to the positive effect this will have on human exploration missions, this will also help to extend the life of satellites in orbit by reducing the effect caused by solar and galactic radiation, which can damage satellite electronics. R ESULTS An extensive amount of data was gathered from the survey part of the ALTEA -Shield experiment, which is being used to check radiation/atmospheric models. As seen below, this data included an identification of the spectra of different forms of radiation and nuclear identification. This was followed up in the second half of 2012 by tests of 2 different Top: ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli, works with the Anomalous Long Term Effects in Astronauts' Central Nervous System - Shield (ALTEA-Shield , [survey ]) equipment on the International Space Station.

Akatov, Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences , Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Bioradiation Dosimetry in Spaceflight (Bradoz) creates methods of bioradiation dosimetry for more precise assessments of biologically significant dose loads on the human body during long - term spaceflights. During Bradoz, complex studies are performed that make possible the establishment of a stable, reliable correlation between the physical characteris tics of ionizing cosmic radiation being measured and the vitally important biological effects of radiation exposure. S PACE BENEFITS Bradoz results can be used during the creation and operation of a system for accounting of and monitoring individual radiat ion doses in space explorers during the period of their professional activity. R ESULTS During the course of research for the Bradoz project, experimental materials were obtained for assessing the biologically significant dose loads on the human body during spaceflight. The results of the Bradoz experiment convincingly showed that dose measurements in International Space Station compartments using only thermo - luminescent d etectors gave an absorbed dose error of up to 10% (reduced) and an equivalent dose error of up to \u00b1 30% due to possible variations in the radiation quality factor. This error can be reduced through the use of a combined method, consisting of the joint use of thermo -luminescent and solid -state track detectors. P UBLICATION (S) Hajek M, Berger T, Vana N, et al.

Knowledge of the absorbed doses and equivalent doses is very imp ortant for understanding the observed behavior of biological samples in space. R ESULTS The dosimeters were distributed among 64 positions in the EXPOSE -E trays. Thirty -two of them were placed as depth dose samples, close to the biological samples, and the other 32 samples were positioned b elow the biological samples, as dark samples. So far, only TLD results can be presented. The daily dose (dark samples) in tray 1 is varying from 0.22 to 0.36 mGy/day, depending on the sample position. The higher the position in the tray, the less shielding is present, the higher the daily doses are. The same effect is observed for tray 2, where daily doses varied between 0.21 and 0.37 mGy/day, as well as for the dark samples. Depth doses varied between 0.33 and 0.21 mGy/day. The results presented here are preliminary results, since data for CR 39 measurements are still missing. Moreover, a detailed comparison of the data obtained by the different groups need to be made. In order to combine doses obtained with TLD's and CR 39 to one single dose, there is need for an algorithm that takes the overlap for both detectors into account (TLD's \"see\" a part of the high LET spectrum as well).

The Dosimetry for Biological Experiments in Space (DOBIES) is additionally developing a standard method to measure the absorbed doses in biological samples aboard the ISS. R ESULTS Data for the experiment was generated through two active DOSTEL detectors and two sets of passive radiation detectors which were located in different locations around the Columbus laboratory from July - November 2009 (set 1) and from November 2009 - May 2010 (set 2). The passive detectors were analyzed on ground following deinstallation and return on Shuttle while monthly data downlinks from the ISS were undertaken for the active detectors between July 2009 and June 2010 with one gap of data from 13 December 2009 to the 5 January 2010. As an example of t he results from the first set of passive detectors (Thermoluminescence Detectors or TLDs and Nuclear Track Etch detectors) Figure 3 - 17 shows the daily dose rate measured with neutron sensitive 6LiF: Mg, Ti TLDs for three different groups (DLR, Cologne, ATI , Vienna and IJF, Krakow) while Figure 3 -18 shows the daily dose rate measured with non- neutron sensitive 7LiF: Mg, Ti TLDs for three different groups (DLR, Cologne, ATI, Vienna and IJF, Krakow). As is seen in Figure 3 -18 the absorbed dose rate inside Colu mbus can vary up to 50% depending on the location of the detectors. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. 940 EUROPEAN TECHNOLOGY EXPOSURE FACILITY -DOS IMETRY TEL ESCOPES (EUTEF-DOSTEL ) Research Area Shielding Expedition(s): 16-20 Principal Investigator(s): G\u00fcnter Reitz, PhD, German Aerospace Center, K\u00f6ln, Germany RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The results of the European Technology Exposure Facility -DOSimetry TELescopes (EuTEF - DOSTEL ) meas urements outside the International Space Station (ISS) will be compared with data obtained with a similar DOSTEL positioned on top of the head of the MATROSHKA facility in the frame of MATROSHKA exposure Phase 2B inside the Russian Zvezda Module. This enables the direct comparison of space radiation data gathered in and outside the ISS with very similar active radiation detectors, taking into account the very different shielding conditions in and outside. R ESULTS For the time where DOSTEL was switched on, the instrument performed perfectly. As an example, the picture shows the trigger rate of the DOSTEL for the time from February to December 2008 (days 56- 330). The trigger profile shows in the lower part the variation of dose due to the galactic cosmic ray environment, while the spikes in the picture were related to passes over the South Atlantic Anomaly as well as due to electrons from th e horns of the radiation belts at higher latitudes.

R ESULTS Measurement frequency was 0.1 Hz. Due to errors in data transmission or temporary termination of Expose power, not all data could be acquired. Radiation was not constant during the miss ion. The radiation dose during the mission was 1823.98 MJ m - 2 for PAR, 269.03MJ m-2 MJ m-2 for UV -C. Registered sunshine duration during the mission was about 152 days (about 27% of mission time). The time profiles of the REP -generated daily fluences, and the absorbed doses at the orbit of ISS during the period February 2008 -August 2010 were analyzed in dependence of the daily Ap index (a measure of the general level of geomagnetic activity over the globe for a given day ) and compared with the daily relativistic electron fluence with energies of more than 2 MeV measured.

A further topic of research, and probably the most important one regarding this ex periment, regards earthquake monitoring from space. R ESULTS This technological demonstrator operated for few days. Ionizing particles were detected within the ISS: the first magnetic observations performed by this instrument were promising and demand for a further and deeper analysis based on a longer time series of data. The main expectations from EGLE were the evaluation of its capability in detecting signals up to ULF frequencies, which was successful. There is also an indication that magnetic measurements exhibit the same time period of the ISS rotation around the Earth. As part of the EGLE test there were also successful testing of the system's 1 - Wire\u00ae data acquisition system, and the signal conditioning and data acquisition board, which produced good quality of signal -to-noise-ratio in all the three frequency bands.

Shurshakov, Institute of Biomedical Problems, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Radi -N Neutron Field Study (RaDI -N) measures neutron radiation levels while aboard the International Space Station (ISS). RaDI -N uses bubble detectors as neutron monitors that have been designed to only detect neutrons and ignore all other radiation. EARTH BENEFITS Data provided from RaDI -N can lead to further understanding of how neutron radiation may damage or mutate Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA), which may cause cataracts and cancer on Earth as well as in space. While the levels of neutron radiation are much higher in space than on Earth, any understanding into the way radiatio n may alter DNA function is extremely useful. S PACE BENEFITS The RaDI -N team is confident that their findings will provide an invaluable resource for accurate risk assessment of neutron radiation in space. This could help reduce astronauts' exposure to ra diation during future missions. R ESULTS The Radi -N experiment, conducted during ISS -20/21 in 2009, used bubble detectors to characterize the neutron radiation field in three locations in the US Orbital Segment (USOS) of the ISS. The goal of the experiment was to compare the neutron dose and energy distribution in Columbus, the US Laboratory, and the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM). The data collected provided some important conclusions regarding neutron radiation in the ISS (Smith 2013). The measured neut ron energy distributions agreed well with previous measurements and did not show a strong dependence on the location in the ISS. These energy distributions showed that approximately 40% of the neutron dose measured was due to high -energy neutrons (> 15 MeV ). Measurements with bubble dosimeters showed that the neutron dose received in the sleeping quarters (in the JEM) was less than that received during daily activities around the ISS. Furthermore, experiments with a water shield in the JEM showed that the n eutron dose on the inner side of the shield was reduced to 72% of the value on the outer side of the shield. A follow -up experiment, Radi -N2, commenced in 2012 and is ongoing.

Expedition 29 Commander Mike Fossu m is performing the HET -Smartphone investigation in the JEM Pressurized Module. 949 ROBONAUT Investigator(s): Myron A. Diftler, PhD, NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Robonaut serves as a springboard to help evolve new robotic capabilities in space and demonstrates that a dexterous robot can launch and operate in a space vehicle, manipulate mechanisms in a microgravity environment, operate for an extended duration within the space environment, assist with tasks, and eventually interact with the crew members. E ARTH BENEFITS General Motors plans to use technologies from Robonaut in future advanced vehicle safety systems and manufacturing plant applications. Robonaut vali dates manufacturing technologies that will improve the health and safety of GM team members at manufacturing plants throughout the world. S PACE BENEFITS Robonaut is an endeavor between NASA and General Motors (GM) to improve robotic technology and capabi lities for future space exploration platforms. R ESULTS Robonaut 2 (R2) arrived on ISS in February 2011 and underwent testing in preparation to become, initially, an Intra-Vehicular Activity (IVA) tool and then evolve into a system that can perform Extra -Vehicular Activities (EVA or spacewalk). After the comple tion of a series of system level checks to ensure the robot traveled well aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis , ground control personnel will remotely control the robot to perform free space tasks that will help characterize the differences between Earth and microgravity Robonaut 2 is the next gener ation dexterous robot, developed through a Space Act Agreement by NASA and General Motors. Expedition 29 commander Mike Fossum works with Robonaut 2 during checkout and operation in the US Laboratory Destiny . 950 control. For approximately 1 year, the fixed base R2 will perform a variety of experiments using a reconfigurable task board that was launched with the robot. While working side -by-side with human astronauts, R2 will actuate switches, use stan dard tools, and manipulate space station interfaces, soft goods, and cables. The results of these experiments will demonstrate the wide range of tasks a dexterous humanoid can perform in space, and they will help refine the methodologies used to control de xterous robots both in space and here on Earth (Diftler 2012).

RRM will reduce risks and lay the foundation for future robotic servicing missions in micro gravity. E ARTH BENEFITS Robotic refueling extends the lifetime of satellites, allowing owners and operators years of additional service and revenue, more value from the initial satellite investment, and significant savings in delayed replacement costs. Numerous satellites are in orbit today that could benefit from such a service. S PACE BENEFITS Robotic refueling and servicing allow human and robotic explorers to reach distant destinations more efficiently and effectively by eliminating the need for space explorers and satellites to launch with large amounts of fuel aboard, thus freeing up mass for mission-critical equipment and capabilities. As an ISS investigatio n, RRM reduces the risk associated with performing robotic servicing tasks in-orbit and lays the foundation for a future robotic servicing mission to a free -flying satellite. It also advances space robotic capabilities. It is the first NASA technology demo nstration to test and prove technology needed to perform robotic refueling and servicing on spacecraft not originally built for them, and the first use of Dextre beyond robotic maintenance of the space station for technology research The Robotic Refueling Mission module on the International Space Station, temporarily installed on the Dextre robot's Enhanced Orbital Replacement Unit Temporary Platform. In this artistic representation, the wire cutter and blanket manipulation tool (right) approaches the Robotic Refueling Mission box (left) to cut wire on a sealed cap. 955 and development. One o f RRM's secondary goals is to validate a Tool- to-Spacecraft contact dynamics robotics simulation facility developed on the ground in parallel with the RRM flight hardware by using the performance data collected from all RRM operations. This is the first step in the plan to expand the Goddard Satellite Servicing Center's capability to develop and test future space robotic servicing and assembly missions with a higher degree of assurance. R ESULTS Data are still being collected from this investigation, and analysis is ongoing. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication. 956 DUAL RF ASTRODYNAMIC GPS ORBITAL NAVIGATOR SATELLITE (DRAGONS AT) Research Area: Small Satellites and Control Technologies Expedition(s): 19-20 Principal Investigator(s): David B. Kanipe, NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Dual RF Astrodynamic GPS Orbital Navigator Satellite (DRAGONSat) demonstrates autonomous rendezvous and docking (ARD) in low -Earth orbit and gathers flight data with a global positioning system (GPS) receiver strictly designed for space applications. ARD is the capability of 2 independent spacecraft to rendezvous in orbit and dock without crew intervention. DRAGONSat consists of 2 picosatellite s (1 built by the University of Texas and 1 built by Texas A&M University) and the Space Shuttle Payload Launcher (SSPL) is the first mission in the 4 - mission Low Earth Orbiting Navigation Experiment for Spacecraft Testing Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (LONESTAR) program. E ARTH BENEFITS This investigation enhances student education by engaging the student in a real- world engineering scenario that includes managing requirements, geographic distance, system engineering, project management, and diverse c ultures. This project also develops critical skills that are invaluable to NASA in the future as the aerospace workforce continues to mature and retire and exposes NASA to the best and brightest students. S PACE BENEFITS This investigation demonstrates ARD in space and provides NASA with actual flight data that is directly applicable to the Exploration Systems Architecture Study's Technology Assessm ent area under Avionics and Software. Data from DRAGONSat has a direct impact on the further development of ARD, which will be used in future exploration missions. R ESULTS Texas A&M University's AggieSat2 and University of Texas' Bevo -1 launched together from shuttle flight STS -127/2JA on July 30, 2009. The 2 satellites failed to completely separate, which hindered communications through antennas that were partially captive within Bevo -1. Despite this failure, AggieSat2 operated for 230 days in low-Earth o rbit until re -entry on March 17, 2010. While mission success requirements to download 2 full orbits of GPS data were not achieved, the NASA -provided DRAGON GPS unit was commanded to operate for one 90 -minute period and data samples throughout this period were downlinked that show the GPS unit was operational and tracking GPS satellites. Texas DRAGONSat looks at independent rendezvous of spacecraft in orbit using Global Positioning Satellite data. 957 A&M students also developed a model to predict a satellite's drag coefficient. Undergraduate students managed, implemented, and documented the entire spectrum of the satellite life cycle, and many students obtained real- time spacecraft operations experience as well (Graves 2012).

The micro -vehicle can be powered by lithium ion batteries and controlled by a microprocessor receiving inputs from IMUs (Inertial Measuring Units) based on measurements obtained fro m gyroscopes. E ARTH BENEFITS This investigation could be used for educational purposes and to inspire future generations to pursue a career in the development of autonomous micro -vehicles. S PACE BENEFITS The I -APE investigation provides space micro -aircraft as aid to the astronaut corps during IVA and EVA operations. It also employs company -developed technologies and solutions that use specialized components standard to the market; therefore, it is a low -cost solution for space. R ESULTS There are no published results. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. Illustration of the APE hardware.

Rory Ninneman, Air Force Research Laboratory, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Middeck Active Control Experiment -II (MACE -II) allows engineers to design future spacecraft and facilities with lightweight, inexpensive structures and materials without sacrificing the stability demanded by sensitive payloads. MACE -II, the first hands - on experiment aboard the International Space Station (ISS), consists of 2 basic parts that are designed to detect and compensate for vibrations. During experiments, scientists use a gimbal at one end of the multi - body platform (MBP) to create a disturbance that is detected by the experiment support module (ESM), which then calculates the opposing forces to be applied at the opposite gimbal, thereby stabilizing the platform. The set of algorith ms used by the ESM are adaptable and can change because of moving parts, variations in temperature, and normal wear and tear on mechanical systems. A collaborating team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) plan to study how control systems such as that used for MACE -II can be applied to hardware and systems that change over time, such as telescopes, antennas, and robotic arms that must be moved to perform specific duties. E ARTH BENEFITS The autonomous adaptive control technology demonstrated by MACE -II can be used in any vehicle that must negotiate turbulent airstreams and atmospheric changes. It can be used to develop smart, problem- solving auto pilots for commercial jets or better guidance and pointing systems for military aircraft. S PACE BENEFITS MACE -II tested self -reliant, adaptive technologies that can detect problems with ISS hardware and correct those problems as needed. This reduces the amount of crew and ground- based personnel time required to monitor and repair ISS hardware. This te chnique is also critical for control of large, flexible structures that must perform precision pointing and tracking. Susan Helms, Expedition 2 flight engineer, works with Middeck Active Control Experiment -II, which is shown \"floating\" in th e microgravity environment of the International Space Station. 960 RESUL TS Fourteen test protocols were completed during Expedition 1, and an additional 62 test protocols were completed during Expedition 2. Algorithms were developed to control mechanical systems in real time using only information from onboard sensors and actu ators to respond to changes in the system. These algorithms were able to adapt whenever they sensed changes in vibration or the loss of a sensor or actuator. The system was able to reduce unwanted vibrations without human intervention by a factor of 10 whi le the system was under control. It was also able to decrease vibrations by a factor of 6 after adapting to the failure of a primary actuator. While the Air Force Research Laboratory Science Team successfully completed all of its experiment objectives asso ciated with the MACE -II unit, the MIT Science Team was unable to do the same because of data downlink constraints (Ninneman 2003).

Zelenyi, PhD, Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Study of Physical Processes Associated with Atmospheric Lightning Discharges Using the Chibis -M Microsatellite and Progress Cargo Vehicle (Mikrosputnik) is designed for an in -depth investigation of the physical mechanisms of electrical discharges in the atmosphere in the broadest energy spectrum, specifically from RF to gamma rays. Above all, the extremely powerful gamma radiation at altitudes of 10 -20 kilometers is a potential hazard for airline crews and passengers. Gamma radiation, which does in fact reach Earth, covers wide areas, which can be important both from an ecological perspective and in terms of human safety. And finally, single supercharged RF pulses carry high radiation energy in virtually the entire radio wave range used (up to and exceeding 3 GHz) and can serve as a convenient natural radiation source to create a global monitoring system for radio communications. E ARTH BENEFITS This research demonstrated the need for providing useful information on space weather to a wide range of users in the science, economics, medicine, and other sectors. Because of the developments in space communication/navigation systems, northern regions e xploration and transpolar civil aviation routes exploitation, the dependence on solar and space environment factors will only increase in the future.

R ESULTS Measurements of electrical activity by the RF analyzer from the Groza equipment set have demonstrated that in reality the spatial storm front structure is of multidimensional, or to be more exact, the distribution of charged cells is random and can be described in the terms of a fractal topology, ie, some kind of a self -organization of an electr ically charged layer occurs. The microsatellite flight has facilitated creating a map showing the geographical areas with the highest discharge frequencies. The map is used to generate the Groza equipment operation timelines that allow implementing a pre -programmed activation of the necessary modes of operation for both the microsatellite systems (power supply, attitude control, etc) and the Groza instruments.

Selivanov, PhD, Russian Corporation for Rocket - Space Instrumentation and Information Systems, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Preparing Nanosatellite and Launching it from the Russian Segment of the International Space Station (Nanosputnik) inserts a nanosatellite into low -Earth orbit and controls it to blaze a trail for future reduction of expenditures on the development and use of space systems based on small spacecraft. SPACE BENEFITS Nanosputnik results will be used in the following spheres of the aerospace industry: technologies for low -cost creation and launches of spacecraft; technologies for performing technical research and experiments on board manned orbital stations; telecommunications technology; and technologies for global control of the systems of spacecraft. RESULTS During Expedition 10 in 2005, the first phase of the Nanosputnik experiment was implemented: nanosatellite [] -0 No. 1 was manually launched from t he International Space Station during an extravehicular activity. The duration of the satellite's autonomous flight was 4 months (it descended into the dense layers of the atmosphere on August 30, 2005), during which time the program of flight experiments was performed in full, and results were obtained that confirmed the successful achievement of the tasks assigned in the experiment: Use of the GLOBALSTAR satellite telecommunications system to control and communicate with the small spacecraft was confirme d. Effective monitoring of the spacecraft's functioning using the subscriber set of the international COSPAS- SARSAT system was shown. Tests of experimental onboard devices \u2014system monitor, Sun sensors, horizon sensor, lithium battery, passive (magnetic) attitude -control and stabilization system \u2014were successfully performed.

Production has begun on a new generation of High Efficiency Solar Cells that are committed to fly on major Department of Defense (DOD) space a ssets. In the past, flying new solar cell technology for the first time on a major satellite program has resulted in unexpected interactions with the space environment, which caused either failure of the solar arrays or significant degradation of performance limiting ultimate useful life in orbit. The PSSC Testbed flight experiment is designed to obtain space environment degradation data for these advanced solar cells. This capability will allow for gathering spaceflight performance data before the launch o f new satellites with the new solar cell technology as the primary power source. E ARTH BENEFITS The new advanced materials and components demonstrated on PSSC will improve the performance, increase the useful life, and reduce the operational costs of com mercial weather, communications, and Earth observation satellites. S PACE BENEFITS Results from PSSC will provide a better understanding of the durability of various solar cell materials when exposed to the space environment. Many of these materials might be used in the design of future spacecraft. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication.

Miller, PhD, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) experiment is a testbed for formation flying by satellites. SPHERES consists of 3 self - contained satellites, each of which measures 0.2 meter in diameter and weighs 3.5 kg. Each satellite contains internal propulsion, power, avionics, software, communications, and metrology systems. The SPHERE S experiment tests relative attitude control and station- keeping between satellites, re -targeting and image plane -filling maneuvers, collision avoidance, and fuel -balancing algorithms, and an array of geometry estimators that are used in various missions. SPHERES is an ongoing demonstration. Each session tests progressively more complex 2 - and 3 -body maneuvers that include docking, formation flying, and searching for \"lost\" satellites. E ARTH BENEFITS The technologies for formation flight of small satellite s influence Earth -based applications of current satellite technologies including surveillance, mapping, communications, and navigation. S PACE BENEFITS Results from SPHERES support the development of autonomous spacecraft to carry out a variety of tasks in the space environment and the simplification of autonomous docking allowing for servicing, re -supplying, reconfiguring, and upgrading of space systems. Smaller autonomous spacecraft can perform tasks too complicated or too expensive for larger spacecraft to execute. The algorithms developed during this investigation eliminate the complicated spacecraft maneuvers that require ground teams to coordinate an d execute. Examples of the use of small autonomous spacecraft include a Separated -Spacecraft Interferometer in which light from 2 or more spacecraft telescopes combine to provide a high-resolution image, and a satellite cluster, a collection of microsatellites that operate cooperatively to perform the function of a single large satellite. Three satellites fly in formation as part of the Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites investigation during Expedition 14 in the US Laboratory module. 967 RESULTS Testing in the risk -tolerant environment of the ISS has allowed SPHERES researchers to push the limits of their algorithms. The initial test sessions showed the hardware operated correctly and the software programs uploaded successfully to the satellites. The SPHERES team identified and corrected many of the operational and programmatic difficulties encountered by lengthening session frequency, using real- time aud io and video, and allowing the crew to run tests sequentially. All data collected has been used to continually improve formation flight and docking procedures, creating many space firsts such as the first free -flyer to operate aboard the ISS, the first to demonstrate docking to a tumbling target in a microgravity environment, and docking using on- line path -planning. The final integrated tests of the autonomous docking algorithms culminated with the successful demonstration of docking to fixed and tumbling targets, with and without obstacles or failures. Various flight maneuvers (such as 2 -stage reconfiguration, scatter, and imaging) were successfully performed with 2 and 3 satellite formations. In addition, several algorithms for collision avoidance and form ations starting from random positions have been developed, tested, and validated on the ISS. Several tests included robotic experiments where the satellites were controlled by astronauts on the ISS. Results showed that including assisting elements, like au tonomous collision avoidance, enhanced the operator's performance by allowing the operator to concentrate on the assigned task rather than worry about collision avoidance.

Bruniga, United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland James Keeney, PhD, Air Force Research Laboratory, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The complement of Space Test Program -H2 (STP -H2) investigations was deployed from STS -116/12A.1 on December 20, 2006. ANDE (BRUNIGA ) The Atmospheric Neutral Density Experiment (ANDE) consists of 2 spherical microsatellites: t he Mock ANDE Active (MAA) spacecraft and the Fence Calibration (FCal) spacecraft. These satellites were launched from the space shuttle cargo bay into a circular orbit just below the International Space Station (ISS) altitude. The main objective of the AND E mission is to measure the total atmospheric density and composition between 100 and 400 kilometers. RAFT (BRUNIGA ) Radar Fence Transponder (RAFT) is a student experiment from the U.S. Naval Academy that used picosatellites to test the Space Surveillanc e Radar Fence and experimental communications transponders. More specifically, RAFT was designed to provide the Navy Space Surveillance System (NSSS) radar fence with a means by which to determine the limits of a constellation of picosatellites that would be otherwise undetectable to the radar fence and to enable NSSS to independently calibrate its transmit and receive beams using signals from RAFT. This was accomplished with 2 picosatellites (RAFT1 and MARScom): 1 that actively transmitted and received sig nals, and 1 with a passively augmented radar cross section. Additionally, RAFT provided experimental communications transponders for the Amateur Satellite Service, the Navy Military Affiliate Radio System, and the Naval Academy's Yard Patrol Craft. MEPSI (KEENEY ) The MIcroelectromechanical System -based PICOSAT Inspector (MEPSI) experiment series was designed to demonstrate the concept of an onboard intelligent hardware agent, \"InfoBot,\" that can be used to assist satellite operations. It is designed to en hance satellite command and S116E07836 - Shown is one of the ANDE satellites floating free from Internal Cargo Unit (ICU) after deployment. The second satellite did not leave its half of the ICU until 4 hours after launch from the shuttle cargo bay. 972 control operations by providing active onboard imaging capability to assess spacecraft damage from human -made or environmental threats, monitor satellite early orbit testing operations, and augment servicing operations. MEPSI w as developed through a series of 4 preflight missions, each of increasing complexity and each improving overall satellite performance over the previous version. In December 2002, MEPSI completed its third development mission with a successful launch from t he Space Shuttle Endeavour , which was its first shuttle mission. Improvements from the 2002 version were included in this payload, which was deployed in December 2006 from STS- 116. E ARTH BENEFITS Improvements in orbit calculations produced by data from ANDE may generate advancements in t he fields of mathematics and physics. RAFT provides students the opportunity to design and build picosatellites and helps prepare the next generation for careers in the aerospace industry through the application of mathematic, engineering, and scientific c oncepts. The advancements in miniature imaging and relay technology resulting from MEPSI are applicable in a variety of settings from medicine to public safety. S PACE BENEFITS Density data gathered by ANDE will be used to better characterize the paramete rs that are used to calculate the drag coefficient of a satellite and improve orbit determination calculations of resident space objects . Results from RAFT support the development of an improved system to track an increasing population of picosatellites. M EPSI technology will lead to an image inspection capability for low -cost survey of spacecraft while on orbit. R ESULTS The ANDE satellite re -entered the atmosphere on December 25, 2007, over a year after deployment. Its orbital decay was tracked by the Maui Laser Ranging Tracking Station. Because the satellite carried packet radio communications systems operating in the Amateur Satellite Service, ham radio volunteer ground stations were critical for telemetry feeds that included temperature and battery life. RAFT was deployed on December 20, 2006, and deorbited on May 30, 2007, after 5 months in space. The deployment resulted in an applied torque to the satellites (see image). Several subsystems on the satellite, including solar panel and thermal, were monitored. Volunteer ground stations were used to track the satellites (Bruniga 2002).

C ANARY (MCHARG) Canary investigates the interaction of ions with the background plasma environment around the ISS. DISC (NICHOLS ) The Digital Imaging Star Camera (DISC) captures images of star fields for analysis by ground algorithms to determine the attitude of the ISS. MHTEX (WILLIAMS AND PENERA ) The Massive Heat Transfer Experiment (MHTEX) investigates the in space performance of capillary pumped loop (CPL) heat transfer equipment, which uses continuous fluid flow to transfer heat from multiple spacecraft sources to an external radiator su rface. This investigation intends to improve the understanding of heat transfer transport phenomena and two-phase flow (ie, liquid -vapor flow) performance in microgravity. VADER (WILLIAMS ) The Variable emissivity radiator Aerogel insulation blanket Dual zo ne thermal control Experiment suite for Responsive space (VADER) investigation tests a variable emissivity radiator and a new form of multilayer insulation that uses Aerogel as the thermal isolator in order to protect the spacecraft from the harsh extremes of the space environment. The Aerogel material provides a more durable, lighter, and cheaper alternative to traditional spacecraft thermal blankets. The use of this material could reduce the costs related to spaceflight by reducing the required spacecraft mass and increasing design efficiency.

S PACE BENEFITS The full STP -H3 complement of investigations, including thermal control, attitude knowledge, and environmental sensing technologies, may be used in future spacecraft design and development, each technology offering an increase in efficiency and decrease in cost. R ESULTS Data is still being collected from this investigation, and analysis is ongoing. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication. 975 REENTRY BREAKUP RECORDER (REBR) Research Area: Space Structures Expedition(s): 27-ongoing Principal Investigator(s): William Ailor, PhD, The Aerospace Corporation, El Segundo, California RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Re -Entry Breakup Recorder (REBR) tests a cost -effective system that rides a re -entering space vehicle, records data during the re -entry and breakup of the vehicle, and returns the data for analysis. Understanding how vehicles behave during atmospheric re -entry gives future spacecraft developers unique information that can enhance design efficiencies and safety. E ARTH BENEFITS Data regarding how a spacecraft breaks up during deorbit can be applied to the design of future spacecraft to minimize hazards to people and property in the event the re -entering spacecraft becomes unco ntrollable. S PACE BENEFITS REBR increases the understanding of vehicle breakup during re -entry, potentially resulting in removing the need for deorbit propulsion capability, thereby decreasing cost and complexity and increasing mission life and payload mass budget. R ESULTS REBR units were installed and activated in the H -II Transfer Vehicle 2 (HTV2) and Automated Transfer Vehicle -2 (ATV -2) 1 day prior to vehicle undock from ISS. The REBR in HTV2 was soft - mounted while the REBR in ATV -2 was hard -mounted. HTV2 undocked from the International Space Station (ISS) on March 28 and re -entered the atmosphere on March 29, 2011. ATV -2 undocked June 20 and re -entered on June 21, 2011 (Wada 2011). According to REBR data, interaction with the atmosphere gradually slowed HTV2, put it into an unstable tumble, and heated its structure until breakup and release of REBR at an altitude of 66.5 km and speed of Mach 23. During re -entry, HTV2 experienced increasing rotation rates because of aerodynamic moments, which built to highly erratic behavior during HTV2 breakup and REBR release. Two hundred seconds after re- entry began, the rotation rates took on a damped oscillatory character, which was consistent with REBR stabilizing with its conical nose View of the REBR installed in the ATV -2. 976 facing forward into the oncoming airstream. Initiation of HTV2's major breakup began as early as 120 seconds after re -entry was detected and extended over an altitude range of 75.6 to 66.5 km, while catastrophic disintegration probably began between 180 and 190 seconds after re-entry was detected. The acceleration magnitude trend measured by REBR was consistent with predictions (Ailor 2011). Once free of HTV2, REBR continued to record data while it initially tumbled, emerged from its housing, and aerodynamically stabilized. REBR impacted the South Pacific Ocean 727 seconds after start of data recording and 531 s econds after breakup of HTV2. Ballistic and drag coefficients were in agreement with preflight predictions.

Bruninga, United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Atmospheric Neutral Density Experiment - 2 (ANDE -2) consists of 2 microsatellites launched from the shuttle payload bay that measure the density and composition of the low - Earth orbit atmosphere while being tracked from the ground. The data will be used to better predict the movement and decay o f objects in orbit. E ARTH BENEFITS Improving calculations that are used when observing orbits may lead to advancements in the fields of mathematics and physics on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS Understanding the atmospheric effects on spacecraft in low -Earth orbit will lead to improved calculations for orbit determinations and collision avoidance. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. Deployment of Atmospheric Neutral Density Experiment -2 (ANDE -2). ANDE -2 is part of a Department of Defense project to provide high-quality satellites for calibrating techniques and models for precision orbit determina tion.

Knowledge of impacts, their seasonal variations, and long -term ev olution are required for a reliable spacecraft risk assessment and the design of protective shielding. R ESULTS DEBIE -2 data was highly dominated by noise events following a first analysis of potential impact events, with false events mainly being due t o the International Space Station (ISS) plasma and thermal environment and ISS operations (eg, shuttle docking/undocking). After initial background noise filtering was undertaken, 931 events were identified as potential impact events in the period January -September 2009. From this data a significantly higher amount of impacts occurred on the upward (zenith) -facing sensor than on the forward -facing and starboard sensors. One of the surprising findings was that impact events came in clusters and were not randomly distributed. These peaks can be concentrated within the space of perhaps a minute to 80 seconds at a time, indicating the existence of dust clouds along the ISS orbit. These particles might be either natural or artificial in origin. Asteroids and comets leave trails of fine dust behind th em while solid rocket boosters spray out fine droplets of aluminium oxide. After retrieval of DEBIE -2, it was found that one wire of the upper grid on the sensor unit pointing to the zenith had been broken while in orbit. A postflight analysis was starte d including the use of optical microscopy. Hundreds of holes were observed in the area beneath the broken wire, indicating that the particle was vaporised during the impact. Since the impacted wire had a diameter of 75 m, one can derive that the impactor should have had a minimum size of 25 m and a maximum size of about 50 m, otherwise it should have survived the impact.

The experiment includes 2 sensor units, each containing 6 sensors. One unit was facing the ISS flight direction measuring the dynamic pressure and the other unit was facing the zenith (away from Earth) direction measuring the static pressure of the atomic and molecular oxygen. RESULTS First results of the sensor currents versus the prediction of atomic oxygen using the atmosphere models are illustrated in the associated graph. These first results show deviations of the transient behavior of atomic oxygen compared to the prediction of the higher atmosphere models U.S. Naval Research Laboratory Mass Spectrometer and Incoherent Scatter Radar Exosph ere (NRLMSISE), which is an empirical model of temperatures/densities of atmospheric components, Marshall Engineering Thermosphere Model (MET) and Density Temperature Drag Model (DTM). The results showed an increase of atomic oxygen after local sunrise whe n ISS orbited from south to the equator followed by a decrease when continuing the orbit to higher latitudes. Some minutes before the ISS exited the local eclipse phase, the atomic oxygen level reached its minimum. P UBLICATION (S) Fasoulas S, GH, Lohle S.

Sokolov, S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, Moscow, Russia R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES Recording Micrometeoroid and Technogenic Particle on the External Surface of the ISS Russian Segment Service Module (Meteoroid) continuously monitors the meteoric and space debris environment in the proximity of the orbit of ISS operations. This is determined on one hand, by the conti nuous increase of the pollution level in the space environment, and on the other hand, by the ISS design life. The Meteoroid experiment is one component of a system being developed to monitor the meteoroid and technogenic elements of the space environment, covering the full range of the particle sizes. S PACE BENEFITS Meteoroid will aid in updating the Russian models of the technogenic environme nt in the range of small- sized particles (< 0.1 mm), which is characterized by significant dynamics in time, and specifically, for updating the developed model of the penetrating shower of meteoroid and technogenic particles with sizes 20 - 100 micron impacting thin barriers and to verify the predictions of the arrival time and intensity of meteor showers. R ESULTS The comparison of the data on MMOD showers obtained as a result of the Meteoroid experiment to results from orbital stations Salyut and Mir and other space objects, as well as to modeled values of the showers showed that in the range of particle sizes over 20 micron, there is an increase in the pollution levels of the near -Earth space environment over time for orbital altitude ranges 400 -500 km (m ore than doubling over 10 -15 years). For the range of particles with sizes below 20 micrometers, such effect is not observed as a result of a more intensive self-cleaning of the space environment at these altitudes from smaller -sized micro -particles due to aerodynamic deceleration and solar radiation pressure. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. General view of the Station and the placement of sensors on the planes of the Service Module.

Belyaev, PhD, S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, Korolev, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The High -Accuracy Spatial Orientation of Scientific Devices Taking in Account the ISS Hull Deformation (Privyazka) investigation assesses hull deformation and determines the error values of the reference coordinate system, to provide quality results for ISS investigations. For experiments to observe celestial objects, the Earth's surface, to study the atmosphere, and some others, it is important to have information on the accurate spatial orientation of the sensing axes of research devices. S PACE BENEFITS The results will be used to increase the accuracy of determining the orientation of scientific equipment installed on the ISS, for planning, and high quality analysis of scientific experim ents that require, for example, accurate tracking by scientific equipment of objects being studied, or knowledge of spatial position with high accuracy. In addition, results may be used to design and control other spacecraft and to conduct on them research and experiments, which require the highly accurate spatial positioning of scientific equipment. R ESULTS The obtained results correspond to the data existing in this field calculated during Salyut and Mir station operations. Angular misalignments of the s ensing axes of devices by approximately 1 - 2\u00b0 due to ISS hull deformations occur just as they did on previous stations. Nevertheless, the results obtained in the course of Privyazka enabled the development of corresponding mathematical models and the obtained measurements processing methods in order to determine ISS hull deformation, and device and system misalignments aiming to increase the accuracy of determining their orientation in the reference coordinate system for the high -quality analysis of scientific experiments conducted on the ISS. This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected. Still camera mounted on a window in the ISS RS.

Dimpfl, PhD, Aerospace Corporation, Los Angeles, California RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Ram Burn Observations (RAMBO) is an experiment in which the Department of Defense uses a satellite to observe space shuttle orbital maneuvering system engine burns. Its purpose is to improve plume models, which predict the direction the plume or rising column of exhaust will move as the shuttle maneuvers in orbit. Understanding the direction in which the spacecraft engine plume or exhaust flows could be significant to the safe arrival and departure of spacecraft on current and future exploration missions. E ARTH BENEFITS While interactions at hyperthermal energies are relatively rare on the surface of the Earth, there are potential applications relevant to the cutting -edge of technology, including the understanding of high-temperature plasmas and the production and derivation of energy from controlled fusion power sources. S PACE BENEFITS Applications in space include an understanding of plume flow fields that could be relevant to the safe approach and departure of supply ships to the International Space Station (ISS) or other spacecraft. They also include an understanding of background radiance produced by plumes, impacting sensors designed for other observations. More generally the applications include a contribution to understanding any phenomenon related to spacecraft that are impacted by the poorly understood interactions of atoms and molecules at hy perthermal energies that govern the environment around spacecraft in low -Earth orbit. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. This image shows the Glow experiment documentation of Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS)/Reaction Control System (RCS) pods and vertical stabilizer from STS -007. 985 SHUTTLE EXHAUST ION TURBULENCE EXPERIMENTS (SEITE) Research Area: Spacecraft and Orbital Environments Expedition(s): 18-28 Principal Investigator(s): Paul A. Bernhardt, PhD, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Shuttle Exhaust Ion Turbulence Experiments (SEITE) uses space -based sensors to observe the ionospheric turbulence from a Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) burn. E ARTH BENEFITS Results will help in the interpretation of spacecraft plumes when they are observed from Earth. S PACE BENEFITS Artificially -created plasma turbulence can disrupt military navigation and communications using radio systems. R ESULTS SEITE 1 and SEITE 2, conducted during STS - 127/2JA and STS- 129/ULF3 respectively, provided unique measurements of highly altered, neutral, and plasma environments that resulted from space shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) burns in the ionosphere. During STS- 127, an OMS burn was timed so the exh aust plume would cross the path of an Air Force satellite. The satellite, which flew through the near - center of the exhaust cloud, measured a 50% increase in ion temperature, 10% increase in electron density, increase in vertical neutral wind from 0 to 3.5 km/s in 6 seconds, and the conversion of 25% of ions to CO 2+, which was the result of the exchange of charges between neutral CO 2 and ambient atomic ions. All of these results were consistent with predictions. Of particular interest was the detection of e lectromagnetic pulses (EMPs) in the form of a fast magnetohydrodynamic (ultra -low frequency) wave and multiple whistler (very low frequency) waves, as well as a broad band of high -amplitude noise that followed the initial EMPs. The source of the noise is s till under investigation. The experiment was repeated during STS -129. This time, the satellite flew through only the edge of the exhaust cloud. Like SEITE 1, an EMP caused by the fast magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave was detected about 6 seconds after the OMS ignition. Unlike SEITE 1, no whistler modes were observed. These observations were in accordance with predictions: the fast MHD wave is the most likely mode to be detected by a remotely located satellite, since it propagates in all directions. The whistl er modes, however, travel in a 19.5\u00b0 cone around the magnetic field from the point of origin and therefore are only detected by a satellite if it is within this cone. While the satellite in SEITE 1 was within this cone Shuttle Exhaust Ion Turbulence Experiment operational concept. US Department of Defense Space Test Program image , Houston, TX. 986 and therefore detected the whistler w aves, the satellite in SEITE 2 was well outside the whistler cone. Also like SEITE 1, a broad band of high amplitude noise was observed following the initial EMP during SEITE 2. The noise detected during the SEITE experiments demonstrated that a large numb er of electrostatic waves are produced after initially neutral rocket exhaust products are converted to high speed ions (Bernhardt 2012). Findings from SEITE will be used to develop quantitative models of plasma disturbance that can affect tracking and ima ging radars. P UBLICATION (S) Bernhardt P, Ballenthin J, Baumgardner J, et al.

Bernhardt, PhD, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Shuttle Ionospheric Modification with Pulsed Localized Exhaust Experiments (SIMPLEX) investigates plasma turbulence driven by rocket exhaust in the ionosphere using ground -based radars. E ARTH BENEFITS Results will help in the interpretation of spacecraft engine plumes when they are observed from Earth. S PACE BENEFITS Artificially created plasma turbulence can affect military navigation and communications using radio systems. The plasma turbulence can also be used to promote communications by opening radio channels at abnormally high frequencies. The processes by which chemical releases can produce plasma waves are fundamental to many applications. These processes are quantified with the SIMPLEX measurements. R ESULTS The effect of shuttle OMS burns on the ionosphere at or near the equator was observed during shuttle flights STS-86, STS -93, and STS - 122/1E. The first objective of SIMPLEX, to study the flow of plasma into an artificially created hole in the ionosphere, was accomplished during shuttle mission STS- 86. The hole created by the burn recovered more quickly than was predicted by plasma diffusion models. The second objective, to trigger bubbles in the ionosphere, was accomplished during STS -93, when a 10 -second burn produced a hole on the bottom side of the equatorial layer of the ionosphere, which researchers hoped would seed an ionospheric bubble. After the burn, an ionospheric disturbance was detected drifting eastward at 100 meters per second. While the appearance of the disturbance after the burn was consistent with Ground radar data collection during Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) burn of the space shuttle. The radar scatter provides data on the ionospheric interactions of the high- speed OMS exhaust. (SIMPLEX concept image provided by Dr. Paul A. Bernhardt, Plasma Physics Division, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC 20375) 988 hypothesis, it remains unclear whether the disturbance was naturally occurring or an e ffect of the OMS burn. The final objective, the use of artificial airglow to make natural ionospheric irregularities more easily observable, was accomplished when the STS- 122/1E completed an OMS burn in a region of strong natural ionospheric irregularities . The burn exhaust created artificial airglow that enhanced the irregularities present in the ionosphere. The enhanced features were easily observed by ground -based imagers. Ground based radar was used to observe the effect of shuttle OMS burns on the iono sphere at midlatitudes during shuttle flights STS- 110/8A, STS -128/17A, and STS -119/15A. The cases of STS -110 and STS -128 showed that the exchange of charges by exhaust molecules traveling at hypersonic speeds in the ionosphere yields high energy ion beams that create a backscatter signature detectable by radar that lasted from 30 to 90 seconds to over 20 minutes. The STS -119 case was the first reported detection of a rocket engine burn in the F -region, the topside and densest layer of the ionosphere, at a range of over 700 kilometers. The burn was detected by radar as a disturbed region of enhanced high frequency (HF) backscatter that lasted for 40 minutes. This disturbance was unique to the burn and was not seen near this location in the 2 weeks prior to or after the burn event. SIMPLEX demonstrated that rocket exhaust products can be used to better observe irregular features in the ionosphere (Bernhardt 2012).

The ASIA experiment was the co re of the first super -computer for space application that can operate in a high radiation environment assuring high functionality and performance through the realization of innovative and self -configuring architecture without \"radiation hardened\" electron ic components. R ESULTS The Commercial- off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware worked perfectly during its postflight tests. In 2005 it was one of the first attempts to demonstrate that COTS hardware could work in the space environment without protection, with respect to the radiation dose calculated analytically. The data/experience coming from the ASIA e xperiment is proving very important in the development of a microsatellite design based on the COTS hardware. This investigation is complete; however, additional results are pending publication.

This technology may eliminate the need for highly complex deployment mechanisms by providing a simpler, lightweight alternative to mechanical hinges. EMCH builds on the previous space shuttle experime nt, lightweight, flexible solar array hinge (LFSAH) that was flown on STS- 93. E ARTH BENEFITS Since composite materials are valued for being lightweight and strong, the hinges may have spin-off applications on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS EMC materials tested in this experiment are stronger and lighter than current material used in space hinges and could be used in the design of future spacecraft. R ESULTS EMCH was successfully completed aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during Expedition 15. The investigation was returned to Earth for a complete analysis by the investigator team in 2007. However, the preliminary assessment indicated that the experiment demonstrated the robustness and reliability of the TEMBO\u00ae EMC hinge in the zero -gravity environment. This test campaign consisted of both nominal and off- nominal c onditions, with the final series of tests presenting the most challenging conditions for in- orbit TEMBO\u00ae hinges. The successful completion of these tests indicates that hinges meet the designed performance goals of a next -generation, spaceflight -qualified actuator. Additionally, the science gained from this experiment confirms engineering assumptions used to design the TEMBO\u00ae EMC hinges as well as other TEMBO\u00ae EMC -deployable structures that are being developed for space applications. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publications.

The material samples consist of a selection of thermal control paints and foils , optical glasses, thin solar sail materials, and metallic anodisations . RESULTS Preliminary analysis of the material degradation data showed the relative trends in the material behaviour and ageing/degradation mechanisms (yellowing, erosion from atomic oxygen, etc). However, more detailed modelling was required in order to acquire more accurate values for their thermo -optical properties. The space debris experiment SODAD (composed of MOS capacitor sensors) recorded 11 impact events during the mission, and these flight results were being correlated with model predictions. The results from the environmental sensors on MEDET, and in particular the pressure gauge, have been used to show the influence that space station orbital maneuvers and the docking of the space shuttle have on the local International Space Station (ISS) environment. Further analysis is ongoing to analyse the in -orbit behaviour of the materials and to determine synergies between the different types of data. The preliminary results from the QCM (quartz crystal microbalances) contamination monitors indicated that no significant molecular contamination deposition occurred during this period. This QCM data also covered the period when the space shuttle STS -123 docked to t he ISS in March 2008. It is interesting to note that the erosion appeared to stop at the moment the shuttle docked and then continues after the shuttle had undocked. This corroborated evidence from the pressure gauge. Previously, this was attributed to a p ossible shielding effect caused by the space shuttle. However, it is now believed to be due to a \"ram/wake\" effect, caused by re - orientation of the station during the shuttle docking. ESA image. 992 During 2010, the analysis of the in- orbit results were complemented wit h ground- based activities (environment simulation, calibration, chemical analysis, physica,l and optical properties). The results showed the general trends in the material behavior. These were summarized as follows: There was no significant degradation of the white paints. There was no significant degradation of the Plasmocer. There was no significant degradation of the black bodies. Complete erosion of the Upilex S occurred. Darkening of the Y100 polyimide was followed by a decrease in absorptance. Ther e was a small increase in absorptance of the RSR, MAP ATOX, and RSF coatings. Preliminary results will need to be refined using a more detailed analysis, and a comparison will also be made with the postflight measurements after return of the samples.

This is of major importance for spacecraft systems. The Tribolab experiments cover both experiments in liquid and solid lubrication such as the evaluation o f fluid losses from surfaces and the evaluation of wear of polymer and metallic cages weightlessness. R ESULTS The first results from the \"Pin on Disk\" tests in the Tribolab experiment showed that the behavior of the lubricants under microgravity and vacuum conditions in orbit is similar to their behavior on Earth, with transferred material from the coated disk to the mating surface (ball). The main friction coefficient and the maximum endurance of the coating in orbit were similar to the ones obtained on Earth in a commercial tribometer.

Grugel, PhD, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The In Spa ce Soldering Investigation (ISSI) was rapidly developed after the Columbia accident as a low -mass experiment using hardware already aboard the International Space Station (ISS). While it was designed to promote understanding of joining techniques, shape equilibrium, wetting phenomena, and micro -structural development in space, its primary objective was to better understand the effects and consequences of soldering in microgravity. On Earth, soldering has a defined behavior and relies on gravity and convection to assist in solidification, joint shape, integrity, and microstructure. Unfortunately, detrimental gas bubbles (void spaces) can form in the solder joint and at contact surfaces. These voids reduce thermal and electrical conductivity and provide sites for crack initiation. In the microgravity environment, bubbles have less chance to escape, and therefore, are likely to be more of a problem. To better understand this potential problem, a systematic series of soldering samples was designed to investigate and understand porosity development, surface wetting, and equilibrium shape formation. The samples were heated in orbit and then returned to Earth for property testing and metallographic examination. E ARTH BENEFITS The study of soldering in space leads to a better comprehension of materials processing techniques and fluid dynamic processes. S PACE BENEFITS The ISSI experiment provides unique insight into microgravity soldering methods, which could play a fundamental role in maintaining the ISS as well as providing repair capabilities during future exploration missions. Video screen shot of science officer Mike Fincke using a soldering iron to perform In Space Soldering Investigation during Expedition 9. 995 RESULTS Five soldering sessions resulted in 86 samples. The experiment samples were returned to the investigator team in late 2005 and were evaluated both nondestructively and then destructively. A number of both expected and unexpected observations were made. Real -time downlink video of the experiment yielded direct observation of the solder melting, equilibrium shape attainment by the liquid, and flux movement. The flux movement was particularly noteworthy because it was entirely unexpected. When the flux was released from the solder during heating, it formed a droplet that spun around the larger solder drop. This surprising movement is driven by thermocapillary flow induced by the temperature gradient and cannot be duplicated on Earth. Researchers developed a model derived from both space -based observations and ground -based experiments to provide insight into the observed flux spinning (Grugel 2006, 2008).

Gerasimov, S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energ ia, Korolev, Russia, Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Study of the Dynamics of Contaminating Substances Emission from Control Liquid Propellant Low-Thrust Jet Engines during Their Pulse Firings and Verification of the Effectiveness of Deflectors for the Protection of ISS External Surfaces from Contamination (Kromka) studies the dynamics of contaminating substance emissions from control liquid propellant low -thrust jet engines during their pulse firings and studies the verification of the effectiveness of devices for the protection of ISS external surfaces from contamination. S PACE BENEFITS The introduction of deflectors on the control liquid propellant low -thrust jets will significantly decrease the deterioration of solar arrays, radiators, and other ISS components by extending their on- orbit service lives, and will decrease the risk of crewmembers' spac esuit contamination upon contact with surfaces during extravehicular activity. R ESULTS The studies included analysis of the chemical composition of fuel/oxidizer reaction products (FORP), visual and instrument -aided analysis of the composition of FORP deposits samples, analysis of the changes of sample optical characteristics, and densitomet ry of the images of control tablets. Using a specially developed procedure, the balance between the mass of deposited and vaporized FORP was determined. It was established that a deflector effectively limits the contamination area from roll thrusters with an angle of ~45\u00b0, thus preventing contamination of structural elements of the ISS Service module. Based on the study results, an angular distribution of FORP in the plume was obtained and used to calculate the predicted contaminating ISS005E05422 - Shows the location of the Kromka tablet near the attitude and pitch thrusters unit (view from DC1 window) . 997 effect of ISS Service module roll thrusters on structural elements and exterior surfaces. During the 4 stages of the Kromka space experiment, the assumptions on the mechanisms of FORP emissions from attitude thruster nozzles into the surrounding area were confirmed, which were determined based on the results of experiments in pressure chambers using actual thrusters and simulated nozzles.

Kinard, PhD, Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virgina RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Materials International Space Station Experiment - 1 and 2 (MISSE -1 and 2) are a test bed for materials and coatings reaction to space exposure. Attached to the outside of the International Space Station (ISS), MISSE accommodates several hundred samples th at are being evaluated for the effects of atomic oxygen (AO), direct sunlight, and extremes of heat and cold. This experiment allows the development and testing of new materials to better withstand the rigors of space environments. E ARTH BENEFITS The n ew advanced materials and components that make up MISSE represent research efforts to improve the performance, increase the useful life, and reduce the costs of future space operations of commercial weather, communication, and ground observation satellites that are crucial to everyday life on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS Results provide a better understanding of the durability of various materials when they are exposed to the space environment. Many of the materials may have applications in the design of future spacecraft. R ESULTS Researchers who took part in MISSE -1 and 2 had interests in polymers, nanocomposites, thermal control coatings, radiation shielding, environmental monitors, and marking processes designed to label parts exposed to the space environment. Primary data from MISSE were obtained by comparing the preflight laboratory characterization of the test specimens with postflight laboratory analyses after the specimens are retrieved. Astronaut Patrick G. Forrester prepares to work with the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE). The experiment was installed on the outside of the Quest Airlock during the first extravehicular activity of the STS -105 mission. MISSE will collect information on how different materials weather in the environment of space. I NASA image . Close up of Materials International Space Station Experiment with Earth backdrop. NASA image. 999 The following information is a sampling of the results obtained from MISSE -1 and 2 thus far. Some particulate contamination was observed. Optical property changes in thermal control materials were also seen. Several materials performed well in the harsh environment. Lack of widespread molecular contamination on MISSE gave confidence in using the ISS for future material studies. However, over 100 micrometeoroid and space debris strikes were found on MISSE surfaces. Atomic Oxygen completely eroded many polymer film samples, but some survived and were analyzed. Many of the experiments provided space -validated result s for ground -based experiments, such as the durability of materials to withstand Atomic Oxygen erosion (AO). Because AO erosion is the primary weathering force to spacecraft materials, and true space environmental conditions are difficult to replicate on E arth, MISSE provided a valuable test platform that enabled methods for validating ground results. Forty -one different polymers called Polymer Erosion and Contamination Experiment (PEACE) Polymers were tested with the objective to determine the atomic oxyge n erosion yield for a variety of materials such as Kevlar\u00ae, polyethelene, Lucite, Kapton\u00ae, and Teflon\u00ae that are used in spacecraft and exposed to the space environment. The erosion yield data are immediately applicable to spacecraft designs. Even though th e length of exposure was 4 times longer than planned, the sample preparation method of stacking many thin layers allowed for meaningful data with residual samples even after 4 years. In addition to testing various materials, experiments were also set up to measure the geometry of atomic oxygen scattering from oxidized aluminum surfaces. MISSE -1 and - 2 results expanded knowledge into atomic oxygen erosion and resulted in several patents and spin- offs ranging from cleaning artwork methods, parts etching to be used in human grafts, new methodologies for testing blood sugar, and more. Because MISSE assembled partners across industry and the Department of Defense, in addition to NASA scientists and academic partners, many of the results were proprietary.

Kinard, PhD, Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES Materials on the International Space Station Experiment 3 and 4 (MISSE -3 and 4) are the third and fourth in a series of suitcase -sized test beds attached to the outside of the space station. Environmental sensors record the thermal cycling (the change i n temperature), and the effects that atomic oxygen (single oxygen molecules) and ultraviolet light have on materials are also studied. New material that might be used in the next generation of extravehicular activity (EVA) suits is tested to examine how the material reacts to the harsh space environment. Research findings can be used to design stronger, more durable materials for space and Earth applications. E ARTH BENEFITS The new advanced materials and components tested in MISSE -3 and 4 could prove use ful in improving the performance, increase the service life, and reduce costs of future space operations of commercial weather, communication and Earth observation satellites that we all now depend on. The participation of school children in experiments wi th plant seeds from the MISSE -3 and 4 stimulates their interest in science and helps to inspire and promote the development of future space scientists and research. S PACE BENEFITS Results provide a better understanding of the durability of various materials when they are exposed to the space environment. Many of the materials may have applications in the design of future spacecraft and equipment. R ESULTS MISSE -3 and 4 experiments were very similar to experiments flown on MISSE -1 and 2. The Electromagnetic Interference Sh ielding experiment was the only experiment flown on MISSE -3 and 4, which was not also flown on MISSE -1 and 2. MISSE -3 and 4 also exposed approximately a million basil seeds for school science experiments. Preliminary assessments that included results from previous MISSE -flown materials, suggested that the contamination control for the station\u2014 the method for tracking whether scientific Materials on the International Space Station Experiment 3 and 4 following deployment on the outside of ISS on August 3, 2006.

Kinard, Ph D, Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia Robert J. Walters, PhD, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Materials on the International Space Station Experiment - 5 (MISSE -5) is a suitcase -sized experiment attached to the outside of the International Space Station (ISS). It exposes hundreds of potential space construction materials to the environment. The samples are returned to Earth for study after a set exposure period. Researchers can use the knowledge gained from the results to design stronger, more durable materials for a variety of applications. E ARTH BENEFITS The new advanced materials and components tested in MISSE can help improve the performance, increase the useful life, and reduce the costs of future space operations of commercial weather, communication, and Earth observation satellites that we all now depend on. S PACE BENEFITS More reliable and robust materials help construction of spacecraft, instrument, and satellites that will last longer in the harsh conditions of space. R ESULTS The following information is a sampling o f the results obtained from MISSE -5 thus far. MISSE -5 contained active and passive investigations: The Forward Technology Solar Cell Experiment (FTSCE), an active experiment that tested the performance of 36 current and advanced generation solar cells f or use on future spacecraft; the active Second Prototype Communication Satellite System (PCSat -2) that provided a communication system and tested the Amateur Satellite Service off -the-shelf solution for telemetry command and control; and the passive MISSE -5 Thermal Blanket Materials Experiment, which consisted of several Views of MISSE -5 mounted on the International Space Station P6 truss. PcSat -2 is protected by a golden thermal blanket with flexible material samples attached. NASA image. 1005 individual experiments to measure the degradation of more than 200 materials in the space environment. MISSE -5 passive investigation tested a wide variety of materials. Some focused on new polymers with additives to slow the atomic oxygen erosion process. Others tested both new and old thermal control materials used in multilayer insulation blankets. MISSE 5 PFTC materials experiment consisted of 33 tensile specimens including many of the same types of polymer films exposed in the MISSE 1 -4 Gossamer Materials and PFTC experiments. Results from this experiment are compared to ram and wake facing polymers in the MISSE 1 -4 Gossamer Materials and PFTC experiments. The data were compared with other flight experiments and analyzed for solar absorbance, contamination, and other effects. The majority of the samples flown on MISSE -5 experienced some loss in tensile strength and percent elongation as a result of exposure to the harsh environment. Comparing MISSE 1 and MISSE 5 test results indicated that the loss in tensile strength for the coated FEP Te flon samples was independent of the VUV and radiation levels or number of thermal cycles indicating that there may be a da mage limit which MISSE 1 and 5 both exceeded for this property. The levels at which changes occurred, and which environment factor or combination of factors caused these changes was unclear and needs further investigation in experiments where these factors can be controlled or eliminated independently.

Kinard, PhD, Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Materials International Space Station Experiment - 6A and 6B (MISSE -6A and 6 B) is a sample box attached to the outside of the International Space Station (ISS); it is used for testing the effects of exposure to the space environment on small samples of new materials. These samples will be evaluated for their reaction to atomic oxy gen erosion, direct sunlight, radiation, and extremes of heat and cold. Results provide a better understanding of the durability of various materials, with important applications in the design of future spacecraft. E ARTH BENEFITS These results provide an improved understanding of the durability of various silk and collagen materials in Earth orbit, with implications for the design of future materials for medical procedures and also physiology applications. S PACE BENEFITS Results provide a better understanding of the durability of various materials when they are exposed to the space environment. Many of the materials may have applications for various needs during space travel. For example, protein -inorganic composites could be an important path forward in designing durable protein materials for space needs, as would protein materials pre -cross -linked on Earth to reduce the radiation impact. R ESULTS The following information is a sampling of the results obtained from MISSE -6A and 6B thus far. Collagen and silk were flown to the ISS in the Materials International Space Station Experiment - 6A and 6B (MISSE -6A and 6B) and exposed to space for nearly 18 months. All protein materials were changed but to different degrees depending on the material. Around 10 -15% surface depth of silk and collagen films was etched away by heavy ionizing particles such as atomic oxygen, the major component of the low -Earth orbit space environment . Similar surface Close -up view of Materials I nternational Space Station Experiment -6A and 6B Passive Experiment Container on European Laboratory/Columbus. NASA image. 1008 damage was created by oxygen plasma et ching exposure control experiments on Earth. Unexpectedly, laboratory analysis revealed that more than 80% of the silk and collagen protein chains were chemically cross -linked by penetrating space radiation, which caused changes to the proteins. Silk -silica composites or triple -helix structures in native Type I collagens were more resistant to the impact of radiation in space than silk. It was also shown that resistance to high heat decreased after space travel for the protein samples. Results suggested tha t protein materials could be bioengineered to help protect them in the extreme space environments. Black Kapton \u00ae XC polyimide films on MISSE -6A and 6B exhibited a higher erosion rate when the films were stretched during the exposure period. Although a sli ght stress dependence was also observed in the ground- based samples, both in appearance and in the erosion yield, it was not to the extent seen in the space -exposed samples. Differences such as atomic oxygen, levels of UV radiation, temperature, and charge d particles between the ground based and space environments could have caused this difference. Coatings of silicon dioxide and silicon showed evidence of cracking while under stress. This type of cracking can lead to failure of the underlying polymer material if cracks are exposed to high levels of atomic oxygen. This appeared to be the cause of failure for the silicon oxide (SiOx) coated Kapton flown on the ram side of MISSE -6A and 6B. Microscopic photos of the Kapton XC samples showed very little erosion on the unstressed samples but noticeable surface texturing under slight stress, and almost complete erosion under stresses greater than the tensile yield stress. The failure of vapor deposited aluminum (VDA) polymer films appeared to be dependent on the level of environment exposure. VDA samples under stress exposed on the ram side of MISSE -6A and 6B failed while the sample exposed under stress on the wake side did not. MISSE -6A and 6B hosted samples with titanium and aluminum oxide cermet coating having the optical properties of high- solar absorptance and low infrared emittance. Spectral reflectance data obtained before and after flight revealed essentially no change in the optical properties of solar absorptance and infrared emittance upon low -Earth orbi t exposure, consistent with ground laboratory evaluation of similar cermet coatings. An atomic oxygen fluence monitor, flown as part of the MISSE -6B, was designed to measure the accumulation of atomic oxygen fluence with time as it impinged upon the ram ( front) surface of MISSE -6B. This was an active experiment for which data was to be stored on a battery -powered data logger for post- flight retrieval and analysis. An atomic oxygen fluence of 1.37 \u00b1 0.16\u00d71021 atoms/cm 2 was measured. The fluence was approximately 30% lower than fluences measured using Kapton\u00ae H samples from an adjoining MISSE -6A passive experiment container. Further testing is needed to isolate the factors that resulted in increased erosion under stress. T hese findings are crit ical for designing next -generation biocompatible materials and measurement systems for the space environments, where the effects of heavy ionizing particles and other cosmic radiation need to be considered. Further testing is needed to isolate the factors that result in increased erosion under stress. 1009 PUBLICATION (S) Hu X, Raja WK, An B, Tokareva O, Cebe P, Kaplan DL.

Walters, PhD, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Materials International Space Station Experiment -7 (MISSE -7) is a test bed attached to the outside of the International Space Station for materials and coatings being evaluated for the effects of atomic oxygen, ultraviolet, direct sunlight, radiation, and extremes of heat and cold. This experiment allows t he development and testing of new materials to better withstand the rigors of space environment. Results provide a better understanding of the durability of various materials when they are exposed to the space environment with applications in the construction of future spacecraft. E ARTH BENEFITS The new advanced materials and components demonstrated in MISSE help to show how improvements can be made to the performance, useful life, and cost reduction of future space operations of commercial weather, communication, and Earth observation satellites that we all now depend on. Materials International Space Station Experiment image taken from the STS -133 mission mounted outside the International Space Stati on. NASA image. 1011 SPACE BENEFITS Results provide a better understanding of the durability of various materials when they are exposed to the space environment. Many of the materials may have applications in the design of future spacecraft. R ESULTS The following information is a sampling of the results obtained from MISSE -7 thus far. Six samples of pristine and dust- abraded, outer -layer spacesuit fabrics were exposed to the wake low- Earth orbit (LEO) environment on the International Space Station (ISS) for 18 months in order to determine whether abrasion by lunar dust increases fabric deterioration from radiation. Comparison of pre and postflight showed that space radiation darkened and reddened all 6 fabrics increasing their integrated solar absorptance by 7% to 38%. There was a decrease in the ultimate tensile strength and elongation to failure of lunar dust -abraded Apollo spacesuit fibers by a factor of 4 and an increase in the elastic modulus (tendency to be deformed) by a factor of 2. The lunar dust- laden Apollo 12 sample darkened, but did not appreciably redden, though it appeared redder to the eye. No evidence of contamination was found suggesting that the discoloration was due to radiation damage. Even though the samples were positioned on the wake (backward) side, because the ISS periodically reorients, the samples were exposed to the equivalent of about 38 days of ram (forward) atomic oxygen (AO) bombardment. Evidence for this was seen in the oxidation of silver -coated fasteners and the etching of fabric fibers. The erosi on seen in the fibers was consistent with previously reported values for the erosion yields of the materials. The severity of the degradation of the fabric samples over the 18 -month exposure period show that as materials wear out over time they absorb more energy and get hotter demonstrating the necessity to find ways to reduce radiation damage to spacesuits when planning extended exploration- class space missions.

NASA image. 1012 Modern multijunction (MJ) solar cells require stable optical coatings that provide wider spectral protection. The requirement to transmit shorter wavelengths to the top cell of the MJ device imposed new challenges for coatings. Ultraviolet reflection (UVR) and wide -band antireflection (AR) multilayer coatings were applied on working solar cell covers and test substrates and subsequently exposed in space on MISSE -7 along with space -simulated ground tests to determine their performance and stability. Observed effects of long space exposure on the coatings and assembled solar cells were small. UVR/AR coatings showed stable optical properties after exposure to proton, UV, atomic oxygen, and protected flexible polymer substrate materials. The technology for produ cing effective space -mission coatings that operate to UV wavelengths near 200 nm was successfully demonstrated. Further development is pending, including more exposure tests of UVR, AR, and transparent conductive oxide (TCO) coatings on flexible substrat e alternatives and coatings integrated with MJ cells. Progress was made toward developing stable and protective coatings with improved resistance to radiation-induced darkening for extended space -mission applications. The additional requirements that the c oatings on MJ flexible solar arrays tolerate deployment from being rolled up, and prevent static accumulation and discharge, were also satisfied.

Walters, PhD, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Materials on International Space Station Exp eriment - 8 (MISSE -8) tests various materials and computing elements on the exterior of the space station. The payload container is mounted so one side faces the Earth and the other faces space. The harsh environment of low - Earth orbit exposes the materials to a vacuum, atomic oxygen, ultraviolet radiation, direct sunlight, and extreme heat and cold. The experiments provide a better understanding of material durability, from coatings to electronic sensors, which could be applied to future spacecraft designs . E ARTH BENEFITS Ultraviolet radiation, oxidization, and other phenomena happen on Earth as well as in space. Research on atomic oxygen oxidation could improve designs of fire -retardant and rust - resistant material on Earth. Interactions between various materials and solar ultraviolet radiation could improve terrestrial structures, such as plastic siding for houses. In addition, the MISSE experiments could lead to better protective designs for communications and weather satellites. S PACE BENEFITS Many of the materials and sensors tested in the MISSE experiments could be incorporated into new spacecraft designs. Advanced materials tested with MISSE could also improve the performance of satellites, solar cells, and other space -based technology. Missi ons on other planets have already benefitted from MISSE research: a static -dissipating paint tested in a previous MISSE experiment now coats components of NASA's Curiosity Mars rover. R ESULTS The following information is a sampling of the results obtaine d from MISSE -8 thus far. The Communications Interface Board (CIB), developed with radiation tolerance and reliability as the primary design considerations, was an improved communications architecture demonstration on the ISS. MISSE -7 was the first spacef light of this technology. The CIB View of STS -134 Mission Specialist Andrew Feustel working to install a new Materials International Space Station Experiment - 8 on the Expedite the Processing of Experiments to Space Station Logistics Carrier 2. NASA image. 1014 simplified the communications interface to the ISS for real -time health monitoring, telemetry, and control of resident sensors or experiments. With over 40months of spaceflight operation, the CIB successfully supported 2 sets of flight experiments: 1) the silicon carbide junction gate field -effect transistor (SiC JFET) is a high -temperature component that is used throughout a spacecraft including health monitoring in extremely hot environments. 2) the second Forward Techno logy Solar Cell Experiment (FTSCE II) demonstrated solar cell health monitoring on the ISS with real- time telemetry enabled by the CIB. The CIB accomplished this by acting as a bridge between the ISS low -rate telemetry (LRT) bus and the sensors that allowe d for 2 -way command and telemetry data transfer. The CIB, currently operating in flight on the ISS, also enabled future materials, software, and device development, which lead to further use in health monitoring systems.

Area: Spacecraft Materials Expedition(s): 16 Principal Investigator(s): Richard Cobb, PhD, Air Force Institute of Technology, Wright - Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Rigidizable Inflatable Get -Away -Special Experiment (RIGEX) operates in the Space Shuttle Cargo Bay and is designed to test and collect data on inflated tubes that are heated and cooled to form stiff structures in space. E ARTH BENEFITS This technology can lead to an increase in communication satellites that provide television, telephone, and communication services. S PACE BENEFITS Inflatable structures can be used for antennas, communication satellites, trusses for space stations, and support structures for solar sails and can also provide a light -weight, compact, and cost -reducing option for future spacecraft missions. R ESULTS There are no published results. This investigation is complete and all results are published.

A. Romera, European Space Agency, Noordwijk, Netherlands RESEARCH OBJECTIVES European Technology Exposure Facility -Thermometer ( EuTEMP) is an autonomous, battery - powered, multi -input thermometer that is used to measure temperatures on the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF) during the unpowered transfer from the Shuttle Cargo Bay to the Columbus External Payload Facility to which EuTEF was attached for 18 months. Some of the EuTEF instruments could be s ensitive to temperature variations, and ESA wants to determine what temperatures would be experienced during the transfer phase. R ESULTS EuTEMP started recording temperature data 8 hours after activation of the 28V Stay Alive Feeders, which occurred on February 7, 2008. This was just under 80 minutes after launch of STS- 122 Space Shuttle Atlantis. Once in orbit, the shuttle's cargo bay door s were opened to allow exposure of the shuttle's environmental control and life support system radiators for heat rejection of the orbiter's systems. Temperatures then decreased while in the usual cargo bay facing Earth, which is a standard attitude for the shuttle and also showed a decrease whenever Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) alignment maneuvers were made that pointed the bay to space. The temperatures also decreased during rendezvous and docking with the International Space Station (ISS). Following docking, the temperatures measured by EuTemp started rising after the Columbus laboratory was removed from the shuttle cargo bay (after 20.00 GMT) on February 10 for installation on the ISS. Two negative peaks followed on February 13 due to spacewalk activities to install a new Nitrogen Tank Assembly. The first peak was due to deactivation of the 28V Stay Alive Feeders between 15.26 and 16.36 GMT to remove the new Nitrogen Tank Assembly (NTA) from the cargo carrier in the shuttle's cargo bay (to which EuTE F and the Solar facility were also installed). The second peak was due to deactivation of the 28V feeders between 18.36 and 20.02 GMT to install an old Nitrogen Tank Assembly back onto the cargo carrier in the shuttle's cargo bay. A similar small peak was experienced on February 15 due to removal of the solar facility from the cargo carrier (feeders deactivated from 14:40 -14:55 GMT). The most significant drop was seen on February 15 after 16:56 GMT (when the feeders were again deactivated) due to the trans fer of the EuTEF facility (with EuTemp) from the cargo bay to the Columbus External Facility. Following its installation, the temperatures started stabilization after 20:03 on February 16 after activation of the 120V feeders on the external Payload Facilit y. This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected. 1017 HEAT TRANSFER PERFORMANCES OF A GROOVED HEAT PIPE (HEAT) Research Area: Thermal Management Systems Expedition(s): 8 and 9 Principal Investigator(s): Jean -Claude Legros, University of Brussels, Belgium Laurent Barremaecker, Euro Heat Pipes, Nivelles, Belgium RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The goal of the Heat Transfer Performances of a Grooved Heat (Heat) experiment is the improvement of heat pipe design, not only for future application in spaceflight and space research but also for improved cooling systems here on Earth. R ESULTS Typical burn -out conditions were analyzed in order to derive the maximum heat transport capabilities of the heat pipe. The heat transfer coefficients were also derived before the burn - out conditions. For the heat transport capability, it can be noticed that the performances of the AG110 (the specific aluminum grooved profile under testing) in weightlessness were equivalent or higher than the 1g horizontal conditions. For the heat transfer coefficient, a very significant improvement is observed in microgravity. For equivalent test configurations, the improvement factor was from 2 to 2.3 times better in weightlessness. The preliminary software correlation showed that the EHP weightlessness predictions were in line with the m easurements (about 14%). Very promising results were recorded and show good correlation with the heat pipe involved physical laws and predictions. Further tests in weightlessness are now needed to cover heat pipes with larger diameter and full operational temperature range. P UBLICATION (S) Goffaux C, Van Oost S, Barremaecker L.

Environmental conditions during transportation are very important for biological specimens and reagents for life -science experiments. This investigation uses commercial small temperature data loggers to record the environmental conditions of cargo vehicles. E ARTH BENEFIT New knowledge is expected to be the major benefit of this investigation. S PACE BENEFIT It is now possible to offer temperature survey data in each vehicle to the users who are considering launching cargo aboard each vehicle to ISS. Thereby, it becomes easy to plan for launch or return of experimental samples. R ESULTS TEM packages were installed inside soft bags and launched by each assigned vehicle. Data loggers of TEM automatically measured and recorded temperatures during transportation to the ISS. After ISS docking, TEM packages were moved to an in -orbit storage area in the JEM. Data eventually retrieved is provided to the science team for analysis. This investigation is ongoing and additional results are pending publication. Transport Environment Monitor is composed of 3 commercial , small temperature loggers.

We include and summarize the results of operations that have generated valuable scientific data that enable scientists and engineers to better define problems and understand the space environment. 1020 INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION SUMMARY OF RESEARCH PERFORMED (ISS SUMMARY OF RESEARCH ) RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The International Space Station (ISS) Program lends itself to periodically summarizing the status of the program as a whole or sometimes a particular area. The purpose of this entry is to capture those publications in one location for accessibility to the community as a whole. E ARTH BENEFITS This project is applied to new knowledge and not specifically to advances in space exploration. S PACE BENEFITS New knowledge is expected to be the major benefit of this project. R ESULTS The ISS partnership has produced substantial research in a wide range of disciplines. Benefits come from the engineering development, the international partnership, and from the research results. To date, over 63 countries have directly participated in som e aspect of ISS research or education (Thumm 2012). The configurability and human -tended capabilities of the ISS provide a unique platform. The international utilization strategy is based on research ranging from physical sciences, biology, medicine, psy chology, to Earth observation, human exploration preparation and technology demonstration. The ability to complete follow -on investigations in a period of months allows researchers to make rapid advances based on new knowledge gained from ISS activities. D uring the utilization phase, the ISS partners are working together to track the objectives, accomplishments and the applications of the new knowledge gained. Scientific knowledge and new technologies derived from research on the ISS will be realized throug h improving quality of life on Earth and future spaceflight endeavors (Thumm 2010).

Pettit, PhD, NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Don Pettit, Expedition 6 NASA International Space Station science officer, used his free time, usually Saturday mornings, while living aboard the International Space Station to shed the light of science on a variety of s ubjects for students of all ages. These demonstrations were chronicled and dubbed \"Saturday Morning Science.\" E ARTH BENEFITS The simple demonstrations using everyday material for Saturday Morning Science will play a major role in inspiring the next generation to take the journey into space. SPACE BENEFITS The simple inspired demonstrations performed during Saturday Morning Science will provide insight into how fluids and other objects behave in microgravity compared to the gravity on Earth. RESULTS Several articles have been published on Saturday Morning Science. Although simple, Saturday Morning Science often demonstrated phenomena that had not been seen in microgravity. An article published in Sky and Telescope in October 2003 titled \"Shooting the Heavens from Space\" discussed the amazing views and images captured by astronauts as they live and work in space. In April 2004, another article published in Sky and Telescope titled \"Building Planets in Plastic Bags \" based on water observations performed as a Saturday Science demonstration. The demonstration involved observing how salt grains clumped in water while in microgravity. During this demonstration, Pettit unknowingly demonstrated middle stage planetary accr etion. A summary paper of the demonstration was published in Lunar and Planetary Science in 2004 concluded that although the demonstration lacked formal controls to identify the exact clumping mechanism, the mechanism is obviously electrostatic. Future inv estigations of this phenomenon will use realistic materials such as rock dust.

Once the capability of the pulmonary function system (PFS) to perform PFEs is verified, crew members will be able to integrate their monthly PFE with oxyge n consumption measurements to fulfill the requirement for cardiovascular fitness evaluations during long -duration spaceflight. E ARTH BENEFITS Little information is currently available on the effects of long -term exposure to a closed life control system mi crogravity environment on aerobic capacity of humans. This information is important to maintain crew health during long -duration exploration. The data will also provide valuable insight into the aerobic capacity of teams in closed environments on Earth, su ch as arctic bases and submarines. S PACE BENEFITS The PFE -OUM measurements will help flight surgeons to better understand the decline in cardiovascular function that occurs during long -duration stays in microgravity. R ESULTS Analysis of data from PFE -OUM is ongoing, conclusive results will be published upon completion of data analysis. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication.

Crew health before, during and following spaceflight is essential to overall ISS mission success. All of the partner agencies recognize the importance of crew health to mission success and are dedicated to maintaining the health of all crew members throughout all phases of ISS missions. E ARTH BENEFITS Maintaining crew member health and safety while in orbit better ensures that crew member functionality is not jeopardized as a result of time spent on a mission, therefore, allowing them to resume life on Earth unaffected by space travel. S PACE BENEFITS The optimization of crew health and safety increases the productivity of their performance while conducting in- orbit operations. With humans cur rently occupying the International Space Station (ISS) for 6 months and space exploration missions of 1 to 3 years on the horizon, preservation of crew member health status and monitoring is a major objective of the international space community. R ESULTS Medical Monitoring covers a wide array of distinct ISS investigational studies. Below are some of the results that encompass the Medical Monitoring on ISS. A study has found that long -duration, but not short- , spaceflight prolongs cardiac electrical conduction and heart muscle recovery. Shifts in systemic cardiac regulation and primary cardiac changes may be responsible. Long -duration flight is associated with ISS030E012609 - NASA astronaut Dan Burbank (foreground), Expedition 30 commander, and Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, flight engineer, participate in a Crew Health Care System medical contingency drill in the Destiny laboratory of the International Space Station. Thi s drill gives crew members the opportunity to work as a team in resolving a simulated medical emergency aboard the space station. Image courtesy of NASA . 1042 slower heart rate and may increase arrhythmia susceptibility. It is recommended that medication that decreases the heart rate should be administered with caution during and after long -duration spaceflight (D'Aunno 2003). Highly sensitive and selective cardiovascular screening before flight is the most effective method of reducing the risk of a cardiac event in space. Current studies support adding electron -beam computed tomography (EBCT) and highly selective C -(capsular) reactive protein (hsCRP) for diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in current and future candidates for space missions. The recommended initial astronaut selection and long -duration mission assignment screening algorithms use EB CT-derived calcium scores and serum hsCRP levels to screen for CAD and predict individual cardiac risk. The proposed screening methods with the latest diagnostic capabilities attempt to improve on the current selection and retention standards, and also fulfill the operational space medicine goal of preventing the occurrence of cardiovascular illness or impaired performance during spaceflight (Hamilton 2006). Research has shown that the immune system is less efficient during spaceflight. Miniature and semi -automated diagnostic systems to perform a set of biological and immunological tests aboard spacecrafts will allow the study of the causes of space -related immune deficiency and the development of countermeasures to maintain an opt imal immune function and prevent infectious diseases during space missions. By monitoring the astronaut's immune responses on one side, and their environment on the other side, new set of diagnostic tools will fill our knowledge gap and decrease one of the risks of space missions. In addition, the development of a micro -flow cytometer (cell counter) with the characteristics needed for spaceflight (low power consumption, small footprint) will have great impact on point -of-care diagnostics and medical facilit ies in remote areas and resource -poor countries and in situ environmental monitoring and control. Similarly, the automation and miniaturization of DNA- based analytical tests will be greatly beneficial to medical care on Earth. Three independent subject groups that included balance impaired patients, normal subjects before and after 30 minutes of 40% bodyweight unloaded treadmill walking, and astronauts before and after long -duration spaceflight were tested to determine body load -sensing and vestibular(inner ear canals) sensing influences on head movement control during treadmill walking after long -duration spaceflight. Data collected show that exposure to unloaded walking caused a significant increase in head pitch movements in normal subjects, whereas the head pitch movements of impaired patients were significantly decreased. This is the first evidence of ISS020E040433 - Nicole Stott performs routine tasks aboard the International Space Station while ECG (using the HRF Holter Monitor 2) and continuous blood pressure data (using the ESA Cardiopres) are recorded for the Integrated Cardiovascular experiment. Image courtesy of NASA . 1043 adaptation of vestibular mediated head movement responses to unloaded treadmill walking. Astronaut subjects showed mixed respo nse of both increases and decreases in the amplitude of head pitch movement. These results indicate that body load- sensing input centrally influences vestibular input and can adaptively modify vestibular control of head -movement during locomotion. Thus, spaceflight may cause central adaptation of the converging vestibular and body load -sensing systems leading to alterations in head movement control ( Mulavara 2012) .

Smith, PhD, NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Nutritional assessments of astronauts before, during, and after spaceflight ensure adequate intake of energy, protein, and vitamins during missions. Scientists use the information to understand the connections between nutrition and human health during spaceflight, and to develop effective dietary strategies to reduce adverse health impacts. E ARTH BENEFITS Increased understanding of th e connections between nutrition and bone loss has potential value for patients suffering bone loss on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS Nutritional monitoring is vital to ensuring crew health during long -duration spaceflight. The results are being used to identify specific effects of microgravity on nutrient- dependent processes such as vitamin uptake, antioxidant production, and metabolism of iron. Alterations to nutrient assimilation in microgravity are also important for studies of bone loss while in microgravity. R ESULTS Results have been compiled and analyzed for International Space Station (ISS) crew members. Intake of energy (relative to World Health Organization standards) was observed to generally decrease over time during missions . However, when dietary counseling was provided to a single astronaut during flight, adequate energy intake was maintained throughout the mission. Body weight, total bone mineral content, and bone mineral density decreased during flight. Antioxidant capaci ty decreased during flight, leading to increased susceptibility to genetic damage from radiation. Vitamin D concentration in crew bone was decreased, and bone resorption increased, by long exposure to microgravity. The relative concentrations of other bloo d and urine analytes preflight and postflight were variable and subject to several confounding factors that limit conclusions as to particular effects of spaceflight (Smith, 2005, 2008). The results of this study formed the basis for the nutrition and repo sitory experiments, currently being operated on the ISS.

E ARTH BENEFITS Understanding gastrointestinal disorders and diseases in adverse environmental conditions help to improve delivery methods of medications for treatment, establish innovative, non - invasive ways to measure drug availability in the body, and validate inexpens ive ambient storage for biological samples. S PACE BENEFITS This project will help scientists improve the design of medications provided to crew members during space exploration to maximize the effect of the medication when taken in microgravity. R ESULTS Analysis of data from Pharmacokinetics is ongoing, conclusive results will be published upon completion of data analysis. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. Image of acetaminophen tablets.

EARTH BENEFITS New knowledge is expected to be the major benefit of this project. SPACE BENEFITS Possible countermeasures may be developed to mitigate space - induced ocular impairments. R ESULTS Since 1989, as part of the postflight eye examination, astronauts were queried as to whether they perceived a subjective improvement or degradation in distant or near vision (none, mild, moderate, or severe) during their short - and long -duration missions. Prompted by persistent reports of visi on changes, NASA began a stepwise operational process to determine the c ause(s). Several ophthalmic procedures were initiated on astronauts, including dilated fundus (the rear portion of the eye) examinations with binocular ophthalmoscopy, cycloplegic ref raction, optical coherence tomography (OCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of orbits, and fundus photography for before and after space missions. In a follow -up study, twenty -seven astronauts underwent thin- section, three -dimensional, eye orbital, and conventional MRI brain scans. Eight astronauts underwent repeat imaging after an additional mission in space. All astronauts had previous exposure to microgravity. Image analysis of the optic nerve sheath, optic disc, posterior globe, and pituitary gland w as performed and compared for association with intracranial evidence of excessive fluid buildup inside the skull, cells, tissues, or body cavities, venous blood clotting in the brain and/or mass lesion. Visual acuity degradation in astronauts exposed to m icrogravity is a newly recognized phenomenon. Although the exact mechanism is yet to be fully determined, many MRI findings suggest that intracranial hypertension is an important component. However, a large proportion ISS030E235670 - Don Pettit perform s Ultrasound Eye Imaging in the Columbus Module of International Space Station during Expedition 30. Image courtesy of NASA . 1050 of astronauts do not show these ocular effects, suggesting there could be variable biologic response to the spaceflight environment and warrants a search for existing risk factors. Standardization of qualitative and quantitative imaging criteria will further help in the identification of asymp tomatic changes and allow for the use of countermeasures to mitigate potential long -term vision damage. Future studies involving advance tissue imaging techniques would improve our understanding of the cause -versus -effect relationship of intracranial pressure after exposure to microgravity (Kramer 2012).

E ARTH BENEFITS This study will allow for better understanding of normal balance and su ggest causes for abnormal balance in patients on Earth. If OVAR, associated with a 3 -D eye movement measuring system, proves that reliable information about otolith organs can be obtained, then this test has obvious clinical value to assess vestibular disorders. S PACE BENEFITS This study will allow for better understanding of normal balance and suggest causes for abnormal balance related to microgravity exposure. In particular, spaceflight will provide knowledge and understanding of the vestibular system (sensory system that contributes to balance and sense of orientation), which is one of the systems most affected by gravity. R ESULTS OVAR has the advantage of generating cyclic testing control of OCR, allowing averaged measurements over several cycles, presumably improving measurement accuracy over static head tilt tests. Results show there was no significant difference in OCR during OVAR immediately afte r landing compared to preflight. However, the perceived degree of the roll tilt during OVAR was significantly larger immediately postflight, and then returned to control values in the following days. Since the OCR response is mainly due to the shearing force exerted on the otoliths by tilt relative to gravity, the absence of change in OCR postflight suggests that the peripheral otolith organs function normally after short- term spaceflight. However, the increased sense of roll tilt indicates an adaptation in the central neural processing of Off Vertical Rotation - Measurement of Perception and Video Recording of Eye Movements . ESA image. 1052 gravitational input, supposedly related to a re -weighting of the internal model of gravity, or lack thereof, as an adaptation to microgravity. These results suggest a separation between otolith- driven eye movement and orientation perception during passive vestibular stimulation by inertial motion after spaceflight, and support the conclusion that otolith- driven compensatory eye movement and orientation perception are controlled by different neural mechanisms. OCR is primarily a direct response of otolith activation by low -frequency linear acceleration along the axis between the ears, whereas perception of tilt is primarily governed by the integration of otolith inputs, as well as bodily sensations such as position of limbs and pressure on the skin and internal organs. Apparently, the peripheral vestibular organ showed little or no changes after 10 -13 days spaceflight, thus otolith- driven eye movements appear relatively unaffected by short- term exposure to microgravity. Howev er, the central processing of orientation relative to gravity is likely to be affected and suggests why perceptual and oculomotor responses dependent on central vestibular processing can be greatly disrupted (Clement 2007, 2012).

Paloski, PhD, NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Spatial Reorientation Followin g Spaceflight (Spatial) study examines adaptive changes in spatial processing for balance control following short -duration spaceflight. The first specific aim of this study was to examine adaptive changes in spatial processing for balance control following spaceflight by incorporating static and dynamic tilts that disassociate head and gravity reference frames. Impairments to sensorimotor (sensory and motor) coordinatio n of body segments following spaceflight are more pronounced after landing when the head is actively tilted with respect to the trunk. This suggests that central vestibular processing shifts from a gravitational frame of reference (aligned with gravity vec tor) to a head frame of reference (aligned to head position) in microgravity. A major effect of such changes is a significant postural instability. Decreases in functional performance may still be underestimated when head and gravity reference frames remained aligned. A second aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of altering the re -adaptation process by providing discordant visual -vestibular somatosensory (sensory system perception) stimuli using short -radius pitch centrifugation. Previous obser vations suggested that conflicting sensory stimuli caused by an unusual motion environment disrupted spatial orientation and balance control in a returning crew member possibly by triggering a change in the central vestibular system (inner ear, eyes, and t he central nervous system). E ARTH BENEFITS A better understanding of the characteristics of sensorimotor recovery from short- duration spaceflights will help in understanding the mechanisms related to the adaptation of balance control. The findings are als o expected to demonstrate the feasibility of triggering state changes between sensorimotor control sets using a centrifuge device. The results will also be of use to clinical and military researchers interested in adaptive changes in spatial processing to altered gravitational environments, and the fragility of the sensorimotor adaptive processes. These findings will improve the understanding of the functional risks to crew members after A view of the posturography (the study of posture and its effects on health) system located in the JSC Neuroscience Laboratories. As a part of the medical requirement test battery, posturography is currently being performed on returning short and long duration crewmembers to assist in determining their return-to -duty status. ESA image. 1054 transitions between altered gravito -inertial (having different strengths of gravity) environments. SPACE BENEFITS Conducting studies involving balance control before and after spaceflight will provide information and understanding of the effects introduced by space habitation in regards to sensorimotor function. Understanding such changes is essential in maintaining the health and functional performance of crew members during missions in micro - and partial- gravity environments. R ESULTS Analysis of data from Spatial is ongoing, conclusive results will be published upon completion of data analysis. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. The Short Arm Centrifuge (SAC) in the JSC Neuroscience Laboratories allowed pitch centrifugation which produced discordant canal -otolith -somatosensory stimuli to illicit changes in the readaptation process.

Allen, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES The International Space Station Acoustic Measurement Program (ISS Acoustics) is responsible for ensuring a safe, healthy, and habitable acoustic environment on the ISS in which crews can live, communicate, and work. This means ensuring that space vehicle environments are not too noisy, do not have irritating audible sounds, and do not have startling bursts of acousti c energy. E ARTH BENEFITS Data resulting from measuring acoustics on the ISS are useful in other extreme environments on Earth, such as submarines or underwater laboratories. S PACE BENEFITS Information from ISS Acoustics is used to ensure safe and habitable noise levels for crew members living and working aboard the ISS. ISS Acoustics data are used to compare with noise level predictions for upcoming spaceflight missions. R ESULTS The ISS presents a significant acoustics challenge considering all of the modules and equipment that make it an in -orbit laboratory and home with long -duration crew occupation. The acoustic environment aboard the ISS has become one of the highest crew habitability concerns. The acoustics mission support function, including training, mission control support, and data analysis, is necessary to monitor crew exposure and ensure that the crew members' hearing is not at risk. Without accurate in -orbit data, all preventative ground efforts are rendered ineffective. Mission monitoring and support is critical to the control and mitigation of acoustic noise on the ISS. ISS Acoustics preserves c rew members' hearing and provides for a safe, productive, and comfortable noise environment (Limardo 2011). The Acoustics Office at Johnson Space Center (JSC) performs valuable management oversight over acoustic activities. The JSC acoustics team provides beneficial support of modules, payloads, and government furnished equipment requirements definition, design and development, consultation, and applies proactive efforts to help hardware providers achieve compliance (Allen 2011). The ISS005E12372 - Flight Engineer Sergei Treschev takes measurements with a sound level meter in the US l aboratory during Expedition 5. NASA image. 1056 acoustic team also man ages predictions for flight readiness, in -orbit measurements, and maintains a database of measurements, and distributes reports and assessments of the data. It is important that the ISS noise be in compliance with current specifications. This is important to ensure acceptable crew communications, health, and well- being. Data collected from the space shuttle and Mir programs indicate that levels at or close to 70 dBA should be considered ISS daily exposure limits. These limits are justified in view of crew e xperience, especially considering the variability in crew member physiological and psychological response to noise (Goodman 2003). ISS Acoustics develops measures to safeguard the crew members' hearing, ensures there are work- arounds for excessively noisy areas or mission events, and provides for a secure, productive, and comfortable noise environment. This is aided by module noise monitoring, noise abatement, and restricting crew noise exposure during a mission (Pilkinton 2003). PUBLICATION (S) Allen CS, Denham SA.

E ARTH BENEFITS This study involves a demonstration of an on- orbit compu ter system assessing environmental data, for the purpose of securing valuable payload data and crew health, which makes it unrelated to Earth applications. S PACE BENEFITS Data acquired in this study will be used to assess radiation behavior and to correla te possible disturbances of experiments carried out in scientific payloads with milli -g accelerations; eg, by crew activities, re -boost, or docking of spacecraft to the ISS. Follow -up data analysis will provide valuable data for scientific payloads and for crew health support with respect to otology (the science of the ear and its diseases). Such technologies are necessary to continuously provide state -of-the art computers for replacement and extension of the ISS data management system and the ISS primary p ayload computers. R ESULTS Analysis of data from LEON -2 is ongoing, and conclusive results will be published upon completion of data analysis. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. 1058 SENSOR TEST FOR ORION RELATIVE NAVIGATION RISK MITIGATION , DETAILED TEST OBJECTIVE 703 (STORRM, DTO 703) Research Area: Technology Development and Expedition(s): 27/28 Principal Investigator(s): Heather Hinkel, NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES Sensor Test for Orion Relative Navigation Risk Mitigation - DTO 703 (STORRM) tests the Vision Navigation Sensor, Star Tracker, and Docking Camera planned for Orion both during shuttle approach to and departure from the International Space Station (ISS). This test determines how well the navigation system performs during the mission. EARTH BENEFITS Results allow for improved math models and design of future hardware. S PACE BENEFITS STORRM demonstrates and characterizes in -orbit performance of new navigation system technology prior to the first Orion mission to ISS. R ESULTS The Space Shuttle Orbiter Trajectory Control Sensor (TCS) interference testing is complete. The testing consisted of 4 reflective elements that are being considered for use on the STORRM DTO (DTO 703). The purpose of the testing was to ensure that the refl ective elements, which are required for the DTO, did not interfere or cause any unwarranted operation of the Shuttle TCS. The laser and detector for the TCS are designed for the visible spectrum as compared to the STORRM Vision Navigation System designed f or the near infra -red spectrum. Preliminary results eliminate the concern that the DTO reflective elements will interfere with TCS operations. DTO 703 collected data from the Vision Navigation Sensor and Docking Camera during Orbiter Operations. This inv estigation is complete and all results are published. STORRM Docking Target.

E ARTH BENEFITS Analysis of the crew evaluations will be presented to several NASA boards after data return. A final report will be completed and archived for use in design of lighting systems in the next generation of exploration vehicles. S PACE BENEFITS SSLM on the International Space Station (ISS) will begin the evaluation of LED lighting systems for the next generation of crew exploration vehicles. SSLM will effectively evaluate potential savings of LE D technology vs currently installed systems. R ESULTS The new solid -state lighting technology provides an important opportunity for re -lamping of the ISS with an energy -efficient lighting system that has a significantly longer lifespan and does not contain potentially toxic mercury vapor. A prototype Solid -State Lighting Assembly (SSLA) was developed at NASA's Kennedy Space Center and successfully installed on the ISS during Expedition 18. This new lighting system will provide multiple settings that can sup port astronaut vision and potentially serve as a lighting countermeasure for sleep and circadian disruption aboard the ISS. ISS018E010657 - Michael Fi ncke hold s a General Luminaire Assembly in Node 2. NASA image. 1064 Three ground -based studies were completed on visual performance, color discrimination, and melatonin (melatonin promotes sleepines s) suppression in healthy human subjects under different SSLA light exposure conditions inside a high- fidelity replica of the ISS crew quarters (CQ). Color discrimination tests showed no significant differences in color discrimination for indirect daylight , fluorescent room light, and SSLA light in the CQ. Also, there were no significant differences in score or time for subjects performing contrast tests. Presently, the data demonstrate that bright white Solid -State Lighting Module -Research light supports v isual performance and color discrimination equivalently to typical indoor exposures to indirect daylight and overhead fluorescent light. In addition, increasing exposures to SSLA inside the CQ elicit increasingly stronger melatonin suppressions in healthy volunteers. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of doing controlled studies on visual, neuroendocrine and circadian responses in a high -fidelity replica of an ISS component. Early studies represent a start towards quantifying the broader range of vis ual, biological, and behavioral responses to light once the current fluorescent lighting system is replaced by solid - state lighting. The data reported here begin to address long -duration space exploration, and the rapid development of solid -state lighting that will ultimately revolutionize how our public facilities, work places, and homes are illuminated in the coming decades. Similar to some of the astronauts, a significant portion of the global population suffers from chronic sleep loss or circadian -relat ed disorders. By refining multipurpose lights for astronaut safety, health and well-being in spaceflight, the door is opened for new lighting strategies that can be evolved for use on Earth (Brainard 2012).

All the partner agencies recognize the importance of vehicle health to mission success and are dedicated to maintaining the health of ISS. E ARTH BENEFIT New knowledge is expected to be the major benefit of this project. S PACE BENEFIT ISS External Radiation Monitoring provides new knowledge to advance space exploration. R ESULTS The International Space Station provides the proving ground for future long -duration human activities in space. Ionizing radiation measurements in ISS form the ideal tool for the experimental validation of radiation environmental models, nuclear transport code algorithms, and nuclear reaction cross sections. Indeed, prior measurements on the space shuttle have provided vital information impacting both the environmental models and the nuclear transport code development by requiring dynamic models of the low - Earth orbit environment. Previous studies usi ng Computer Aided Design models of the evolving ISS configurations with Thermo - Luminescent Detector area monitors, demonstrated that computational dosimetry requires environmental models with accurate non -isotropic as well as dynamic behavior, detailed information on rack loading, and an accurate 6 degree of freedom description of ISS trajectory and orientation. It is imperative that we understand ISS exposures dynamically for crew career planning, and insure that the regulatory requirements of keeping expo sure as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) are adequately implemented. This is especially true since the ISS was comp leted. S128E009988 - Overall view of the International Space Station shortly after the undocking of Space Shuttle Discovery during STS -128.

Crew health before, during, and followin g spaceflight is essential to overall ISS mission success. All of the partner agencies recognize the importance of crew health to mission success and are dedicated to maintaining the health of all crew members throughout all phases of ISS missions. E ARTH BENEFITS Maintaining crew member health and safety while in orbit better ensures that crew member functionality is not jeopardized as a result of time spent on a mission, therefor e, allowing them to resume life on Earth unaffected by space travel. S PACE BENEFITS Human exploration and development of space without exceeding acceptable risk from exposure to ionizing radiation is one of NASA's main objectives. Moral, legal, safety, and practical considerations require that NASA limit postflight risks incurred by humans living and working in space to acceptable levels. R ESULTS The ISS is performing well within expectations with respect to total ionizing dose (TID) degradation and single event effects (SEE) impacts on electromechanical (EEE) parts and avionics performance. Until recently, ISS has been flying at altitudes between 350 and 400 km during solar maximum, well below the 500 km specified for the worst -case radiation design environment. TID accumulated to date is well below the performance degradation threshold for EEE parts. Ionizing radiation dose measurements, made within the habitable volume with thermoluminescent dosimeters and crew personal dosimeters, range from 5 to 12 m icroGy (0.5 ISS009E06471 - EXPRESS Rack 5 with the Intravehicular Charged Particle Directional Spectrometer (IV -CPDS) (gold box in left field of view) and the Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter Radiation Detector (gold cylinder) and upper storage comp artments visible. EXPRESS Rack 5 is in the Destiny module/U. laboratory. NASA image. 1068 to 1.2 milli rads) per hour, depending on location in the habitable volume, corresponding to an annual dose range of 44 to 105 milliGy (4.4 to 10.5 rads). The variation in TID with location in the habitable volume is largely a result of variations in effective shielding mass with location. No destructive SEE events of any kind have been observed during the first two years of flight. Only one ISS vehicle equipment item fault that may be uniquely attributed to SEE with a reasonable level of confi dence has been observed. Detailed consideration of the effects of both the natural and induced ionizing radiation environment during ISS design, development, and flight operations has produced a safe, efficient manned space platform that is largely immune to deleterious effects of the low -Earth orbit ionizing radiation environment. However, model estimates show the need for more work directed to development of a practical understanding of secondary particle production in massive structural shielding for single event effect (SEE) design and verification. Utilizing computer -aided design it was determined that total dose estimates for shielding mass distribution were reasonable and accurate for the ISS pressurized elements (Koontz 2005). At pr esent, the best active dosimeters used for radiation linear energy transfer (LET) are the tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) and silicon detectors. The best passive dosimeters are the thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs), optically stimulated lu minescence dosimeters (OSLDs) for low LET, and CR -39 plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTDs) for high LET. TEPC, CR- 39 PNTDs, TLDs, and OSLDs dosimeters were all used to investigate the radiation environment for ISS Expedition 12, STS- 112, and STS -114, and proven to be successful and consistent in measuring the LET spectra and all radiation quantities with excellent agreement among different detector types. The sensitivity fading of CR -39 detectors for long -time exposures was observed, and the method of \"in ternal LET calibration using GCR iron peak\" was developed to correct the sensitivity fading giving final CR-39 results that are consistent with those measured by TEPC and TLDs/OSLDs. This study indicates the LET spectrum method using CR -39 PNTDs, the LET c alibration for CR -39 detectors, and the combination method for results measured by passive dosimeters are reliable and will be continually used in future space missions (Zhou 2007).

Easton, National Center for Space Exploration Research, Cleveland, Ohio RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Component Repair Experiment -1, SDTO 17012U (CRE -1) is an incremental step toward providing an electronics repair capability during future long -duration space missions. Implementation of repair capabilities can help reduce the burden of replacement hardware. Specifically, CRE -1 demonstrates the physical steps of component -level electronics repair conducted by crew members aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These physical processes all have a direct gravitational dependence (such as the soldering process itself) or an indirect, operational dependence on the gravity environment (such as placing, aligning, and securing small replacement parts). Therefore, the repair processes must be demonstrated in a relevant environment as part of a repair cap ability development. E ARTH BENEFITS Development of improved toolsets, procedures, and training methods can help enable in- the-field repairs by deployed US military forces, thereby assisting in reducing the logistical support requirements of US forces. S PACE BENEFITS The current strategy for electronics' repair aboard the ISS calls for replacement of failed hardware that relies on spares provided by resupply flights from Earth. For future exploration missions beyond low -Earth orbit, this logistical support will be much more constrained. Repair ing electronics at the lowest component level could potentially ease the logistical burden by minimizing the upmass and volume of required spares. Implementation of such a strategy on the ISS could serve as a test bed for future operations as well as offer additional options for actual contingency maintenance. Before such a strategy can be adopted, data must be gathered about the practicality of performing such repairs in microgravity. CRE -1 serves to advance the state of knowledge and experience involved i n manual component- level electronics repair by demonstrating such repairs in an operational environment. R ESULTS The results of the CRE -1 operations show a great deal of potential for future astronauts to perform low -level electronics repair during a miss ion. Each crew member was able to remove ISS018E035796 - Astronaut Sandra Magnus removing conformal coating during the CRE -1 experiment. NASA image. 1072 and replace components successfully, demonstrating that with limited training and tools these low-level repairs are a realistic option for future missions. However, each crew member experienced difficulties with som e of the tasks. These problems range from forming solder joints that are functional but do not pass current standards, to failed solder joints, and damage to the component or circuit board. The difficulties encountered by the crew point to areas requiring improvement. Further, the crew members were not trained to identify and correct mistakes or flaws in their work, which contributed to the number of components that did not pass a visual inspection to NASA standards. The results of the CRE -1 work show 2 mai n areas for improving an electronics repair capability: improving crew training and improving the tools provided. P UBLICATIONS (S) Easton JW, Struk PM.

Struk, PhD, NASA's Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Soldering in Reduced Gravity Experiment (SoRGE) will examine solder joints created in micro gravity. Recent simulated microgravity (aboard the KC -135 and C -9B reduced gravity aircraft) testing has shown that, on average, solder joints produced in microgravity (space) exhibit approximately 3 -times more voids (defects) compared with those produced in normal gravity (Earth). Without gravity, gas bubbles (from solder flux or water vapor) form pores or void defects in solder joints and can reduce their strength. For SoRGE operations, crew members will be soldering small electronic components using the International Space Station (ISS) soldering iron to validate the results observed in C -9B aircraft testing, including potential mitigation techniques for reducing solder joint voids. EARTH BENEFITS Through better understanding of the inherent physics, the study of soldering in space could lead to better soldering techniques on Earth. S PACE BENEFITS The current strategy for electronics mainten ance aboard the ISS calls for replacement of Orbital Replacement Units and relies on re -supply flights from Earth to provide the replacement units. This logistical support may not be easily available for future exploration missions beyond low -Earth orbit. Repairing electronics at the lowest component level could ease the logistical burden by minimizing the upmass and volume of required spares. Before such a strategy can be adopted, data must be gathered about the practicality of performing such repairs in microgravity. This includes understanding how ISS015E06769 - Astronaut Suni Williams performs the Soldering in Reduced Gravity Experiment (SoRGE) in the Maintenance Work Area (MWA). SoRGE will examine how the microgravity environment affects soldering joints. NASA image. ISS015E06764 - This image shows the samples that were used during SoRGE. SoRGE will examine how the microgravity environment affects soldering joints. Image courtesy of NASA. 1074 the physical processes (such as soldering) are affected by the microgravity environment. SoRGE is the next step in understanding the role that reduced gravity plays in the repair of electronic components. R ESULTS Analysis of data from SoRGE is ongoing, conclusive results will be published upon completion of data analysis. This investigation is complete; however additional results are pending publication. 1075 BOUNDARY LAYER TRANSITION , DETAILED TEST OBJECTIVE 854 (BLT, DTO 854) Research Area: Technology Development and Demonstration: Spacecraft and Orbital Environments Expedition(s): 18-20 Principal Investigator(s): Gerald Kinder, The Boeing Company, Huntington Beach, California Charles H. Campbell, NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The Boundary Layer Transition (BLT) involves the use of 10 modified tiles, equipped with thermocouples (indicate a temperature change based on voltage between a junction of 2 different metals), placed on the bottom of Space Shuttle Discovery 's left wing. One tile is also equipped with a protuberance (specially modified speed bump) to study the characteristics of how the airflow is tripped from laminar (smooth) to turbulent (rough) during re -entry. BLT improves the understanding of the parameters associated with re -entering the atmosphere and including the significant heat increase caused by turbulent boundary layer flow. E ARTH BENEFITS BLT provides scientists and engineers with the incredible opportunity to demonstrate how NASA is working to understand spaceflight better and an opportunity to successfully apply what has been learned to improve space vehicles. S PACE BENEFITS The data gathered from BLT will be utilized to support analytical computer modeling and design efforts for the space shuttle and NASA's next generation spacecraft. R ESULTS The Boundary Layer Transition (BLT) was successful in obtaining BLT onset data near Mac h 16 and turbulent heating data after Mach 16 with a 0.25 inch tile protuberance downstream of the port landing gear door. Flight hardware performance and thermocouple data was excellent, and no anomalies were identified. This investigation is complete; however no publications are expected.

Several papers provide data that model these different contamination sources on the ISS. Certain surfaces of the ISS are particularly sensitive to contamination; knowledge of the station environment leads to mitigation strategies and feeds back into mater ials and mission designs for future missions. E ARTH BENEFIT New knowledge is expected to be the major benefit of this project. S PACE BENEFIT ISS External Environments provides new knowledge to advance space exploration. RESULTS The data are used to help predict component life cycles; provide data that are relevant to performance; create operational rules for spacecraft and extravehicular activity (spacewalks); and feed into future mission design considerations. NASA's Image Science & Analysis Lab produces regular reports of their findings. ISS engineers use the data for the various studies that are reported here. Below is a sample of these results to date. Liquid droplets of partly reacted propellants are produced by thruster exhaust plumes from visiting spacecraft. Both the chemical nature and the physical acceleration of the drops can produce pitting, mechanical erosion, and other damage on surfaces. For critical surfaces, such as solar arrays, the models influenced flight rules for array -positioning during thruster firings (A lred 2003; Pankop 2004). An experiment was performed in 2001 to document a water dump and venting event with video for analysis. The venting was characterized from the imagery, including the extent of the cone of the vent, number of particles outside the cone, and velocities of ice particles. Because S123E010030 - Backdropped by a blue and white part of Earth, a close -up view of the International Space Station is seen from Space Shuttle Endeavour as the two spacecraft begin their relative separation . NASA image. 1077 the particles can be large (2 mm) and have significant velocities (30 -50 ft/sec), they have the potential for creating damage on station hardware. When the video was analyzed, some of the ice particles were ob served bouncing off of the nearby ISS hardware. Results agreed well with models; during the nominal phase of the vent, larger particles stayed within a cone with a 20 - degree half -angle (Schmidle 2001, 2002). These data were used to develop an operational constraint on the location of the solar arrays and photovoltaic radiators to mitigate potential damage. PUBLICATION (S) TC, SR, Badavi FF, et al.

All of the partner agencies recognize the importance of crew health to mission success and are dedicated to maintaining the health of all crew members throughout all phases of ISS miss ions. The data obtained from environmental monitoring provides insight into the environmental contamination during the stages of construction and habitation of ISS. E ARTH BENEFITS Understanding the effects of a closed space environment on humans will increase the knowledge of living in extreme conditions. Due to widespread growth in the use of colloidal silver as a biocidal agent, the development of a simple and cost efficient method of silver testing is valuable. S PACE BENEFITS Environmental monitoring is vital to ensure crew and spacecraft health during spaceflight. The results are being used to identify specific effects of a closed space environment on astronauts. This knowledge will allow scientists to develop systems that enable the crew to remain healthy on future long -duration missions to the moon and Mars. R ESULTS Several stu dies on ISS Internal Environments have been conducted; below is a sampling of the results to date. ISS010E11563 - An example of contamination that has developed on one of the interior panels aboard the International Space Station (ISS) . This image shows how contamination can form on interior ISS surfaces. Crews have weekly sessions to clean ISS surfaces. The Surface, Water, and Air Biocharacterization ( SWAB ) investigation will help us understand the microbes involved in contamination and how to deal with them. NASA image. 1079 During one study of the ISS atmosphere, 12 bacterial strains were isolated and fingerprinted from the ISS water system. The bacteria consisted of common strains and were encountered at levels below 10, 000 colony -forming units/10 cm2, which is well below the minimum bacteria needed to cause illness. This data represents the beginning of ISS habitation and indicates that the lessons learned from the Mir and Sky lab missions were implemented and have been effective in keeping the ISS a safe place to live and work (Castro 2004). Solid waste in space must be safely processed and stored in a confined environment. Most of the solid waste is wet and poses a high risk of culturing the growth of undesirable microorganisms. Analysis was performed in order to assess potential crew risks resulting from microbial decay. Results show certain levels of volatile organic compounds, ethylene, methane, and carbon dioxide. These ga ses are being contained within the trash compartments, minimalizing potential risk for crew members (Peterson 2004). On station, silver is used as a biocidal agent based on its antimicrobial properties in the potable water system. Recent studies have shown that colloidal silver is possibly toxic to humans. Researchers are currently developing and testing a simple technique that will enable crew members to test silver levels in the water system in less than 2 minutes (Hill 2010). Continual efforts to ensure crew safety will accompany the lifetime of the ISS. A new type of air testing was performed in 2010, evaluating threshold (T) values for 16 adverse health effect groups. All T levels were within the safe limit. The highest values were found in mucosal limits, headaches, central nervous system depression, and cardiac sensitization. T his evaluation is an integral tool to NASA's Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health (James 2012). P UBLICATION (S) Checinska A, Probst AJ, Vaishampayan PA, et al .

Mikatarian, Boeing, Houston, Texas R ESEARCH OBJECTIVES This analysis created a model to predict the voltage difference between the International Space Station (ISS) and the plasma background. The ionospheric plasma interacts with the ISS solar arrays and conducting surfaces, causing excess charge to be accumulated, thus creating the potential difference. This model will be used to predict the ISS floating potentials to assess vehicle and extravehicular mobility unit dielectric breakdown. EARTH BENEFITS This model will be the standard for solar arrays in space. With an energy crisis upon us, solar power is a viable alternative. Ultimately, solar arrays in space create more power than solar arrays on the ground. This model will be invaluable for those seeking to pioneer solar arrays in space for the private sector. S PACE BENEFITS This Plasma Interaction Model models the interaction of the spacecraft, with high -voltage solar arrays, to the local plasma environment. RESULTS The P lasma Interaction Model has been used to predict the charge build- up and associated dangers for future ISS solar array configurations. Ground data were collected from various locations around the world. Additionally, historical data\u2014 eg, the IRI 2001 model, FPP data, and the Dynamics Explorer -2 Satellite data, are available. Using these data, the PIM has been able to characterize the peak voltage levels for the various ISS stage builds. (Reddell 2006).

EARTH BENEFITS New knowledge is expected to be the major benefit of this project. SPACE BENEFITS The ZPM concept can substantially reduce the International Space Station (ISS) lifetime propellant use while avoiding thruster plume loads and contamination of solar arrays. A reduction in propellant use not only saves money, but increases payload capacity for resupplying vehicles. Even more importantly, ZPM provides the only means of control if ISS thrusters are unavailable. ZPM will also reduce propellant use for spacecraft maneuvers using only thrusters. This technology will be even more valuable for future human exploration of the solar system as the propellant savings will allow for increased payload or provisions. R ESULTS The ZPM concept was successfully demonstrated on the ISS. On November 5, 2006, and March 3, 2007, the ISS was rotated 90 degrees and 180 degrees, respectively, without using any propellant. The 90- degree maneuver of ISS Stag e12A was completed in 2 hours and reached 70% of CMG momentum capacity (Bedrossian, 2007[a]). The 180 -degree maneuver of ISS Stage 12A.1 was completed in 2 hours and 47 minutes and reached 76% of CMG momentum capacity (Bedrossian, 2007[b]). The same 180 -degree maneuver was performed with thrusters on January 2, 2007, and consumed 50.8 kilograms or 112 pounds of propellant. At an estimated cost of $10,000 per pound, the 180- degree maneuver with ZPM saved $1,120,000 (Kang, 2007). Naval Postgraduate School Professor of Mechanical and Astrona utical Engineering I. Michael Ross briefs NPS Space Systems Academic Group students on NASA's use of his optimal control software to maneuver the International Space Station cost -free, without the need to use thrusters and expend valuable fuel. Photo credi t: US Navy , by Javier Chagoya. 1085 The flight results were documented and compared to predicted performance. The data included attitude, momentum, and gimbal rates during the maneuver. Flight reconstruction was performed to resolve discrepancies between predicted and flight results. The impact of this new technology is to substantially reduce ISS lifetime propellant use, and avoid solar array contamination and loads. Future applications that can also be performed non - propulsively include maneuvering the ISS to unload accumulated CMG momentum, recovering attitude contr ol when CMGs are saturated, and recovering attitude control in the event of a tumbling ISS. Since ZPM will also reduce propellant consumption for maneuvers using thrusters, it can also be used for future long -duration space exploration missions where prope llant savings are even more valuable than for ISS and will allow for increased payload and provisions.
