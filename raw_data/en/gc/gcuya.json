USask Department of Medicine Annual Report July 1, 2020 - December 31, 2021 3 | P a g e MESSAGE from the PROVINCIAL HEAD I am pleased to present a modified annual report for the Department of Medicine at the University of Saskatchewan and the Saskatchewan Health Authority. The report covers the 2020 - 2021 Academic Year as well as the remainder of 2021 to December 31. We intentionally delayed the collection of data for this report because of the incredible demands faced by our faculty members particularly during the fourth wave of COVID-19 during the fall of 2021. While COVID has affected the entire medical community, the burden of this crisis has fallen disproportionately on our department. Even when COVID hospitalizations declined, inpatient numbers for Internal Medicine remained well above normal. Department of Medicine members took on extra shifts, helped to upskill colleagues, and worked with local and national media to translate knowledge for the public. All this while also taking on leadership roles such as Pandemic Area Chiefs of Staff. Demonstrating flexibility, strength and resilience, Department of Medicine members continued to provide innovative education, research and clinical services. Despite research restrictions, publication and citation counts remain strong. For the first time in many years, this year's cohort of new residents all filled as a first match. Not only are we attracting high quality internal candidates, our programs are also attracting a wider range of residents from out of province. Administratively, we are working to improve the work environment for everyone by following recommendations made by the new Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee. It is a first step as we move in the right direction. We are continuing to examine the recommendations provided by the external review of the department, carried out in the fall of 2020. While many of the recommendations are outside the control of the department, a provincial Department of Medicine committee is determining which of the specific recommendations to target in the year ahead. I am proud to continue to lead this dedicated team of healthcare professionals, researchers, teachers and administrators. I am grateful for the outstanding contribution of all members of the department including the administrative team lead by our Finance and Admin Manager Helen Chapple, who is retiring after serving the department for 31 years. I encourage everyone to take care of yourself with the same compassion and understanding you provide to others, as we all look for better days ahead. DR.

Department of Medicine members continue to provide leadership in all aspects of COVID-19 activities taking on roles, often at great personal sacrifice, ranging from Pandemic Area Chief of Staff to patient advocates and public educators through social media. The department has been under intense pressure with the inpatient census consistently above 100% and frequently reaching 140-150%. Fortunately, collaboration between multiple divisions in managing COVID patients has been excellent including, for example, the Cardiology Division and ICU creating an ECMO team and shock team that was crucial in providing optimal advanced care for the most critically ill patients. In addition to pressures caused by an increased COVID-related workload, there are increased volumes of both outpatient and inpatient non-COVID patients. This has resulted in dramatic increases in waiting lists, testing, outpatient procedures and increased complexity and volume for inpatient patients admitted to our medical services throughout the province. It will take some time for these numbers to return to normal even after COVID is under control. On a more positive note, learners and educators have adapted to the unusual conditions caused by COVID, with increased engagement in virtual events such as Academic Half Days for Residents, Grand Rounds and Resident Research Days. Recent changes in SHA policy have allowed medical students the option of being involved in the care of COVID positive patients. COVID did affect research over the past year and half, with the university instituting a pause on research activities for several months. This pause has since been lifted with recommended precautions. Not surprisingly, research funding is down from previous years, however publications and citation counts are at new highs, so work is obviously continuing despite the interruptions. Examples of COVID-related research include CCHSA faculty who are involved in work related to a SARS CoV-2 vaccine development, as well as research with the engineering department addressing the impact of ventilation on virus transfer. The Prairie Vascular Research Group, made up of members of the Division of Cardiology in Regina, was integral in developing the NACMI (North American Covid-19 ST- Elevation Myocardial Infarction) Registry, which helped to better understand the MI experience in COVID-19. The Department of Medicine has an excellent participation rate for vaccination, and all members are encouraged to obtain boosters, comply with SHA policies, and get their N95 masks fitted if they have not done so recently. While it is difficult to predict the future of the pandemic, the increased vaccination rates, new COVID therapies and ongoing enforcement of SHA policies are expected to lessen the impact of COVID on inpatient services in the months ahead. Thank you to all members of the Department for their dedication and contributions. We look forward to a better year ahead. USask Department of Medicine Annual Report July 1, 2020 - December 31, 2021 10 | P a g e EDUCATION SECTION II USask Department of Medicine Annual Report July 1, 2020 - December 31, 2021 11 | P a g e UNDERGRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION Another year of the pandemic and our faculty continue to provide excellence in teaching to our UGME students. Our Year 3 students finished a hectic year of on-again, off- again rotations. They made the best of it and are currently excelling in their Year 4 electives. The new Year 3 students are quickly getting used to life as clerks. This group of students faced significant adversity in Year 2 when the pandemic started and all in-person teaching was cancelled. Despite this and the numerous COVID outbreaks on the wards, they are raising the bar in their rotations. Recent new SHA policy now allows learners to remain on COVID outbreak wards, which is good news for them and for the logistics of managing these wards. Recent changes now allow learners to be involved in the care of COVID positive patients. Additionally, year 4 and 5 students may also choose to be involved in an AGMP on a COVID positive patient. This change brings us in line with other Canadian medical schools and also prepares our students for transitioning to residency. Students do have the option to opt out of these exposures. The number of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) required for this Year 3 cohort has increased to include #1-6. This number will continue to increase over the next few years until they will be required to complete all 12. The clerkship competency committee meets every month to review each students' EPA accomplishments and ensure they are achieving competency in each rotation. The committee also ensures that narrative feedback given by faculty is adequate and useful matching their scores, as this information makes its way into their Dean's Letters. Please contact me if you are interested in being a part of this very rewarding and important committee. This past year's final class scored very well on their LMCC part 1 exam. Our graduates had a 96% pass rate, very comparable to the national rate of 97%. The National mean score was 263 while our graduates scored a very impressive 267. This is very positive news and kudos to all the great teaching you do to prepare our students for success. Starting next year, students will have the opportunity to do all their training from Year 1 -4 in Regina. \"Having our learners train in many, varied locations throughout Saskatchewan is a win-win-win,\" said Dr. Preston Smith, Dean of the College of Medicine. \"Medical students benefit from a greater number and range of learning opportunities across urban, rural, remote and Indigenous communities. Physicians and other care providers deliver improved care when learners are involved in their practices and at our clinics and hospitals. And Saskatchewan people are on the receiving end of this improved care.\" This will open up many teaching opportunities for Regina faculty and those interested can contact Dr. Jackie Kraushaar. DR. RAHUL MAINRA Director Undergraduate Education USask Department of Medicine Annual Report July 1, 2020 - December 31, 2021 12 | P a g e Lastly, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and incredible dedication of all our Administrative Assistants in all sites that maintain our department's teaching activities within the entire curriculum. We all do an immense amount of teaching in various levels of the curriculum and the coordination of the students is done by our amazing administrative team. The success of our academic activities is dependent on this strong cohesive team and a huge THANKS goes to them. I also want to thank Dr. Alex Zhai for his commitment and dedication to clerkship as the Site Director for CTU. I am excited to welcome Dr. Fatima Pirani to this role. We look forward to working with her!

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect all aspects of the Internal Medicine residents' training. The Academic Half Days educational/teaching sessions are still being delivered virtually. The faculty presenters have adapted their presentations to this platform, and we work on continuing to encourage engagement on both side in this era. The PGY2/PGY3 SIM session re-started in October 2020 after a brief hiatus starting in March of that year. These sessions are a highly valued educational experience DR. JESSIE BAPTISTE Director - Core Internal Medicine Incoming (as of July 1, 2021) DR. KAREN LAFRAMBOISE Director - Core Internal Medicine Outgoing (as of July 1, 2021) USask Department of Medicine Annual Report July 1, 2020 - December 31, 2021 14 | P a g e A big thank you goes out to Dr. Masri and Melissa Pardy for organizing the sessions and to Christina Sparrow, our CTU Nurse Coordinator who is an important resource for the simulation in her role as our nurse confederate in these sessions. The CaRMS subcommittee was very busy during the 2021 PGY1 match cycle. All CaRMS interviews and program information sessions were done virtually for the first time this past year. The residents were integral in the development of the program promotional video, highlighting the strengths of the Internal Medicine program in both Regina and Saskatoon. The video was posted on the CANPREPP site. There were three virtual Town Hall sessions that included senior residents from Regina and Saskatoon as well as two faculty members at each session. The Town Hall sessions were well attended by final year medical students from across Canada and international medical graduates from around the world. The Internal Medicine program had a very successful CaRMS PGY1 2021 match. For the first time in the last fifteen years (or longer) the program filled all our training positions in Saskatoon and Regina in the first round. The Medical Subspecialty Match for 2021 and 2022 were held in the fall of 2020 and 2021. We had a very high match rate in both years, with everyone matching in the 2020 cohort. Finally, all of the PGY3 residents successfully passed the Royal College Internal Medicine specialty written exam held in March 2021. Resident Research Days were held virtually again and will continue to be so for the 2021-2022 year. Through Dr. Julian Tam's leadership, the research presentations were very well received, with some Internal Medicine residents submitting their research to the PGME Research Day. Within the PGME main research category, Internal Medicine residents were awarded the 1st place prize and the 3rd place prize. We look forward to the 2021-2022 round of research presentations and are always looking for people who would like to be involved. The CBD (Competence By Design) training curriculum continues to evolve as we moved into having all three years now fully enrolled in CBD. The Competence Committee has been working diligently, and we would like to thank all committee members for their efforts in the residents' assessment and education. Feedback from faculty members in the Department of Medicine continues to increase and improve as we move forward in our third year in CBD. Over the last few years, there has been a steady increase in the number of patients coming to the ED and requiring admission to the internal medical inpatient teams at both training sites. The Internal Medicine Program has worked closely with the Department of Medicine to ensure that the CTU inpatient teams provide excellent and safe patient care as well as a safe learning environment for all levels of learners. The Department of Medicine faculty members have stepped up to provide coverage for non-teaching inpatient teams in both Regina and Saskatoon. In Saskatoon, a separate in-hospital night call coverage schedule was also developed to cover the non-teaching medical inpatient services that was previously covered by the Internal Medicine residents when they were on call. This provided significant workload reduction for the residents on call each night. Overall, it was a very busy year and a half with many successes. The educational mission of the Internal Medicine program was maintained despite the high inpatient numbers due to the hard work and commitment of the Internal Medicine residents at all level of training, and the commitment of the faculty in the Department of Medicine. Starting in July 2021, Dr. Jessie Baptiste took over as Program Director for the Internal Medicine program from Dr. Karen Laframboise . She brings her experience as GIM Program Director to the USask Department of Medicine Annual Report July 1, 2020 - December 31, 2021 15 | P a g e position as well as UGME educational and leadership experience. Dr. Laframboise was an exceptional leader for the last eight years and the program has grown under her guidance. A huge thank you for all her hard work and sacrifice over the years. We would like to thank Dr. Haddad and the members of the Department of Medicine in Saskatoon and Regina for their commitment to resident education and support of the Internal Medicine training program.

Despite a variety of challenges, our researchers have continued to produce a great deal of high-quality research with several researchers continuing to address COVID-19 either as principal investigators or as members of local and national teams. Our department continues to be one of the most productive departments in the College of Medicine based on reports from the Office of the Vice Dean of Research. This is a testament to the important work being completed by our researchers. Some of our programs and highlights are described below. Department members have been very successful in grant competitions locally, provincially, and nationally. A number of DOM researchers received funding from the Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation as principal investigators (PI) and co-investigator. Notably, DOM researchers were successful at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). Dr. Alexandra King was successful as a co-PI on a number of CIHR grants for her work in Indigenous health and wellness and community approaches; Dr. Debra Morgan was a co-PI on grants related to dementia care; Dr. Erika Penz was co-PI on a grant looking at the effects of e-cigarette exposure on macrophage function; and Dr. Julian Tam and Dr. Anderson Tyan were co-PIs on a grant looking at cellular bases of Cystic Fibrosis. In addition to this, there were a number of DOM researchers included as co-investigators on successful CIHR grants. The DOM Faculty Research Days were unfortunately cancelled in 2020, however, in June 2021 we were able to hold this event remotely with an excellent turnout and participation. It was a packed day that highlighted the intensity and emphasis of research in the department. The topics varied from biomedical to clinical to population-based to health services research, and demonstrated the diversity of research in the department. We were also fortunate to include third year resident projects, which were very well done. We would also like to congratulate Dr. Michael Prystajecky for receiving the award for the top presentation in the Clinical, Population Health, and Health Services research category and Dr. Michael Levin for receiving the award for the top presentation in the Biomedical research category. We look forward to the next research day, anticipated for June 2022. We would like to congratulate all members of the department for successes in and out of research. As always, we encourage you to contact the research committee and staff about your projects and ways in which we can assist you. Our departmental Research Facilitator, Dr. Ozlem Sari, can be reached at ozlem.sari@usask.ca. We also hope that by working together, we will be able to continue to build on our momentum in research throughout the province. DR. JOSH LAWSON DIRECTOR, RESARCH USask Department of Medicine Annual Report July 1, 2020 - December 31, 2021 22 | P a g e RESEARCH SUPPORTS 2020-2021 The Department of Medicine continues to provide support for new and established researchers through a variety of channels. RESEARCH LUNCH AND LEARNS Research Lunch and Learns are needs-driven meetings for members of the Department of Medicine. At these sessions, a presenter discusses practical topics related to research followed by a question-and-answer session with participants. The following topics were covered during the past year and half. Patient Oriented Research Knowledge Translation Quality Improvement Ethics Approval and Operational Approvals Grant Writing Workshop with Panel Discussion Exploring Funding Opportunities Whenever possible, the lunch and learn sessions are recorded and available for viewing on the Dept. of Medicine Research SharePoint site which can be accessed from the research page on the DoM website. RESEARCH MENTORSHIP PROGRAM The Research Mentorship Program is designed to provide one-on-one and team support and advice for new researchers and those who wish to move into research. For more information about the Research Mentorship program, please contact our research facilitator Ozlem Sari at ozlem.sari@usask.ca ANNUAL RESIDENT RESEARCH DAY The Annual Resident Research Day was delayed due to the COVID-closures, and then rescheduled as online events. The PGY1 Case Presentations were held in June, and the PGY2 Poster Presentations took place in October. See the Celebrating Success pages of this report for a list of winners. USask Department of Medicine Annual Report July 1, 2020 - December 31, 2021 23 | P a g e QUALITY of CARE SECTION IV Our Quality of Care Committee (QCC) continued to focus on the teaching around cognitive biases and concepts of system thinking/improvement during the Department of Medicine quality improvement rounds. Each group of presenting internal medicine residents is supervised by a member of Quality of Care Committee, which enhances the learning of trainees around the concepts of quality improvement. These rounds foster a culture of safety and provide a platform to have open conversations around quality and patient's safety issues. To date, no formal learning has been organized for the faculty of the Department of Medicine. Therefore, the Department of Medicine QCC felt the need to have a formalized assessment program to enhance the knowledge of patient safety and quality improvement in the Department of Medicine. A self-assessment program (SAP) for quality improvement and patient safety was offered for faculty (2020-2021). Faculty who attended the rounds were invited to participate in self-assessment after each quality improvement rounds and could claim it towards Royal College Section 3 credits. This was an accredited Self- Assessment Program (Section 3) as defined by the Maintenance of Certification (MOC) Program of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and approved by the Continuing Medical Education Division, University of Saskatchewan.

Contributions from faculty whose primary academic appointment are outside the Department of Medicine are not included in this report. The Centre's MISSION is to conduct and stimulate research, education, and health promotion programs aimed at enhancing the health and well-being of agricultural, rural and remote populations. Over the last year CCHSA research and outreach has grown and adapted to our ongoing COVID-related challenges. On top of ongoing rural and agricultural health and safety research, CCHSA Department of Medicine faculty continue to have had significant roles related to the COVID pandemic including: work related to the SARS CoV-2 vaccine development, research with engineering addressing the impact of ventilation on virus transfer, and occupational health policy guidance to SHA regarding COVID policies and response as well as vaccine roll-out. CCHSA faculty also play a crucial role helping manage resumption of activities and presence in health sciences, particularly during the 4th wave. So many remarkable lines of research and outreach have continued and developed over the year. Rural health remains a key area including the work of the Rural Dementia Action Research (RaDAR) Team and the Musculoskeletal Health and Access to Care research group. Through many partnerships and collaborations, our faculty continue research and outreach in respiratory exposures and health effects, farm injury and fatalities, musculoskeletal health, proteomics and metabolomics, rural dementia, asthma, diabetes in First Nations, and sleep health among First Nations People.

Drs. Ambreen Khan , Vanessa Rininsland and Sarah Oberholtzer have completed their rheumatology training at University of Saskatchewan and have joined practices here in Saskatoon. Despite the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, our division members have continued to provide ongoing rheumatologic care to Saskatchewan people with focal and systemic rheumatologic disorders. This has involved considerable creativity and collaboration in care delivery to support patients with often multisystem and complex care needs. During this time, members have supported large outpatient practices and have strived, for the most part successfully, to ensure these vulnerable patients can be cared for outside of the inpatient hospital setting. We have also provided and maintained a continuous consultation service for all three hospitals in Saskatoon and the Northern Saskatchewan catchment area during this time. Our newest members are already actively contributing to further expansion of rheumatology service delivery. Drs. Rininsland and Oberholtzer are collaborating with our Northern Medical Services leadership to develop and offer a periodic rheumatology clinic in La Ronge, SK which will contribute to increased access-to-care for Northern rheumatology patients. Ongoing and expanding service delivery by our members include: the rheumatology-respiratory combined clinic collaborations with Drs. Keltie Anderson and Veronica Marcoux as well as Drs. Vanessa Rininsland and Stacey Lok. These clinics particularly provide care for patients with interstitial lung disease in the context of connective tissue/rheumatic disease. Dr. Jodie Reis continues to collaborate with Dr. Sheryl Fowler for a combined rheumatology-GI clinic which provides care for patients with inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatologic presentations. Dr. Reis also supports bone health care delivery through both a fracture liaison service creating opportunity for osteoporosis treatment intervention for orthopaedic patients as well as through a clinic dedicated to Rheumatology - Saskatoon DR.
