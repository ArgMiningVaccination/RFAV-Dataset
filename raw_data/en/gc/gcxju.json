Cacao is not only chocolate, but a consciousness and intelligence. We honour Cacao as a teacher and keeper of ancient, sacred wisdom and acknowledge her as a feminine force. We honour the ancestors of Cacao and the lands on which it originates and hold gratitude for this sacred plant medicine. Being guarded by Elders, Cacao seems to offer a ceremonial centre to reconnect with the invisible harmony.The Healing Benefits of Cacao: Cacao is the most complex food on Earth. It contains a number of ingredients that have a positive effect on the mind and body. Raw Cacao is nature's most magical superfood due to its mineral content and nutrients, formed of some 600-1.200 individual chemical components. Like all superfoods, cacao blurs the line between food and medicine. Cacao contains the highest concentration of antioxidants and magnesium of any food in the world. Raw Cacao is rich in zinc, chromium, theobromine, vitamin C, iron, copper, tryptophan, manganese, omega-6 fatty acids, serotonin, and more. Cacao is a highly effective natural energy enhancer and is used with great popularity by superfood lovers. Cacao contains PEA, a chemical that we produce in our bodies when we fall in love. PEAs also play a role in increasing focus and alertness. Anandamide is an endorphin that the human body naturally produces after exercise. Anandamide is known as the bliss chemical as it is released while we are feeling joy. It has only been found in one plant - Cacao. - 100% Plant Based - 40 Times the Antioxidants of Blueberries. - Highest Plant-Based Source of Iron. - Full of Magnesium for a Healthy Heart & Brain. - Contains More Calcium Than Cow's Milk - Increases blood flow from the heart to the brain - Lowers high blood pressure - Beautiful connection to the heart Cacao carries within a powerful medicine that nourish the soul, expand the mind and connects the human heart with the heartbeat of life itself.
