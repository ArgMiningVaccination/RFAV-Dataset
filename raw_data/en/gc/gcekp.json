Parts 98 and 99, hereby repeal s Sections 300 to 379 in Chapter 3 (Child Development Facilities) of Title 29 (Public Welfare) of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (\"DCMR\") , and adds a new Chapter 1 (Child Development Facilities : Licensing) to Subtitle A (Office of the State Superintendent of Education) of Title 5 DCMR (Education). I. Purpose Research has shown that licensing and regulatory requirements for child care affect the quality of care and the health and development of children in care. Accordingly, this final rulemaking is necessary to ensure that care and education provided in a licensed Child Development Facility in the District is not only safe, but also supports children's healthy development and future academic achievement and success by establishing the minimum requirements nece ssary to protect the health, safety and welfare of children in care. In addition, the final rulemaking will amend the District's regulatory framework for child development facilities to comply with the federal CCDBG Act and the regulations promulgated ther eunder. II. CCDBG Act and Implementing Regulations On November 19, 2014, the bipartisan CCDBG Act was signed into federal law by President Obama, thereby strengthening the requirements to protect the health and safety of children in child care and enhan cing the quality of child care and the early childhood workforce across the country. Thereafter, on September 30, 2016, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Child Care, Administration for Children and Families (\"ACF\") issued a final rule amending 45 C.F.R. Parts 98 and 99 (\"implementing regulations\" or \"federal regulations\") 2 to implement the reauthorized CCDBG Act. The CCDBG Act made sweeping statutory changes that required significant reforms to the District's Child Developm ent Facility regulations to raise the health, safety, and quality standards of child care, ensure more stable child care assistance to families, and enhance the consumer outreach and education for families. These new requirements reflect current research o n the importance of stable, high quality early experiences to children's future success. In addition, studies have shown the increasing cost of child care and the important role of financial assistance in helping parents afford child care. The implementi ng regulations, amending 45 C.F.R. Parts 98 and 99, add new detailed requirements that are either directly mandated by or advance the revised intent of the CCDBG Act. The relevant major provisions of the CCDBG Act provide requirements to: (1) protect the health and safety of children in child care; (2) help parents make informed consumer choices and access information to support child development; and (3) enhance the quality of child care and the early childhood workforce. First, the CCDBG Act established minimum health and safety standards including mandatory criminal background checks, annual monitoring of providers, and specific health and safety trainings. Accordingly, children cared for in licensed child development facilities in the District will be cared for by caregivers who have had basic training in health and safety practices and child development. Parents will know that individuals who care for their children do not have prior criminal records that indicate potential endangerment of their childr en. These changes to the District's licensing scheme not only conforms with the requirements set forth by the federal government but recognizes that health and safety is a necessary foundation for quality child care that supports early learning and develo pment. Second, the CCDBG Act increased consumer education requirements for the District and made clear that parents need transparent information about health and safety practices, monitoring results, and the quality of child care providers. Currently info rmation on OSSE's licensing and monitoring process is available at (insert URL with flow charts). By November 19, 2017 the results of monitoring visits and substantiated complaints must be made available on an OSSE website. To further support this provisio n of the CCDBG Act, the District is implementing an enhanced quality rating and improvement system (QRIS), to assist providers in improving the quality of care. In addition, the CCDBG Act requires that all licensing inspectors, who conduct pre-licensure in spections and monitoring visits, are qualified to inspect the facilities and have received training in related health and safety requirements appropriate to provider setting and age of children served. Finally, the CCDBG Act requires the District to imple ment training and professional development standards for caregivers. The implementing regulations build on this requirement by outlining the components of a professional development framework. The CCDBG Act emphasized the fundamental importance of the care giver in a high -quality early learning setting, and this final rulemaking helps ensure that early childhood professionals have the knowledge and skills they need to support the health and development of young children. While the CCDBG Act does provide som e flexibility to states in developing child care policies, the implementing regulations clearly provide where states have and do not have opportunities to 3 exercise flexibility. For example, the CCDBG Act requires facilities receiving CCDF funds to particip ate in QRIS. Accordingly, the State Superintendent has limited the requirement to participate in QRIS to facilities that receive CCDF funding, while providing the opportunity for all licensed facilities to participate. However, when a requirement is mandat ed only for facilities receiving CCDF funding, the federal government encourages states to apply the requirements to all licensed facilities. Because the District's goal is to provide safe and high quality care to all children in the District, mandating th e same health and safety requirements across all licensed facilities in the District is necessary to avoid a bifurcated system in which subsidy eligible children have access to only a portion of child care providers who meet applicable standards. ACF used this rationale to mandate criminal background checks for all licensed providers across the country. This final rulemaking also aligns with recommendations produced with the expertise of researchers, physicians, and practitioners set forth in Caring for O ur Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards; Guidelines for Early Care and Education Programs, 3rd Edition (American Academy of Pediatrics, American Public Health Association, National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care a nd Early Education, Washington DC (2011) (available at http://cfoc.nrckids.org/StandardView.cfm ) (\"Caring for Our Children \"). Caring for Our Children is a set of recommendations intended to create a common framework to align basic health and safety efforts across all early childhood settings. Recently, ACF published \"Caring for Our Children Basics \" (\"CfoC basics.pdf ) to provide the minimum, baseline standards for health and safety based on Caring for Our Children . ACF recommends that states looking for guidance on establishing health and safety standards consult CfoC Basics . However, ACF encourages states to go beyond the baseline standards to develop a comprehensive and robust set of health and safety standards that cover additional areas related to program design, caregiver safety, a nd child developmental needs, using Caring for Our Children . As with the reauthorized CCDBG Act, this final rulemaking is intended to be an integral part of supporting families, promoting both the healthy development of children in the District of Columbi a and parents' pathways to the middle class, and improving the overall quality of child care in the District. III. Summary of the Rulemaking This final rulemaking creates a new Chapter 1 (Child Development Facilities: Licensing) of Title 5-A DCMR, which sets forth the framework for obtaining and maintaining a license to operate a Child Development Facility in the District, and the requirements and standards that apply to all licensed child development facilities including the new CCDBG requirements. More specifically, the sections of Chapter 1 of Title 5 -A DCMR are organized into the following subject areas accordingly: (1) General Licensure Provisions: \u00a7\u00a7 100-102 License 103-117 (3) Requirements for All Licensees: \u00a7\u00a7 Facilities, Supplies, Equipment and Environmental (8) Health Promotion and Protection: Require ments for Licensed Centers: \u00a7\u00a7 162-166 (10) Additional Requirements for Licensed Child Development Homes: \u00a7\u00a7 167-168 (11) Additional Requirements for Licensed Expanded Child Development Homes: \u00a7\u00a7 169-171 (12) Additional Requirements for Out -of-School \u00a7\u00a7 172-176 IV. Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking The majority of the current regulations at Chapter 3 of Title 29 DCMR were last revised in 2007. Understanding that any changes to the licensing regulations would have a significant impact on a number of children, families and businesses in the District, OSSE issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on OSSE's website on December 24, 2015 to provide the early learning community and stakeholders with an opportunity to provide comment prior to an issuance of proposed rulemaking. The comment period for the ANPR was open for forty -five (45) days, closing February 8, 2016. In addition, OSSE held four public hearings during the public comment period in various locations throughout the District to s olicit verbal or written comments from the public on the ANPR. Notice of the Public Hearings and the forthcoming ANPR was published in the D.C. Register at 62 DCR 16097 on December 18, 2015. Further, the Notice provided that Amharic, Chinese, French, Spani sh, Vietnamese, Korean and Sign Language interpreters would be available if the services were requested prior to the selected hearing date. By the end of the ANPR public comment period, OSSE received comments from over twenty (20) various interested partie s, including individual stakeholders, child development facilities, and non -profit organizations throughout the District. OSSE reviewed and thoroughly considered all comments received on the ANPR and at the public meetings. Overall, stakeholders provide d valuable insights and feedback, enabling OSSE to refine and significantly improve its earlier proposed rule and draft revisions. V. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking On September 9, 2016, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was published in the D.C. Register , which included amendments based on comments received during the ANPR, for a thirty (30) day public comment period at 63 DCR 11279 . OSSE also held a meeting for all licensed child development facilities to discuss the proposed rulemaking on September 10, 2 016 where over 100 providers attended. The public comment period for the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking closed on October 11, 2016, with the State Superintendent having received comments from seventeen (17) interested parties, including individual stakehold ers, child development facilities, and non -profit organizations throughout the District. During the public comment period, OSSE received a few requests for a non -English translation of the proposed regulations and an extension of the comment period. Whil e OSSE greatly 5 appreciates the work of the facilities serving the District's diverse population, there is not current precedent for the translation of District rulemakings. This is because, pursuant to the Language Access Act of 2004, effective June 19, 20 04 (D.C. Law 15 -167; D.C. Official Code \u00a7\u00a7 2 -1931 et seq. (2012 Repl.)), District agencies, including OSSE, are not legally required to provide the requested translations of the proposed rulemaking. Specifically, D .C. Official Code \u00a7 2-1933 provides that: A covered entity shall provide translations of vital documents into any non - English language spoken by a limited or no -English proficient population that constitutes 3% or 500 individuals, whichever is less, of the population served or encountered, or lik ely to be served or encountered, by the covered entity in the District of Columbia. (Emphasis added). The relevant portion of the definition of \"vital document\" provides: Vital documents means applications, notices, complaint forms, legal contracts, and outreach materials published by a covered entity in a tangible format that inform individuals about their rights or eligibility requirements for benefits and participation. D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2 -1931. The definition does not expressly state that proposed regulations are vital documents. Rather, it concerns documents that are actually in effect and being used. Further a regulation is not itself an application, notice, complaint form, legal contract, or outreach material. Therefore, the proposed text of Ch apter 1 in Title 5 -A was not a vital document for which translation was legally required. Nonetheless, OSSE will issue a document summarizing key components of the regulations that will be available in Amharic, Chinese, French, Spanish, and Vietnamese on O SSE's website in the near future. In summary, a majority of the comments received requested clarification around the various requirements but did not seek amendments. Accordingly, the comments received did not compel the State Superintendent to make any s ubstantive changes to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and the State Superintendent is therefore issuing these regulations without further request for comment. However, to provide further transparency and respond to requests for clarification, the State Superintendent (1) responds to a majority of the stakeholders' comments and (2) identifies any non -substantive technical changes included in this final rulemaking, below: A. General Licensure Provisions Sections 100 through 102 provide the general pro visions for child development licenses. The State Superintendent did not receive many comments in these sections. One commenter sought clarification regarding \u00a7 102.9, which provides that a licensed facility that does not accept public funding may particip ate in OSSE's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS). Licensed facilities that do not receive public funding are, therefore, not required to participate in the QRIS. The State Superintendent received a number of comments during the ANPR requesting th at the mandate to participate in the QRIS was aligned to the CCDBG Act and limited to licensed facilities accepting public funding. The State Superintendent accepted the recommendation in the 6 proposed rulemaking and will maintain the proposed language in t he final rulemaking. While not required, both the federal government and OSSE encourage all licensed facilities to participate in the QRIS. Additionally, a commenter noted that the language in \u00a7 101.3(a) was confusing and needed clarification. In response to this comment, OSSE clarified the language by striking the word \"no\" and adding a comma before the phrase \"on a regular basis.\" One commenter requested clarification of the exemption for \"informal or occasional parent - supervised play groups\" in \u00a7 101.5 (d). Section 101.5 sets forth the services and activities exempted from obtaining a license to operate a child development facility. Some of the services and activities are specifically exempted from licensure in the Facilities Act (D.C. Official Code \u00a7 7-1022). The rest of the services and activities are not new exemptions per se but rather OSSE clarifying language in the law defining a \"child development facility\" as one that provides care and other services for children on a regular basis by identifying additional entities that does not meet the definition, including an informal or occasional parent -supervised play group. OSSE intended that an informal or occasional parent -supervised play group is understood as a group of parents with their respective ch ildren gathering for the children to play together while their parents supervised. OSSE did not intend for the informal or occasional parent -supervised play group to be one parent supervising, and ultimately caring for, a group of children and where the group of children are gathered on a regular basis at the same place with a different parent supervising each time. Section 199 presents the definitions for the terms and phrases used throughout the rulemaking. Two comments were received regarding the defi nitions. One commenter requested that OSSE reconsider the definition of \"child development center\". The definition of \"child development center\" is based on the number of children a facility serves and the premises where child care is provided, not the ty pe of program that is offered, thereby distinguishing a \"center\" from a \"home\" or \"expanded home\" offering child care services. The commenter further requested \"private nursery schools and private child care centers\" are included in OSSE's definition of \"private school.\" However, neither the proposed rulemaking nor this final rulemaking define \"private school.\" Private, parochial and independent schools that meet certain requirements are either entirely exempted from licensure or exempted from specific prov isions of licensure in the final rulemaking. The Facilities Act specifically excludes private schools \"engaged in legally required and related functions\" from the definition and therefore the requirement to be licensed. OSSE interprets this provision to me an a private school offering both kindergarten to twelfth grade services and pre -k services are exempted from licensure for services provided during the instructional day. This interpretation aligns with conforming amendments made to the Facilities Act whe n the Pre -k Act was passed to exempt pre -K programs in DCPS, public charter and high quality community based organizations from licensure. The final rulemaking makes this exemption clear in \u00a7 101.5(l). In addition, private, parochial, or independent schoo ls caring for infants and toddlers that meet certain requirements, including offering a pre -K through twelfth (12th) grade educational program or any portion thereof, are exempted from provisions in the rulemaking around daily program activities and teache r qualifications. Accordingly, \"private nursery schools and private child care centers\" are not a school offering pre -K through twelfth 7 (12th) grade educational programming and could not meet the requirements for either exemption from licensure or exempti on from specific provisions of licensure. Another comment requested the \"District of Columbia Early Learning Standards\" be clarified in the body of the rule, and not in the definitions. Similarly, the State Superintendent received recommendation to strike Section 140.1, which requires that a licensee implement a curriculum consistent with the \"District of Columbia Early Learning Standards.\" These comments will be addressed below in G. Program Activities for Healthy Development. B. License Application an d Maintenance Sections 103 -117 describe how to obtain and maintain a license to operate a child development facility. The State Superintendent received a number of comments specifically regarding the components of an initial application, the components of a renewal application, waivers, restricted licenses, fees, monitoring and inspections, authority for enforcement actions, and summary suspension. Initial Application Section 103 sets forth the components of an initial application for a license to operat e a child development facility. First, two commenters raised questions seeking clarification about the three (3) hour orientation described in \u00a7 103.2, specifically asking whether the three (3) hour orientation is required every time a license is sought fo r a new facility and whether the training would be available online. The orientation is required every time a license is sought for a new facility, even if the facility is under the same ownership as another facility. The orientation will be offered online and in person. However, to clarify that this requirement is required every time a license is sought, OSSE strikes the phrase \"three (3) hour\" to allow OSSE to adjust the orientation as necessary for various audiences. This non -substantive amendment maint ains OSSE intent to ensure anyone opening a facility, whether new or the same ownership, is aware of the requirements to both obtain and maintain a license to operate a facility in the District. Additionally, the State Superintendent received a number of comments regarding the required supporting documentation in \u00a7 103.5. Commenters specifically sought clarification around the clean hands certification, insurance coverage, and the building use agreement. One commenter noted that facilities that operate as non-profit organizations do not pay taxes and therefore would not need a Clean Hand certification. However, the Clean Hands certification does not serve as evidence that an applicant has filed taxes, rather, the Clean Hands certification verifies that an applicant does not owe more than $100 to the District of Columbia. The Clean Hands Law (D.C. Official Code \u00a7\u00a7 47 -2861 -2866) provides that an applicant for any license or permit in the District of Columbia cannot owe more than $100 to the District governmen t. Another comment asked for clarification around how much insurance coverage a facility must obtain, as \u00a7 103.5(f) does not indicate the total amount required for each type of insurance coverage. Section 103.5(f) does state, however, that a facility must have proof of reasonable coverage, as determined by the District of Columbia Office of Risk Management. Reasonable coverage will vary based on the size and type of facility and the services provided. Four stakeholders commented about the requirements set f orth for building use agreements set forth in \u00a7 103.5(g). A building use agreement is necessary to ensure a proper contingency location, a space that may be used to 8 maintain child care services if the primary location is not available, is identified. In Se ction 107.2, a Licensee may relocate to its identified contingency location for no more than thirty days due to temporary closure. Specifically, commenters asked whether notarizing an agreement was necessary, raised concerns about the amount of information required in a building use agreement, and sought clarification around the \"health and safety inspections\" requirement. The State Superintendent appreciates these comments and recognizes that a building use agreement is a new requirement, however, securing a contingency location through a valid building use agreement is essential to providing stability to children and staff during an emergency situation by allowing a licensee to continue to provide care and education even if the facility's actual premise is not usable. To clarify \u00a7 103.5(g)(6), the State Superintendent has struck \"health and\" and added \"that are required\". Additionally, one commenter asked whether another licensed facility could serve as a contingency location. Another licensed facility may only serve as a contingency location if the facility is licensed to serve more children than currently enrolled. Finally, although no comments were received seeking clarification, the State Superintendent amended the phrase to \"not more than ninety (90) da ys old\" to \u00a7 103.5(b) to clarify this provision. This amendment is intended to clarify that the State Superintendent requires a fire safety inspection certificate that is both current and specifically for the operation of a child development facility. It is also worth noting that this final rulemaking continues to reserve Subsections 103.5(d) and 129.2(d) for requirements to limit, eliminate, and protect children from lead -based water hazards. Also, provisions to protect children from lead -based paint haza rds are in this final rulemaking in Subsections 103.5(c), 129.2(c), and 152.4 through 152.5. Renewal Application Section 104 sets forth the components of an application for a renewal license to operate a child development facility. Specifically, \u00a7 104.5 p rovides what supporting documentation is required for the application, which is almost identical to the required supporting documentation in \u00a7 103.5, however, there is one additional document, the Certificate of Immunization Compliance. The Certificate of Immunization Compliance is issued by the District's Department of Health and certifies that the facility has reached the immunization compliance target for enrolled children and staff. One commenter asked whether child development homes would be required t o obtain a Certificate of Immunization Compliance. All facilities, including centers, child development homes and expanded homes, must obtain a Certificate of Immunization Compliance to support the application for renewal license, unless the facility is gr anted a waiver pursuant to \u00a7 106. The commenter further asked how the Certificate of Immunization Compliance would take into account the grace period provided for immunizations. The current process to obtain a Certificate of Immunization Compliance from t he Department of Health would remain the same, even with the new grace period. Facilities will continue to work with Department of Health's Immunization Program to keep them informed of the status of their students. However, if a facility has not reached i mmunization compliance targets for enrolled children and staff because some children are within their grace periods, then the facility may apply for a waiver pursuant to \u00a7 106. It is worth noting that OSSE received a number of comments during the ANPR co mment period that the current immunization compliance target, ninety -eight percent (98%), is unrealistic and 9 unattainable. In response, OSSE removed the actual target percentage in the proposed rulemaking. OSSE continues to not include the actual target pe rcentage in the final rulemaking and will issue guidance setting forth a new immunization compliance target shortly. Section 104.12 provides that a renewal application may be denied if the applicant failed to abate identified deficiencies within the requi red timeframe provided by OSSE. Section 104.12 does not provide a specific number of days as the required timeframe. One commenter recommended a longer timeframe than ninety (90) days to abate deficiencies and further recommended that OSSE provide thirty ( 30) days for an applicant to submit a corrective action plan according to a timetable, similar to Headstart. The State Superintendent appreciates the comment. However, because the timeframe to abate will vary based on the nature of the deficiency, the Stat e Superintendent retain the language as proposed and will not add a specific timeframe to abate identified deficiencies to this final rulemaking. Waiver Section 106 provides licensees and applicants with waiver of compliance for one or more licensure prov isions. Prior to the proposed rulemaking, the only flexibility available to licensees and applicants was a variance from the physical or structural requirements. This section allows OSSE to grant waivers for any licensing provision so long as the requireme nts in \u00a7106 are met. The State Superintendent received three comments on the provisions in this section. One comment asked whether all three factors in \u00a7 106.1 must be considered. Subsection 106.1 requires that OSSE must determine, based on clear and convi ncing evidence, that all three factors are met. The waiver application must provide evidence and support for each factor. The commenter further asked what notice would be provided if a waiver was revoked and whether a facility would be provided with time t o cure before a waiver is revoked. Because any waiver is issued at the discretion of OSSE to the sole benefit of a facility, notice and opportunities to cure are not provided in the same manner as if OSSE issued a summary suspension. Restricted License Section 107 outlines the requirements for a restricted license which is issued as an alternative to suspending or revoking an existing license when a licensed facility has one or more deficiencies. Two comments regarding restricted licenses were received. One commenter recommended that OSSE only issue a restricted license for three or more deficiencies, instead of one or more deficiencies. However, because the nature of the deficiency varies and one major deficiency may severely limit a facility's ability to operate, the State Superintendent does not accept this recommendation. Another commenter sought clarification of \u00a7 107.2, which prohibits a facility operating under a restricted license from enrolling additional children. Specifically, the commenter ask ed whether a facility was prohibited from increasing its current enrollment or that enrollment was \"frozen\" as of the date of the issuance of the restricted license. The intent of this subsection was to ensure that facilities operating under a restricted l icense did not attempt to serve more children until the deficiency or limitation leading to the need for a restricted license is corrected. Accordingly, a facility's enrollment is frozen as of the date the restricted licensed is issued until the deficiency is abated. Fees 10 Section 108 sets forth the various fees for licensure. The fee structure provided in both the ANPR and the proposed rulemaking shifts the District's practices from issuing a one (1) year license to issuing a three (3) year license. One c ommenter asked if new applicants would be required to pay both an application fee of seventy -five dollars ($75) and the applicable license fee. OSSE appreciates the commenter's request for clarification. Applicants seeking an initial license and a renewal license are required to pay the application fee and the applicable licensing fee. To avoid further confusion, the State Superintendent deleted the word \"initial\" in \u00a7 108.2 to clarify the application fee was required for both an initial application and a renewal application. Another commenter raised the concern that the fee for the three (3) year license was burdensome, and further, that the benefit of a three (3) year license was not clear as facilities would still have to meet certain annual requirements . OSSE recognizes the financial impact that shifting to a three (3) year license may have on facilities. In order to aid facilities with the cost of both the license and the application fee, OSSE will allow facilities to set up payment plan agreement. Howe ver, it must be noted that by shifting to a three (3) year licensing scheme, OSSE is able to shift its efforts from licensing facilities to quality -focused monitoring. This shift will improve the quality of child care and education across the District. Two commenters requested that the State Superintendent amend \u00a7 108.7 to require OSSE publish a new fee schedule ninety (90) days before any new fee is implemented. OSSE will publish any new fee schedule in accordance with the District's laws and regulation s requiring proper notice and comment. Monitoring and Inspections The Facilities Act provides OSSE with the authority to conduct investigations and inspections of licensed facilities to ensure compliance with both the Facilities Act and the licensing reg ulations. In addition, the CCDBG Act emphasizes the importance of regular monitoring of child care settings to ensure compliance with appropriate standards that protect the health and safety of children and mandates that a state conduct annual monitoring visits. Accordingly, Section 111 sets forth the provisions around monitoring and inspections of licensed facilities. Four comments were received for this section. One commenter requested that the State Superintendent amend \u00a7 111.1 to require that OSSE sign in before monitoring a facility and provide documentation detailing the reason for the visit. The State Superintendent did not accept this recommendation. Often, OSSE will inspect a licensing facility based on a complaint. If the complaint alleges imminen t harm, OSSE reports to the facility immediately and in those situations may not have opportunity to create documentation of the reasons for a visit. Another comment questions whether OSSE having access to a facility's administrative records in \u00a7 111.5(a) suggests that OSSE could ask for records that are not relevant to compliance with the Facilities Act and the licensing regulations. While OSSE understands the commenters concerns, access to all records is necessary for OSSE to determine compliance. Further more, this is not a new requirement and was previously set forth in 29 DCMR \u00a7 303.4. One commenter questioned whether the requirement that OSSE have access to a facility's surveillance footage in \u00a7 111.5(c) is legal. OSSE is not mandating that a facility have recording devices, rather, OSSE is requiring that if a facility has recording devices, OSSE shall have access to review footage, which is a facility's record of the events taking place, to ensure compliance. 11 Finally, OSSE has received comments that facilities have received inconsistent and arbitrary enforcement of the licensing regulations. The CCDBG Act requires that all licensing inspectors, who conduct pre -licensure inspections and monitoring visits, are qualified to inspect the facilities and hav e received training in related health and safety requirements appropriate to provider setting and age of children served. Accordingly, to comply with this CCDBG Act requirement and address the comments received regarding the enforcement of the licensing re gulations, OSSE's licensing specialist will all complete training provided by the National Association for Regulatory Administration (\"NARA\"). NARA is an international professional organization dedicated to promoting excellence in human care regulation and licensing through leadership, education, collaboration, and services. NARA represents all human care licensing, including child care, older adult care, child welfare, and program licensing for services related to mental illness, developmental disabilities and abuse of drugs or alcohol. Enforcement Action Section 112 provides the overarching provisions for all enforcement actions a facility may be subject to and the following sections provide further detail for each specific enforcement action, where nece ssary. Section 112.1 sets forth a list of the various enforcement actions for violations of local or federal laws or regulations. Two commenters requested that \"(g) Civil Fines;\" and \"(j) Criminal Prosecution\" be removed from the list of possible enforceme nt actions. These two enforcement actions are not new actions but existed in the prior licensing regulations. Further, the authority to issue civil fines or pursue criminal prosecution is set forth in \u00a7 116. However, to provide clarity, the State Superinte ndent amended the language in \u00a7 112.1 by adding \"or any other authorized government entity when that agency or entity has jurisdiction .\" This amended language is consistent with the original intent in the proposed rulemaking but eliminates unnecessary ambi guity that the proper District authority could issue civil fines or pursue criminal prosecution for violation of applicable laws and regulations. Another commenter has asked for the rationale and legal authority to not provide advanced written notice to a facility prior to summary suspension or issuance of a cease and desist order in \u00a7 112.3. A summary suspension or cease and desist order is issued in situations when children are in imminent harm. In those situations, OSSE has the right and responsibility to immediately remove children and staff from harm prior to issuing written notice. Summary Suspension The Facilities Act provides OSSE with authority to issue a summary suspension for imminent harm. Section 114.3 provides examples of imminent harm. Comm enters did not request any amendment to the language in \u00a7 114.3 but have requested clarification regarding the standard for \"poor air quality\" and the meaning of \"inadequate staffing\". The standard for poor air quality is set by the United State Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and evaluated by the District's DOEE. According to Caring for Our Children , children are particularly vulnerable to air pollution because their systems (respiratory, central nervous system, etc.) ar e still developing and they also breathe in more air relative to their weight than adults do. Indoor air pollution is often greater than outdoor levels of air pollution due to a general lack of adequate air filtration and ventilation, and lingering and bui ld up of air contaminants emitted from certain furnishings. The presence of dirt, moisture, and warmth encourages the growth of mold and other contaminants, which can trigger allergic reactions and asthma. Inadequate staffing is any deficiencies in staffin g that are required to operate a licensed facility 12 in accordance with this rulemaking. Two stakeholders commented about the requirements set forth in \u00a7 114.6, specifically asking how soon parents should be provided with notification and recommending that t he four components were re -ordered. Section 114.6 sets forth what a Licensee must do immediately, once a Notice of Summary Suspension has been delivered. All four requirements must be completed, including providing written notification to parents immediate ly based on the circumstance for the suspension. Because all four requirements must be completed immediately, re -ordering the components is not necessary. C. Requirements For All Licensees Sections 118 to 121 set forth the overarching requirements for all licensed child development facilities, specifically for supervision and the adult -to-child ratios and group sizes. The State Superintendent received a number of comments on supervision and the adult -to-child ratios. A commenter questioned whether th e reference to \u00a7 115.3 in \u00a7 118.2 was incorrect. The State Superintendent agreed, recognized the drafting error, and amended the rulemaking to strike \u00a7 115.3 and replace it with \u00a7 118.3. Supervision Section 120 provides the requirements for supervision of children while in the care of a licensed facility. Specifically, \u00a7 120.5 requires that a staff member should be assigned to a specific group of children, know both the names and whereabouts of the children, be physically present with the children and be able to state how many children are in their care at all time. This standard ensures that the facility knows which children are receiving care at any given time and who is responsible for directly supervising each child. One commenter recommended that thi s requirement not apply to child development homes, as they are often a multi -age group with one or more teachers working together. Regardless of whether a child development center or child development home, OSSE recognizes that supervision is key to ensur ing safety and the prevention of injury and to maintaining quality child care. Therefore, the State Superintendent has decided to retain the requirement as proposed. Another commenter questioned whether this requirement was too specific and thereby interfe red with a facility's authority to create operational policies. Similarly, this commenter also noted that \u00a7 120.7, requiring that the performance of other staff duties should not interfere with the supervision of children, also interfered with a facility's authority to create operational policies. The State Superintendent considered these comments, however, as noted above, OSSE recognizes that proper supervision is the fundamental to providing the District's children with quality child care. The requirement s in Section 120 establish minimal standards necessary to provide active and positive supervision, and therefore, the State Superintendent retains the requirements as proposed. This standard ensures that the facility knows which children are receiving care at any given time and who is responsible for directly supervising each child. Adult -to-Child Ratios and Group Size Section 121 sets forth the various ratios and group sizes for child care centers, homes and expanded homes, based on the age and number of children served by a facility. Section 121 also offers flexibility where ratios may differ for various reasons. OSSE received a number of comments regarding the provisions in \u00a7 121. 13 First, in response to the ratios set forth in \u00a7 121.3(a), a commenter re quested that the 1:10 ratio for child development centers is lowered to 36 -60 months, instead of 48 -60 months. OSSE considered these comments, however OSSE has elected not to incorporate the commenter's suggested changes. The purpose of setting ratios and group sizes is to provide healthy and safe conditions for children, as well as meet children's developmental needs. Adult -to-Child ratios should be set such that caregivers can demonstrate the capacity to meet health and safety requirements and evaluate t he needs of children in their care in a timely manner. Section 121.3(b) sets forth the ratios and group sizes for child development centers providing out-of-school -time care to school age children. One comment requested the State Superintendent re-instate the ratios and group sizes in 29 DCMR 343.5, which provided a 1:12 ratio and maximum group size of 24 for children under six (6) years old and a 1:15 ratio and maximum group size of 30 for children 6 years and older. The commenter notes that the National Afterschool Association recommends a ratio between 1:10 and 1:15, with group sizes not to exceed thirty (30). OSSE appreciates this comment as OSSE did not intend to change in ratio for child development centers providing out -of-school -time care to school age children through the proposed rulemaking but was altered due to a drafting error. Because the former ratio and group size requirements for child development centers providing out -of-school -time care to school age children meet the National Afterschool Association's recommendations, OSSE has amended 121.3(b). Section 121.3(b) sets forth the ratios and group sizes for child development homes and expanded child development homes. One comment recommends amending the maximum group size in an expanded child development home from nine (9) to twelve (12) when there are more than four (4) children under two (2) years old. OSSE considered these comments, however elected not to incorporate the commenter's suggested changes. The National Fire Protection Associatio n 101: Life Safety Code from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) recommends no more than three children younger than 2 years of age be cared for where two caregivers are caring for up to 12 children because low child to staff ratios for non -ambulatory children are essential for fire safety. Also, in reviewing the proposed rulemaking, OSSE recognized that the maximum size of group heading in table in \u00a7 121.3(c) was unclear. A child development home can only serve up to six (6) children and an e xpanded child development homes can only serve up to (12) children, and therefore, OSSE struck the heading \"maximum size of group\" and replaced it with \"maximum number of children enrolled.\" One commenter questioned why child development homes have a rat io of 1:6 and a group size of twelve (12) with one child under two (2) years when child development centers must maintain a ratio of 1:4 and a group size of eight (8) with one child under two (2) years. Child development homes offer care to children from birth to age 14 in one setting and therefore have different ratios and group size then centers. Section 121.7 provides that volunteers shall not to be used to meet ratio requirements, unless otherwise provided. OSSE received two comments requesting clari fication of this requirement as 14 programs may rely on volunteers to help meet the ratio, such as students completing their practicum hours. A facility may use volunteers to meet ratio requirements only as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 121.9, 121.10, 121.11, such as durin g non -peak hours, nap or rest period, or substituting for an assistant teacher in a part day program. OSSE has elected not to incorporate other circumstances when a volunteer may be used to meet ratio requirements. The role that volunteers play in a licens ed facility is addressed in Section 138. Section 121.8 requires that child development centers shall have two (2) staff members supervising each group at all times. A commenter recommended that when a teacher is supervising children in public spaces, whe re both children and staff are under the supervision of other staff, and within ratio, a second teacher should not be required. OSSE considered these comments, however OSSE has elected not to incorporate the commenter's suggested changes. Caring for Our Ch ildren recommends that the adult to staff ratio should be met during all hours of operation, including indoor and outdoor play and field trips, and that no child development center should operate with fewer than two staff members if more than six children are in care, even if the group otherwise meets the adult to child ratio. The second teacher's presence is necessary to help in the event of an emergency or evacuation. Section 121.10 provides that when children thirty (30) months and older are grouped to gether to nap, only one staff member is required to be supervising the children, while a second staff member should be present on the same floor and immediately available to assist. One comment questioned whether the second person may be assigned to more t hat one group on the same floor. Because the purpose of the second person on the same floor is to support the first teacher supervising the napping children during an emergency response or evacuation, the second person should only be assigned to one group. In sum, the comments in this section mainly requested that OSSE decrease the adult to child ratio requirements. However, low adult -to-child ratios support the health and safety of children and allows for stronger relationships between a child and their caregiver, which is a key component of quality child care. D. Facilities, Supplies, Equipment and Environmental Health Sections 122 through 126 set forth the health and safety standards for a child development facility's premise. At their core, the hea lth and safety standards in this final rulemaking are intended to make child care safer and thus lower the risk of harm to children. The State Superintendent received a number of comments in these sections, which are addressed below. General Requirements Section 122.3 sets forth the requirements for exits. One commenter noted that two of the four requirements, exits are visible and exits are arranged or marked so the path to exit the building is clear, contradict each another and sought clarification as t o whether both requirements were necessary. OSSE adopted the commenter's suggestion that both requirements may lead to confusion, deleted \"visible at all times\" from \u00a7 122.3(b), added \"visible and\" to \"arranged or marked so the path to exit the building is visible and clear, and re -lettered the other requirements accordingly. 15 Section 122.7 provides that a facility must undergo an additional fire inspection in certain situations, at their own expense. One commenter sought clarification as to why a facility is required to obtain an additional fire inspection to change the ages of the children to be served at the facility. OSSE appreciates the request for clarification. OSSE intended that a facility should obtain a new fire inspection, and Certificate of Occu pancy, if there was an increase in the number of children enrolled under 30 months of age as this would impact a facility's ability to safely serve the number of children and evacuate in an emergency. Accordingly, to ensure there is not any further misunde rstanding, OSSE amended the requirement in both \u00a7 122.5(c) \u00a7 122.7(c) by striking \"change the age of children\" and inserted \"increase the number of children under thirty (30) months of age\" in its place. A new fire inspection will determine whether t he facility will continues to meet all applicable fire safety codes for the new age groups and determine whether all children and staff could be safely evacuated during an emergency. Another stakeholder commented that \u00a7 122.12 could be misinterpreted as requiring windows are covered at all times. To ensure that no such misunderstanding occurs, OSSE has further clarified this in the final rule by amending \u00a7 122.12(b) by inserting the phrase \"protected with guards that prevent exit by a child.\" This amendme nt maintains the intent of this section in the proposed rulemaking, which was to ensure that children were safe from various harms within a center, such as falling down stairs, strangulation by cords, or falling out a window. In addition, the State Super intendent deleted \u00a7 122.17 in its entirety and renumbered accordingly to clarify the requirements for electric fans because the requirements were already set forth in \u00a7 122.15(a) and therefore unnecessarily repetitive. Section 122.24 requires that smoke detectors are tested monthly. A comment requested that OSSE amend to require testing quarterly as larger centers have external companies that conduct such testing and therefore compliance with monthly testing would be unnecessarily burdensome and costly. OSSE adopted the commenter's suggestion and replaced monthly with quarterly in \u00a7 122.24. This amendment does not alter the intent of this provision, to ensure smoke detectors were examined on a consistent basis and therefore this non -substantive change doe s not require further request for comment. The State Superintendent also amended \u00a7 122.25, requirements for fire drills, by striking the word \"quarterly\" and inserting the word \"monthly.\" This change reflects the current requirement for monthly fire dri lls as mandated by Section 405, \"Emergency Evacuation Drills\" of the International Fire Code (IFC 2014). The State Superintendent did not intend to change the monthly requirement but was altered due to a drafting error. Lavatory Space To clarify the inte nt of the requirement set forth in \u00a7 123.5, the State Superintendent deleted the phrase \"within children's reach\" and replaced it with \"in a manner accessible for independent use\". In addition, one commenter requested the State Superintendent amended \u00a7 123 .6 to add \"that are not independently using toilet facilities\" to clarify that changing tables are only required for children who are not independently using toilet facilities. The State Superintendent agrees 16 that this change will reflect the intent of the previous wording of \u00a7 123.6 and further clarify the requirement. Indoor Environment Two commenters sought clarification regarding the required temperature settings set forth in \u00a7 124.2. One commenter specifically asked why the State Superintendent did not just require a facility maintain a temperature between sixty -eight (68\u00b0F) degrees to eighty -two (82\u00b0F) degrees year round. This requirement is not a new requirement and was previously required in the 29 DCMR \u00a7 340.3. In addition, the temperature requir ements in the final rulemaking align with the recommended temperatures in Caring for Our Children , based on the standards of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air -Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), which takes both comfort and health into c onsideration. Section 124.7 requires individuals remove or cover shoes prior to entering an infant play area. These individuals, as well as the infants playing in that area, may wear shoes, shoe covers, or socks that are used only in the play area for tha t group of infants. One commenter questioned whether OSSE, by setting this requirement, exceeded its regulatory authority. The commenter further asked whether OSSE would provide funding to facilities to comply with this requirement. Mandating that individu als either remove their shoes or place covers over their shoes is within OSSE's authority to regulate licensed child development facilities as this requirement ensures the health and safety of infants by protecting them from hazardous toxins. When infants play, they touch the surfaces on which they play with their hands, and then put their hands in their mouths. As noted in Caring for Our Children, facilities can meet this requirement in several ways - designating contained play surfaces for infant play on which no one walks with shoes, wearing shoes or slippers that are worn only to walk in infant play area, or wearing clean cloth or disposable shoe covers over shoes that have been used to walk outside the infant play area. Outdoor Environment Section 125 .10 requires a facility to inspect the outdoor play area daily. One stakeholder commented that this requirement was unnecessary and unrealistic and requested this requirement be removed. OSSE considered these comments, however OSSE has elected not to incor porate the commenter's suggested amendment. First, the requirement for daily inspections of the outdoor play area is not a new requirement, as it was previously required in 29 DCMR 367.5. Furthermore, OSSE included this requirement because daily inspection s of the outdoor play area are critical to ensuring children's safety, preventing deterioration of equipment and accumulation of hazardous materials within the play site, and noticing wear and tear that requires maintenance. Equipment, Materials and Furn ishings Section 126.8 sets forth requirements for materials that are provided to children. One commenter recommended we strike \"large and small muscle development\" in \u00a7 126.8(f) and insert the phrase \"fine and gross motor skills\" in its place to align with the Head Start standards. The State Superintendent agreed with this recommendation and amended \u00a7 126.8(f) accordingly in the final rulemaking. Section 126.15 provides three (3) requirements for each cot or crib in a facility. Three (3) comments were rec eived on the requirement that each crib or cot is placed at least two (2) feet 17 apart from any other crib or cot, windows, and any radiators. One commenter specifically noted that it is not possible to meet two feet of separation from all sides in all insta nces. However, 126.15 only requires two feet of separation from all sides from other cribs or cots, windows and radiators when the crib or cot is in use. It further does not prohibit cribs being placed against a barrier, so long as the barrier itself is no t another crib, cot, window or radiator. A space of two feet between cribs or cots will provide access by the staff to a child in case of emergency. Sections 126.11 and 126.22 describe requirements for riding wheeled equipment. Two comments were received on this matter. During the ANPR, the State Superintendent received a number of comments as to what age was appropriate for children to begin riding bicycles and whether or not helmets should be required. The State Superintendent addressed the concerns rais ed in the ANPR and aligned the language with the guidance provided in Caring for Our Children . For example, one commenter noted that the requirement that children riding wheeled equipment must wear helmets is too expensive and burdensome. However, \u00a7 126.22 does not mandate that the Facility provide the helmets to the children, parents may bring the children's helmets. The requirement is that, if children are riding, then children must wear helmets. Helmets could be provided by the school, parents, or donate d. One of the main purposes of the final rulemaking is to ensure the safety of children while in care of child development facilities. Allowing children in licensed facilities to ride wheeled equipment without protective head gear goes against the purpose of this rulemaking and the State Superintendent has therefore retained the requirements in \u00a7 126.22 and \u00a7 126.11 as set forth in the proposed rulemaking. E. Administration and Operation Sections 127 to 131 set forth the requirements for the administratio n and operation of a child development facility. The State Superintendent received a number of comments in these sections, which are addressed below. Parent Communication Section 127.4 describes the policies and procedures a facility must implement and provide to parent(s) and guardian(s). The State Superintendent received one comment in this section. The comment sought clarification as to whether sleep sacks are acceptable \"appropriate sleep clothing\" that Facilities may communicate to parents. Caring f or Our Children provides that clothing sacks or other clothing designed for sleep may be used in lieu of blankets. Reporting Unusual Incidents Section 128 provides that a licensee is required to notify the State Superintendent if any unusual incident oc curs. One commenter sought clarification of the State Superintendent's intent of the language \"at the Facility\" in \u00a7 128.3(h). Specifically, commenter asked whether the State Superintendent intended to limit this requirement to the immediate vicinity of th e Facility, or if the State Superintendent intended to include incidents immediately outside of the Facility, as well. OSSE expects to be informed when any unusual incident occurs that impacts the health and safety of children and staff, whether directly o n Facility premises or nearby. Section 128.1 clearly provides that the basis for notification is whether the health, safety, or welfare of any enrolled child or children is affected, not where the incident occurs. Section 128.3 provides a list of potential unusual incidents to provide facilities with context for OSSE's expectations. 18 However, to ensure that no further misunderstanding occurs, OSSE has further clarified this in the final rule by adding \"may\" to \u00a7128.3 so that it now reads \"Unusual incidents m ay include, but are not limited to, the following\". Another comment noted that OSSE should require training on what constitutes \"reasonable cause\" if that is what the reporting requirement in \u00a7 128.5 is based upon. OSSE already requires such training as provided in Section 147.2(a), which states that a licensee must provide \"training to all staff upon initial hire and annually thereafter regarding the Facility's policies and procedures relating to child abuse, neglect, and risk to a child's health, safety or welfare, including to whom and how to report suspected abuse, neglect, or risk to a child's health, safety, or welfare.\" Recordkeeping Requirements for Children Section 130 provides the recordkeeping requirements for a child enrolled at the facility. These records are necessary to protect the health and safety of children in care as operational control requires that information regarding each child in care be kept and made available on a need -to- know basis. One commenter requested that OSSE clarify how we define \"complete record\" in \u00a7 130.3 and if \"complete record\" includes all documents listed in \u00a7 130.2. A complete record includes all documents listed in \u00a7 130.2 Another commenter sought clarification as to whether the record may be maintained digi tally. One commenter noted that the language \"in the form provided by or approved by OSSE\" indicates that the record may only be maintained in hard copy. However, the final rule maintains that records shall be maintained \"in a secured location with limited access,\" but do not specifically dictate the form they are to be maintained. Accordingly, a facility may maintain records in hard copy or digitally, so long as the records are maintained in a secure location with limited access. Another commenter sought clarity as to whether a record of the daily menu plan was required if children were bringing their own food from home, or if a document shared with families providing the USDA nutrition requirements was acceptable. In response to this request for clarific ation, OSSE added \"if the facility provides any meals or snacks to children\" to \u00a7 130.8. Recordkeeping Requirements for Staff Similar to 130, the following section, \u00a7 131, provides the requirements for records a Facility must maintain on all staff member s. The State Superintendent received comments that the information required for the staff member's record contained substantial personal information. One commenter questioned whether such information was necessary. Another commenter asked what if the staff member refuses to provide the required physical exams in \u00a7 131.5. The State Superintendent considered these comments and made one minor clarifying change by striking \"results of\" and inserting \"Documentation of\" in its place for \u00a7\u00a7 131.5(a) and (b). Compl ete identification of staff, whether paid or volunteer, is an essential step in safeguarding children in care. Caring for Our Children emphasizes that maintaining complete records on each staff person employed at a facility is a sound administrative practi ce. In addition, OSSE may use these records to ensure applicable licensing requirements are met, such as identifying information, educational qualifications, health assessment on file, record of continuing education, signed 19 statement of agreement to observ e the discipline policy, and guidelines for reporting suspected child abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse. Maintaining results of staff member's pre -employment physical examinations, annual physical examinations, and immunizations are necessary to ensure children's health and safety. Section 131.4 also addresses the records a facility should maintain for each volunteer, which includes standard identifying information, job description, and results of a comprehensive background check. One commenter recommended that phrase \"who work directly with children on an on -going basis\" should be added to \u00a7 131.4 to clarify which volunteers were required to provide such information. Another commenter sought clarification as to how the State Superintendent defined one who volunteers on an \"on -going basis\" in \u00a7 131.5. Both comments are addressed in the discussion of Section 138: Volunteers and Aides below. F. Staffing Sections 132 through 136 address staff members' suitability for employment in a child development facility , including criminal background checks, traffic record checks, and drug and alcohol testing provisions. The State Superintendent received a number of comments in these sections, which will be addressed below. First, one commenter suggested that the langu age in \u00a7 132.1 was offensive to the child care community. OSSE amended the language by striking \"suitable\" and \"of moral character and dedication.\" This amendment did not change the intent of \u00a7 132.1 but rather removes ambiguous and potentially offensive l anguage. Criminal Background Checks Section 133 sets forth the requirements for criminal background checks of all staff members. The CCDBG Act, and its implementing regulations, requires all child care staff members (including prospective staff members ) of all licensed, regulated, or registered child care providers to have a comprehensive background check, unless they are related to all children in their care. The CCDBG Act set forth this requirement based on the belief that \"all parents, regardless of whether they receive CCDF assistance, deserve this basic protection of knowing that those individuals who have access to their children do not have prior records of behavior that could endanger their children.\" In the proposed rulemaking, \u00a7 132.2 provide d that for Sections 132 to 139, a staff member shall include Center Directors, Teachers, Assistant Teachers, Caregivers, and Volunteers. In the final rulemaking, OSSE has deleted this provision to avoid confusion as \"staff members\" is defined in \u00a7 199 and \"staff members\" required to submit to criminal background checks were described in \u00a7 133.1. However, OSSE did amend \u00a7133.1 to strike \"section\" and insert in its place \"Sections 133 and 135\" to clarify that \u00a7135: Results and Appeals applied to individuals r equired to submit to criminal background checks in \u00a7 133. One commenter asked whether the criminal background check requirement for any individual residing in a child development home or expanded home in \u00a7 133.2 extends to college students who may not be present during the hours of operations. The CCDBG Act, and its implementing 20 regulations, clearly extends the background check requirement to all adults residing in child development homes and expanded homes, regardless of whether they may or may not be pr esent during the hours of operations. Section 133.4 provides that the State Superintendent shall make a good faith effort to provide notification of the results of the criminal background check within forty -five (45) days. One commenter requested that th e State Superintendent shall provide notification within fifteen (15) days, not forty -five (45) days. Another stakeholder commented that a good faith effort is not an acceptable standard because waiting forty -five (45) days after an interview will impact t heir hiring process. OSSE appreciates these comments and recognized the commenters' concerns. However, OSSE will retain the proposed language in the final rulemaking. Section 658H(e)(1) of the CCDBG Act requires that once a child care provider submits a ba ckground check request, OSSE must carry out the request as quickly as possible, and further that the process must not take more than forty -five (45) days after the request was submitted. Section 133.7 sets forth the information a staff member shall prov ide in order to complete a criminal background check. The State Superintendent received comments asking why OSSE needed fingerprints. In addition, one commenter requested OSSE remove the request for a social security number. OSSE did not make any changes to the final rulemaking based on these comments as both are necessary to complete all five federal statutorily mandated components of the required comprehensive background check: \"(1) A search of the State criminal and sex offender registry in the State w here the staff member resides and each State where the staff member has resided for the past five years; (2) A search of the State child abuse and neglect registry in the State where the staff member resides and each State where the staff member has reside d for the past five years; (3) A search of the National Crime Information Center; (4) A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint check using the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System; and (5) A search of the National Sex Offender Registry.\" In addition, OSSE amended \u00a7 132.3(a), the components of a criminal background check, to maintain consistency with the federal regulations by adding \"with the use of fingerprints being required in the State where the staff member resides, and op tional in other States.\" ACF added this language to the federal regulations in response to comments emphasizing that technology does not exist to allow States to send fingerprints electronically to check other States' repositories. Traffic Records Chec k The State Superintendent also received comments seeking further clarification of the traffic records check process, specifically asking for timing and consequences. OSSE recognizes that there is a need to further address what the traffic record check s hall include, how the information will be assessed in determining eligibility, the timing and how results will be provided. OSSE will address this in future rulemaking. Until then, OSSE recommends that stakeholders refer to Caring for our Children for furt her guidance on this matter, and any other area that may be ambiguous. Suitability Results And Appeals 21 The State Superintendent received comments asking why the State Superintendent, and not the Facility is making the determinations as to whether an indi vidual is eligible or ineligible to work. In addition, one commenter noted that if there is a concern on a criminal background check, they should be informed of the concern so that they could make a final determination as to whether or not they would like to employ the individual. In order for the protection of privacy of the results, the CCDBG Act requires the state lead agency (OSSE) to make determinations regarding a child care staff member's eligibility for employment. The federal law further requires that OSSE provide results of the background check to the child care provider in a statement that indicates only whether the staff member is eligible or ineligible, without revealing specific disqualifying information. If the staff member is ineligible, the Lead Agency must provide information about each specific disqualifying crime to the staff member, as well as information on how to appeal the results of the background check to challenge the accuracy and completeness. In addition, the State Superintenden t has made three non -substantive changes in \u00a7 135. First, OSSE amends \u00a7 135.6 to strike \"OAH\" and replace it with the Commission on Human Rights to comply with the Child and Youth, Safety and Health Omnibus Temporary Amendment Act of 2016, signed October 3 1, 2016 (D.C. Act 21 -521; 63 DCR 13597 (November 4, 2016) ). Second, the State Superintendent is striking \"licensee\" and replacing it with \"staff member\" in \u00a7 135.5(b). This amendment is necessary to correct an unintended error as right to appeal described in the Notice of Ineligibility for Employment is intended for the staff member, not the licensee. Finally, the State Superintendent is updating the number of days a staff member has to request a hearing in \u00a7 135.5(b) from ten (10) days to thirty (30) days to correct a drafting error and maintain consistency with \u00a7 135.6, which provides a staff member may request an appeal not later than thirty (30) days after receiving the notice described in \u00a7 135.5. Required Drug And Alcohol Testing Program Section 136 provides the requirements for drug and alcohol testing. One commenter requested clarification regarding the State Superintendent's policy regarding the authorization of the use of a Schedule I drug, marijuana, in licensed child development facilities. The District's Department of Human Resources (\"DCHR\") has determined that Initiative 71 has no impact on the District government's current enforcement and application of employment related drug testing requirements. Furthermore, any recipient of federal fundin g, including funding under the Child Care Development Block Grant (\"CCDBG\") Act of 2014, effective November 19, 2014 (P ub.L. 113-186; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9858 et seq .) is required to comply with the Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988, effective (P ub.L. 114 -165; 41 U .S.C. \u00a7 8103 et seq .) and its implementing regulations. The Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 mandates that all federal grantees provide drug -free workplaces as a condition to receiving a federal grant. A drug -free workplace requires a policy that the unlawf ul use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the covered workplace. Marijuana is a controlled substance. The Federal guidance explicitly states that grants to school districts or other educational organizations are covered by the Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the statute does not provide a basis on which school districts or other education -related grantees may be exempted from the requirements of the regulations. Therefore, if a facility allows an employee who has tested positive for marijuana t o continue performing their duties at the facility without a 22 first producing proof of substance abuse treatment and a valid negative drug test result, the Center's award of federal funding shall be at risk of suspension of payments or termination. Pursuan t to \u00a7 136.17, staff members are required to submit to an alcohol or controlled substance test when there is reason to believe the employee has violated the alcohol or controlled substance policy. One commenter requested the State Superintendent provide mo re guidance around the conditions leading to a reasonable suspicion referral in \u00a7 136.17 since both alcohol and marijuana are legal substances. Although, both drinking alcohol and the use of marijuana in certain circumstances are legal, the consumption of alcohol and the use of marijuana is prohibited at all times when staff members are responsible for the supervision of children. Therefore, a reasonable suspicion referral should be made if there are specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations conce rning the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee. The observations may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of substances, including alcohol and marijuana. While both drinking alcohol and the use of marijuana in cer tain circumstances are legal, consumption or use may prevent staff members from providing appropriate care to infants and children by impairing motor coordination, judgment, and response time. Section 136.18 requires that a staff member shall be subject t o a post -accident test when involved in accidents under certain conditions. A commenter asked for clarification as to whether the condition in \u00a7 136.18(d) requires that the vehicle the staff member was operating in an accident must be a school -owned vehicl e. This provision does not require the vehicle be a school -owned vehicle. Rather, the requirement is for post incident testing following an accident where a staff member receives a citation or moving traffic violation operating a vehicle, whether school ow ned or not, while performing any function while on duty. Aides And Volunteers Section 138 sets forth various requirements for aides and volunteers, including duties of a volunteer and background check requirements. The State Superintendent received a n umber of comments in this section. One commenter noted that a volunteer was not an aide and therefore should not be required to participate in ongoing in -service training and continuing education requirements, as provided in \u00a7 138. First, to clarify, \"on -going in -service training\" is not the same as the professional development requirements set for in \u00a7 139. Volunteers are not required to meet the requirements in \u00a7 139 as the requirement is placed on paid staff members. Caring for our Children, however, recommends that volunteers should participate in on -the-job training, including a structured orientation to the developmental needs of young children. Staff training in child development and/or early childhood education is related to positive outcomes for c hildren. This training enables the staff to provide children with a variety of learning and social experiences appropriate to the age of the child. Accordingly, the requirement for volunteers to participate in \"on -going in-service training\" means that volu nteers should attend any in -service training provided on an on-going basis by a facility, however, although a structured orientation to the developmental needs of young children is encouraged, a facility is not required to develop on -going in -service training specifically for volunteers. 23 Section 138.4 requires that aides and volunteers who work directly with children on an on -going basis are subject to the background check requirements. Two stakeholders commented that the requirement for volunteers to com plete background checks as burdensome and potentially prohibitive. Specifically, one commenter noted that a volunteer who is in the classroom for two hours a week under constant supervision of the teacher would be subjected to higher level of scrutiny that a chaperone who would be on the field trip with children, potentially unsupervised. Another commenter questioned whether a parent chaperone would meet the requirement for \"on - going basis.\" Volunteers who provide infrequent and irregular service that is su pervised or parent volunteers who are supervised do not meet the standard of \"on -going basis.\" Parent chaperones should not care for children other than their own unsupervised. Volunteers who come into a child care facility to help with a classroom party, read to students, or assist with recess are not caring for or supervising children for a child care provider. Rather, volunteers in the situations described above are providing additional assistance under supervision of the primary staff member. While, th e CCBDG Act and its implementing regulations have not specifically mandated background checks of volunteers, the CCDBG Act provided states with flexibility in developing screening processes for volunteers. ACF has clearly emphasized, however, that voluntee rs who have not completed a background check may not be left unsupervised. ACF further encourages states to require that volunteers who have not had background checks be easily identified by children and parents, for example through visible name tags or cl othing. The District already set forth background check requirements for volunteers pursuant to CYSHA, which requires that volunteers, who work without any monetary or any other financial compensation in an unsupervised position for a child development fac ility, must submit to criminal background checks. Therefore to align with the current practice and definitions in the District for volunteers, OSSE has deleted \"on an on -going basis\" in \u00a7138.4 and replaced it with \"meet the standard in Section \u00a7 133.1.\" OS SE also deleted on an on -going basis\" in \u00a7138.8 and replaced it with \"are not provided unsupervised access to children who are cared for or supervised at a Facility.\" In addition, OSSE deleted \"on an on -going basis\" in \u00a7 131.5(b) and inserted the following in its place \"whose activities involve the care or supervision of children at a Facility or unsupervised access to children who are cared for or supervised at a Facility\". OSSE also inserted \"\"whose activities involve the care or supervision of children a t a Facility or unsupervised access to children who are cared for or supervised at a Facility\" in \u00a7 131.4. These non -substantive amendments maintain the intent of the proposed rulemaking and clarify questions raised about the volunteers who support the fac ilities in the District. Finally, CYSHA further provides that volunteers may use the same criminal background check for a period of 2 years. Therefore, to align with CYSHA and current practice in the District, OSSE is adding \"A volunteer may use the sam e criminal background check for a period of 2 years\" to \u00a7 138.4. This new language is necessary to clarify that volunteers must continue to comply with the more stringent requirement in D.C. Code \u00a7 4 -1501.5(e). Professional Development Section 139 sets forth the professional development requirements for paid staff members. Commenters raised concerns about the number of trainings required, in the time periods provided, and the potential additional cost and disruption to obtain and attend the trainings. Th e 24 State Superintendent appreciates these comments and recognizes stakeholders concerns given that these requirements are a significant shift in the professional development requirements. However, OSSE will not incorporate any of the commenters' suggested c hanges. A comment requested clarification as to which trainings were required every single year, versus upon hire. As provided in \u00a7 139.6, annual training must include the health and safety standards listed therein. Another commenter requested clarificat ion as to who would provide the training, the licensee or OSSE, and if the licensee, whether experienced internal school staff may provide the training. While OSSE itself will not provide the training, OSSE will widely publicize the availability of these h ealth and safety trainings, including on -line and in -person professional development opportunities. Additionally, internal school staff may provide the training if school staff is an OSSE approved trainer pursuant to \u00a7 139.9. The federal regulations have e mphasized the overarching importance of ensuring that staff members understand how to preserve the health and safety of children in their care. Recognizing that there may be a cost to obtaining trainings, ACF has provided several no -cost or low -cost traini ngs at and ACF do not advocate the exclusive use of online trainings. A mixed delivery training system that includes both online and in -person trainings can meet the varied needs of staff members. The federal regulations issued on September 30, 2016 re quired that staff members who provide direct care for children must be supervised until training is completed in pediatric first aid and CPR, safe sleep practices, standards precautions to prevent communicable disease, poison prevention, and shaken baby sy ndrome/abuse head trauma. In order to comply with this federal requirement, OSSE added \u00a7 139.4 and renumbered the following sections accordingly, which provides: 139.4 The following critical health and safety training must be completed before staff membe rs are allowed to care for children unsupervised: (a) Prevention of sudden infant death syndrome and use of safe sleep practices, as applicable; (b) Prevention of shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma, as applicable; (c) First aid and CPR ; (d) Poison prevention , including the handling and storage of hazardous materials and the appropriate disposal of bio contaminants; and (e) Prevention and control of infectious diseases, including immunization. This non -substantive amendment maintains the intent in the proposed r ulemaking to ensure staff members are adequately training to care for children and to comply with the CCDBG Act's implementing regulations. 25 OSSE also received a comment requesting clarification as to whether a training that is not specifically applicable to the children served by the staff member is required, specifically referencing the training on sudden infant death syndrome. The proposed rulemaking sets forth language that reflects necessary content variation within required topic areas. As provided i n \u00a7\u00a7 139.2(c) and (d), the trainings shall be included \"as applicable.\" The State Superintendent received two comments specific to requirements for training in first aid and CPR. One commenter sought clarification regarding the first aid and CPR training requirement. The commenter correctly notes that \u00a7 139.2 requires all staff members receive training in first aid and CPR within thirty (30) days of hire, but \u00a7 150.2 requires two (2) staff members readily available to administer first aid or CPR at the Fa cility at all times. The State Superintendent appreciates the comment and recognizes how these two sections may seem in conflict. The State Superintendent notes, however, that \u00a7 150.1 requires all staff members possess current and valid certification in fi rst aid and CPR, which aligns with the training requirements in \u00a7 139.2. The intent and purpose of \u00a7 150.2 was to ensure that a facility is appropriately staffed in case of an emergency, not to set requirements for the number of staff members trained. Anot her commenter requested that the requirement for training in first aid and CPR was moved to \u00a7 139.3, the orientation trainings done within ninety (90) days of hire, because the facility would need an outside vendor. While OSSE recognizes the challenges presented in obtaining an outside vendor, training in first aid and CPR, and the confidence to use these skills, is critically important to the outcome of an emergency situation. Accordingly, OSSE will retain the requirement for first aid and CPR within thirt y (30) days of hire. G. Program Activities for Healthy Development Sections 140 through 141 set forth the activities and curriculum for children's healthy development. Specifically, \u00a7 140.1 requires that a licensee implement a curriculum that is consist ent with the District of Columbia Early Learning Standards. Two stakeholders commented on this requirement. One commenter specifically noted that the standards are extensive and it is not clear how the term \"consistent\" will be interpreted. Both commenters recommended that this requirement should be removed from the regulations and that the standards should be issued as guidance. Neither \u00a7 140.1 nor the definition of \"District of Columbia Early Learning Standards\" set forth specific requirements for the im plementation of the standards. The \"District of Columbia Early Learning Standards\" provides a framework for the desired outcomes and content for the education of the District's youngest learners but the standards do not dictate the actual curriculum, class room practices, and teaching strategies that licensed facilities use. While the District of Columbia Early Learning Standards are an important component of the District's comprehensive, high -quality system of early care and education, OSSE recognizes stake holders' concerns. Therefore, in response to these comments, this final rulemaking does not adopt \u00a7 140.1 that was included in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. However, this final rulemaking does reserve \u00a7 140.1 for future rulemaking after further consid eration and consultation with stakeholders. In addition, this final rulemaking does not adopt the definition \"District of Columbia Early Learning Standards\" but will consider adding it back in future rulemaking after further consideration and consultation with stakeholders. 26 Additionally, OSSE strikes \"in alignment with District of Columbia Early Learning Standards\" from \u00a7 140.2(a). OSSE also strikes \"are consistent with District of Columbia's Early Learning Standards, assessed\" in 165.5(c) and 166.3(b) an d inserts \"which promotes positive development and learning\" in its place. These non -substantive amendments maintains the intent in the proposed rulemaking not to enforce a singular curriculum but to provide guidance around appropriate standards and ensure facilities are implementing a curriculum that promotes positive development and learning. These non -substantive amendments also ensure no further misunderstanding occurs. H. Health Promotion and Protection Sections 142 through 161 set forth the basic h ealth standards that must be in place to protect children, no matter what type of facility they attend. The State Superintendent received a number of comments in this area, which are addressed below. Supporting Healthy Child Development Section 143.2 s ets forth the required amount of physical activity a licensee shall provide a child. Section 143.6 further provides that a licensee shall limit the amount of screen -time provided to a child. One stakeholder commented that both requirements were beyond the scope of the regulations. Pursuant to D.C. Official Code \u00a7 7 -2036(a)(1), OSSE maintains the authority to set forth the minimum standards of operation concerning, among other things, the safety and health standards. Both physical activity and screen time di rectly related to a child's health and development, and therefore are within the scope of OSSE's regulatory authority. Diapering Section 145.1 requires that a licensee maintain a diaper changing area within arm's reach of a properly maintained a source of running water and soap that is not in the kitchen or eating area. One commenter requested that \u00a7 145.1 is amended to only apply to Centers, as it is not realistic for homes to meet this requirement. Caring for our Children has emphasized the importance of facilities limiting the opportunity for the transfer of contaminants at changing areas, including ensuring that sinks are within arm's reach of where the diapering takes place to avoid transfer of contaminants to other surfaces en route to washing the h ands of staff and children. OSSE recognizes the requirement that changing tables are within arm's reach may not be entirely feasible for all child development homes. Accordingly, OSSE amends \u00a7 145.1 by striking the phrase \"arm's reach\" and replacing it wit h \"close proximity.\" The amended language maintains OSSE's intent in the proposed rulemaking to have sinks close by to prevent the spread of contaminants and disease and the prior language in 29 DCMR \u00a7 390.1 . Emergency Preparedness And Response Planning One commenter sought clarification as to whether a cell phone would meet the requirements set forth in \u00a7 148.8. A cell phone would meet the requirements. No change is required to clarify this provision. First Aid And C PR Subsection 150.2 generally requ ires that a licensee have at least two (2) staff members available to administer first aid and CPR. One commenter raised the issue that a home provider may only 27 have one staff member, the caregiver, on site and therefore would always be out of compliance with the requirement for two (2) staff members. The State Superintendent appreciates this comment and acknowledges that this may be true in many homes. The State Superintendent did not intend to require more than one person in a home and has amended \u00a7 150.2 by adding \"unless a caregiver in a child development home is serving no more than six (6) children with no more than two being under the age of two.\" Inclusion, Exclusion, And Dismissal Of Children And Staff Due To Illness Section 151 sets forth the re quirements for excluding both children and staff from the facility due to illness. Two stakeholders commented that requiring a child or staff member, who exhibited symptoms in \u00a7 151.2 and was treated by a doctor, return to a facility with written permissio n from a licensed health practitioner is burdensome and may keep the student or staff member out of school longer than necessary. Written permission is necessary to ensure the child will not spread infectious agents to other children in care. Furthermore, that the requirements in \u00a7 151 for written permission is not a new requirement for children and is what is currently required in 29 DCMR \u00a7 326.8. As recommended by Caring for our Children, OSSE extended this requirement to staff because staff also can spr ead infectious disease. Subsection 151.5 provides that if a child exhibits \"mild symptoms\" of illness, a facility, in consultation with the child's parents, shall decide if the child should go home based on the three factors provided. One commenter reque sted that the State Superintendent define or provide clarity for the phrase \"mild symptoms\". The State Superintendent appreciates this comment and request for clarity. Section 151.3 provides symptoms that a licensee should look for as indication of an illn ess that may require exclusion. OSSE intended that \"mild symptoms\" should be interpreted as symptoms that do not indicate an illness listed in \u00a7 151.3. Medication Administration And Storage Subsection 153.1 prohibits a licensee from administering medica tion to a child in care unless the parent provides permission, the administration of medication is approved by a licensed health care practitioner, and the staff member has completed an approved medication administration training program. One commenter req uested the State Superintendent provide at least two (2) years to allow staff members to receive training. The CCDBG Act requires that staff members in licensed facilities have sucessfully complete this training by September 30, 2017. Another commenter rec ommend the State Superintendent add a requirement for renewal of the training every two year s. OSSE appreciates the comment; however , it is not necessary to insert additional regulatory language to address the comment. Similar to certification in First Aid e/CPR, the approved entity that certifies an individual's successful completion of medication administration training program shall set forth how long certification is valid and how often training shall be renewed. A commenter sought clarification of th e requirement prohibiting a Licensee from administering medication to a child if the child had not had at least one dose of the medication at home. The commenter asked whether it was one dose that day or one dose, ever. To ensure that no such misunderstand ing occurs, OSSE has further clarified this in the final rule by adding \"at a previous time or date\" to S ubsection 153.2. 28 Prevention of and Response to Food Allergies Subsection 154.1 requires a facility to have a written plan for each child with a food allergy from a child's parents or licensed health care practitioner which includes instructions regarding which food a child is allergic to and a treatment plan. One commenter requested OSSE align this with the CACFP medical non -disabling statement form, w hich asks a medical authority to state which food items shall be omitted and provide suggested substitutions. The CACFP medical non - disabling statement form is used by the facility to support CACFP meal reimbursements claims. While OSSE recognizes that a medical authority must sign the CACFP medical non -disabling statement, OSSE has not inserted additional regulatory language to address the commenter's request because the CACFP medical non -disabling statement form and the written plan serve different purpo ses. Food Service Subsection 155.2 requires all menus and foods actually served are consistent with the meal pattern requirements and nutrition standards specified by CACFP. One commenter requested clarification as to the difference between a snack and meal. OSSE recommends referring to CACFP for guidance on the difference between a snack and meal. Subsection 155.15 requires that a licensee ensures appropriate meals and snacks are provided to children in their care. One commenter requested the State S uperintendent amend the subsection to add a reference to the Child and Adult Care Food Program (\"CACFP\"). Although, the proposed rulemaking already referred to CACFP in \u00a7 155.2, OSSE accepted the recommendation to add a reference to CACFP in \u00a7 155.15. Addi ng a reference to CACFP will clarify that OSSE intended meal and snack to be interpreted consistently with CACFP. Subsection 155.4 requires a licensee to have one staff member who is certified as a Food Protection Manager, with valid certification and ph otographic identification. Two commenters noted that the Department of Health no longer issues a photographic identification to a Food Protection Manager. Accordingly, OSSE has deleted \"photographic identification\" from \u00a7 155.4. Infant Feeding Subsection 156.2(i) requires that a Licensee discard all unused formula and breast milk after each feeding. One commenter requested that the State Superintendent provide a timeframe for when discarding unused formula and breastmilk would be necessary. OSSE appreciat es this comment and has clarified the requirements for discarding unused formula and breastmilk. Section 156.2(i) now reads: (i) After each feeding, discard any unused: (1) Formula within one hour of feeding; and (2) Breast milk, if less than one ounce, other wise return remaining breast milk to the parent(s) or guardian(s); 29 This non -substantive amendment aligns with the recommendations from Caring for Our Children and maintains OSSE's intent as set forth in the proposed rulemaking to ensure that facilities ar e using safe approaches to feeding infants while in their care . One commenter recommended the language in \u00a7 156.2(m) is amended to prohibit microwaving breast milk, unless parents have been notified in writing. OSSE will not accept the commenter's recomm ended language. Microwaving breastmilk is prohibited because uneven hot spots in the milk may cause burns in the infant and excessive heat may destroy beneficial components of the milk. S ubsection 156.2(m) provides that parents must be notified in writing if a facility plans to microwave liquids and foods, other than breastmilk. Swimming and Water Play Section 157 provides the requirements for swimming and water play. As noted in Caring for Our Children, drowning is the second leading cause of unintentio nal injury -related death for children ages one to fourteen. Children can drown in as little as two inches of water. A prior study of drowning deaths of children younger than five years of age attributed the highest percentage of drowning reports to an adul t losing contact or knowledge of the whereabouts of the child. OSSE set forth the requirements in \u00a7 157 because timely administration of resuscitation efforts by a trained staff member trained is critical. The circumstances surrounding drowning and water - related injuries of young children suggest that staffing requirements and environmental modifications may reduce the risk of this type of injury. Further, studies have shown that prompt rescue and the presence of a trained resuscitator at the site can save about 30% of the victims without significant neurological consequences. OSSE received three comments on \u00a7 157. Two stakeholders sought clarification of the requirements in \u00a7 157.7 and \u00a7 157.8 regarding the ratios, training and certification for water pla y and whether such training and water play was required for water table play. OSSE has considered these comments and recognizes that phrase \"water activities\" is not clear as the phrase includes anything from playing at water tables to swimming. OSSE inten ded to distinguish requirements for proper supervision during various water activi ties in the proposed rulemaking; however, further clarification in the final rulemaking is necessary based on the comments received. To clarify the requirements for swimmin g or playing in water, OSSE strikes \u00a7 157.7 and renumbers the following subsections accordingly. In \u00a7 157.8, which requires adults certified as lifeguard or water safety instructor, OSSE strikes the phrase \"all children's water activities\" and inserts \"chi ldren are swimming or playing in water, including baby pools, wading pools, and full-depth pools\" in its place. Finally, in \u00a7 157.10(a), which is now \u00a7 157.9(a), OSSE strikes \"Children are supervised in accordance with supervision provisions of Subsection 157.7\" and inserts \"(a) At least one (1) adult for every six (6) children shall be certified in pediatric First Aid and CPR and in attendance. Adult -to-child ratios as set forth in Section 121 shall be maintained\" in its place. These non -substantive amendm ents clarify the varying requirements for swimming and water table play while maintaining OSSE's intent to distinguish requirements for proper supervision during various water activities. 30 Finally, one commenter sought clarification as to whether prohibiti ng the use of bottles, cups and glasses during water table play in \u00a7 157.10(h), included the use of plastic cups. As recommended by Caring for Our Children, the rulemaking prohibits the use bottles, cups and glasses during water play because the presence o f these items encourages children to drink from them. Contamination of hands, toys, and equipment in the room in which play tables are located may play a role in the transmission of diseases in child care settings so prohibiting items that can lead to cont amination is necessary to ensure the health and safety of children in care. Transporting Children One commenter requested OSSE provide further criteria related to supervision of transporting children, specifically the appropriate ratios during transport. Ratios during transport have been addressed. S ubsection 121.2 specifically states that minimum adult -to-child ratios shall be maintained in vehicles during transport. I. Additional Requirements For Licensed Centers Child development centers must meet t he all the requirements for all licensed child development facilities. In addition, licensed child development centers must meet the additional requirements set forth in Sections 162 to 166. The State Superintendent received four comments about child devel opment centers. Requirements for Center Directors Section 164 addresses the qualifications and responsibilities of Center directors. Specifically, \u00a7 164.6 requires that a center director complete twelve (12) hours of professional development annually. One commenter noted that Center Directors, who have been Directors for a long time, do not need to participate in annual professional development approved by OSSE. While OSSE values and recognizes the commitment to children of Center Directors who have bee n Center Directors for a long time, research has shown that coursework and training has a measurable and positive effect on quality child care. OSSE considered these comments, however OSSE has elected not to incorporate the commenter's suggested changes. A n individual's experience as a Center Director must be supplemented by continuing competency -based training to determine and provide whatever new skills are needed to care for children in child care settings. Research, best practices, and knowledge base a re constantly changing and it is essential that center directors, as the instructional leaders for the program, stay current with information. Maintaining the annual professional development requirements as set forth in the proposed rulemaking is consiste nt with the emphasis the CCDBG Act has placed on professional development which is designed to prevent harm to children and ensure optimal development and learning. Teacher Qualifications One commenter appreciated the waiver in \u00a7 164.3 that applies to c enter directors who have served as a center director continuously for ten (10) years and requested that the waiver also apply to teachers who have served as a teacher continuously for ten (10) years. OSSE intended this waiver to also apply for teachers who continuously have served as a teacher continuously for ten (10) years, however that was omitted in the proposed rulemaking due to a drafting error. This provision is now in the final rulemaking in \u00a7 165.4 and the following sections were renumbered accordi ngly. Additionally, in reviewing the proposed rulemaking, OSSE recognized a drafting 31 error in \u00a7 164.1(d) in its reference to achieving \"compliance with (a), (b), or (c).\" To correct this drafting error, OSSE combined \u00a7 164.1(d) with \u00a7 164.1(c) deleted the reference to \"(c).\" This non-substantive amendment maintains the intent to provide center directors with time to comply with the requirements of the final rulemaking as demonstrated by consistent requirements for teachers in \u00a7 165.1(d). J. Additional Requ irements For Licensed Child Development Homes Child Development Homes (\"homes\") must meet the all the requirements for all licensed child development facilities. In addition, licensed homes must meet the additional requirements set forth in Sections 167 t o 168. The State Superintendent received two of comments about homes. In \u00a7 167.7 and \u00a7 167.8, the State Superintendent requires that licensed weapons are inaccessible to children and that parents are provided notice that a weapon is on the premise. Dur ing the ANPR, one stakeholder specifically requested that OSSE consider adding provisions around weapons in homes caring for children, similar to many other states. After careful consideration and research, OSSE accepted the recommendation and added \u00a7 167. 7 and \u00a7 167.8 to the proposed rulemaking. In response to the new language in the proposed rulemaking, another commenter applauded OSSE for including such language around weapons. However, the State Superintendent also received a comment that questioned whe ther OSSE was violating the privacy rights of caregivers by requiring disclosure of weapons in a child development home or expanded home. However, a caregiver's expectation of privacy is outweighed by the public's interest in ensuring the safety of childre n in their care. Like background checks, parents deserve the basic protection of knowing whether or not their children may have access to weapons while in child care and whether or not the individual who has access to their child has a weapon that could en danger their children. While this is a new requirement for caregivers in the District, the District of Columbia is joined by other states that require the same kinds of disclosures when weapons are present in homes. Subsection 168.1 describes the baseli ne qualifications of caregivers in homes. S ubsection 171.1(a) requires that in order to qualify as a caregiver, one must have earned a high school diploma and shall earn a Child Development Associate (\"CDA\") credential within two (2) years of the effective date of the final rulemaking. One commenter asked that OSSE amend \u00a7 171.1(a) to provide a caregiver with four (4) years instead of two (2) years from the effective date of this regulation to earn a CDA credential. OSSE considered this comment, however OSS E has elected not to incorporate the commenter's recommendation. On average, it takes approximately 6 months to complete a CDA credential. Two (2) years from the effective date of this regulation is sufficient time. Subsection 168.2 sets forth the dutie s of a caregiver. Specifically, \u00a7 168.2(c) requires that a caregiver supervise enrolled children at all times. One comment recommended that OSSE replace the word \"supervise\" with \"within sight and sound.\" OSSE adopted the commenter's suggestion, and insert ed and sound\" in \u00a7 168.2(c). Finally, \u00a7 168.4 requires that if a caregiver is not physically present, a qualified back -up caregiver, who meets the requirements and qualifications, must be designated to assume full 32 responsibility of the facil ity's operations. One commenter requested clarification regarding what requirements and qualifications a qualified back -up caregiver must meet. Section 168.1 requires a caregiver have a high school diploma and a CDA credential, complete twelve (12) hours of professional development, and complete all required health and safety trainings. OSSE recognizes that substitutes are difficult to find for homes, however, because the risk to children from care by unqualified caregivers is so high, developing a qualifi ed substitute pool or establishing relationships with alternative homes is essential for home operation. Accordingly, OSSE has amended \u00a7 168.4 to clarify specifically that a qualified back -up caregiver should have a CDA credential, training on basic health and safety topics, and be subject to the criminal background and child protection register checks as required in \u00a7 133. These amendments are made in response to comments requesting clarification and are non -substantive as they maintain OSSE's intent of th e proposed rulemaking to ensure back -up caregivers were qualified to provide care. K. Additional Requirements For Licensed Expanded Child Development Homes Expanded child development homes (\"expanded homes\") must meet the all the requirements for all li censed child development facilities. In addition, licensed expanded homes must meet the additional requirements set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 169 to 171. The State Superintendent received two of comments about expanded homes. First, a commenter noted that the langua ge in \u00a7 169.4 is a repeated section. OSSE acknowledges that \u00a7169.4 reiterates the requirement set forth in \u00a7 167.9 for homes. Accordingly, OSSE has deleted the requirement in \u00a7 169.4 and added clarifying language in \u00a7 167.9 to ensure the same requirement w as set forth for caregivers operating both homes and expanded homes. OSSE also reviewed the language in \u00a7 169 to ensure there were no other repeated sections. Sections 170 and 171 set forth the baseline qualifications and responsibilities of caregivers a nd associate caregivers in expanded homes. One commenter requested clarification regarding the requirements for a caregiver in an expanded home in \u00a7 170.2(b). Specifically, the commenter asked whether the only pathway to opening an expanded home was if the caregiver had previously operated a child development home. There are, however, two pathways to opening an expanded home, as the primary caregiver, having operated a home or have served as a Center Director or Teacher in a licensed center. It is worth no ting that the requirements in \u00a7 170.2(b) are not new requirements and is what is currently required of caregivers seeking to open an expanded home. VI. Conclusion The State Superintendent greatly appreciates the many comments that the public submitted throughout the process. OSSE has thoroughly considered all the comments and made changes accordingly. The entire rulemaking process has resulted in a more effective, clear, and transparent final rulemaking. OSSE recognizes that implementing these updated li censing provisions may be challenging for some parties, but this effort is necessary to improve child care in the District for the benefit of our children. 33 Effective Date These rules were adopted as final on November 15, 2016 and shall become effective on the date of publication of this notice in the D.C. Register . Pursuant to the CCDBG Act, facilities shall be in compliance with health and safety trainings and criminal background check requirements for all current and new staff members by September 30, 2017. Compliance with qualifications for Center Directors, Teachers, Assistant Teachers, and Caregivers are as set forth in this final rulemaking. Compliance with all other provisions in this final rulemaking will be determined through OSSE's review of app lications for licenses.
