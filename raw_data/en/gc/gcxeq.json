After your plastic surgery procedure with [Dr. Jayesh Panchal](https://www.genesisokc.com/meet-dr-jayesh-panchal), you will be provided with postoperative instructions. Following these carefully will help reduce your risks of developing visible scars. However, due to skin type, genetics, and other factors, some scars may remain stubbornly visible even with traditional aftercare. To assist your body in healing, it can be helpful to use at-home scar remedies. DIY Scar Treatments - Coconut Oil - Coconut oil is an effective moisturizer and may even boost collagen production. With antibacterial and anti-fungal properties, the medium-chain fatty acids in coconut oil encourage cell production and repair as well - Aloe Vera - Aloe is known for its ability to speed up tissue regeneration and reduce inflammation. It boosts collagen and elastin fiber production, reduces inflammation, and may even improve immune response - Raw Honey - Raw honey has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory powers, and you can speed up tissue repair by applying it to wounds. Raw and unfiltered honey is complete with flavonoid and polyphenol compounds that may also reduce redness. Please note: Processed honey does not have these properties. You must use raw and unfiltered honey for this benefit - Cocoa and Shea Butter - Cocoa butter is full of vitamin E, an essential vitamin for skin healing and repair. Shea butter, like coconut oil, is packed with essential fatty acids that may speed the healing process These topical treatments are applied to clean, closed, and dry incisions during the healing phase. They should never be applied to open wounds. A Closer Look at Vitamin E Vitamin E can be an effective natural scar treatment. Applied topically as an oil, vitamin E stimulates collagen production, helps speed cell turnover, and works to repair damaged skin. There is no evidence that consuming vitamin E is effective on scars. Topical application is necessary for results. However, unlike the natural scar remedies listed above, you should not use vitamin E topically until your wounds have healed. It has blood-thinning properties that may increase risks for visible scars if used too early. Dealing With Older Scars Certain nonsurgical treatments can be very effective in dealing with scars. [Laser skin resurfacing](https://www.genesisokc.com/fraxel-dual-treatments), chemical peel, even [topical skincare and sunscreen](https://www.genesisokc.com/skin-care-products) can assist with scar management.
