This meditation will relax you right away.", "sitename": "Tea Creative  ", "date": "2021-08-25", "cleaned_text": "some COVID-19 vaccine reactions, including fainting, dizziness and nausea, were due to anxiety, not the shots themselves?](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/cdc-finds-covid-19-vaccine-reactions-due-anxiety/story?id=77423427) If you are about to get vaccinated whether it's Pfizer, Astrazeneca, Moderna, it's natural to feel anxious. For me, getting the COVID-19 vaccine was one of the most scary experience I ever experienced! I wanted to chill. However, I couldn't stop thinking about the tiny possibility of getting the severe side effects. Something was pressuring my left chest. I couldn't breathe. I wasn't myself. Although I knew there was a little chance for me to get a severe side effect like heart failure or death, I felt like I was going to die... - What if I have underlying disease that I am not aware of? - What if my heart fails? - What if I get a severe allergy reaction? - What if I die? Who's gonna look after all my belonging and mess!? - What was my medical, life insurance policy? - Wow. There are so many things I said I would do, yet didn't do. - Why do I feel so scared? - Where is this fear originated from? - Does this mean I love my life so much? Why am I terrified? I tried my best to cut the negative thoughts in my head. However, my brain wouldn't shut. My mind and brain created a living hell out of me. I was doomed. There were times I wanted to kill myself. However, this was the first time I wanted to live, but feel like I was going to die. Later I found out I was experiencing a panic attack. \"If you felt like you were gonna die because of the vaccine, why did you register for the COVID-19 vaccine?\" Yeah, I could wait. I could skip. However, I didn't want to run away. It's been more than a year since the pandemic happened. The COVID-19 is still interfering with my daily life. I didn't want to live under fear of getting COVID neither. - I made sure my medical, life insurance are all good. - I cleaned my house. If I end up dead, I didn't want someone else to go though my mess or unorganised space where I just moved in. - I talked family and friends. - I expressed my concerns and fears of getting vaccinated publicly. - I cooked the entire week of meals in advance because I knew I had more probability of staying alive. I wanted to get vaccinated. However, every step was a challenge to me. Even when I arrived at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre to get a vaccine, each step felt like a quest to conquer. It was a struggle. That's when I remembered 4-7-8 Breathing Technique . What Is 4-7-8 Breathing Technique? The 4-7-8 breathing technique is based on [pranayama](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-pranayama) breathing exercises, the ancient yogic practice of controlling your breath. Dr. Andrew Weil, an American celebrity doctor graduated from Harvard Medical School developed this breathing to relief stress and bring relaxation. Dr. Weil refers 4-7-8 breathing as a \"natural tranquilizer for the nervous system\".

Purse your lips if it helps. - Close your lips and inhale through your nose for a count of four. - Hold your breath for a count of seven. - Exhale completely through your mouth making a whoosh sound for a count of eight. - This completes one cycle. Repeat for three more cycles. While I was waiting for my turn to get vaccinated in front of a booth, this breathing technique popped up in my head. After using the breathing technique, I felt much calmer and less anxious. Through this experience of getting vaccinated, I learned everyone experiences different kind of fear. I wondered whether I wasn't callous about other people's pain in the past.
