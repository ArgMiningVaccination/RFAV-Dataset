The symptoms from an influenza infection (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat) are mostly self-limiting but influenza can be complicated due to severe illnesses like pneumonia and otitis media caused by the primary influenza infection or a secondary bacterial infection [1-3]. Such diseases might result in hospitalization and even death, especially in the population at high risk for complications such as the elderly, children younger than the age of two years, and patients with a chronic disease or weakened immune response [3,4]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the annual influenza epidemic results in three to five million cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide depending on the severity of an influenza season [3]. Influenza viruses Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and are membrane-enveloped viruses with a segmented negative strand RNA genome [1,5]. Each RNA segment forms a ribonucleotide protein (RNP) complex together with nucleoproteins (NPs) and a polymerase complex consisting of the polymerase protein A (PA) and polymerase basic proteins 1 and 2 (PB1 and PB2) [5]. Figure 1 presents the overall structure of the influenza virus [1,5-7]. Figure 1 - Influenza virus structure The RNPs are surrounded by a layer of internal matrix 1 proteins (M1) [5]. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are both surface antigens that are inserted into the influenza virus membrane. HA is responsible for the attachment of the virus to the receptors on the cell surface of the host as well as the entry of the virus into the host cell. NA plays an important role in the release of newly formed virus particles from the host cell [1,5]. Matrix 2 protein (M2) is an ion channel that plays a role in the transport of protons [5]. Based on differences in the two internal 112 proteins NP and M1, there are different influenza viruses (A, B, C and D) described of which influenza A and B are the most clinically relevant [5,8]. The influenza A virus is further subdivided into subtypes based on the HA and NA surface proteins. There are 18 different HA (H1 trough H18) and 11 different NA subtypes (N1 trough N11) that have been described so far [8]. Only a few subtypes have been identified in humans, specifically, H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 viruses. Other subtypes such as H5N1, H7N7, and H9N2 viruses are occasionally identified in humans [5]. There are several influenza A virus strains, for example, A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) and A/Hong/ Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2), that are named based on the geographic origin, strain number, and year of isolation [9]. The influenza B viruses are not divided into subtypes but into lineages and strains. Currently, there are two lineages known: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria [8]. The several influenza virus strains exist due to the fact that they are continuously undergoing antigenic changes to escape the immune response of the host by antigenic drift and shift. Antigenic drift is the result of point mutations in the viral gene encoding HA while an antigenic shift occurs when the re-assortment of genome segments from different influenza strains that circulate in different animal species, including humans, takes place. This can occur if a host cell is simultaneously infected with two influenza A viruses [1,5]. An antigenic shift results in a completely new influenza virus which may circulate among humans. Such shifted viruses might cause a pandemic with higher mortality and morbidity rates compared to the annual influenza epidemics since the population is naive to the new circulating virus. Influenza vaccines The most effective way to prevent influenza related diseases is by vaccination. Since the 1940s, vaccines are used to target the influenza A and B virus strains [10]. The vaccine antigens are aiming at the development of a virus-specific immune response. When a person who has been vaccinated comes in contact with an influenza virus, the immune response will prevent the infection and/or recognize the virus earlier and clear it from the body. This will reduce the chance of an influenza infection and/or the severity of a possible infection [11]. The influenza vaccines that are currently being used are not very different from the vaccines introduced in the 1940s and contain at least the two viral surface antigens HA and NA from the influenza virus. These vaccines mainly induce antibodies which neutralize the actions of these surface proteins. However, due to the fact that HA and NA are constantly changing due to antigenic drift, the vaccine should be updated each year [1,5]. Each year, the WHO recommends which influenza strains should be included in the influenza vaccine. Trivalent influenza vaccines contain two influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) and one influenza B-virus strain (Yamagata or Victoria lineage). Since the influenza season of 2013-2014, the WHO also recommends quadrivalent vaccines, that include a B/Yamagata-virus as well as a B/Victoria-virus. The recommendation is based on epidemiology data from the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) which continuously monitors influenza viruses circulating in humans [3]. For the northern hemisphere the WHO 113 makes a recommendation in February on the strains to be included in the vaccine for the next winter season, more than six months before the actual start of the influenza season. The strains need to be selected several months before the start of the influenza season to make sure the vaccine is ready on time since the whole process of production and purification of vaccine antigens, as well as the packaging and distribution nowadays takes six to eight months [12,13]. Most of currently available influenza vaccines are still produced in embryonated hens' eggs which is a time consuming process since, e.g., before the production can start, selected viruses should sometimes be manipulated for high-yield growth in eggs, reagents should be generated to characterize the vaccine product, and the growth of seeds in the embryonated hens' eggs takes several weeks [13,14]. Vaccine effectiveness Since the influenza vaccine composition is updated each year, the ability of an influenza vaccine to prevent influenza virus infection in the general population [influenza vaccine effectiveness, IVE] should be monitored. Information about the IVE is important for immunization policy decision makers, e.g., to decide which type of vaccine should be used and who should be immunized [15]. The IVE, however, varies from season to season, per country, and even per virus (sub)types/lineages. For example, in the United States, the IVE varied from 10% (95% CI -36 - 40) to 60% (95% CI 53 - 66) during the influenza seasons of 2004-2005 and 2010-2011, respectively [16]. It is not possible to determine the IVE in advance of an influenza season in a randomized controlled trial since trials are time-consuming and infeasible in some of the influenza vaccine target populations [17]. Therefore, retrospective studies using observational data, such as cohort and case-control studies in which the influenza incidence is compared between those subjects who have received an influenza vaccine and those who have not received the vaccine, are needed to annually estimate the IVE [17,18]. The test-negative design (TND) is a type of case-control study which is commonly used to estimate the IVE by comparing the prevalence of an influenza vaccination between influenza-like-illness patients who tested positive for an influenza virus [cases] and those who tested negative for influenza [controls] [19,20]. As both cases and controls are selected from the same source population, the study design is assumed to minimize confounding by, for example, health care-seeking behavior compared to other observational study designs [21,22]. However, there is no consensus about the appropriate control group to use since the definition of the control group introduces other different sources of bias resulting in an under- or overestimation of the IVE [22,23]. One of the most important factors that influences the (sub)type-specific IVE is the degree of similarity between the vaccine strains and circulating influenza virus strains; when the vaccine strains do not match the circulating strains, the IVE will be low [24]. A vaccine can reduce the risk of illness by 50-60% among the overall population during seasons when the vaccine strains match the virus strains [24,25]. However, for example in the United States during the 2014-2015 season, the IVE was as low as 19% (95% CI 10 - 27) in the general population [16]. This low efficacy is thought to be the result of the mismatch between the H3N2 virus in the vaccine (A/Texas/50/12) 114 and the circulating H3N2 virus (A/Switzerland/971529313) and resulted in the highest recorded rate of flu-associated hospitalizations among adults 65 years and older since the Center of Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) started tracking data [26,27]. Such a severe mismatch can occur due to the fact that it is difficult to predict several months in advance which influenza viruses will circulate since antigenic drifts occur continuously over time. Moreover, antigenic changes in the vaccine strain can occur during the production in embryonated hens' eggs [12,28]. Quest for new broadly reactive or universal influenza vaccines The risk of a vaccine mismatch during annual epidemics and the threat of pandemics due to an antigenic shift highlights the need for new influenza vaccines which give the population a broader protection against a variety of influenza virus strains. In 2013, the European Commission called for research initiatives aimed at the development of such influenza vaccines that provide a longer-lasting and broader protection against multiple influenza virus strains. This is with the ultimate aim that such an influenza vaccine can efficiently protect the general population against seasonal and pandemic influenza (a 'universal' or 'broadly reactive' influenza vaccine) [29]. It has been hypothesized that some of these novel influenza vaccine concepts need a so- called adjuvant to improve immunogenicity. Adjuvants are substances which are not antigenic themselves, but they may enhance and prolong a specific immune response towards a specific antigen [30]. Aluminum gels or salts, MF59, and AS03 are adjuvants that are included in licensed influenza vaccines [31,32]. Studies show that adjuvanted vaccines can induce an enhanced and broader immune response compared to vaccines without an adjuvant [33,34]. Such adjuvants may even increase cross-recognition of influenza virus strains which are not included in a vaccine [35]. However, for the licensing of a novel vaccine with a novel or even established adjuvant, the inclusion of an adjuvant should be justified. The adjuvant should improve the immune response but, more importantly, it should have an acceptable balance between the beneficial effects on the immune response and the risk of local and systemic adverse events. Especially for prophylactic vaccines such as influenza vaccines, safety favours over efficacy [30]. Of note, an in-depth analysis of the safety and tolerability of the adjuvants that are currently being tested in clinical trials for (universal) influenza vaccines is lacking. Before a universal influenza vaccine can be licensed and enter the market, several preclinical and clinical studies should be performed to determine efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety. An important aspect before such studies can be conducted is the ethical approval of a study to ensure that the safety and wellbeing of laboratory animals and study participants, respectively, are safeguarded. Before the start of a clinical trial, ethical and national competent authority approval has to be obtained. However, especially for multinational vaccine trials, it is a challenge to obtain approval in Europe due to the differences in the implementation of the clinical trial Directive 2001/20/EC from the European Parliament and European Commission in the different European Union Member States. Especially for scientific initiatives without any clinical trial experience, it is a hassle to obtain such approval due to the tangle of regulations, and an overview of requirements is urgently needed. 115 Thesis objectives The first objective of this thesis is to investigate the effectiveness of currently used conventional influenza vaccines in the Netherlands over the past influenza seasons. In addition, ethical guidelines to conduct clinical trials with vaccines in Europe, the safety and tolerability of adjuvants that are currently being investigated in influenza vaccine trials, and the safety and immunogenicity of a novel universal influenza vaccine concept will be addressed. Thesis outline The first part of the thesis focusses on the evaluation of the IVE in the Netherlands. In Chapter 2 , the IVE over the influenza seasons from 2003/2004 until 2013/2014 is estimated using the TND case-control study stratified by the different influenza virus (sub)types/lineages and match status. Chapter 3 summarizes the results of the IVE estimates for the same seasons excluding the pandemic season of 2009/2010 using the TND case-control study with different control groups. We evaluate the differences among the IVE estimates using the most commonly applied definitions of control groups. In the second part of the thesis, a systematic review is presented in Chapter 4 which evaluates the safety and tolerability of the adjuvant Montanide ISA 51 TM. In Chapter 5 , a meta-analysis is presented in which the safety and tolerability of vaccines including QS-21 or ISCOMATRIX adjuvant are evaluated. In the third part of the thesis, the clinical evaluation of influenza vaccines is described. Chapter 6 outlines the ethical approval and competent authority authorization procedures for a vaccine trial in different European Union Member States. Chapter 7 describes a protocol for a phase IIb clinical trial to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a universal influenza vaccine concept administered as a standalone vaccine and as a primer to H5N1 influenza vaccine. In Chapter 8 , the results of this study are described. Finally, the main findings of all of the chapters and the future perspectives are discussed in Chapter 9 . 116 REFERENCES 1.

Method We used data from the Dutch Sentinel Practices of the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (NIVEL) Primary Care Database. Participating general practitioners took nose and throat swabs for viral studies from patients with influenza-like illness or another acute respiratory infection. Cases were those patients whose samples were positive for an influenza virus and controls were those whose samples were negative for influenza virus. We determined the IVE of 11 influenza seasons 2003/2004 to 2013/2014, for all seasons together and stratified by influenza virus type and to vaccine match or mismatch.Results Over all seasons, the IVE was 29% (95% CI:11-43). In seven of the 11 seasons there was a mismatch between vaccine and circulating virus type. The IVE was 40% (95% CI: 18-56) for those seasons in which there was a vaccine match, and 20% (95% CI: - 5-38) for seasons with a mismatch. When the influenza A/H3N2 virus was dominant, the IVE was 38% (95% CI: 14-55). The IVE against the influenza virus A/H1N1, A/H1N1/pdm09 and against both influenza IVE was particularly low when there was a mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating virus type and when A/H3N2 was the dominant influenza subtype. 224 Volgens de Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie (WHO) is influenzavaccinatie om en influenzagerelateerde complicaties te voorkomen.

Darvishian, F. Dijkstra, G.A. 35 (21): 2831 - 283932 ABSTRACT Information about influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) is important for vaccine strain selection and immunization policy decisions. The test-negative design (TND) case-control study is commonly used to obtain IVE estimates. However, the definition of the control patients may influence IVE estimates. We have conducted a TND study using the Dutch Sentinel Practices of NIVEL Primary Care Database which includes data from patients who consulted the General Practitioner (GP) for an episode of acute influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection (ARI) with known influenza vaccination status. Cases were patients tested positive for influenza virus. Controls were grouped into those who tested (1) negative for influenza virus (all influenza negative), (2) negative for influenza virus, but positive for respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus or enterovirus (non-influenza virus positive), and (3) negative for these four viruses (pan-negative). We estimated the IVE over all epidemic seasons from 2003/2004 through 2013/2014, pooled IVE for influenza vaccine partial/full matched and mismatched seasons and the individual seasons using generalized linear mixed-effect and multiple logistic regression models. The overall IVE adjusted for age, GP ILI/ARI diagnosis, chronic disease and respiratory all influenza negative, non-influenza virus positive and pan-negative controls, respectively. In both the main and subgroup analyses IVE estimates were the highest using non-influenza virus positive controls, likely due to limiting inclusion of controls without laboratory-confirmation of a virus causing the respiratory disease. 333 INTRODUCTION The most effective way to prevent influenza virus infection and (severe) illness is by vaccination [1]. However, the composition of the influenza vaccine should be reconsidered annually, and eventually updated, due to amino acid substitutions causing antigenic drifts of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase virus surface proteins which occurs continually over time to escape neutralization by the immune response [2,3]. Despite the yearly update, the ability of the vaccine to prevent influenza virus infection in the general population during an influenza season (vaccine effectiveness [VE]) varies each year [4]. Hence, VE information is important for immunization policy decision makers, e.g. to decide which type of vaccine should be used (i.e. inactivated or live attenuated virus, with or without adjuvant) and who should be immunized (e.g. health care workers, children, elderly) [5]. However, it is not possible to determine the VE before an influenza season. Therefore, retrospective studies using observational data are performed to estimate the VE annually [4,6]. The test-negative design (TND) case-control study is a commonly used study design to estimate influenza VE (IVE). In this study design, patients seeking medical care for influenza-like illness (ILI) are tested for influenza virus infection [7]. The IVE is determined by comparing the prevalence of influenza vaccination between ILI patients who tested positive for influenza [cases] and those who tested negative for influenza [controls] [7,8]. As both cases and controls are selected from patients seeking medical care for ILI, the study design is assumed to minimize confounding by health care-seeking behavior or functional status compared to other types of observational studies [9-11]. Moreover, laboratory tests are used to define the influenza outcome which, compared to other study designs using non-specific influenza outcomes (e.g. ILI symptoms), reduces misclassification bias [9-11]. Several studies have shown that the definition of the control group in TND studies may influence the estimates of the IVE [12-16]. Three types of control groups have been used in TND studies: (1) all ILI patients tested negative for influenza virus infection (all influenza negative), (2) ILI patients tested negative for influenza virus but positive for another respiratory virus (noninfluenza virus positive), and (3) ILI patients tested negative for both influenza virus and other respiratory viruses (pan-negative) [11-18]. Although all influenza negative controls are commonly used, in several studies non-influenza virus positive controls have been used arguing that if another respiratory virus than influenza virus could be detected in the control group, the presence of misclassification is highly unlikely, as there is a confirmed infectious cause of ILI in both cases and controls. This is based on the fact that the same laboratory tests for influenza virus are used for both cases and controls [13,15,16]. On the other hand, other investigators argued that the presence of a non-influenza respiratory virus infection could be partly explained by the association between influenza vaccination and the increased risk of another respiratory virus infection due to a temporary nonspecific immune response [10-12,18,19]. Consequently, the definition of the second control group could lead to selection bias and thereby an overestimation of IVE since the risk of ILI symptoms caused by another 334 pathogen would be higher in the vaccinated patients than in unvaccinated patients, resulting in a higher proportion of vaccinated individuals in the control group [11,12,14,17,18]. As a consequence, several studies have used pan-negative controls. The aim of the present study is to estimate the IVE over ten influenza epidemic seasons in The Netherlands (from 2003/2004 to 2013/2014) using the three most commonly applied definitions of TND control groups and evaluate the differences among the IVE estimates. METHODS Study database We used data from the Sentinel Practices of NIVEL Primary Care Database [20,21]. Sampling of patients with ILI or another acute respiratory infection (ARI) for laboratory diagnostics started in 1992. Since 2003 participating general practitioners (GPs) are asked to take nose and throat swabs from two ILI patients each week. Since 2005/2006 with the additional instruction to sample preferably one patient less than 10 years of age. If no ILI patients are encountered, the GP is asked to swab patients with another ARI instead [22]. The official standard definition of ILI was used in the GP offices to diagnose a patient with ILI, namely an acute onset of symptoms (full development of typical symptoms in 4 days) including a rectal temperature of at least 38 oC and at least one respiratory or systemic symptom (i.e. cough, nasal catarrh, sore throat, frontal headache, retrosternal pain, myalgia) [21]. ARI is defined as an acute respiratory illness other than ILI, such as acute sinusitis or pneumonia, and with at least one of the following symptoms; coughing, rhinorrhea or sore throat [23]. Both ILI and ARI patients were included in this study to maximize the power. Patient information is registered on the sample form, e.g. personal information (gender, age), date of symptoms onset and swabbing, use of antiviral medication and underlying medical conditions. The surveillance study has been registered in the Personal Data Protection Act Register of the Dutch Personal Data Protection Commission [No. RIVM/EPI-043]. No further ethical approval was needed since only anonymized data was used for the current study. Laboratory testing Collected samples from all swabbed subjects were sent to the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) for laboratory tests for a number of pathogens. These pathogens were identified using virus isolation and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR changed over time from conventional block-based to real-time format with necessary adjustments in primer and probe design. Laboratory tests for the respiratory viruses influenza virus, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), rhinovirus (RV) and enterovirus (EV) were performed throughout the study period from 2003 to 2014. Laboratory tests for other pathogens differed per season: the identification the 2007/2008 influenza season and adenovirus (ADV) was tested only from 2005 until the 2007/2008 season. We used information on these other pathogens for sensitivity analyses only. Selection of cases and controls For each influenza season from 2003/2004 through 2013/2014 patients were selected when they were swabbed between week 48 and week 14 of the following year. Patients were excluded if (1) the vaccination status was unknown, (2) time between symptoms onset and swabbing was more than seven days, (3) a patient had received antiviral medication within the two weeks prior to the GP visit, (4) the date of swabbing was before the first of December of each season to make sure vaccination was given 14 days before symptoms onset, or (5) data was missing on other variables (i.e. gender, age, ILI/ARI diagnosis, underlying chronic disease and respiratory allergy) [7,24]. Patients swabbed in the season 2009/2010 were excluded since this was an atypical (pandemic) influenza season. Eligible swabbed patients who tested positive for influenza virus A(H1N1), A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) or B were regarded as cases. Controls were defined as those patients tested (1) negative for influenza virus (all influenza negative) (2) negative for influenza virus, but positive for RSV, RV or EV (non-influenza virus positive), and (3) negative for these four respiratory viruses (pan-negative). We included RSV, RV and EV since only these viruses were tested throughout the whole study period. Statistical analysis Chi-square tests were used to test for significant differences in proportions of categorical covariates, and T-tests for differences in mean age between cases and control groups. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. IVE was calculated by IVE = (1 - OR) x 100% with influenza vaccine status as the exposure [7]. The unadjusted and adjusted IVE for potential confounders were estimated, i.e. age, ILI/ARI diagnosis, respiratory allergy, underlying chronic disease (e.g. asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases), influenza season and level of vaccine match. Variables that were associated with the outcome (changed the OR > 5%) were retained in the final generalized linear mixed effect model (GLMM) or multiple logistic regression model. When the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) did not contain zero or negative values, the IVE was considered significant [25]. The GLMM in which influenza seasons are modelled as a random effect was used to estimate the IVE over all seasons and by seasons categorized by level of vaccine match [26]. Vaccine match status was categorized as (partial) match or mismatch based on the circulating influenza viruses and seasonal influenza vaccines used which information was extracted from data published by the Dutch National Influenza Center [26-37]. The multiple logistic regression model was used to assess the IVEs for the individual seasons. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4) and R (version 3.2.0) [38].336 Sensitivity analysis We performed several sensitivity analysis. We estimated (1) the overall IVE excluding seasons 2003/2004 and 2004/2005 since those two seasons had a low number of subjects in the control group, especially the non-influenza virus positive controls, (2) the overall IVE including the pandemic season of 2009/2010 were the vaccination status was based on receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine only, (3) the overall IVE using the patients which were swabbed within 4 days after symptom onset and (4) we calculated the IVE for the influenza seasons 2005/2006, 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 using laboratory test CoV, RSV, hMPV, RV, EV and ADV. Influenza virus negative patients testing positive for at least one, or negative for all the viruses were considered as non-influenza virus positive and pan-negative controls, respectively. This sensitivity analysis was conducted since the definition of the control groups is similar to previously conducted studies [12-16]. RESULTS Subject characteristics GPs of the Dutch Sentinel Practices network swabbed a total of 11,199 patients from 2003 through 2014. From these, 4051 (36%) fulfilled the in- and exclusion criteria for this study (Table 1). The majority of subjects were excluded because they were swabbed outside the influenza season (4153, 37%). Other subjects were excluded since information on e.g. age, clinical diagnosis or influenza vaccination was missing (928, 8%), the time between symptom onset and swabbing was more than seven days (1444, 13%) or they had received antiviral medication within two weeks prior to the GP visit (62, 1%). From the included subjects, a total of 1297 (32%) patients tested positive for influenza virus (cases) and 2754 (68%) tested negative for influenza virus. Among those patients testing negative for influenza virus, 676 (25%) tested positive for RSV, RV or EV (non-influenza virus positive) and 2078 (75%) tested negative for these viruses (pan-negative). Statistical significant differences in age, GP ILI/ARI diagnosis, presence of any chronic disease and influenza vaccination status were found between cases and the different control groups. Compared to the control groups, cases were younger, more likely to be diagnosed with ILI, and had a lower proportion of any chronic disease and influenza vaccination. In addition, there were statistically significant differences in age and diagnosis when comparing the non-influenza virus positive and pan-negative controls; pan-negative controls were older and were more likely to be diagnosed with ILI compared to non-influenza virus positive controls (see Table 1).337 Table 1 Characteristics of cases and the three different control groups: all influenza negative (Control group 1), non-influenza virus positive (Control group 2) and pan-negative (Control group 3).

Therefore, in the following paragraphs only IVE estimates adjusted for these confounding factors are shown (influenza season parameter not included in estimating season-specific IVE).338 Overall IVE estimate The adjusted IVE estimate over all seasons was 35% (95% CI 15- 48) when using all influenza negative controls (Fig. 1). When using non-influenza virus positive controls the IVE increased to 64% (95% CI 49-75) whereas the IVE decreased to 21% (95% CI -1 to 39) when using the pan-negative controls. (Mis)matched seasons From 2003 to 2014, the vaccine strains and circulating viruses (partially) matched in the seasons 2005/2006, 2006/2007, 2008/2009 and 2010/2011 (Table 2) [27-37]. The pooled adjusted IVE estimates for these (partially) matched seasons were 39% (95% CI all influenza negative, non-influenza virus positive and pan-negative controls, respectively (Fig. 1). The pooled adjusted IVE estimates for the mismatched seasons were 31% (95% CI _18 37) for Control group 1-3, respectively.

Mismatched seasons include all other seasons from the study period.339 IVE estimates individual influenza seasons Adjusted IVE estimates for the different individual influenza seasons varied from negative IVE estimates to 95% (Fig. 2). Significant IVE estimates were identified for the 2007/2008, 2010/2011 and 2012/2013 seasons irrespective of the control group used. Except for season 2013/2014 when using all influenza negative, no significant IVE estimates were identified for any of the other seasons. In all seasons, with the exception of season 2005/2006, the estimated adjusted IVE was the highest for non-influenza virus positive controls, followed by all influenza negative and pan-negative controls. Sensitivity analysis The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in Table 3. The adjusted overall IVE estimates increased when excluding seasons 2003/2004 and 2004/2005. The pooled overall IVE estimate was 66% (95% CI 51-76) and CI 8- 46) for all influenza negative, non-influenza virus positive and pan-negative controls, respectively. When including the pandemic season of 2009/2010 the adjusted IVE estimates are comparable with the main analysis. On the other hand the adjusted IVE estimates decreased when restricting to subjects which were swabbed within 4 days after disease onset. For the sensitivity analysis using the laboratory test results of PIV virus 1-4, CoV, RSV, hMPV, RV, EV and ADV to define the cases and controls, 343 eligible patients tested positive for influenza virus (cases) and 794 tested negative (all influenza negative). Among those tested negative for influenza virus 288 (36%) and 506 (64%) patients were included as non-influenza virus positive and pan-negative controls respectively (Table 4). The adjusted IVE estimates for the 2005/2006, 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 seasons with the different control groups varied from negative estimates to 92% (Table 3). The adjusted IVE was only statistically significant for the 2007/2008 season when using the different control groups. For all sensitivity analysis the IVE estimate was the highest when using noninfluenza virus positive controls, followed by all influenza negative controls and pan-negative controls. 340 Table 2 Proportion of virus (sub)types and lineages (%) and vaccine mismatch per subtype/lineage based on virus isolates and specimens submitted to the National Influenza Center with a specimen collection date in week 40 of one year through week 39 of the following year Influenza season virus (sub) types (%) A 99 80 64 99 49 92 100 60 90 69 94 A(H1N1)a0 18 4 13 86 1 100 97 1 39 40 A(H3N2) 100 82 96 87 14 99 0 3 99 61 60 B 1 20 36 1 51 8 0 40 10 31 6 B Y Y Y/V Y Y V NA Y/V Y/V Y/V Y/V B/Vic 91 95 12 6 24 B/Yam 9 5 88 94 76 Mismatch per subtype A(H1N1) NA No No Yes Yes No Yes bNo No No No A(H3N2) Yes Yes No No No No NA No Yes Yes Yes B/Vic NA NAYes (Yam in vaccine)NA NAYes (Yam in vaccine)NA No No NA NA B/Yam Yes (Vic in vaccine) Yes (Antigenic mismatch)Yes match c Mismatch MismatchPartially matchPartially matchMismatch Match Mismatch Match Mismatch Mismatch Mismatch V: B/Victoria/2/87-lineage; Y: B/Yamagata/16/88-lineage; NA: Not applicable.

The influenza vaccine was considered to partially matched if the vaccine strain matched the predominant virus subtype but mismatched the non-predominant subtypes. In all other situations the vaccine was considered mismatched with circulating viruses. 341 Figure 2 Adjusted1 influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza in The Netherlands for the individual seasons2.

Similar differences in IVE estimates were found in a study performed in Portugal, in which the IVE was estimated for the mismatched 2012/2013 influenza season among ILI patients which were tested on RSV, PIV, hMPV, RV and ADV to define the control group patients [12,39]. On the other hand, an American study which estimated the IVE over six influenza seasons (2004/2005 through 2009/2010) among children and adults aged 50 years and older found only minor differences in the IVE estimates when the different control groups based on the detection of the same viruses as the Portugal study and enterovirus [14]. However, other studies performed in Australia which estimated the IVE in children for the matched influenza season of 2008/2009 and 2008-2012 seasons using all influenza negative and noninfluenza positive controls, found the highest IVE estimates when using non-influenza positive controls [13,15]. The IVE estimate for (partial) matched seasons using non-influenza positive controls in our study is higher than the IVE estimate in a Dutch randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted with patients aged 60 years and older (50% (95% CI: 35-61)) in the matched season of 1991-1992 [40,41]. Moreover, the IVE estimate for mismatched seasons in our study is also 343 higher than the IVE estimate found in a Cochrane review of RCTs with healthy subjects aged 18-65 years using non-influenza positive controls (55% (95% CI: 41-66)) [42].

P2: Comparison Control group 2 versus Control group 3. The variation in the IVE estimates using different control groups can be explained by selection bias or misclassification bias [11,12,17]. In order to reduce selection bias, several studies suggested including non-influenza ILI patients tested negative for other respiratory viruses as controls (pan-negative controls). This suggestion is based on the assumption that influenza vaccination may increase the risk of a non-influenza respiratory virus infection by a temporary nonspecific immunity (viral interference), resulting in a higher proportion of 344 vaccinated individuals in the control group [11-14,17,18]. In our study we found no indication that influenza vaccination might have increased the risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infection in vaccinated patients. We observed no difference in the vaccination coverage between the non-influenza positive controls and pan-negative controls (coverage in both groups 21.0% (P = 1.00)) [13]. Others have indicated that if a temporary nonspecific immunity is present, this is a short lasting response (around two weeks). Therefore, it is unlikely that this response influences the risk of other non-influenza respiratory viruses throughout the full study period since we have only included swabbed patients who received the vaccine at least 14 days before symptom onset [14,19,43]. Although, this explanation is only true when we assume individuals are susceptible to influenza virus infection only at the beginning of the study period and timing of infections is not taken into account [44]. It should especially be questioned which population patients is represented by pan- negative controls since these are ILI/ARI patients tested negative for the evaluated respiratory viruses, i.e. ILI/ARI patients without an infection of one of the tested pathogens. Pan-negative patients might be more susceptible for health care-seeking behavior, and therefore include a higher proportion of ILI/ARI not caused by infection, since patients in this control group were older and the prevalence of any chronic disease was higher compared to the cases and other control groups. Also the delay in swabbing might play a role since the time between symptom onset and swabbing influences the sensitivity of laboratory tests [45,46]. If the time between swabbing and symptoms onset is greater, the sensitivity of influenza A and B viruses RT-PCR detection decreases, e.g. from 88% for 4 days till 70% for 7 days delay [46]. In our study, 14.2% of the pan-negative patients were swabbed 6-7 days after symptom onset compared to 13.6% and 11.5% of all influenza negative and non-influenza virus positive controls. The sensitivity of the laboratory tests is also important for the assumption of including patients tested negative for influenza virus but positive for another respiratory virus as control group (non-influenza positive controls). The inclusion of this control group is based on the assumption that laboratory tests are adequate for both cases and controls, thereby eliminating false negative controls and misclassification bias. However, in the current study different laboratory techniques have been used to detect an infection with one of the tested pathogens. RT-PCR was used throughout the whole study period to detect influenza virus, RSV, RV and EV infection. However, due to innovations in these techniques over the study period, the sensitivity of the assays has increased a little. This might have reduced misclassification in later seasons. Furthermore, in season 2004/2005 only virus isolation was used for the detection of RV and EV, which also was the method used to detect PIV virus infections. Virus isolation has a lower sensitivity than RT-PCR. Due to this sensitivity gap misclassification of patients can still not be ruled out absolutely [46-48]. Our sensitivity analysis excluding the seasons 2003/2004 and 2004/2005 for the overall estimate showed higher IVE estimates compared to the primary analysis, especially when using all influenza negative and pan-negative controls. No significant difference between the IVE estimates could be observed when using the different control groups, the confidence intervals 345 overlapped more than in the primary analysis. When including the pandemic season the overall estimates were almost identical to the estimates from the primary analysis. However, when restricting to patients who were swabbed within 4 days after disease onset the IVE estimates decreased, especially when using non-influenza positive controls. Also the sensitivity analysis which used several extra respiratory pathogens to define the control groups, showed slightly different IVE estimates compared to the primary analysis which included three respiratory viruses for the definition of control groups. However, no general trend (increase or decrease of the IVE) could be observed when comparing the IVE estimates of the primary and sensitivity analyses which may be explained by the relative infrequent occurrence of these infections in primary care. We were able to analyze the IVE estimates over several seasons among the Dutch general practice population using the TND study with different control groups, however our study has several limitations. Firstly, a certain level of misclassification might be present in the non-influenza virus positive controls and pan-negative controls due to the differences in sensitivity of the laboratory tests used for the detection of other pathogens, especially for those detected by RT-PCR and those detected by virus isolation [49,50]. Secondly, due to the limited number of eligible patients both patients diagnosed by the GP with ILI and ARI were included in this study to maximize the power. However, there may be differences in health care-seeking behavior of these two patient groups, which could have resulted in misclassification bias. Moreover, patients in the Sentinel Practices of NIVEL Primary Care Database network are not a systematic sample of ILI/ARI patients in the population since most persons with ILI/ARI will not visit their GP and from those who visit the GP, the GP did not have a strict instruction about which patients to sample (e.g. first patients in the week). In addition, subjects who have been hospitalized with an influenza virus infection through the first aid are not covered by the NIVEL Primary Care database, since those subjects are swabbed in the hospital. Despite including both ILI and ARI patients, the number of eligible patients was limited which resulted in wide confidence intervals and only few statistically significant IVE estimates. Finally, we did do not have information on how the vaccination status per individual patient was exactly collected and this might have resulted in misclassification bias. However, since all inhabitants in the Netherlands are registered at one GP office, we can assume that if the GP has vaccinated the patient that the GP takes this information from the registry data of the patient. 346 CONCLUSION Our study shows differences in the IVE estimates when using three different control groups which are in line with other studies. Pan-negative controls seems less valid because a high proportion of patients in this group likely consult the GP because of noninfectious causes of ILI or ARI symptoms. When using noninfluenza positive controls, the IVE estimates are more consistent with previous effectiveness studies and clinical trial data, likely due to limiting controls without an infectious cause of respiratory disease; all controls have a laboratory confirmed infection explaining ILI and ARI symptoms. Nevertheless, when using non-influenza positive controls a higher IVE estimate was found in the primary analysis for mismatched seasons compared to matched seasons which is not as expected, but based on the sensitivity analysis seemed to be caused by the mismatched seasons. Future studies using the TND design should take into account the potential impact of defined control group as well as vaccine match status. Further studies on the study design are needed to confirm our findings and to give a more clear statement about the differences observed between the control groups. Future research on the study design should include more patients to be able to detect statistical significant IVE estimates, especially since adjusting for confounding is needed. This possibly can be done by expanding the GP network, increasing the number of patients a GP has to swab or by pooling data from several countries [51-53]. In addition, it is recommended for future studies to use if feasible, standardized equalsensitive tests for pathogen detection throughout the whole study period to minimize misclassification bias, although innovations in diagnostic tests increasing the sensitivity should not be ignored. 347 REFERENCES 1.

Liu, A. Huckriede, E. Hak Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics. 2016; 12(1):159-69. 54 ABSTRACT Montanide ISA51 (ISA 51) is a vaccine adjuvant which has been tested in therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine trials. The aim of this review is to present a comprehensive examination of the safety and tolerability of ISA 51 containing vaccines. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and clinicaltrials.gov. Eligible studies were categorized into: (A) uncontrolled studies with non-healthy subjects, (B) controlled studies with non-healthy subjects, and (C) controlled studies with healthy subjects. Reported adverse events (AEs) were assessed. 91 studies were included in our review. Generally observed AEs included injection site reaction; injection site pain; myalgia; headache; gastro-intestinal disorders; fatigue and fever - regardless of the administration route and subject characteristic. Specific AEs, e.g. injection site reactions and rash, were more frequently reported from subjects receiving ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccines than from subjects receiving antigen or ISA 51 only. The reported AEs were mainly mild to moderate in intensity. Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 27% of the uncontrolled trials and 2 trials conducted with healthy subjects. Notably, 2 other trials conducted with healthy subjects were stopped due to unacceptable AEs. Some studies indicate that the mixing procedure of antigen and adjuvant might influence the occurrence of AEs. Reports on SAEs and premature termination of 2 trials advise caution when using ISA 51. Yet, AEs might be preventable by proper mixing of vaccine and adjuvant to a stable emulsion. Trials including an active control group are needed for a fair evaluation of adjuvant safety. 455 INTRODUCTION Adjuvants are substances which are not antigenic themselves but help to induce strong and efficacious immune responses toward specific antigens [1,2]. Adjuvants enhance immune responses by at least one of the following mechanisms: (1) accelerate the onset of an immune response by activating innate immune responses or targeting antigens to professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs); (2) enhance the overall magnitude of an immune response, including the frequency of memory B and T cells; (3) elicit an immune response for a longer duration; (4) skew an immune response toward the desired directions (Th1, Th2, Th17, or balanced Th1/Th2) and (5) modulate the specificity, affinity and isotype of the elicited antibodies. Based on their modes of action, adjuvants can be classified into immune modulators, delivery vehicles or carriers with immune stimulatory effect [1-4]. Montanide ISA TM 51 (Seppic, France), a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion composed of a mineral oil and a surfactant from the mannide monooleate family, is an adjuvant carrier with immune stimulatory effect [2-6]. When mixed with antigens in a ratio of 50/50 v/v (1:1), ISA 51 enhances antigen specific antibody titers and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses [7]. The immune enhancing effect of ISA 51 is suggested to be associated with depot formation (and thus slow the release of antigens at the immunization site), inflammation (which stimulates the recruitment of APCs) and lymphocyte-trapping (which stimulates the accumulation of lymphocytes in draining lymph nodes) [8, 9]. It has been given to thousands of subjects subcutaneously (s.c.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) in vaccine trials requiring cellular immune responses, such as vaccine trials for cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and malaria [5, 6]. A therapeutic lung cancer vaccine containing ISA 51 as emulsion adjuvant has been recently licensed in Cuba [10]. Recently, ISA 51 was also tested in influenza vaccine trials [11,12]. The inclusion of a vaccine adjuvant should be justified by a favorable risk/benefit ratio; the risk including local and systemic Adverse Events (AEs) [3]. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on the assessment of the safety and tolerability of ISA 51 and ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccines. 456 MATERIALS AND METHODS Search strategy Vaccine trials using ISA 51 adjuvant were systematically searched. Published medical studies were obtained from searches of PubMed and EMBASE with the free-text term \"ISA 51\"OR\"ISA51\" and 'ISA 51'OR'ISA51', respectively. References from the databases were extracted and imported to RefWorks where duplicate entries were removed. The clinical trial register (clinicaltrials.gov) was hand searched for unpublished trials for which study results were available. References given by the trials identified from clinicaltrials.gov were examined for relevancy. No protocol is registered for the systematic review. Study selection Title and abstract of the extracted references were screened for relevant studies. Studies were included if: (1) they were clinical trials; (2) they used ISA 51 as vaccine adjuvant; and (3) they were reported in English. Comment letters, reviews and conference abstracts and/or presentations were excluded. Full-text articles from the resulting pre-screened studies were obtained for the second stage evaluation. Studies were excluded if (1) they did not report safety, tolerability and/or toxicity data, (2) they were case reports or (3) letters to an editor, and (4) full-text was not available from the University Medical Center Groningen library. The screening and full-text evaluation procedures were performed independently by 2 members of the study team. Consensus on study selection was achieved. In case of disagreement, a third member of the study team made the final decision. Data extraction Data on study design, study population, study treatments (including trial vaccine and administration route), study endpoints and safety, tolerability and/or toxicity outcomes were extracted from the selected studies by one study team member. The extracted information was independently validated by a second team member. Trials included in the systematic review were categorized by the following subject characteristics and study design: (A) uncontrolled studies with non-healthy subjects, (B) controlled studies with non-healthy subjects and (C) controlled studies with healthy subjects. A control group could be an active control (immunization with the tested antigens without adjuvants or with adjuvants used in licensed vaccines, e.g., alum, AS03 and AS04); a placebo-control (immunization with saline buffer); or an adjuvant control (immunization with ISA 51 in saline buffer). Quality assessment The methodological quality of the controlled studies selected for the review was evaluated by the Jadad score. The scoring system judged the procedure and description of randomization (0, 1 or 2 point), double-blinding (0, 1 or 2 point) and the description of withdrawals and drop outs (0 or 1 point). Using this scoring system a maximum score of 5 could be obtained; a score of 2 was considered as indicating poor methodological quality [48].457 RESULTS Search results and study selection A systematic literature search performed on 9th February 2014 identified 580 studies from PubMed and EMBASE (Fig. 1). Additional, 12 trials on ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine were identified from clinicaltrials.gov and one study obtained from a previous literature search on universal influenza vaccines. After removing duplicate entries, 462 studies were evaluated for inclusion based on the title and/or abstract, after which 114 potentially relevant studies were included for full-text examination; the majority of excluded studies were reviews or animal studies and 6 studies were not reported in English. From the 114 studies, full-text was unavailable for one study [13], 2 studies were duplicates published under different titles [14,15], one study only described the study design [16] and 6 studies did not report safety, tolerability and/or toxicity results [7,17-21]. These together with 11 case reports [22-32] and 2 letters to the editor were excluded [33,34]. Ultimately, a total of 91 studies were included in the systemic safety review. The full list of the 91 eligible studies including citations is provided in Supplemental Table 1.

Except for the study by Pinto et al. which was conducted in HIV-infected subjects 35, all studies were conducted in cancer patients. Among these studies, 14% were pilot studies (11/81), 38% were phase I trials (31/81), 12% were phase I/II trials (10/81), 30% were phase II trials (24/81) and 2% were phase III trials (2/81) - 3 studies (4%) did not specify the trial phase. Among the trials, different administration routes were used, including s.c. (8/81, 10%). Controlled studies with non-healthy subjects Four studies were conducted in non-healthy adults (aged 18 years) and included control group(s). In the phase Ib trial of Boffito et al., HIV-positive males were randomized to receive a single s.c. administration of HIV vaccines at different doses, alone or adjuvanted with ISA 51 [36]. The study also included placebo (saline only) and adjuvant (ISA 51) controls. In the phase I trial of Sabbatini et al. and phase II trials of Goldinger et al. and NCT00273910, cancer patients were administered with multiple dosages of cancer vaccines with or without ISA 51 [37-39]. Sabbatini et al. included ovarian cancer patients, while both Goldinger et al. and NCT00273910 included melanoma patients. All subjects in Sabbatini et al. received s.c. administrations. The same route was used for the administration of ISA 51-adjuvatend cancer vaccines in the other 2 trials. In Goldinger et al. and NCT00273910, the active control group (containing the same vaccine antigen but without ISA 51 or with a licensed adjuvant) received plain vaccine antigens given by the intranodal or the i.d. route respectively. The main characteristics of the 4 studies are summarized in Table 1. In total the studies included 212 non-healthy subjects of whom 50 were treated with vaccine antigens only (arm 1) and 77 were treated with ISA 51-adjuvanted cancer vaccines (arm 2 and also arm 3 for NCT00273910). In addition, 11 subjects received saline buffer alone or emulsified with ISA 51 in the trial of Boffito et al., and 74 subjects received the non- or ISA 51-adjuvanted antigen with imiquimod or poly ICLC in the other studies. The methodological quality of 3 of the 4 trials was judged to be poor with Jadad scores of 1, 1 and 2 for the trial performed by Goldinger et al., Sabbatini et al. and NCT00273910, respectively (Table 1; Table S2). Only the study performed by Boffito et al. was of good quality and reached a Jadad score of 4. 459 Table 1 Main characteristics of the controlled studies with non-healthy subjects Study Trial phaseStudy population Vaccine antigensTreatment groups Vaccine volume Administration routeJadad score Boffito et al.

The cream was applied topically. 460 Controlled studies with healthy subjects Six trials were conducted in healthy adults (aged 18 years) and included control group(s) [11,12,40-43]. I.m. administration was used in 5 studies, Pleguezuelos et al. used s.c. administration. The phase I trials from Graham et al., Herrera et al. and Wu et al. included an adjuvant (ISA51) control group. Subjects in the Graham et al. study were randomized to receive a cocktail of HIV peptides (1 mg or 4 mg) adjuvanted with ISA 51 or ISA 51 emulsion alone. Herrera et al. and Wu et al. both tested a malaria antigen. Subjects were randomized to receive ISA 51 emulsion only or a mixture of synthetic peptides (50 mg or 100 mg per peptide) or one of 2 recombinant surface proteins (Pvs25 or Pfs25) adjuvanted with ISA 51, respectively [41,43]. Subjects in the Herrera et al. study were also randomized to receive the tested antigen adjuvanted with Montanide ISA 720 [41]. The phase I/II trial by Atsmon et al. and the phase I trial from Pleguezuelos et al. randomized subjects to receive a placebo, ISA51 emulsion only, or different doses of influenza antigens (250 mg or 500 mg of recombinant protein or polypeptides harboring diverse influenza B and T cell epitopes) with or without ISA 51 [11,12]. In the study of Atsmon et al. 2 immunizations were given and in the study of Pleguezuelos et al. one immunization was given. Subjects in the phase I study of Pialoux et al. all received 2 dosages of vCP125 antigens before they were randomized to receive 2 dosages of rgp160 antigens adjuvanted with alum or ISA 51 [42]. The main study characteristics of the 6 studies are summarized in Table 2. In total there were 231 healthy adults of which 53 were treated with vaccine antigens alone or with a licensed vaccine adjuvant (arm 1 for Atsmon et al., Pialoux et al. and Pleguezelos et al.), 31 with only ISA 51 emulsion (arm 2 or 3) and 117 were treated with ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccines. In addition, 14 subjects received saline buffer only and 16 subjects received ISA 720-adjuvanted vaccines. Except for the trial performed by Pialoux et al. which has a Jadad score of 2, all the other trials had a score 3 (Table 2; Table S3). 461 Table 2 Main characteristics of the controlled studies with healthy subjects Study Trial phaseStudy population Vaccine antigens Treatment groups Vaccine volume Administration routeJadad score Atsmon et al.

For those where specific AEs were reported, commonly reported AEs include injection site reaction, fatigue, fever, gastro-intestinal (GI) disorders including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and injection site or local erythema. Most of the observed AEs were not immunization route specific (Table 3). Nevertheless, chills were more commonly reported in trials using the i.m. route (80%), and headache was more commonly reported in trials using other administration route(s) (40%). The severity of reported AEs were mainly mild (grade I) to moderate (grade II). Severe (grade III) AEs, such as fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, hyperglycemia, neutropenia, were reported in 32% of the trials (26/81); 27% of the trials (22/ 81) reported serious (grade IV) AEs (SAEs), such as neutropenia, hyperglycemia, hepatic toxicity and renal failure. A possible cause due to co-intervention (e.g., GM-CSF, IL-2 or gemcitabine) and/or underlying disease could not be excluded.

Most of the reported AEs were mild. Moderate and severe AEs were more often reported from the study groups receiving a high antigen dose. Boffito et al. identified five SAEs, namely gastroenteritis, Kaposi's sarcoma, perinanal abscess, Shigellosis and lower abdominal pain, which were all considered not to be caused by the HIV vaccine. The safety reporting system used by Boffito et al. did not allow us to extract information on the number of subjects experiencing a specific AE and the total number of AEs experienced in the study. As stated by Boffito et al. the most frequent AEs experienced in this study were injection site pain (12,8%), headache (9,2%) and fatigue (9%) [36]. 463 The cancer vaccine trials performed by Goldinger et al., Sabbatini et al. and NCT00273910 included an active control group and reported the number of subjects experiencing a specific AE after the study treatment. The study from Goldinger et al. only reported the occurrence of AEs with an incidence >3 while studies from Sabbatini et al. and NCT00273910 both reported the occurrence of all AEs. Table 4 summarizes the AEs reported in at least 2 of these trials. In general, treatment related AEs were more often observed in the ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine group than in the active control group. Specific AEs including injection site reaction, pruritus, myalgia and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were more commonly reported from the ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine group. Other AEs reported only by a single study include injection site rash, pain and erythema, skin neoplasm excision, skin nodule, oral herpes, sweating, decreased serum phosphate, hypersensitivity, vomiting, nausea and diarrhea. Notably, most of the AEs reported by subjects in the NCT00273910 trial were reported from subjects receiving the ISA 51-adjuvanted study vaccine prepared by vortex. In this trial, 19 and 14 cancer patients received ISA 51-ajduvanted study antigens prepared by vortex and 2-syringe mixing respectively. All patients receiving the adjuvanted study antigens developed injection site reaction regardless of the preparation process. However, AEs such as leukocyte count decrease, GI disorders, chills, fatigue, sweating and myalgia were only reported from the group receiving the vaccine prepared by vortex mixing. In addition, pruritus was reported in 5 and one patient(s) in the group of vortex and 2-syringe mixing, respectively. Rash was reported in 2 and one patient(s) in the 2 treatment groups, respectively. While the severity of the AEs reported from NCT00273910 was not available, most of the reported AEs reported from Goldinger et al. and Sabbatini et al. were mild or moderate. SAEs were only reported by Goldinger et al., which were 6 hospitalizations due to tumor progression. None of them was considered related to the study treatment. Controlled studies with healthy subjects In the trial of Graham et al., the frequency of the subjects experiencing a specific AE was not given. AEs were classified as local (including pain, tenderness, erythema and induration) or systemic (including malaise, myalgia, headache, fever and nausea) and were graded by severity [40]. Most of the reported AEs were mild. Moderate AEs were more commonly reported from the high antigen dose group (where the amount of ISA 51 was the same as in the low antigen dose group). Severe (systemic) AEs were only reported from the high dose antigen group after the second immunization. Subject dropouts were reported from those receiving the ISA 51-adjuvanted HIV vaccines, at both low and high antigen doses. The dropouts were caused by the painful swelling which occurred after the first immunization. The trial was prematurely terminated (after the second immunization) due to the development of sterile abscesses at the injection site in 4 out of the 21 subjects (19,0%) who received the ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine. None of subjects in the adjuvant control (ISA 51 in saline buffer) developed sterile abscess and AEs above an intensity of mild.464 Sterile abscess was also observed in the trial performed by Wu et al. of which the number of volunteers in each vaccination group experiencing a solicited AE was reported. One out of the first 30 (3,3%) enrollees from the ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine group reported sterile abscess. Aside from frequent occurrence of injection site pain, subjects in both the ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine groups and adjuvant control group experienced local pain, tenderness and erythema, headache, malaise, nausea and leukopenia. AEs only reported by subjects in the ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine group included local induration and swelling, arthralgia and myalgia. Although most of the reported AEs were mild, Wu et al. observed severe (grade III) systemic AEs in the group of high Pvs25 antigen dose adjuvanted with ISA 51. In addition, erythema nodosum (an inflammatory panniculitis) were reported from 2 out of the 10 subjects (20,0%) receiving the high dose Pvs25 malaria antigen adjuvanted with ISA 51. The erythema nodosum reactions were judged to be probably related to vaccination and were the cause for the premature termination of the study. Wu et al. observed no significant differences in the incidence of AEs observed after the first and the second immunization. None of the participants in the adjuvant control groups developed AEs above moderate [43]. The prophylactic vaccine trials performed by Atsmon et al., Herrera et al. and Pialoux et al. reported the number of AEs after each immunization [11,41,42]. For the trial of Pleguezuelos et al., only the number of systemic AEs that occurred after a single injection could be extracted. Table 5 summarizes the reported AEs from the ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine group and the different control groups which were reported in at least 2 of the 4 trials. The reported treatment related AEs were in general evenly distributed between the ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine groups, the active control groups and the adjuvant control groups. Only injection site pain or tenderness were more commonly reported in the ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine group compared to the control groups. Other AEs reported only by a single study include local swelling and erythema, redness, warmth, fatigue, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, diarrhea, dizziness, abdominal pain, adenopathy, asthenia and malaise. The AEs reported by the 4 studies were classified as mild and moderate. Only Pleguezuelos et al. and Herrera et al. reported AEs with an intensity above moderate; 2 severe AEs (appendicitis and pre-syncope) and 2 cases of SAEs (chronic cholecysitis and acute urolithiasis), respectively. In both studies these events were considered not directly caused by the vaccine [12,41]. 465 Table 4 Frequency of adverse events reported in at least two controlled studies with non-healthy subjects Study ISA 51-adjuvanted study vaccine n/N (%) aActive control n/N (%) a 1.

A total of 91 clinical trials on ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccines which provided information on safety, tolerability and/or toxicity were reviewed. Of these 91 trials, 81 were uncontrolled studies with non-healthy subjects, 4 were controlled studies with non-healthy subjects and 6 were controlled studies with healthy subjects. Commonly reported AEs from uncontrolled trials included fever, fatigue, GI disorders, injection site erythema and injection site reaction. These AEs were also reported from controlled trials. For controlled trials with non-healthy subjects the frequency of AEs was generally higher in the ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine group compared with the active control group. However, for controlled studies with healthy subjects the reported AEs were in general evenly distributed between the treatment groups except for injection site pain or tenderness. These AEs were more commonly reported in the ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine group compared to the active and adjuvant control groups. Since the immune response and the sensitivity to pain and discomfort can be expected to be different between non-healthy and healthy subjects, we classified the reviewed studies into 2 subject backgrounds. However, the reported AEs were found to be neither subject specific nor immunization route specific. In general, the observed AEs from controlled trials with nonhealthy as well as healthy individuals were mild to moderate in intensity. However, it should be noted that 2 controlled studies on ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccines in healthy subjects were terminated prematurely due to unacceptable AEs [40,43]. The study of Wu et al. was stopped after the 2 reported cases of erythema nodosum, which was not observed from other ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine studies. The trial by Graham et al. was stopped after 4 cases of sterile abscess, which was also reported by one subject who had erythema nodosum in the trial of Wu et al. and by subjects in 2 other uncontrolled therapeutic vaccine studies in breast cancer patients. In the study of Carr et al., one of the 21 patients (4,8%) was reported to develop a small abscess after receiving the ISA 51-adjuvanted cancer vaccine [44]. The same vaccine was later used in the trial by Mulens et al. where two of the 38 patients (5,3%) who received the ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine developed severe abscess after the vaccination [45]. Since none of the subjects in the adjuvant control group of Graham et al. and Wu et al. was reported to have erythema nodosum, sterile abscess, and/or AEs with an intensity above mild, it is unlikely that the unwanted side effects were caused by ISA 51 alone. Wu et al. noted that the same production lot of malaria Pvs25 antigen was used to produce alum-adjuvanted Pvs25 vaccine, and was shown to be well tolerated in humans [46]. This ruled out the possibility that the unacceptable AEs were caused by the antigen alone. It is therefore most likely that the AEs were caused by the combination of ISA 51 and vaccine antigens. Thus, the mixing procedure for ISA 51 emulsified adjuvant and antigens and other factors involved in the final presentation of the combined product (e.g., antigen dose, dose volume, etc.) should be investigated as possible cause(s) for the observed serious AEs. 467 Table 5 Frequency of adverse events reported in at least two controlled studies with healthy subjects Study ISA 51-adjuvanted study vaccine n/N (%) aActive control n/N (%) aAdjuvant control n/N (%) aPlacebo control n/N (%) a 1.

NA = not applicable; control group not included in the study468 The effect of the method used for mixing ISA 51 and vaccine antigen was particularly addressed in the trial NCT00273910. In this trial, subjects receiving the ISA 51-adjuvanted study vaccine prepared by vortex experienced more AEs, e.g., pruritus, rash, GI disorders, chills, fatigue and myalgia, compared to subjects receiving the study vaccine by 2-syringe mixing. The increased frequency of AEs observed from the vortex mixing group is likely resulted from the poor quality of the mixed ISA 51/antigen emulsions. Vortex mixing probably did not generate enough shear strength to produce stable emulsions [5]. With unstable emulsions, coalescence and change in the droplet size will occur. The antigen is thus no longer entrapped but readily released into the injected environment. Moreover, the escaped mineral oils might cause unwanted local or systemic side effects. Therefore, mixing by syringe is recommended for small volume preparations to obtain homogenous and stable emulsions [5]. To properly address the effect of ISA 51 on vaccine safety and tolerability, the AEs reported from ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine need to be compared to those from an active control group. The inclusion of an active control group, however, was found to be rare among the reviewed studies. This might be due to ethical consideration (e.g. it may be considered unethical to give patients suboptimal treatments) or due to lack of a scientific interest. Only seven out of the 91 reviewed studies has an active control group. This limited the power to detect statistically significant differences between the ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine group and the active control group. Therefore, the incidence of AEs could only be compared in a descriptive way. This review has several limitations. AEs reported by Goldinger et al. were pre-selected and only those with an AE incidence of more than 3 in the study population were presented. Therefore, the AEs with an incidence of zero in Table 4 for the study of Goldinger et al. may not reflect the real situation. Besides, 5 of the 11 controlled studies (45,5%) included for the review had a low methodological quality based on the Jadad scores. Except the trials performed by Boffito et al., Graham et al., Herrera et al. and Pleguezelos et al. the other included controlled studies might have detection and performance biases since there were no blinding procedures for the study participants, personnel and the investigators [47]. Such potential biases might result in giving more attention to those study participants that receive the ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccines. This may have resulted in an overestimation of (S)AEs in the participants receiving an ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccine. Furthermore, 3 of the 6 controlled trials with non-healthy subjects may be subject to selection bias since no randomization procedure was mentioned. However, it is not clear to us what the likely direction the potential selection bias may cause [47]. Last but not least, different AE classifications and reporting systems used by the reviewed studies limited the possibility to present a complete overview of the occurrence and the frequency of AEs experienced by subjects who received ISA 51-adjuvanted vaccines. This could have led to an underestimation of the AEs, especially for the uncontrolled trials. 469 CONCLUSION AEs are frequently reported among trials testing ISA 51-adjuvanted antigens including non- healthy subjects as well as healthy subjects. In addition, SAEs are frequently reported among studies with non-healthy subjects and 2 trials testing ISA 51-adjuvanted prophylactic vaccines with healthy subjects are stopped due to unacceptable AEs which were most likely caused by the combination of ISA 51 adjuvant and the vaccine antigens. Studies indicate that the mixing procedure of the study antigen with ISA 51 might influence the occurrence of AEs. Therefore, for future trials caution should be taken when mixing ISA 51 and the vaccine antigen, especially with regards to small volumes, in order to produce stable emulsions and to prevent unwanted side effects. In addition, trials including an active control group are urgently needed for a fair evaluation of adjuvant safety and tolerability and adjuvant effect on immune boosting, preferably using a standardized reporting system for vaccine related AEs such as the MedRA reporting system. 470 REFERENCES 1.

Bigaeva, E. Doorn, H. Liu, E. Hak PloS One. 2016; 11(5):e015475782 ABSTRACT Background and objectives QS-21 shows in vitro hemolytic effect and causes side effects in vivo. New saponin adjuvant formulations with better toxicity profiles are needed. This study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of QS-21 and the improved saponin adjuvants (ISCOM, ISCOMATRIX and Matrix-M) from vaccine trials.Methods literature search was conducted from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library and Clinicaltrials.gov. We selected for the trials vaccines adjuvanted with QS-21, ISCOM, ISCOMATRIX or Matrix-M, which included a placebo control group and reported safety outcomes. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Jadad scale was used to assess the study quality.Results Nine RCTs were eligible for the meta-analysis: six trials on QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines and three trials on ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted, with 907 patients in total. There were no studies on ISCOM or Matrix-M adjuvanted vaccines matching the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis identified an increased risk for diarrhea in patients receiving QS21-adjuvanted vaccines (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.04-6.24). No increase in the incidence of the reported systemic AEs was observed for ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines. QS-21- and ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines caused a significantly higher incidence of injection site pain (RR 4.11, 95% CI 1.10-15.35 and RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.41-4.59, respectively). ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines also increased the incidence of injection site swelling (RR 3.43, 95% CI 1.08-10.97).Conclusions Our findings suggest that vaccines adjuvanted with either QS-21 or ISCOMATRIX posed no specific safety concern. Furthermore, our results indicate that the use of ISCOMATRIX enables a better systemic tolerability profile when compared to the use of QS-21. However, no better local tolerance was observed for ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines in immunized non-healthy subjects. This meta-analysis is limited by the relatively small number of individuals recruited in the included trials, especially in the control groups. 583 INTRODUCTION Adjuvants are substances that do not confer immunity on their own [1]. However, when added to immunogens, they facilitate, improve and maintain the immune responses against the immunogens [2,3]. Therefore, adjuvants provide a rational strategy to improve the efficacy of vaccines, especially in the case of weak immunogens and/or vaccines intended for individuals with weakened immune systems (e.g. newborns, the elderly or immune-compromised persons). Furthermore, adjuvants allow for dose sparing of vaccine antigen and helps in reducing the cost of vaccination programs [4,5]. A group of immunoenhancers of great interest is saponins, whose strong adjuvant activity was first described in 1930s [6]. Saponins are natural triterpenoid or steroid glycosides, which can be extracted from the bark of a South American tree Quillaja saponaria (Soapbark) [7,8]. QS-21 is one of the most potent and the most extensively studied saponin adjuvants in numerous studies including prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines for both animals and humans [9,10]. QS-21 has been shown to be an effective immunological adjuvant for human vaccines with a wide variety of antigens and to have a relatively low toxicity in preclinical studies in mice [11,12]. It stimulates both antibody and cellular immune responses composed of both Th1 and Th2 immunity. The cellular immune stimulating capacity of QS-21 is especially important for developing vaccines against cancers and intracellular pathogens [13]. A number of vaccine trials have been performed using QS-21 as adjuvant, initially for cancer vaccines (i.e. melanoma, breast and prostate cancer) and, subsequently, for vaccines against Alzheimer's disease and infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, influenza, herpes simplex virus (HSV), malaria and hepatitis B diseases [9,12]. However, the natural saponin QS-21 has inherent disadvantages such as chemical instability, limited supply, difficult and low-yielding purification, and dose-limiting toxicity, which prevent it from wider use [14]. Importantly, QS-21 could cause hemolysis in vitro and its use in vivo has been observed with side effects [7]. Saponins have been shown to interact with cholesterol, and might form pores in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes. When such interaction happens to erythrocytes, hemolysis could occur [15]. In order to reduce saponin-related toxicity, the formulation of immunostimulating complex (ISCOM) was developed by Morein et al. in 1984 [16]. ISCOMs are open cage-like 40-nm particulate structures, which are formed spontaneously if cholesterol, phospholipids, saponin and viral envelope proteins are mixed together [17,18]. The formulation retains the adjuvant activity of the saponin with an increased stability, when compared to QS-21. Furthermore, the concern of hemolysis is solved by eliminating the possibility of the saponin to interact with cell membranes [19,20]. Nevertheless, the types of antigens that can be incorporated into ISCOM are restricted, and the incorporation process is difficult to control [4]. Due to these technical problems and the fact that antigen incorporation is not necessary to achieve a potent immune stimulation, matrix formulations such as ISCOMATRIX and Matrix-M were eveloped. These matrix formulations contain the same components and have 584 the same structure as the ISCOM but without the incorporated antigen [19,21]. ISCOMATRIX usually contains Quil A or more purified forms of saponins, including QS-21, ISCOPREP 703 and, more recently, ISCOPREP [22]. Matrix-M is a combination of two individually formed matrix particles from different purified fractions of Quillaia saponins, namely Matrix-A and Matrix-C [23]. The former fraction has a higher adjuvant activity while the latter fraction has a lower adjuvant activity but a high tolerance [19]. Both ISCOMATRIX and Matrix-M adjuvanted vaccines have been tested in animal models and more recently in human clinical trials [19,22,23]. Vaccines adjuvanted with either ISCOMATRIX or Matrix-M have been shown to induce strong antibody and T-cell responses and to be well tolerated in both pre-clinical and clinical studies [24,25]. ISCOMATRIX is currently under evaluation in candidate vaccines against hepatitis C virus (HCV) [26], influenza [27] and cancer [28-30]. Matrix-M is currently being investigated in vaccines for influenza, HSV type 2 and malaria [23,31]. Current applications of ISCOMs include the development of influenza vaccines for humans [32]. The benefits from adjuvant incorporation into any vaccine formulation have to be balanced with the risk of adverse events (AEs) [2]. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of QS-21 and the improved saponin-based adjuvants such as ISCOMATRIX. Here we focus on single adjuvant formulations (QS-21, ISCOM, ISCOMATRIX and Matrix-M) rather than combinations of adjuvants. Therefore, studies that used adjuvant systems, such as AS01, AS02 and AS04 developed by GlaxoSmithKline, were not included in the analysis. METHODS We conducted a meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [33]. The protocol for the study was not published online. Literature search strategy A systematic search of literature was performed using the electronic databases of MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE and Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The clinical trial register (clinicaltrials.gov) was searched for unpublished trials. To define the studies of interest in these databases, the following keywords were Details of the search strategy are provided in the supporting information (S1 Appendix). References were imported to RefWorks where duplicate entries were removed. Furthermore, the literature search was complemented by manual search of the reference lists of all identified studies and reviews for additional studies.585 Study selection References were evaluated using the pre-defined inclusion criteria: (1) randomized controlled (QS-21, ISCOM, ISCOMATRIX or Matrix-M); (2) which included a control group (i.e., individuals immunized with saline buffer, adjuvant alone, antigen alone or adjuvanted with a licensed adjuvant); and (3) reporting information regarding safety and/or tolerability. The inclusion of only RCT studies was considered necessary to avoid the possible selection and reporting biases that may arise from observational studies. Two independent reviewers (EB, ED) performed primary evaluation of the retrieved articles for relevance based on the title and abstract. Disagreements were discussed with a third investigator (HL) until consensus was achieved. Potentially eligible publications were reviewed as full text. The acronym PICOS (patients, interventions, comparator (control) group, outcomes and study design) was used to assess if the references fully complied with the inclusion criteria. In order to lower the between-study heterogeneity and due to the fact that there were not enough eligible RCTs in healthy volunteers to be included for the meta-analysis, we limited our study selection to RCTs that recruited adult (18 years and older) non-healthy subjects. References for which full-text could not be acquired electronically or were reported not in English language were excluded. Data extraction Two independent reviewers (EB and ED) identified potentially relevant articles and collected the following data: the first author's last name, the year of publication, clinicaltrials.gov identifier (if applicable), study design, total number of participants, age range, gender, disease background, study arms with number of vaccinated participants in each arm, doses of adjuvants used for the preparation of vaccines, immunization route and number of injections. The following safety outcomes were identified from the included studies and considered for the meta-analysis: serious, systemic and local AEs. The commonly reported systemic AEs across the selected studies included headache, fatigue, insomnia, pyrexia, myalgia, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, anxiety and back pain. The local AEs included injection site pain, redness, erythema and swelling. Evaluation of study quality Following Cochrane guidelines for systematic reviews of interventions [34], two independent reviewers (EB, ED) assessed the quality of individual studies included in the meta-analysis. The Jadad scale for reporting RCTs, which summarizes the methodological quality of a study in an overall score, was employed. In brief, the Jadad scale evaluates three items: randomization (up to two points are given), double blinding (up to two points are given) and report of withdrawals and dropouts (up to one point is given). An overall score between zero and five is assigned. A score of three and above is commonly regarded as the reference point for adequate trial quality [35]. Studies were not to be excluded on the basis of this assessment but their quality scores were taken into account when describing results.586 Data analysis To evaluate the safety and tolerability of saponin adjuvanted vaccines, the dichotomous data on the number of subjects experiencing a systemic or local AE in the saponin-adjuvanted study vaccine group and placebo group were extracted from each study with subsequent determination of the risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Of note, within each study we pooled all subjects that received adjuvanted vaccine, regardless the concentration of the adjuvant and antigen in vaccine formulation. We combined data statistically using random effects (Mantel-Haenszel method) model due the differences in among the studies in e.g. vaccine formulation, adjuvant dose and the disease background of subjects. Chi 2 and I2 statistics were used to assess the heterogeneity among the included studies. Values of I2 can be interpreted as low (25-50%), moderate (50-75%), and high (75% and greater) levels of heterogeneity [36]. Meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager (RevMan 5.3, Cochrane Collaboration). results were considered to be statistically significant with a p value of <0.05. In addition to the meta-analysis, descriptive reports on serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment discontinuations were given. Dealing with missing data Our analysis relies solely on the existing data. Assessment of reporting biases Due to the limited number of studies available for meta-analysis, assessment of publication bias was not applicable. The review is subject to publication bias. RESULTS Search results A total of 813 references were identified from electronic databases during the search performed during 03-04.03.2016 (Fig 1). Additional 7 references were identified by manual search. After removing duplicate entries (151), 669 references were evaluated for inclusion based on the title and/or abstract. As a result, 112 potentially relevant articles were included in the next stage for the full-text evaluation. From the 112 articles, full text was unavailable for 13 studies, 3 references were reviews, and 1 reference was a completed clinical trial with no study results reported. Characteristics of the study population, interventions, control groups, the evaluated outcomes and/or design of the study (PICOS) did not meet the inclusion criteria in 81 publications. Most of these studies did not include a control group, i.e. all enrolled subjects received the saponin-adjuvanted vaccines. One meta-analysis [37] and four pooled analyses [22,38-40] were excluded since the original safety data of the reported studies were not retrievable. Ultimately, a total of nine RCTs fulfilled all inclusion criteria and were selected for the meta-analysis [41-49].587 Study characteristics The main characteristics of the selected RCTs are summarized in Table 1. Among nine studies, six used QS-21 and three used ISCOMATRIX as vaccine adjuvant. No RCTs on ISCOM or Matrix-M adjuvanted vaccines matched the inclusion criteria. Briefly, the trials on ISCOM (one trial) and Matrix-M (one trial [50], two reports [51,52]) adjuvanted vaccines were performed in healthy volunteers and/or did not report safety data. The six trials on QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines enrolled a total of 755 individuals, of which 510 in the treatment group (i.e. subjects received antigen with adjuvant) and 245 in the control groups (i.e. subjects received placebo, antigen alone or adjuvant alone). A total of 152 nonhealthy subjects were recruited for the three RCTs on ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines and included 98 and 54 in the treatment and control groups, respectively. Figure 1 Flowchart of the evaluation and inclusion process for the meta-analysis. 588 The selected trials for both adjuvants recruited adult non-healthy subjects. Studies that involved healthy volunteers could not be included for the meta-analysis due to the limited number of identified studies that fulfilled the pre-defined inclusion criteria. The age of the enrolled subjects in the nine studies varied from 19 to 85 years, among which 44.9% were males. All studies reported the number of subjects experiencing a specific AE. Studies of Anderson et al. [47] and Frazer et al. [48] used a seven-day diary card to record specific local and systemic AEs. In the former study, unsolicited AEs could also be reported on a separate 30-day diary card. In the study of Frazer et al. [48], an additional home visit was conducted with each study subject at the end of the follow-up period. Studies described by Gilman et al. [41] and Wald et al. [42] did not mention the method of AE reporting; however, they used physical examinations and evaluations of clinical and laboratory parameters after each vaccination. In the Sharp&Corp study [49], the safety data was collected up to 4 years after first dose of vaccine by systematic assessment (not further specified). During Pfizer studies NCT00479557 [43] and NCT00498602 [44] AEs were reported throughout 110 weeks, including a 6-week screening period, 52 weeks of dosing and 54 weeks for follow-up after the last dose. The studies NCT00752232 [45] and NCT01227564 [46] recorded AEs from day 1 throughout the trial (24 months and 104 weeks, respectively). All Pfizer studies used non-systematic assessment of AEs. Furthermore, trials NCT00479557, NCT00498602, NCT01227564 and Sharp&Corp (but not NCT00752232) used 5% frequency threshold for reporting AEs (not including SAEs). A threshold of 5% indicates that only AEs with a frequency greater than 5% within at least one arm were reported.

[42] According to the Jadad scale, eight out of the nine studies (88.8%) have a score of 3 or 4. The study published by Wald et al. [42] has a score of 2 due to the fact that this RCT was single-blinded, and there was insufficient information on the randomization method.

QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine versus placebo Serious adverse events (SAEs). Wald et al. [42] reported no SAEs related to any treatment. On the other hand, treatment-related SAEs including encephalitis, encephalopathy, confusion, grand mal convulsion, retinal thrombosis, cerebral hemorrhage and hemiplegia were reported by Gilman et al [41]. The SAEs were observed in 7.3% (95% CI 4.9-10.8%) QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine recipients and in 0% (95% CI 0-5%) of placebo recipients. This clinical trial was discontinued because of severe AEs, mostly associated with encephalitis. All subjects who reported meningoencephalitis received QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine. Deaths occurred during the follow-up period of the trial, however, with a similar incidence rate in the QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine group (1.7%, 95% CI 0.7-3.9%) and the placebo group (2.8%, 95% CI 0.8-9.6%). Of note, deaths in QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine group were caused by myocardial infarction, broken neck, progression of AD, or non-hemorrhagic cerebral infarct; whereas deaths in the placebo group were caused by neoplasm or cerebral hemorrhage. All Pfizer studies [43-46] reported on SAEs. The SAEs incidence rate observed in the QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine groups was similar across the four trials (Pfizer 17.7%, three out of four trials [43,44,46] showed that SAEs occurred with the similar 591 orhigher frequency in the placebo group (Pfizer CI 6.2-41.0%; Pfizer Pfizer 2014(a) trial [45] reported no SAEs in the placebo group (0%, 95% CI 0-48.9%). The most common SAEs across the four Pfizer studies were: confusion, hallucinations, syncope, urinary tract infection, cardiac arrest, chest pain and hypotension. The pooled data from two Pfizer 2014 trials [43,44] indicated one case of death in the QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine group (the cause was not further specified). No deaths occurred during Pfizer 2014(a) and 2015 trials [45,46].Systemic adverse events. The most frequent systemic AEs observed across the six studies include headache, fatigue, insomnia, pyrexia, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, anxiety and back pain. The results of the meta-analysis demonstrated that out of the nine systemic AEs selected for the analysis, only cases of diarrhea were significantly more frequent in non-healthy subjects receiving QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines than in those receiving placebo (pooled RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.04-6.24, p = 0.04) (Fig 2). Furthermore, although the pooled RRs did not reach statistical significance, a trend towards a higher incidence of headache was observed in the QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine group (pooled RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.93-2.97, p = 0.09). Aside from the systemic AEs included in the meta-analysis, other commonly reported systemic AEs (5% of participants) were vomiting, myalgia, asthenia, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, constipation, contusion and nasopharyngitis.Local adverse events. Regarding the local AEs, we were not able to retrieve dichotomous data from RCT reported by Gilman et al. [41] However, the authors mentioned that injection site reactions were reported in both QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine group and placebo group, and the reported cases tended to be more severe and of longer duration among subjects treated with QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine. Furthermore, Pfizer 2015 trial [46] was not included in the meta-analysis on local AEs due to the fact that the only reported local AEs were injection site hematoma (7.1%, 95% 0-15.5% in placebo group). 592 Figure 2 Meta-analysis of the reported systemic adverse events observed in non-healthy subjects receiving QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines or placebo 593 The meta-analysis showed that QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines caused significantly more cases of injection site pain (pooled RR 4.11, 95% CI 1.10-15.35, p = 0.04) than placebo (Fig 3). No statistically significant increase in the risk for injection site redness/erythema and injection site swelling was observed with the immunization with QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines. Figure 3 Meta-analysis of the reported local adverse events observed in non-healthy subjects receiving QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines or placebo Discontinuations due to AEs. Together with SAEs, systemic and local AEs, we were interested in the cases of discontinuations due to the AEs. Wald et al. [42] reported that two subjects (5.7%, 95% CI 1.6-18.6%) dropped out form the study due to AEs that occurred in a temporal relation with the QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine. One subject developed severe arthralgia, and another developed mild neck pain and neck vein distention. The number of subjects who discontinued treatment due to AEs could not be retrieved from the study of Gilman et al [41]. However, the authors stated that the AEs leading to treatment discontinuations were more frequent among the participants receiving QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine than those receiving placebo. The two Pfizer 2014 trials [43,44] resulted in 4 dropouts in QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine group (2.9%, 95% CI 1.2-7.3%) due to the AEs related to the study vaccine with no cases of discontinuation in the placebo group (0%, 95% CI 0-18.4%). Furthermore, other 4 subjects discontinued the treatment in QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine group due to the AEs unrelated to the study vaccine. The AEs that caused discontinuation were not specified. No withdrawals due to AEs were reported from the Pfizer 2014(a) trial [45]. In general, these three trials showed higher incidence of discontinuations in the QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine group compared to the placebo. Pfizer 2015 trial [46] resulted in one case of discontinuation due to the AEs in QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine group and no cases in the placebo group. However, the total incidence of dropouts in Pfizer 2015 trial was twice higher in placebo group (28.6%, 95% CI 13.8-49.9%) than in QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine group (14.3%, 95% CI 6.7-27.9%).594 ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccine versus placebo Serious adverse events. Studies of Anderson et al. [47] and Frazer et al. [48] reported no SAEs in ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccine recipients. The study from Sharp&Corp [49] detected SAEs in both treatment and control groups, and the observed SAEs included syncope, transient ischemic attack, squamous cell carcinoma of and (95% CI 10.7-33.2%) and 20% (95% CI 3.6-62.0%) of the recipients of the tested vaccine containing ISCOMATRIX and placebo, respectively. The same study reported a SAEs rate of 31.8% (95% CI 16.4-52.7%) in subjects who received only the antigen, and 0% (95% CI 0-22.8%) in those received only adjuvant (i.e. 16 g ISCOMATRIX).Systemic adverse events. The most commonly reported systemic AEs across the selected studies include headache, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, myalgia and insomnia. In general, the observed systemic AEs were mild to moderate in severity and lasted for 2-3 days. The proportion of subjects reporting systemic AEs was greater in the ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccine group than in the placebo group. The meta-analysis comparing the incidence of systemic AEs between the ISCOMATRIX adjuvanted vaccine group and placebo group showed no statistically significant differences in any selected for the analysis systemic AE (Fig 4). Furthermore, pooled RRs were generally lower for ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines than for vaccines containing QS-21.Local adverse events. The reported local AEs were usually associated with injection site pain, redness/erythema and swelling. Individual studies reported also other local AEs such as warmth, bruising, injection site hematoma and injection site pruritus. Trials of Anderson et al. [47] and Frazer et al. [48] specified that the proportion of subjects experiencing an injection site reaction (including pain, swelling, warmth, redness and bruising) or injection site pain was greater in the groups receiving ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines than in the group of subjects receiving placebo.In general, the observed local AEs were of mild to moderate intensity. The meta-analysis showed that there was no association between the exposure to the ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines and the incidence of local redness/erythema (pooled RR 1.87, 95% CI 0.76-4.61). However, the ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines significantly increased the likelihood of experiencing the injection site pain (pooled RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.41-4.59, p = 0.002) and swelling (pooled RR 3.43, 95% CI 1.08-10.97, p = 0.04) than placebo (Fig 5). Of note, the risk for injection site pain is approximately 1,6 times less for subjects receiving ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines compared to subjects receiving QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines (pooled RR 2.55 vs. pooled RR 4.11). In contrast, the risk for injection site swelling increases two-fold in subjects receiving ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines (pooled RR 3.43 vs. pooled RR 1.75). 595 Figure 4 Meta-analysis of the reported systemic adverse events observed in non-healthy subjects receiving ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines or placebo Discontinuations due to AEs. Anderson et al. [47] reported that no participants withdrew due to the AEs. Frazer et al. [48] reported that three women who received ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccine did not complete the treatment because of AEs (12.5%, 95% CI 4.3-31%). The AEs that caused discontinuation were not specified. Besides, no discontinuation in the placebo group (0%, 95% CI 0-35%) was reported from the same study. Sharp&Corp [49] reported that 15.2% (95% CI adjuvanted with ISCOMATRIX, 0% (95% CI 0-22.8%) subjects who g ISCOMATRIX alone and 0% (95% CI 0-43.4%) subjects who received placebo discontinued the study due to the AEs 596 (AEs not specified). Similar to what we observed from the QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine trials, more individuals in the ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccine group discontinued the treatment compared to the placebo group. Figure 5 Meta-analysis of the reported local adverse events observed in non-healthy subjects receiving ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines or placebo. Saponin-adjuvanted vaccine versus placebo In order to study the general effect of saponin adjuvantation on the safety and tolerability of tested vaccines, we performed meta-analysis on the reported AEs from all nine eligible studies. In the case of frequently reported systemic AEs, we were able to combine the dichotomous data on the number of non-healthy subjects experiencing headache, fatigue, insomnia, pyrexia, myalgia, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, anxiety and back pain after immunization with QS-21- or ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines (Fig 6). The meta-analysis showed that there was a trend towards a higher risk of systemic AEs in patients receiving saponin-adjuvanted vaccine compared to those receiving placebo, although the difference was not statistically significant (e.g. headache: pooled RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.95-1.93, p = 0.09; diarrhea: pooled RR 2.32, 95% CI 0.99-5.45, p = 0.05). When combining the data on the frequently reported local AEs from all selected trials, the performed meta-analysis confirmed that immunization of non-healthy subjects with saponin-adjuvanted vaccines increased the risk for injection site pain (pooled RR 2.76, 95% CI 1.61-4.73, p = 0.0002) and injection site swelling (pooled RR 2.62, 95% CI 1.07-6.45, p = 0.04), when compared to placebo (Fig 7). Furthermore, the results showed a trend towards an increased risk for injection site redness/erythema in patients receiving saponin-adjuvanted vaccine compared to those receiving placebo, although it was not statistically significant (pooled RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.95-2.17, p = 0.08). 597 Figure 6 Meta-analysis of the reported systemic adverse events observed in non-healthy subjects receiving saponin-adjuvanted vaccines or placebo 598 Figure 7 Meta-analysis of the local adverse events observed in non-healthy subjects receiving saponin- adjuvanted vaccines or placebo DISCUSSION The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the safety and tolerability of vaccines containing QS-21 and new saponin adjuvant formulations such as ISCOM and ISCOMATRIX. References were included if they reported on a RCT of vaccines with saponin adjuvants (QS-21, ISCOM, ISCOMATRIX, or Matrix-M) including a placebo control group and reporting information regarding safety and/or tolerability. The effect of saponin-adjuvantation was evaluated by the RR with 95% CI for systemic and local AEs. Reports on SAEs and the number of subjects who discontinued treatment due to the AEs were discussed descriptively. We identified three studies reported on ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines and six studies on vaccines adjuvanted with QS-21. All nine studies included adult (18 years) non-healthy subjects. Overall, we included in the meta-analysis 98 subjects receiving ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines, 510 subjects receiving QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines and 138 receiving placebo. Eight of the nine trials have a Jadad score of 3 or 4 indicating an adequate trial quality. SAEs were reported by five studies [41,43-46] on QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines and one study on vaccines adjuvanted with ISCOMATRIX (Sharp&Corp [49]). However, none of the observed SAEs were considered to be related to the use of the saponin adjuvants. The majority 599 of SAE cases described by Gilman et al. [41] were associated with encephalitis. The authors linked the addition of polysorbate-80 to the vaccine formulation with the occurrence of the SAEs. Polysorbate-80 is an emulsifier that helps to improve the product stability, and was previously shown to be involved in the development of the inflammatory reaction. According to Gilman et al. [41], the addition of polysorbate-80 may have caused a greater exposure of antigenic epitopes, which might lead to an inflammatory T-cell response. All reported cases of encephalitis occurred mainly in the antibody non-responders and are reviewed in detail by Orgogozo et al [53]. Of note, none of four Pfizer trials in subjects with Alzheimer's disease observed any cases of encephalitis. The SAEs reported by Sharp&Corp [49] were unlikely associated with the use of ISCOMATRIX as an adjuvant due to the fact that SAEs were not more frequent in the recipients of ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccine compared to those received placebo or the antigen alone. Based on the performed meta-analysis, none of the reported systemic AEs were significantly increased upon the administration of ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines. In the case of QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines, patients experienced significantly more cases of diarrhea compared to placebo. Most of the systemic AEs observed across the included studies were of mild to moderate intensity and of short duration. When we combined the systemic AEs from all the selected studies to evaluate the general effect of saponin adjuvantation on the safety and tolerability of the tested vaccines, we observed that none of the frequently reported systemic AEs were significantly increased upon the use of saponin-adjuvanted vaccines. In general, the relative risks of the reported systemic AEs from the pooled saponin studies are higher than those observed from the ISCOMATRIX-specific studies, but lower than those observed from the QS-21-specific studies. The performed meta-analysis further showed that both QS-21- and ISCOMATRIX- adjuvanted vaccines are associated with a higher risk for injection site pain, although the estimated risk is twice lower for ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines. On the other hand, the risk for injection site swelling is only increased upon the use of the vaccines containing ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines. Although the use of QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines also resulted in a trend towards a higher risk for injection site swelling, the risk was not statistically significant and was 1.6 times less when compared to ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines. When we pooled the data on reported local AEs from all selected trials, the meta-analysis confirmed that the use of saponin-adjuvanted vaccines significantly increased the likelihood of experiencing both injection site pain and swelling. This might provide a possible reason for the observation that generally more treatment discontinuations due to the AEs were reported from the saponin-adjuvanted vaccine recipients than control group. The safety and tolerability profile of QS-21- and ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines revealed by the performed meta-analysis in non-healthy subjects is similar to that observed in healthy volunteers. In healthy subjects, no vaccine related SAEs were observed receiving QS-21- or ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines [26,39,54,55]. However, these trials conducted in healthy subjects often reported higher incidence of systemic AEs in saponin-adjuvanted 5100 vaccine study group than in placebo or an active control group. The systemic AEs reported in healthy subjects were mild to moderate in intensity, self-limiting and of short duration. Local AEs observed in healthy volunteers included local pain, redness and induration. The injection site pain was often moderate to severe and was more frequently reported by QS-21-adjuvanted vaccine recipients than those receiving placebo [54,55]. The study of Waite et al. [40] further confirmed that the presence of QS-21 in the injected formulation is associated with the injection site pain. Interestingly, McKenzie et al. [39] stated that the incidence of local and systemic AEs using ISCOMATRIX vaccines is similar to that published for other adjuvanted vaccines (e.g., AS04, aluminum containing adjuvant). The selected RCTs aimed to assess not only the safety and tolerability of the study vaccines, but also the immunogenicity. To be able to determine the added immunogenicity value of an adjuvant, we need to compare the immune responses elicited by the adjuvanted study vaccines with non-adjuvanted vaccines (i.e. antigen-adjuvant vs. antigen alone). Only one out of three trials on ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines [49] and four out of six trials on QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines [42-45] included appropriate study groups. Moreover, the high heterogeneity in immune parameters reported by different trials, such as the immune factors analyzed (i.e. antibody responses or cellular immune responses), the assays performed (i.e. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT)), the units used (i.e. geometric mean titer or mean fold-increase of a specific antibody response) and the timeframe of the analysis restrains us from performing meta-analysis on the immunological benefit of saponin adjuvants. However, the immune boosting effect of saponin adjuvants can be confirmed by the data reported from five of the selected trials [42-45,49]. One should consider that the immunological benefit of the saponin adjuvants should be weighed against the potential risk of adverse events. The significant increase in the incidence of injection site pain and swelling upon the immunization with saponin-adjuvanted vaccines might prevent the use of such adjuvants in routine immunizations, especially in the case of prophylactic vaccines. The results of the meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the several limitations. To have direct information about the safety and tolerability of adjuvants, the adjuvanted test vaccines should be compared to an active control group (immunization with the antigen alone or antigen with licensed adjuvants). Although there were five eligible RCTs [42- 45,56,57] on QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines with an active control group (antigen alone), we identified only one eligible RCT on ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccine [49]. Due to the limitation, AEs reported from the saponin-adjuvant vaccine group were compared with those from the placebo group in our meta-analysis, which made the actual causes of AEs associated with the use of saponin-adjuvanted vaccines unidentifiable. In addition, the number of the included clinical trials meeting the inclusion criteria was limited. Furthermore, the number of subjects recruited to each of these trials was generally small, especially for the control groups. These contribute to the wide confidence intervals, and decrease the statistical power to detect statistically significant differences between the treatment groups. Due to the different 5101 settings of the trials included in the meta-analysis, we chose random-effects model for the meta-analysis, which further widens the confidence intervals. Last but not least, differences in the reporting method of observed AEs and the classification of AEs limit the possibility for including respectively more trials for the meta-analysis or perform meta-analysis on other reported AEs among the included studies. CONCLUSIONS No major safety concern was identified for both ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines and vaccines containing QS-21 based on the reported SAEs. Most AEs reported by non-healthy subjects in the nine selected trials were generally mild to moderate, self-limiting and of short duration. The performed meta-analysis showed that the use of QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines resulted in a statistically significant increase in the incidence of diarrhea when compared to placebo, while no systemic AEs were found to be associated with the use of ISCOMATRIXadjuvanted vaccines. Both QS-21- and ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines were associated with a higher incidence of injection site pain. The observed elevated risk for local pain was lower for the vaccines containing ISCOMATRIX. On the other hand, an increased incidence of injection site swelling was only observed from the use of ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines. Furthermore, the pooled analysis on ISCOMATRIX- and QS-21-adjuvanted vaccines further confirmed that subjects receiving a saponin-adjuvanted vaccine experienced significantly more injection site pain and swelling when compared to placebo. In addition, for both adjuvants the number of subjects who discontinued treatment was higher in the group of subjects receiving the adjuvanted vaccine than in the placebo group. Our results indicate that the use of ISCOMATRIX results in a better systemic tolerability profile when compared to the use of QS-21. However, no better local tolerance was observed for ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines in immunized non-healthy subjects. The relatively small number of published studies, however, limited our ability to calculate robust estimates for other AEs and to draw strong conclusions on the effects of QS-21- and ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted vaccines. Therefore, further studies are needed, particularly with properly defined and reported safety outcomes and including an active control group, to better evaluate the risks of saponin adjuvanted vaccines. 5102 REFERENCES 1.

Hak, B. Wilffert Vaccines . 2015; 3(2): 263-292114 ABSTRACT Obtaining approval for a multinational vaccine trial from an ethics committee and the national competent authority of different Member States of the European Union (EU) is challenging under clinical trial Directive 2001/20/EC because of the differences in the implementation of the directive in national laws of Member States. In this review the national differences in requirements for ethical and competent authority approval are illustrated. The national ethical and competent authority review procedures in Finland, Hungary, The Netherlands, Norway and Slovenia are described under the EU trial directive after discussing the provisions of the trial directive related to both review procedures. The review illustrates the differences between the countries in the documents that have to be submitted for the review procedures, the submission procedures and the language requirements of the documents, the organization of the ethics committees and the role of the competent authority in the approval procedure. 6115 INTRODUCTION Since 2001, the Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the European Council has been regulating the implementation of good clinical practice (GCP) in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use [1]. The aim of this directive is to harmonize the national procedures for the ethical approval of clinical trials in Member States of the European Union (EU) [1,2]. Despite the aim of the directive, there has been a severe decline in the number of clinical trials carried out in Europe over the past few years, which according to the European Commission is partly due to the trial directive [3,4]. The directive makes it difficult and expensive to carry out cross-border trials because of the legal form of the directive, since directives from the EU are not directly applicable to Member States [3,4]. Directives are only binding to the result that have to be achieved, which means that Member States have the freedom to choose the form and method to achieve the goal(s) set out in a directive. Therefore, directives are differently implemented in the national law of Member States [5-7]. Especially for multinational vaccine trials, such as the EU-funded FLUSECURE and UNISEC projects [8,9], it is a challenge to obtain ethical approval for a trial. These projects need a single opinion from each Member State that will participate in the trial (Article 7 Directive 2001/20/EC) while the procedures to obtain ethical approval differ among the participating Member States [1]. On 14 April 2014, the European Council approved a draft regulation on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use and for the repealing of Directive 2001/20/EC [4,10]. This regulation, which is expected to be in effect in 2016 after a start-up period of 2 years, is binding in its entirety and is directly applicable in the Member States [4-7,10,11]. This means that this type of legislation does not have to be translated or transformed by a Member State before the implementation in the national law. Although the new EU regulation aims to harmonize the national procedure for evaluating clinical trial applications, the ethical review process is still carried out by the concerned Member States. In addition, in case of multistate trials the concerned Member States still have the authority to approve or reject the opinion of the reference Member State [3]. In this review national differences in the requirements for ethical and competent authority approval for a multinational vaccine trial under the EU Directive 2001/20/EC will be illustrated. Therefore, provisions related to the ethical and competent authority review procedure of Directive 2001/20/EC will be described in more detail. The ethical and competent authority approval procedure for a Phase 2 vaccine trial in Finland, Hungary, The Netherlands, Norway and Slovenia will be described as an example, since trial sites in these countries are part of the clinical trial network of the FLUSECURE project [12]. DIRECTIVE 2001/20/EC On 1 May 2001 the EU published Directive 2001/20/EC \" on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human 6116 use\" [1]. The directive consists of specific provisions regarding the conduct of clinical trials, including multi-center trials, on human subjects involving medicinal products in the EU (Article 1 (1) Directive 2001/20/EC). Especially provisions relating to the implementation of GCP are included in the directive to provide assurance that the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects are protected (Article 1 (1,2) Directive 2001/20/EC). Therefore, the directive determines under which terms a clinical trial may be undertaken, e.g., that a clinical trial may only be initiated if the ethics committee has given a favorable opinion and in as much the competent authority of the Member State concerned has not informed the sponsor of any grounds of non-acceptance (Article 9 (1) Directive 2001/20/EC) [1]. The procedures to reach these decisions from the ethics committee and the competent authority may, depending on the sponsor of a trial, run in parallel or not [1]. In addition to the ethical and competent authority approval, other requirement needs to be fulfilled before a clinical trial may be initiated such as the informed consent procedure and that the rights of subjects, to privacy and the protection of data concerning to the subjects, are safeguarded (Article 3 (2) Directive 2001/20/EC) [1]. Ethical Review Before the start of a trial, an ethics committee has to give a favorable opinion (Article 9 (1) Directive 2001/20/EC). An ethics committee is according to the directive an independent body in a Member State, consisting of healthcare professionals and nonmedical members. They have the responsibility to protect the rights, safety and wellbeing of human subjects involved in a trial and to provide public assurance of that protection by for example expressing an opinion on the trial protocol (Article 2 (k) Directive 2001/20/EC) [1]. To obtain a favorable opinion for a vaccine trial of such a committee, an application has to be submitted before the start of the trial by the sponsor or the principal investigator. In case of multi-center trials, the sponsor or the coordinating investigator (the investigator who is responsible for the coordination of work of the principal investigator and the different trial sites) has to submit the application [13]. According to Article 6 (3) of the directive, an ethics committee should in particular consider specific aspects of an application for a clinical trial in order to establish a reasoned opinion, such as the relevance of the trial and the trial design, the protocol, the quality of the facilities, whether the evaluation of the anticipated benefits and risks is satisfactory and whether the conclusions are justified [1]. However, according to Article 6 (4) of the directive, Member States may decide that the competent authority shall be responsible for the consideration and giving of an opinion on the provisions for indemnity or compensation in the event of injury or death attributable to a trial (Article 6 (3)(h)), any insurance or indemnity to cover the liability of the investigator and sponsor (Article 6 (3)(i)) and the amounts and arrangements for rewarding or compensating investigators and trial subjects, and the relevant aspects of any agreement between the sponsor and the trial site (Article 6 (3)(j)) [1]. An ethics committee should have a maximum of 60 days from the day of receiving a valid (complete) application to give a reasoned opinion about the application to the applicant and the national competent authority (Article 6 (5) Directive 2001/20/EC) [1,13]. Within the time 6117 period of the consideration of an application for a favorable opinion, an ethics committee may send a single request for additional information to the applicant. When this is the case, there is a clock stop until the ethics committee has received the additional information (Article 6 (6) Directive 2001/20/EC). Only for trials involving medicinal products for gene therapy or somatic cell therapy or medicinal products containing genetically modified organisms ethics committees may have a longer time period to give a reasoned opinion about the application; 90 days which may be extended by a further 90 days. For trials including medicinal products for xenogenic cell therapy there is no time limit for an ethics committee to give a reasoned opinion (Article 6 (7) Directive 2001/20/EC) [1]. Competent Authority Besides the submission of a request for an opinion of an ethics committee, a valid request for authorization of a clinical trial has to be submitted to the competent authority of the Member State in which the sponsor plans to conduct the trial before the start of the trial (Article 9 (2) Directive 2001/20/EC) [1]. The reason for this is that a trial may only start if the competent authority has not informed the sponsor of any grounds of non-acceptance [1]. Based on a valid request for authorization, the consideration by the competent authority should take place as rapidly as possible with a maximum of 60 days (Article 9 (4) Directive 2001/20/EC) [1]. If the competent authority of a Member State notifies the sponsor of any ground of non-acceptance, the sponsor may amend the content of a request once only based on the grounds given for non-acceptance. If the competent authority still has grounds for non-acceptance, a trial may not start. However, if the competent authority has not communicated any grounds for non-acceptance to the applicant of the request for authorization the clinical trial may start [1,14]. Nevertheless, for trials with specific medicinal products, written authorization is required prior to the start of the trial. These are clinical trials involving medicinal products for gene therapy, somatic cell therapy including xenogenic cell therapy and all medicinal products containing genetically modified organisms (Article 9 (6) Directive 2001/20/EC) [1,14]. For the consideration of a request of a clinical trial involving these types of products, the competent authority has the same extended time period as ethics committees for the consideration (Article 9 (5) Directive 2001/20/EC) [1]. A Member State may also decide that written authorization is necessary before starting a trial involving medicinal products which do not have a marketing authorization and are referred to in part A of the annex to regulation number 2309/93 of the European Commission [1,14]. These are medicinal products developed by recombinant DNA technology, controlled expression of genes coding for biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes including transformed mammalian cells, or hybridoma and monoclonal antibody methods [15]. Also for other medicinal products with special characteristics it may be decided that written authorization is necessary, such as for medicinal products where the active ingredient or active ingredients is or are a biological product or biological products of human or animal origin (Article 9 (5) Directive 2001/20/EC) [1,14]. 6118 ETHICAL APPROV AL AND COMPETENT AUTHORITY AUTHORIZATION OF A V ACCINE TRIAL IN DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES Since a directive is not directly applicable in all Member States but is binding to the result that has to be achieved, directives are being implemented differently by national authorities of Member States [5-7]. In the EU Member States Finland, Hungary, The Netherlands and Slovenia Directive 2001/20/EC has been implemented in the national law [16-19]. Norway is not a Member State of the EU, however Norway has a lot of agreements with the EU, e.g., it has joined the European Economic Area (EEA) [20-22]. Through the many agreements and other forms of cooperation, Norway has complied with several EU legislations without participating in the process of making the legislative act [23-25]. Norway has therefore also fully implemented Directive 2001/20/EC in the Norwegian \"Regulation relating to clinical trials on medicinal products for human use\" [26,27]. Among the Member States, including Norway, there are differences in the overall review procedure of clinical trials such as the organization of the ethics committees and the competent authority, prerequisites before applying for an ethical opinion, the documentation that has to be submitted for ethical and competent authority approval and the submission procedure of the required documents (Table 1).

In Finland, there are multiple ethics committees and institutions working in the field of medical research ethics [28,29]. At the national level the National Committee on Medical Research Ethics (TUKIJA) is an expert on research ethics, and it evaluates all proposals for clinical trials on medicinal drugs unless it delegated this task to a regional ethics committee [28,30-33]. The Finnish regional ethics committees are set up by the board of a hospital district with a university providing medical education in its region (Section 16 \"Medical Research Act\") [28,29,34].6120 In Norway the ethics committees for research ethics are also organized at the national and regional levels [35,36]. In contrast with Finland, the regional ethics committees evaluate all concrete medical research projects and have to give approval for medical and health research projects. Norway has seven regional committees for medical research ethics, the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC), which are divided based on the geography of Norway [35-39]. The ethics committee at the national level, the National Committee for Medicinal and Health Research ethics (NEM), is an advisory and appealing body for these seven regional ethics committees and therefore does not evaluate proposals for clinical trials as is the case in Finland [35-38]. The national ethics committees from Hungary and Slovenia review all clinical trial proposals involving medicinal products [19,40,41]. The national ethics committee in Hungary is the Clinical Pharmacology Ethics Committee, in Hungarian known as Klinikai Farmakol\u00f3giai Etikai Bizotts\u00e1g (KFEB) [17,40,42,43]. The KFEB is one of the national research ethics committees that are part of the Hungarian Health Science Council, which is an advisory board of the Minister of Health [40,44,45]. In Slovenia the National Medical Ethics Committee (NMEC) at the Ministry of Health, which is in Slovene known as Komisija Republike Slovenije za medicinsko etiko, is the ethics committee that gives its opinion about a clinical trial [19,41,46]. The ethics committee that has to give a favorable opinion before a scientific research can be conducted in The Netherlands is according to the \" Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act\" (in Dutch known as \" Wet medisch-wetenschappelijk onderzoek met mensen \" (WMO)), an accredited medical research committee (MREC) or the Central Commission Research Involving Human Subjects (in Dutch known as the Centrale Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek (CCMO)) [47-51]. In the Netherlands there are nowadays 24 MRECs, most of them are connected to an academic center or a hospital, which have been accredited by the CCMO [47,52]. Article 2 of the WMO determines in which cases the CCMO has to give a favorable opinion about a scientific research, such as non-therapeutic research involving minors or incapacitated adults (Article 2 (2)(b)(2) and 4 (1) WMO) and scientific research where the assessment by the central commission is desired considering social, legal and ethical aspects of a scientific research (Article 2 (2)(b)(4) WMO) [47,53]. In the decision \" Besluit centrale beoordeling medisch-wetenschappelijk onderzoek met mensen\" (in Dutch), scientific research covered by Article 2 (2)(b)(4) WMO are described [54]. According to Article 1 (e) of this decision scientific research aimed at the development of a vaccine has to be assessed by the CCMO [54]. Only in Finland and Hungary institutional ethics committees play a role in the ethical approval procedure of medical research. The Finnish institutional research ethics committees, which are installed at research institutions, have to give approval for research, which is not covered by the Finnish \" Medical Research Act \" [28,29]. This act applies to all medical research that is defined in Section 2 (1) as research involving intervention in the integrity of a person, human embryo or human fetus for the purpose of increasing knowledge of health, causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease or the nature of diseases in general 6121 [34]. Besides, the institution ethics board of the institution that will conduct the trial has to be notified about the trial. Also in Hungary, the Institutional Ethics Committee (IKEB) has to be informed about the admission of a trial by the head of the health institution where the trial will be conducted [17]. The Hungarian IKEBs are installed at each health care institution where research involving human subjects is carried out [40]. In Slovenia there are also a number of regional/local ethics committees at university and regional hospitals, however these ethics committees may not give an independent ethical approval for research projects that have to be reviewed by NMEC [46,55]. Prerequisites before Applying for an Ethical Opinion Both Finland and Hungary have prerequisites that a sponsor should fulfill before applying for an ethical opinion. The sponsor of a trial should respectively send a notification to TUKIJA or should inform the head of the health care institution conducting the trial [17,31-33]. Based on Section 2 (1) of the Finnish \" Decree of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health on Clinical Drug Trials \" TUKIJA may decide on delegating the handling of a clinical drug trial to a regional ethics committee even before the actual request for an opinion is made [31]. For TUKIJA to be able to make this decision, a prior notification about the clinical trial shall be made to TUKIJA, which is also called a ruling for jurisdiction [31,32]. This prior notification can be applied by the sponsor as soon as it becomes likely that the clinical trial will run in Finland, even if the actual application is not yet complete [33]. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health has developed a form for the prior notification, the form \"Prior notification of a clinical drug trial\" (only available in Finnish), that has to be used by the applicant (Section 2.2 Decree on Clinical Drug Trials) [31,33,56]. The completed form needs to be sent by e-mail and mail to TUKIJA, after which TUKIJA will decide if one of the regional ethics committees or TUKIJA will carry out the ethical review of that clinical trial [33]. In Hungary there are some prerequisites before applying for an ethical opinion and authorization [17]. The sponsor of a trial should first submit the Hungarian summary of the protocol to the head of the health care institution conducting the trial. Based on the summary, the head of the health institution should decide whether it accepts the trial in question at the institution in advance for the presence of a future permit form the competent authority. If the head of the health institution admits a trial, the head declares that the health institution is in the possession of all material and personal conditions required for the trial [17]. The form in Annex 1 of Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.) \" on the clinical trial and application of correct clinical practices of investigational medicinal products intended for human use \", in which Directive 2001/20/EC has been fully implemented, of the Hungarian Minister of Health can be used for the statement of the head [17,40,57]. If the head admits the clinical trial, the head should inform the competent IKEB on admission of the trial [17]. When the head of the health institution admits the clinical trial, a contract between the health institution and the sponsor of the trial may be concluded [17]. However, this contract is only valid if the clinical trial is officially authorized by the national competent authority (Paragraphs 12-14, Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.)) [17]. 6122 Documents to Be Sent for an Application for a Favorable Opinion In February 2006 the European Commission published a detailed guidance, based on Article 8 of Directive 2001/20/EC, with the format of the application and the documentation that has to be submitted in an application for a favorable opinion of an ethics committee [1,13]. This guidance, the \" Detailed guidance on the application format and documentation to be submitted in an application for an Ethics Committee opinion on the clinical trial on medicinal products for human use \", is drawn up in consultation with the Member States and interested parties [1,13]. The guidance is not legally binding; it is aimed to ensure consistent application of the directive. According to this guidance, an application to an ethics committee is valid if all required documents are complete. However, this may differ per Member State of the EU because some Member States ask for specific information [13]. Supplementary Materials Table S1 gives an overview of documents that have to be submitted to the different Member States included in this review based on this detailed guidance and the national provisions of Member States about the ethical submission procedure. Documents to Be Submitted to the Ethics Committees in Almost Every Member State Based on the detailed guidance of the Ethics Committee, and the national provisions of the Member States, the following documents have to be submitted to an ethics committee in almost every Member State: A signed cover letter, which according to the detailed guidance should include the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT) number, the sponsor protocol number and the title of the trial [13,58]. The cover letter should draw attention to any special issues in the clinical trial such as a special trial population or an unusual trial design. The letter should also specify for each investigational medicinal product (IMP) the reference document(s) chosen by the sponsor to identify the unexpectedness of a serious adverse reaction and should draw attention to any scientific advice or opinion related to the trial or IMP given by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or concerned Member State or the competent authority or ethics committee of any other country [13]. A n application form signed by the sponsor or the sponsor's legal representative and/or the coordination investigator [13]. This can be a filled in EU-wide clinical application form (EudraCT application form) or a national or local ethics committee application form [13,59]. For Hungary, The Netherlands and Norway the EU-wide clinical trial application form has to be submitted to the ethics committee [13,17,38,59-62]. In The Netherlands a national application form (the general assessment and registration (ABR) form) has to be submitted as well, which include questions about the scientific research such as information about the sponsor, the relevance of the scientific research, the risks and benefits of the research and a summary of the research in Dutch and English [63-65]. The summary has to be submitted in Dutch and English because both will be published in the CCMO trial register, a public register with all trials, which are registered to run in The Netherlands or carried out by Dutch investigators [64,66]. For the submission for a favorable opinion in Finland, applicants should use the form 6123 \"Request for opinion on a clinical drug tria l\" (Section 3 (1) Decree on Clinical Drug Trials) from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health (not available in English) [31-33]. Th e clinical trial protocol that describes the objective(s), design, methodology, statistical considerations and organization of the trial (Article 2 (h) Directive 2001/20/EC) [1,13]. The protocol must comply with Chapter 6 of the guidance on GCP (CPMP/ICH/135/95) of the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use (ICH) and should include [13,67];- Th e title of the trial - Th e sponsor's protocol code number - Th e number and date of the version that will be updated - A si gnature of the sponsor and the coordinating investigator - A ll currently authorized amendments - A d efinition of the end of the trial - Th e evaluation of the anticipated benefits and risks - A j ustification of the selection of trial subjects, especially when including subjects who are incapable of giving informed consent or other special populations - A description of the recruitment and informed consent procedures, especially when subjects who are (temporarily or permanently) incapable of giving informed consent are included or when a procedure with witnesses consent is to be used - A description of the plan for the provision of any additional care of the subjects once their participation has ended, where it differs from what is normally expected according to the subject's medical condition The Hungarian, Norwegian and Slovenian national laws include specific additional information that should be included in the protocol. According to the Hungarian Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.) the protocol should also include the summary of the protocol in the national language, a peer review of the scientific value of the trial (if available), the exact age of the human subjects and the permission of the director of the hospital [13,17,42]. Also in Slovenia, a summary of the protocol in the national language and the outcome of the peer review of the scientific value of the trial have to be included in the protocol [68]. According to Slovenian \" guideline for researches submitting their projects for ethical review \", the protocol should also include the aim and scientific rationale, supported by a review of recent literature, and the proposer's own perception of ethical issues involved in the trial [68]. For the protocol to be submitted for a favorable opinion in Norway, the protocol should include a description of research biobanks that are established in connection with the collection, storage and use of human biological material as part of the research project (Paragraph 25 \" Act on medical and health research \" (Act 20/2008)) [62,69]. S ummary of the protocol in the national language of the Member State [13].6124 I nformation on the IMP in an investigator's brochure which should consist of all clinical and non-clinical data on the IMP or other products which are relevant to the study of the product or products in human subjects (Article 2 (g) Directive 2001/20/EC) [1,13]. According to the description of the standard research file, which have to be submitted to the Dutch ethics committee, the IMP needs to comply with the provisions in Chapter 7 of the GCP guideline (CPMP/ICH/135/95) [61,67]. Only in Slovenia, the investigator's brochure does not have to be submitted to the ethics committee based on the \" guideline for researchers submitting their projects for ethical review \" [17,33,61,62,68]. Th e arrangements for recruitment of subjects which should include a detailed description of the procedure for enrolment of human subjects, the reasons for the selection of the human subject group and copies of the material that will be used for the recruitment of subjects [13]. In all Member States the arrangements for recruitment of subjects has to be included in the application. However, the description of the arrangement is defined differently among the Member States. For example, for The Netherlands and Norway the application should include the recruitment material that will be used for the recruitment of subjects, whereas Finland defines it as the information on the detailed procedures to be used for the selection of subject [33,61,62]. Th e subject information leaflet which consist of all information that will be provided to the subject before their decision to participate in a clinical trial in a language the subjects knows [13]. According to the detailed guidance on Ethics Committees, the information should comply with the elements described under 4.8 in the GCP guideline (CPMP/ICH/135/95) [13,67]. For the submission to the ethics committees in the different Member States, the leaflet should be in the national language of the Member State or according to the Hungarian decree 35/2005 in the mother tongue of the individual or in another language identified by the individual as spoken by him or her [17,33,61-63,68,70]. F orm for written consent that should contain at least the consent to participate in the trial, the consent to make confidential personal information available and the consent to archive coded information [13]. This form should also be submitted in the national language of the Member States [17,33,61-63,68,70]. The Slovenian \" guideline for researchers submitting their projects for ethical review \" specifies that a separate consent has to be given if biological samples will be collected and part of the material is to be stored for possible future use [68]. A d escription of the measures taken to safeguard the subject's privacy and protection of personal data [13]. Only according to the operating procedure of TUKIJA and the Slovenian \"guideline for researchers submitting their projects for ethical review \" this description has to be submitted to the ethics committee [33,68]. Based on the operating procedure of TUKIJA, a description of the personal data file has to be submitted since this is required based on Section 10 of the \" Finnish Personal Data Act \" (No. 523/1999) [33]. The section of this act determines that the person for whom a personal file is set up and who can determine the use of the file (the data controller), shall draw up a description of the personal data file [71]. This description should contain the name and address of the data controller, the purpose 6125 of processing personal data, a description of the group of data subjects and data groups, the regular destinations of the data, whether the data are transferred to countries outside the EU or the EEA and a description of the principles in accordance to which the data file is secured [71]. For the application for a favorable opinion of the NMEC in Slovenia, a description of the arrangements for confidentiality of personal data and the right to privacy, as well as a description whether the human subjects that participate in the trial will have access to the results on their health and the general outcome, should be included [68]. C urriculum vitae and/or other relevant documents of the principal investigator to determine the qualification of the principal investigator [13]. According to the detailed guidance on Ethics Committees, a description of any previous training in the principles of GCP or experience obtained from work with clinical trials and patient care should be described [13]. For the application to the ethics committee in Hungary, The Netherlands and Norway the curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) should be submitted [17,61,62]. Whereas for Finland and Slovenia no curriculum vitae of the principal investigator has to be submitted [33,68]. In Finland a statement on the aptitude of the researches in charge of the proposed trial and the investigators based on other trial sites should be included [33]. For Slovenia a statement of the head of the institution must be included that states that the responsible researchers are capable of recognizing dangerous adverse events and take appropriate care of any clinical contingency [68]. A d escription of facilities of the trial so that an ethics committee can give an opinion on the quality of the facilities [13]. For the application to the ethics committee in Finland a statement by the researcher in charge of the proposed trial regarding the quality of the trial facilities and the available equipment has to be included [33]. The submission for The Netherlands should include a statement on the feasibility of the research in a Dutch (investigation) center from the head of the department or the healthcare group manager, and in Hungary a description of the trial facilities has to be submitted, along with information on the supporting staff [17,61]. I n Finland, The Netherlands, Norway and Slovenia a description of the provisions for indemnity or compensation in case of injury or death of trial subjects should be submitted to the ethics committee [13,33,61,62,68]. In Slovenia and The Netherlands, information about the compensation and insurance in case of injury or death, respectively, should be submitted [61,68]. For The Netherlands this should be the insurance certificate for WMO research [60,61]. For Finland the insurance should cover for potential subjects in cases where patients insurance and pharmaceutical injuries insurance do not cover the trial, and in Norway the manufacture or the principal investigator should be a member of the Norwegian Drug Insurance Association [27,33,72,73]. Only the Hungarian national provisions do not include that a specific description of the provisions of indemnity or compensation in case of injury or death of trial subjects has to be submitted [17].6126 A d escription of any insurance or indemnity to cover the liability of the sponsor and the investigator has to be submitted to the ethics committees in Hungary, The Netherlands and Slovenia [13,17,60,61,68]. For the application for a favorable opinion in The Netherlands, proof of coverage of the liability of the investigator or the sponsor has to be submitted and in Slovenia information about the insurance policy [60,61,68]. For the application to an ethics committee in Hungary, any insurance or indemnity to cover the liability of only the sponsor should be submitted [17]. According to Section 3 (5) of the \" act on Medicinal Products for Human Use and on the Amendment of Other Regulations Related to Medicinal Products \" (Act XVC/2005) the sponsor should obtain sufficient liability insurance that covers any damages that may occur in connection with the clinical trial from an insurance company that is establish or has a branch in a Member State of the EEA [74]. Only in Norway the conformation of a signed insurance has to be submitted to the competent authority [1,26]. In Finland the description of any insurance or indemnity to cover the liability of the sponsor and the investigator is not included in the list of required documents to be submitted to an ethics committee in the operating procedure of TUKIJA nor in the list of required documents to be submitted to the competent authority which is included in the administrative regulation of the competent authority [33,75]. I n all Member States information about the financial arrangements between the sponsor and the subjects and/or investigators in the trial has to be submitted to the ethics committees [13,17,33,60-62,68]. For Finland the trial fees and remuneration have to be included, in Slovenia the information about the compensation/financial award to the investigators and the supporting staff, and in Hungary information about the compensation of the trials subjects [17,33,68]. In Hungry the cost of the clinical trial also has to be provided including the division of costs between the hospital and the investigator [17]. For the submission of a request to the ethics committee in The Netherlands, information about the financial compensation for the human subjects, the investigators and participating centers, such as the contract between the sponsor, the investigator and the participating center, only has to be provided if the information on the ABR-form is not sufficient [60,61]. Also in Norway a description of the compensation of the institution, any fees paid to patients and/or researchers and the compensation of participants should be included in the application [62]. Specific Required Documents for a Valid Request for Ethical Approval in the Different Member States The different Member States request specific additional information besides the documents that have to be submitted to almost every Member State (Supplementary Materials Table S1). For example in Finland, Hungary and Slovenia, a statement by the principal investigator and/or the head of the institution where the study is to be conducted has to be submitted regarding the conformity of the trial to research ethics [17,33,68]. However, the content of such statement differs among the Member States. In Finland this statement regarding the conformity of the trial with research ethics should especially focus on the appropriateness of the trial's aims and 6127 planning and the evaluation of the risk and benefits [33]. While for Hungary a letter of intent by the principal investigator should be enclosed in which the investigator agrees to execute the protocol in compliance with GCP principles, the stipulations of the national competent authority decision and the opinion of KFEB in collaboration with the competent IKEB of the investigation location [17]. Whereas for Slovenia a statement of the head of the institution or department where the study is to be conducted has to be included along with a statement of the principal investigator. In these statements the head and the principal investigator need to declare to adhere to the principles of the declaration of Helsinki, the Oviedo Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and the Slovene Code of Medical Deontology [68]. Especially for the application for a favorable opinion to an ethics committee in The Netherlands and Hungary additional information is required. Here the documents that have to be sent to the ethics committee are the same as those that have to be sent to the competent authority based on Article 2 \" Regeling wetenschappelijk onderzoek met geneesmiddelen \" and Paragraph 13 (1,4) of Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.), respectively [17,60]. For example, in both Member States a copy of the importer authorization and examples of the labels in the national language have to be submitted to the ethics committee [17,61]. However, the additional information that has to be submitted to Hungary and The Netherlands is not identical. In Hungary an application should for example also include an analytical certificate of the IMP and, if applicable, a Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) certificate, which is needed for products of specific animal species, such as sheep and goats [17,76,77]. Products of these animal species need to comply with the provisions in the \" Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risks of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy via Medicinal Products \" from the European Commission because TSE may cause diseases in animals, like BSE, and human subjects, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease [76,77]. Also for The Netherlands specific information has to be submitted such as a trading license if the IMPs are stored and are not intended for immediate use in a clinical research organization. The reason for this is that only persons with this license may store IMPs [61]. The standard research file should also include the composition and charter of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) [61]. According to the \"Guideline on Data Monitoring Committees \" of the EMA, the sponsor of a clinical trial should, in the planning phase of a trial, assess the need of a DSMB based on the study population, study endpoint(s), the indication, duration of the trial and the available knowledge about a medicinal product [78]. This guideline also mentions situations in which a DSMB might be necessary, such as a trial in life-threatening diseases, and situations where a DSMB might not add or does not add much to a research, such as clinical trials than can be performed in a short time frame [78]. If a DSMB will be installed, the composition of the DSMB needs to be provided in the standard research file along with a signed charter, which consists of information about the DSMB such as the role and the responsibilities of the DSMB and the organization of the DSMB meetings [61,79]. 6128 Submission Procedure of the Application for a Favorable Opinion to the Ethics Committees The submission procedure of the documentation that is required for an ethics committee to make a decision about a clinical trial differs among the Member States. In both Finland and Slovenia the required documents have to be sent by mail to the national ethics committees [33,68]. If one of the Finnish regional ethics committees is the ethics committee that has to give an opinion, the submission procedure should be checked on the website of the specific regional ethics committee. In The Netherlands the submission procedure of a vaccine trial to the CCMO should preferably be done digitally on a CD-ROM [80]. However, the cover letter and the EudraCT application form should be signed by the applicant and provided on paper [63,80]. Also for Hungary the documents should be provided on a CD-ROM. An application for a vaccine trial needs to be sent by the sponsor in three copies on a CD-ROM to the national competent authority of Hungary, Orsz\u00e1gos (OGYI) (Paragraph 13 (1,4) Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.) One of the copies will be sent to KFEB and one to the National Epidemiological Centre, in Hungarian known as Orsz\u00e1gos Epidemiol\u00f3giai K\u00f6zpont (OEK) [17,42,81]. The OEK has an advisory function on biological products, such as vaccines, and is, according to Paragraph 13 (4) of Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.), a specialist authority, which will assist OGYI in the assessment of the application for an official authorization of a clinical trial [17,81]. The application for a prior approval to a REC in Norway needs to be electronically submitted via the national web-portal at the website of the RECs [82]. Based on the information on this web-portal (which only can be accessed after creating a user account on the REC's website), the person who needs to create and submit the application form for the prior approval is the chief investigator [62]. For clinical trials, the principal investigator in Norway has to be the chief investigator. The chief investigator may give permission to others to complete the application as a co-user, nevertheless the chief investigator is the person that has to submit the application. Information that needs to be filled in on the application form consists of general information about the trial, such as the Norwegian title of the trial and the institution responsible for the research, and more specific information, such as a project description, the research method and the insurance for research for human subjects [62]. As soon as the chief investigator has submitted the application form via the web-portal, the portal will allocate the review to one of the seven RECs. In general, a project will be transferred to a REC in the region of origin of a research project [82]. Consideration of a Request for Ethical Approval by the Ethics Committees The ethics committees in the different Member States will consider certain aspects of a request for ethical approval. These aspects, which are described in the national legislations of Finland, Hungary, The Netherlands and Norway, comply mostly with the aspects described in Article 6 (3) of Directive 2001/20/EC [1,17,27,34,47]. Only the ethics committee in Finland does not give an opinion about any insurance or indemnity to cover the liability of the investigator and the sponsor (Article 6 (3)(i) Directive 2001/20/EC) based on Section 10d of the Finnish \"Medical 6129 Research Act \" and the ethics committee in Hungary does not give an opinion about the provision for indemnity or compensation in the event of injury or death attributable to a clinical trial based on Paragraph 17 (2) of Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.) [17,34]. The ethics committee in Hungary should also consider certain aspects, which are not included in Article 6 (3) of Directive 2001/20/EC such as the justification of the application of a placebo group [1,17]. For Slovenia it is possible that the aspects to be considered by an ethics committee are described in a specific national law, however all national legislative acts of Slovenia are only available in Slovene and not in another language [83,84]. All Member States comply with Article 6 (5) of Directive 2001/20/EC which determines that an ethics committee should have a maximum of 60 days from the date of receipt of a valid application for a favorable opinion to give its reasoned opinion [1,17,19,27,34,47]. In all Member States, except for Hungary, the ethics committee that has to give an opinion should, according to the national legislations, give its opinion to the applicant within 60 days from the day of receiving a valid request [17,19,27,34,42,47]. Section 10d of the Finnish \" Medical Research Act \" and Section 3.3 of the Norwegian \"Regulation relating to clinical trials on medicinal products for human use\" also specify that within this time period the ethics committee should submit the ethical opinion to the national competent authority [27,34]. However, in the national legislative act of The Netherlands and the Slovenian \" Medicinal Products Acts \", which could be found in an unofficial consolidated text in English, it is not specified that the ethics committee also has to submit its opinion to the national competent authority [19,47,85]. Only in Hungary does the ethics committee have a time period shorter than 60 days to give a reasoned opinion. The KFEB, which receives one of the three copies of an application from OGYI, will send its professional-ethical opinion within 42 days to OGYI from the day of receiving the application from OGYI (paragraph 17 (1,5,7) decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.) [17,42]. Competent Authorities In all Member States the national competent authority has to authorize a trial before the start of the trial (Article 9 (2) Directive 2001/20/EC) [1,17,19,27,47,86]. In Finland, Hungary, Norway and Slovenia there is one national competent authority involved in the authorization of clinical trials, receptively the Finnish Medicines Agency (Fimea) [34,86], OGYI [17,42], the Norwegian Medicines Agency (NOMA) which is in Norway known as Statens legmiddelverk [27,87], and the Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices of the Republic of Slovenia which is in Slovenia known as Netherlands the CCMO or the Minister of Health Welfare and Sport is the competent authority that has to authorize a trial. If a MREC is the commission that has to give a favorable opinion about a scientific research with medicinal products, the CCMO is the competent authority. When the CCMO has to give an opinion, such as for vaccine trials, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport is the competent authority (article 13i (1,5) WMO) [47].6130 Documents to Be Sent for Competent Authority Approval To be able to authorize a clinical trial, a valid request for authorization of a clinical trial has to be submitted to the competent authority. For the request for authorization the European Commission has also developed a detailed guidance drawn up in consultation with the Member States. This guidance, \" Detailed guidance on the request to the competent authorities of a clinical trial on a medicinal product for human use, the notification of substantial amendments and the declaration of the end of the trial (CT-1) \", is drawn up based on Article 9 (1) of Directive 2001/20/EC [1,59]. The guidance describes the format and content of the request to the competent authority and which documentation should be included in the request [1,59]. Supplementary Materials Table S2 gives an overview of the documents that have to be submitted to the competent authorities of Finland, Hungary, The Netherlands, Norway and Slovenia for a request for authorization based on this detailed guidance and the national legislations of the Member States. Documents to Be Submitted to the Competent Authority in Almost Every Member State For the request for authorization by the national competent authority in the different Member States, the following documents have to be submitted in almost every Member State; A signed cover letter by the applicant, which, according to the detailed guidance CT-1, should, as with the ethics committee, include the EudraCT number, the sponsor protocol number and title of the trial and should draw attention to any special issues of the trial [13,59]. The cover letter for the application to the competent authority in Finland should also include the name of the person responsible for the trial in Finland [75]. Since, according to the \" Finnish Medicines Agency Administrative Regulation Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products \" (2/2012), a foreign sponsor must have a representative in Finland who is responsible for communication with the Fimea [75]. The cover letter which has to be submitted to the Slovenian competent authority, JAZMP, should be in Slovenian according to article 20(2) of the \" Rules on clinical trials on medicinal products \" [90,91]. A fi lled in and signed EU-wide clinical application form (EudraCT form) [59]. Th e signed protocol of the clinical trial that should according to detailed guidance CT-1 comply with the content and format described in Chapter 6 of the GCP guideline (CPMP/ICH/135/95). A p rotocol for a multicenter trial should be signed by the sponsor and the overall coordinating investigator (2.5.52. Detailed guidance CT-1) and should in particular include [59]: - Th e title of the trial - Th e sponsor protocol number specific for all versions - Th e date and number of the version that will be updated when it is amended, and a short title or name assigned to it - A c lear and unambiguous definition of the end of the trial - A d escription of the plan for the provision of any additional care for the trial participants once their participation in the trial has ended, where it differs from what is normally expected according to the medical condition of the clinical trial participant6131 - A c lear address to all sub-studies conducted at all trial sites or only a specific site - A d iscussion of the relevance of the clinical trial and its design - A n evaluation of the anticipated benefits and risks - A justification for including participants who are incapable of giving informed consent or other special populations such as minors - A d etailed description of the recruitment and informed consent procedure, especially when participants are incapable of giving informed consent - A n identification of adverse events or laboratory anomalies critical to safety evaluations - A s ynopsis of the protocol These aspects correspond mostly with the aspects, which in particular should be included in the protocol for the request of a favorable opinion of an ethics committee [1,59]. Only the discussion of the relevance of the clinical trial and its design, addressing sub-studies conducted at all trial sites or only a specific site, the identification of adverse events or laboratory anomalies critical to safety evaluation, and a synopsis of the protocol are not stated in the detailed guidance on Ethics Committees [1,59]. For the submission of the protocol to the Fimea, the protocol also has to be signed by the person who is responsible for the clinical trial in Finland. Chapter 8 of the regulation of the Fimea summarizes which specific information should be included in the trial protocol, such as the purpose of the investigation and a description of patients [75]. Th e investigator's brochure [59]. Based on the detailed guidance on competent authorities, an IMP dossier (IMPD) or non-investigational medicinal product (NIMP) dossier has to be submitted [59]. Where an IMP is a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial including products already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled in a way different from the authorized form, for an unauthorized indication, or used to gain further information about the authorization form (Article 2 (d) Directive 2001/20/EC) [1]. For example vaccines tested in trials, which are intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the vaccines [1,92]. Therefore, for all Member States an IMPD has to be submitted to the national competent authority for the authorization of a vaccine trial [17,26,61,75,91]. An IMPD should give information about the quality of the IMP, such as the chemical and pharmaceutical quality, manufacturing and control of the product, non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology data, and clinical trials and human experience data [59]. A c opy of the opinion of the ethics committee of the Member State concerned has to be submitted to the competent authority in Hungary, Norway and Slovenia [17,26,59,91]. According to the detailed guidance CT-1, a copy of the opinion of the ethics committee has to be submitted as soon as it is available, unless the ethics committee informs the applicant that is has copied its opinion to the national competent authority of the Member State [59]. In The Netherlands a copy of the assessment of the ethics committees or competent authorities from other Member States of the EU has to be included in the standard research file [61]. Only for Finland it is not specified in the national regulation about the application to the competent authority that a copy of the ethics committee that has to give an opinion about a trial has to be submitted to the competent authority [75].6132 Th e content of the labeling of the IMP which should be in the official language(s) of the Member State according to Article 14 of Directive 2001/20/EC [1,59]. For all Member States, except for Finland, it is included in the national information about the request for authorization that examples of the labels have to be submitted in the national language [17,26,61,75,91]. The Netherlands, Norway and Slovenia specify that the labels should comply with the requirements in Annex 13, under Point 16, of the directive \" laying down the principles and guidelines of good manufacturing practice in respect of medicinal products for human use and investigational medicinal products for human use \" of the European Commission (Directive 2003/94/EC [26,61,91,93,94]. Th e subject information leaflet. This leaflet is not included in the detailed guidance CT-1 but has to be submitted to the competent authorities in Finland, Hungary, The Netherlands and Slovenia based on respectively the regulation of the Fimea [75], decree 35/2005 [17], the explanatory notes on the standard research file [61], and the Slovenian \" Rules on clinical trials on medicinal products \" [90,91]. Th e informed consent form, which is also not included in the detailed guidance CT-1 but in the national information of Finland, Hungary, The Netherlands and Slovenia [17,59,61,75,91]. F or the submission to the competent authorities in Hungary, The Netherlands and Slovenia a summary of the protocol in the national language needs to be included [42,63-65,91]. In Hungary, this summary has to be included in the protocol [42], in The Netherlands with the ABR-from [63-65], and for Slovenia five copies of the summary of the trial have to be submitted to the competent authority in Slovenian language [91]. Additional Required Documents for a Request for Competent Authority Approval According to the detailed guidance on competent authorities, additional documents have to be submitted besides the cover letter, application form, protocol, investigator's brochure and the IMPD, such as the copy of the opinion of the ethics committee of the Member State concerned and the content of the labeling. The detailed guidance also includes other additional documents, which have to be provided to the national competent authority: a copy of the summary of scientific advice from any Member State or the EMA with regard to the clinical trial, a copy of the EMA's decision on the agreement of the Paediatric Investigation Plan and the opinion of the Paediatric Committee if the clinical trial is part of an agree pediatric investigation plan, and proof of payment in case of fees [59]. Only The Netherlands and Norway have specified that copies of the assessment by other regulatory authorities should be submitted to the competent authority [26,61]. Besides, Norway is the only Member State, which specified that, if applicable, the final summary report for a pediatric investigational plan has to be submitted to the competent authority [26]. This information is based on the website of the competent authority since the guideline to the Norwegian regulation to clinical trials, which according to the competent authority specifies the content of a request for authorization, is only available in Norwegian [26,95,96]. Furthermore, proof of payment in case of fees only has to be submitted 6133 to the competent authorities in Finland and Slovenia [75,91]. In Finland 2200 Euros have to be paid for the clinical trial notification to the Fimea [75,97]. However, if a clinical trial will be conducted without external financing or with financing by a non-profit corporation, a waiver of processing fee may be requested. The notification of the Fimea should then be accompanied by an informal statement to the effect that the investigation will not receive any outside financing [75,97]. For the notification or request for authorization of a clinical trial in Slovenia 750 or 1500 Euros, respectively, have to be paid [91,98]. According to Article 52 and 62 of the Slovenian \"Medicinal Products Acts\" the Slovenian competent authority JAZMP has to give written authorization for clinical trials involving human medicinal products for gene, therapy, somatic cell therapy, including xenogenic therapy and all medicinal products containing genetically modified organisms. For clinical trials involving other medicinal products, the competent authority only needs to be notified [19].The national competent authorities may also ask for additional documentation to the documentation listed in the CT-1 guidance because Member States can have decided that the competent authority is responsible for the consideration of aspects described under Article 6 (3)(h,i,j) of Directive 2001/20/EC [1,59]. Additionally, Member States could have national provisions on the protection of clinical trial subjects that are broader than the provisions of Directive 2001/20/EC (2.10 detailed guidance) [59]. However, according to the detailed guidance CT-1 competent authorities may only ask for additional documentation and information if the national provisions are in line with Directive 2001/20/EC and if it is appropriate and proportionate considering the aim of the provision [59]. Submission Procedure to the Competent Authorities In Finland, Hungary and Slovenia the submission procedure of the documents that are required for a request for competent authority approval are the same as for the submission procedure to the ethics committee in these Member States [42,90,99]. However, the filled in EudraCT application form should also be submitted electronically as an XML-file on a CD-ROM in Finland and Slovenia [42,59,75,91,99]. For the submission procedure to the competent authority in The Netherlands all documents should be provided on a CD-ROM [80], and in Norway the documents have to be sent on a CD-ROM or USBstick by mail or by e-mail [26]. In The Netherlands the XML-file of the EudraCT form does not have to be sent with the standard research file [61]. Review Procedures Competent Authorities In all Member States, except for The Netherlands, the national competent authority reviews the content of a request for competent authority approval. Paragraph 13(3) of the Hungarian Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.) on the clinical trial and application of correct clinical practices has specified the aspects of an application that OGYI will assess. These include the clinical trials conducted with the trial preparation, whether the protocol meets the professional standards, whether the expected risks are surpassed by the expected therapeutic benefits and whether 6134 the IMP can be administrated to humans [17]. The decision of OGYI can only be adopted after receiving the professional-ethical opinion of the ethics committee KFEB; OGYI may not authorize a trial if KFEB rejects the application on professional and ethical grounds (Paragraph 14 (1) Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.) [17,42]. OGYI can also only authorize the use of an IMP on humans if the personal conditions for the head of the clinical trial and the material conditions of the trial site meet the requirements in Annex 2 of Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.) [17]. In The Netherlands, the assessment by the competent authority is a marginal review [100,101]. The CCMO or the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport only checks the European databank with adverse events (EudraVigilance) as to whether the database includes side effects of the IMP which lead to unacceptable risks to the human subjects or if there is otherwise evidence that the research will lead to risks to the human subjects of the research (Article 13j (1) WMO) [47,100,101]. The assessment of the content of the request is done by the commission that has to give a favorable opinion [101,102]. Consideration of a Request by the Competent Authorities All Member States comply with Article 9 (4) of Directive 2001/20/EC, which determines that the consideration of a request for authorization may not exceed 60 days [1,17,19,27,47,86]. Based on the national law of Finland, Norway and Slovenia, a vaccine trial may start if the Fimea, NOMA or JAZMP, respectively, has not responded to the applicant about its assessment within 60 days from the day of receiving a valid request for competent authority approval [19,27,86]. Only for clinical trials involving specific medicinal products is written authorization required in these Member States. In Norway these are clinical trials involving medicinal products described under Articles 9 (5) and 9 (6) of the EU trial directive, and in both Finland and Slovenia clinical trials involving medicinal products described under Article 9 (6) of Directive 2001/20/EC [1,19,27,86]. For Hungary, the competent authority OGYI can adopt its decision on a clinical trial if the KFEB has given a favorable professional-ethical opinion [17,42]. Based on Paragraphs 14 (3) and (4) of the Hungarian Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.), OGYI should send the authorization decision of a clinical trial, along with the professional-ethical opinion of the KFEB, to the sponsor within 60 days from the day of receiving an application for an authorization [17]. OGYI should also send the authorization decision to KFEB and the National Pension Insurance Fund according to Paragraph 14 (3) [17]. Only The Netherlands have laid down a shorter period than 60 days in their national law. Based on Article 13i (1,3) WMO, a vaccine trial may start if the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport has not communicated reasoned objections for the research within 14 days from the day of receiving an application [47]. However, just like Finland, Norway and Slovenia, for clinical trials involving medicinal products described under Article 9 (6) of Directive 2001/20/EC (Article 13i (5) WMO), written authorization is required [47]. Language Requirements Submission Procedures For the submission of the required documents for a request for a favorable opinion by an 6135 ethics committee and the competent authority approval there are differences in the language requirements among the Member States. In both Hungary and The Netherlands the documents for the request for ethical and competent authority approval may be submitted in English [17,42,61,63]. Furthermore, in Slovenia the documents that have to be submitted for a request for ethical approval may also be submitted in English to NMEC. However, the documents may also be submitted in Slovene language [68]. In all three Member States, the summary of the protocol, examples of the labels and the information that will be provided to the human subjects such as the informed consent form and diaries need to be provided in the national language [17,42,61,63,68]. For Slovenia, the statement that appropriate measures will be taken to prevent pregnancy in case of research involving patients in fertile period where risk of mutagenicity exists also needs to be submitted in Slovene language [68]. There is one exception for The Netherlands, the questionnaire that must be completed by participants may be submitted in English if the English questionnaire is usually used in The Netherlands and has been validated [61]. The language requirement for the documents that have to be submitted for a request for competent authority approval by JAZMP is not specified in the \" Rules on clinical trials on medicinal products \" with the exception that the cover letter and the summary of the trial protocol should be submitted in Slovenian [90,91]. In Norway the request for competent authority approval by the NOMA may be submitted in English, but the language requirement for the documents to be submitted for the request for ethical approval is dependent on where the clinical trial will be conducted [62,95]. Only for research projects that are exclusively conducted in countries other than Norway, the application for the prior approval by a REC may be submitted in English. If a project is not exclusively conducted in countries other than Norway, the application form and the participant information should be written in Norwegian. The attachments other than the participant information may in this case be submitted in English or another Scandinavian language [62]. Ethics committees in Finland do not accept a request for an ethical opinion in English [13,33]. Therefore a foreign sponsor must have a representative in Finland who is responsible for the communication with TUKIJA or the regional ethics committee and also with the Fimea [13,33,75]. Only the trial protocol and investigator's brochure may be submitted in English to the ethics committee. The summary of the trial protocol, information for potential subjects and informed consent form needs to be translated in both Finnish and Swedish [33,70]. Start of a Vaccine Trial In all Member States a vaccine trial may start if the competent ethics committee has given a favorable opinion and if the competent authority has not responded to the applicant within the defined time period from the day of receiving a valid request for authorization or, depending on the nature of the vaccine, has given written authorization [17,19,27,47,86]. This corresponds with Article 9 (1) of Directive 2001/20/EC [1]. Only in Hungary, will the decision of the national competent authority OGYI always be sent to the applicant [17]. The reason for this is that before the start of a trial in Hungary, the sponsor should have sent the decision of 6136 OGYI along with a summary of the protocol in Hungarian language to the competent IKEB (Paragraph 14 (5) Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.)). The task of the IKEB is to protect the rights and safety of the human subjects participating in the trial and to monitor the execution of the trial in accordance with the conditions in the protocol, the official authorization of OGYI and the opinion of KFEB (Paragraph 12 (4) Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.)). The sponsor also has to notify the head of the health institution and the principal investigator about the decision of OGYI (Paragraph 14 (3) Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.)). Besides, the sponsor also has to inform the investigators about the professional-ethical opinion of the KFEB (Paragraph 14 (4) Decree 35/2005 (VIII.26.)) [17]. For vaccine trials with immunoprophylaxis vaccines in Finland, the Fimea needs to release the batches of the vaccines before the start of a trial. The reason for this is that without the authorization of the Fimea these batches may not be used [75]. To be able to release the batches, the applicant should send the manufactures own analysis certificates to the Fimea along with the relevant batch release certificates signed by the qualified person, details of the batch quantities to be imported into Finland, details on the person responsible for the trial and the clinical trial authorization granted by the Fimea [75]. The Slovenian \" Medicinal Products Acts \" also includes a provision about the import of vaccines into Slovenia, namely Article 77 (2). According to this article the entry and import of vaccines into Slovenia is only allowed on the basis of an entry or import authorization that needs to be given by the competent authority [19]. However, according to the competent authority, no special or additional import permit is required for any kind of drugs, including vaccines, used in clinical trials. This exception is, according to JAZMP, based on the exceptions of Article 77 (2) of the \" Medicinal Products Act \" which are described in the \" Rules on the conditions, method and procedure for the acquisition of authorisation for entry or import of medicinal products for human use \". However, these rules are also only available in Slovenian language [103]. 6137 CONCLUSIONS Under the EU clinical trial Directive 2001/20/EC it is a challenge to obtain ethical approval for a multinational vaccine trial from each Member State of the EU participating in the trial as illustrated by this review due to the differences in the implementation of the directive in the national laws of the Member States. There are differences between the Member States in the documents that have to be submitted to the ethics committee and the national competent authority, which has to perform ethical approval of the trial, the submission procedure of the documents and the language requirements. Moreover, there are differences between the Member States in the organization of the ethics committees and the role and position of the competent authority in the procedure of the approval of a trial. Especially for the requirements of the documents that have to be submitted, including the language requirements of these documents, and the submission procedure a more harmonized procedure in the Member States is desirable for sponsors of multinational trials. The aim of this is to simplify the process of obtaining ethical and competent authority approval in different participating Member States for the start of a trial. For the new EU trial regulation to harmonize the procedures and to be in effect in 2016, much work has to be done, since Member States have to adapt their procedures to the new regulation which is binding in its entirety. Therefore, it is advisable that the implementation of the new trial regulation in the national law of Member States and the changes in the organization of the national review procedures will be carried out with high priority in close collaboration of the Member States and interested parties, with the aim of making an effective transition process from the EU trial directive to the new EU trial regulation possible in all Member States, which indeed harmonizes the national procedures of the Member States. 6138 REFERENCES 1.

S. Hassin, I. Visonati, H.W. Frijlink, E. Hak Medicine. 2017; 96 (11):e6339152 ABSTRACT Introduction Influenza is a major respiratory viral infection of humans with high mortality and morbidity rates and profound economic impact. Although influenza vaccines are generally updated yearly to match the viruses expected in the coming season, genetic mutation and reassortment can result in unexpected novel strains. Therefore, it is important to develop universal vaccines inducing protective immunity to such strains before they appear. This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Multimeric-001 (M-001), which contains conserved epitopes of influenza A and B. M-001 is able to induce both humoral and cellular immunity and provides broad strain coverage.Methods In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and controlled phase IIb trial, 222 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 60 years will be randomized into 3 groups (1:1:1) to receive either 2 intramuscular injections of 0.5 m g M-001 (arm 1), 1.0 m g M-001 (arm 2), or saline (arm 3-placebo), before receiving an investigational (whole virus, inactivated, aluminum phosphate gel [AlPO4]-adjuvanted) prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1). Primary outcomes are safety and cellular immune responses (cell-mediated immunity [CMI]) induced by M-001, evaluated by multiparametric flow cytometry of cytokines. outcome serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer toward the H5N1 vaccine strain. Additionally, exploratory outcomes include evaluation of CMI by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of cytokine mRNA, HAI titers toward H5-drifted strains, serum single radial hemolysis titers toward the H5N1 study vaccine, and the association between CMI markers and antibody response.Discussion There is a need for influenza vaccines that give the population a broader protection against multiple strains of influenza virus. M-001 might be such vaccine which will be tested in this current trial as a standalone vaccine and as a pandemic primer. Both cellular and humoral immune responses will be evaluated.Trial registration EudraCT number: 2015-001979-46. 7153 INTRODUCTION Influenza is a globally important respiratory viral infection of humans that is easily transmitted from person to person.[1] As well as causing annual epidemics during the winter period, newly emerging variants can result in global pandemics.[1,2] Infection of humans with influenza virus is characterized by symptoms such as a sudden onset of high fever and coughing. Although most symptoms are self-limiting and resolved within 1 week, influenza can cause severe illness such as pneumonia and otitis media due to the primary influenza infection or to a secondary bacterial infection.[1,3-6] Severe illness can result in hospitalizations and deaths, in particular among individuals who are at high risk for complications (e.g., children younger than 2 years of age, adults aged 65 years, pregnant women, and patients with a chronic disease or a weakened immune system).[2,4,6] According to the World Health Organization (WHO) up to 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness occur worldwide during an annual epidemic, resulting in 250,000 to 500,000 deaths, depending on the severity of the influenza season.[6,7] In addition to the morbidity and mortality, these annual epidemics have an enormous economic impact, both from the costs of treatment (direct costs) and the high levels of work absenteeism (indirect costs).[6,7] The total estimated cost of an influenza epidemic in industrialized countries may reach 56.7 million euros per million of population. [7] The most (cost)-effective way to prevent influenza virus infection and severe illness is vaccination.[6,8] Vaccines are designed to induce the immune responses that would be normally induced by natural infection, but without causing the disease.[9] Commercially available influenza vaccines contain 2 viral surface antigens, the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA).[8,10] HA is responsible for both the attachment of the virus to the sialic-acid-containing receptors on the host cell surface and the entry of the virus into the host cells, whereas NA releases newly formed virus particles from the cell surface.[8,10] The vaccines elicit antibodies toward these proteins, thereby limiting or eliminating their function.[10] Many countries recommend yearly vaccination against seasonal flu for individuals who are at high risk for complications and for people who live with or care for high-risk individuals.[1,6] Each year, the WHO recommends which virus strains should be included in the seasonal influenza vaccine, usually 2 circulating strains of the influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) virus and 1 or 2 strains of influenza B virus (Yamagata and/or Victoria lineage).[1,2,6,8] The seasonal vaccine must be updated every year due to the minor amino acid changes (antigenic drifts) that occur in the HA and NA viral surface proteins.[1,8,11] These antigenic drifts, resulting from genetic mutations during viral replication, occur gradually over time, eventually result in the unpredictable appearance of new virus strains that may not be effectively recognized by the immune system.[11] Occasionally, an abrupt and major change (antigenic shift) in the influenza A virus may occur resulting in the introduction of a completely new influenza A subtype that has not previously circulated among humans.[1,2,8,11] These viruses are introduced either by the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus to humans or by reassortment between human and avian viruses after coinfection of another animal serving as a \"mixing vessel\" (e.g., ducks 7154 and pigs).[1,12] Being entirely novel, such shifted viruses are poorly recognized (if at all) by the pre-existing immunity to other virus and may be highly contagious and highly pathogenic, resulting in a pandemic characterized by many more cases of severe illness.[1,2,11] One of the most important factors, which influences the type and subtype-specific effectiveness of a vaccine, is the degree of similarity between the vaccine virus strains and the circulating strains.[13] A vaccine can reduce the risk of illness by 50% to 60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating virus strains are similar to the vaccine strains.[13,14] However, the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States estimated that the vaccine effectiveness for the Northern hemisphere in the 2014 to 2015 influenza season was only 23% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14-31) in the general population.[15] This low efficacy is considered to be the result of the mismatch between the H3N2 contained in the vaccine (A/Texas/50/12) and the circulating H3N2 virus (A/Switzerland/9715293/13) and resulted in the highest recorded rate of flu-associated hospitalization (266.1 per 100,000) among adults aged 65 and older in the United States since the CDC started tracking data.[13,15-18] This mismatch highlights the need for influenza vaccines that give the population a broader protection against multiple strains of influenza virus: a universal vaccine.[10,19] Multimeric-001 (M-001), developed by BiondVax Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Israel), is designed to be a universal influenza vaccine that confers immunity and protection against a broad range of influenza viruses. M-001 is a single recombinant protein containing 9 B- and T-cell conserved epitopes (epitopes that do not undergo antigenic change) from the HA, nucleoprotein, and matrix 1 proteins of both the influenza A and B virus strains. The vaccine induces both humoral and cellular immunity.[20,21] In this phase IIb trial, the immunogenicity and safety ofM-001 and its administration prior to an aluminum phosphate gel (AlPO4)-adjuvanted H5N1 investigational influenza vaccine product (Fluart Innovative Vaccines Ltd., Hungary) will be evaluated in healthy adults (aged 18-60 years). FluartH5N1 vaccine is highly immunogenic at doses of 6 and 12mg and hence, a suboptimal dose of the vaccine (3mg) will be used to evaluate the dose sparing potential of M-001 and to show its ability to enhance immunogenicity of the strain-specific vaccine.[22] The immunogenicity of M-001 both as a standalone vaccine and as a pandemic primer will be evaluated. In addition, the association between the cell-mediated immunity (CMI) markers and the antibody responses will be evaluated as an exploratory endpoint. The safety will be evaluated based on the reported adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout the whole study period. 7155 METHOD/DESIGN Study design The study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and controlled phase IIb trial involving 222 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 60 years over a period of 187 days (from screening to study conclusion). Individuals volunteering to participate in the study will be screened before enrollment in the trial. Subject eligibility will be assessed during the screening and written consent will be obtained (Fig. 1). The eligible subjects will be randomized to receive 2 administrations of M-001 at low or high dose, or saline as placebo. All participants will receive an investigational AlPO4-adjuvanted, inactivated whole virus prepandemic H5N1 vaccine as a third administration to evaluate whether M-001 has a priming effect. The H5N1 vaccine is based on a clade 1 virus A/Vietnam/1194/04. Each administration will be given intramuscularly (i.m.) 21\u00b12 days apart. Blood samples will be taken from all subjects on days 0 (before the first vaccination), 42 (21 days after the second vaccination), and 63 (21 days after the H5N1 vaccination) for serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to evaluate the influenza-specific cellular and humoral immune responses. Additionally, questionnaires/diaries concerning AEs will be issued on days 0 and 21 to subjects for the collection of solicited (e.g., fever, chills, joint pain, muscle pain, sore throat, fatigue, injection site reactions) and unsolicited AEs. The cards will need to be completed by the subjects and returned on day 21 (second vaccination of study vaccine) and day 42 (H5N1vaccination). Unsolicited AEs and SAEs will be followed throughout the whole study period and thereby AEs from both the study vaccine and H5N1 vaccine. The study will be conducted at the St. Istvan and St. Laszlo Hospital of Budapest (Hungary) and another Hungarian satellite trial site (B\u00e9ke Hospital, Budapest). 7156 Figure 1 Flow chart describing the study's design Screened Eligible Consent to be study subject Randomized (1:1:1) Vaccination M-001 (low dose: 0.5 1.0 N=74; Placebo N=74 Issue AE diary cards Collect AE diary card Vaccination M-001 (low dose: 0.5 mg) N=74; N=74 Pandemic H5N1 vaccination: N =222 (all subjects) Blood Sampling Blood Sampling Blood sampling Visit 1 Visit 2 (day 0) Visit 3 (day 21) Visit 4 (day 42) Visit 5 (day 63) Blood sampling for baseline profile Issue AE diary cards Collect AE diary card Safety Follow-up Urine pregnancy test (for female) Visit 6 (day 180) Safety Follow-up Study conclusion Participants Individuals will be recruited using advertising material approved by the ethics committee. Healthy males and females between the ages of 18 and 60 are eligible for study participation (Table 1). Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded. Other exclusion criteria include individuals who have received an influenza vaccine or have experienced influenza-like illness within the 6 months prior to the study, those who are receiving medicines or treatments that may affect the evaluation of their immune responses or those who have a history of chronic disease and/or immune system disorder (Table 1). Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to practice adequate contraception throughout the study treatment and for at least up to days 51 and 111 of the trial, respectively, since no reproduction toxicity data are known yet. Furthermore, individuals should be able to understand and comply with the study procedures. In addition, individuals will only be included if the individual provides a signed informed consent form after receiving a detailed explanation of the study protocol prior to any study procedures. In case of uncertainty about the medical status of an individual regarding 7157 any of the exclusion criteria mentioned, the primary care physician will be consulted. Consultation of the primary care physician is included in the consent form and only concerns medical information about the exclusion criteria. Screening and baseline assessment Baseline assessment during the screening visit will include demographics (i.e., age, gender, and ethnicity), general physical examination, self-reported medical and medication history, history of influenza vaccination, and alcohol, drug, and cigarette consumption. This is to ensure that subjects enter the trial in a healthy condition. A blood sample will be taken at the screening visit for laboratory tests including hematology (e.g., hemoglobin, hematocrit, total and differential leukocyte count, red blood cell count, platelet count) and serum chemistry (e.g., uric acid, creatinine, cholesterol, triglycerides, sodium, potassium). Subjects having an abnormal result for any of the tests, upon consultation with the principal investigator, would be excluded from the study. In addition to the blood sampling, females will undergo a urine pregnancy test. Each screened subject will receive a sequential, unique 5-digit screening number which they will retain, whether or not they are ultimately randomized to receive treatment. Serum samples from the collected blood at visits 2 and 5 (days 0 and 63) will be stored until the end of the trial when serology will be performed to detect antibodies to the H5N1 virus and against the 2015-2016 circulating influenza virus strains in order to identify subjects having had an asymptomatic influenza infection prior to the start of the trial. On day 180 of the trial, each participant will receive a phone call for safety follow-up and then the study will terminate. Interventions Individuals who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive either 0.5mgM-001 (low dose), 1.0mg M-001 (high dose), or saline (placebo control). All subjects will receive 2 i.m. administrations of the test vaccine, or saline, followed by 1 i.m. administration of an investigational (whole virus, inactivated, AlPO4-adjuvanted) prepandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) produced by Fluart Innovative Vaccines Ltd (formerly Omninvest Ltd). The prepandemic vaccine contains 3 mg HA, which is half of the dose of the pandemic vaccine licensed in Hungary.7158 Table 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria of individuals Inclusion criteria - Aged between 18 and 60 y - Men and non-pregnant women as indicated by a negative urine pregnancy test - Healthy as determined by vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, armpit temperature), blood chemistry (electrolytes, renal/kidney function, liver function, C-reactive protein, complete blood count), medical history, general physical examination, self-reported illness and clinical judgment of the investigator - Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or postmenopausal for 1 year) and men must agree to practice adequate contraception (intrauterine device (IUD) or a combination of barrier and hormone methods for women and a condom for men) throughout the study treatment for at least up to day 51 (for female) and day 111 (for male) of the trial (i.e. 30 and 90 days after the last administration of the investigational medicinal product - Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures- Provides signed informed consent form after receiving a detailed explanation of the study protocol prior to any study procedures Exclusion criteria - Known allergy to components of the vaccine (e.g. egg products) - History of severe reactions following immunizations- Immune deficiency/disorder, whether due to genetic defect, immunodeficiency disease, or immunosuppressive therapy - Positive urine pregnancy test prior to vaccination or who are breastfeeding- History of (reported by subjects): A cute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM); A ctive C hronic hepatitis B evere renal disease; T ransplant recipients; U nstable or progressive neurological disorders - Receipt of medicines/treatment that may affect the evaluation of immunogenicity such as; O ral or parenteral steroids, high-dose inhaled steroids (greater than 800 \u00b5g/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs; I mmunoglobulin or other blood products (within the 3 mo prior to vaccination in this study); E xperimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or medication) within 1 mo prior to vaccination in this study, or expects to receive an experimental agent during the study period; I nfluenza antiviral medication within the 4 wk prior to the vaccination in this study. - Received any influenza vaccine within 6 mo prior to vaccination in this study. - Influenza like-illness within 6 mo prior to vaccination in this study. - Acute illness, including an armpit temperature > 38 degrees oC, within 1 wk before vaccination.- History of alcohol or drug abuse.- Any abnormal haematology values and/or serum chemistries judged by the investigator as clinically significant. - Ineligible subject based on the judgement of the investigator.7159 Outcomes Primary outcomes The trial has 2 primary outcomes. The first primary outcome is the cellular immune response elicited by M-001, evaluated by multiparametric flow cytometry analysis in all subjects on days 0 and 42. Multiparametric flow cytometry will be performed after 24h in vitro stimulation of PBMC with vaccine antigen. Markers including clusters of differentiation 3 (CD-3), CD-4, and CD-8 will be used to define cell lineage, and interferon gamma (IFN-g), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) will be used to detect specific cytokine responses. The other primary outcome is safety evaluation. This includes the solicited AEs in all subjects until 21 days after the last dosing of the study vaccine and the unsolicited AEs and SAEs in all subjects for 180 days after the first injection. The investigator will assess the intensity of the AE and the relationship between the tested vaccine and the occurrence of the AE (Table 2). Secondary outcomes The secondary outcome is serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers specific for the H5N1 study vaccine strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) in all subjects on days 0 and 63 (21 days following the H5N1 vaccination). HAI tests will be performed by standard procedures with chicken red blood cells and 4 HA units of virus/well.[23] Table 2 Adverse events classification Adverse event intensity Mild An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities Moderate An event that causes sufficient discomfort as to interfere with normal everyday activities Severe An event that prevents normal everyday activities Serious Any untoward medical occurrence that: R esults in death I s life threating (an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the time) R equires hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization R esults in disability or permanent damage as defined as a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions I s a congenital anomaly/birth defect O ther adverse events that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes Adverse event causality Unrelated Where an event is not considered related to the investigational medicinal product Unlikely Although the relationship to investigational medicinal product cannot be completely ruled out, the nature of the event, the underlying disease, concomitant medication or temporal relationship make other explanations more likely Possibly related The temporal relationship and the absence of a more likely explanation suggest the event could be related to the investigational medicinal product Probably related The known effects of the investigational medicinal product or its therapeutic class, or based on challenge testing, suggest the investigational medicinal product is the most likely cause Definitely related AE is clearly a consequence of administration of the drug7160 Exploratory outcomes The following exploratory outcomes are considered; (1) cellular immune response elicited by M-001, with or without prepandemic H5N1 vaccine, evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of cytokine mRNA on days 0, 42, and 63 in a subset of 60 subjects; (2) serum HAI titers toward H5 drifted strains evaluated on days 0 and 63 in all subjects; (3) serum single radial hemolysis (SRH) titers evaluated on days 0 and 63 in all subjects toward the H5N1 vaccine strain; and the association between the CMI markers analyzed and (4) the HAI responses. Sample size calculation Though a variety of immune parameters will be analyzed during the trial, the minimum sample size is determined on the basis of the expression of IFN-g producing CD-8+ cells, as this T-cell subset is important for influenza viral clearance.[24,25] We estimated a background rate of 5% in the placebo group and it is expected that the M-001 vaccine will result in at least 5 times higher rates, or an absolute rate of 25% responders in the vaccinated arms.[21] To be able to detect this with a power of 80%, approximately 60 subjects per arm are needed based on a 2-group continuity corrected test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. Taking 15% loss of follow-up into account, a total of 222 subjects (74 subjects per treatment group) is required. It should be noted that estimates are based on data analysis from a previous trial where multiparametric flow cytometry analysis was performed on only a small sample size of 10 elderly participants. Randomization Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to 1 of the 3 treatment groups. Within each treatment group block randomization will be done for participants aged <50 years and 50 years to achieve an approximately balanced age distribution.[26] Randomized subjects will be allocated the next sequential 3-digit randomization number available at the trial site which is identical to the treatment number allocated by the randomization list. Blinding The study will be double-blinded. To maintain blinding, the preparation of the M-001 formulations and control will be performed by an unblinded qualified person (QP) other than the person giving the injection. The reason for this is that M-001 and saline differ in appearance. The unblinded QP will prepare the dosing solutions and will use the study randomization code to assign each subject to the appropriate treatment group. The unblinded QP will not reveal the treatment code to other study personnel or perform any other study treatment-related activities. The unblinded QP will prepare syringes containing the study medication assigned by the randomization scheme. The syringe content will be hidden by a label, which includes the subject's randomization number, initials, and date of birth. An identical label will be attached to the top of the case report form. This material will be given to the blinded study 7161 personnel administering the injections. The pharmacy file, including the randomization list, vaccine supplies, and all associated documentation, will be stored in a locked cabinet within the pharmacy to which only the unblinded pharmacy personnel have access. Statistical analysis and report A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 2010 guidelines before the database lock.[27] Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and perprotocol analysis will be performed for the analyses of reported AEs and SAEs, themeasured serumHAI titers, SRHtiters, and the cellular immune by both multiparametric flow cytometry and qRT-PCR assays. ITT analysis will include all vaccinated subjects who receive the first vaccination. Perprotocol analysis will include the subjects who complete the assigned schedule of vaccination, who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and who comply with the procedures defined in the protocol (i.e., vaccinated according to their randomized assignment, not vaccinated with any vaccine or treated with any medication not foreseen or forbidden in the protocol, free of underlying medical conditions forbidden by the protocol) until the days of assessment and have not broken the randomization code. Both analyses will be conducted to assess differences from baseline with their corresponding 95% CIs. Differences in continuous variables will be tested using the analysis of variance (ANOVA)/Ttests or distribution-free tests. In addition, subgroup analyses are preplanned according to age (<50 and 50 years) and ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test will be applied to test for potential differences between the treatment groups. All calculations will be performed using SAS for Windows. The measured variables and derived parameters will be listed individually by subject number and treatment group. The data will be summarized in appropriate tables presenting sample size, arithmeticmean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum values by treatment group for continuous data and absolute and relative frequency by treatment group for categorical data. Data management An interactive website will be established which will be the major communication instrument ensuring the integration of program communication and the trial study. In addition, electronic case report forms will be developed in accordance with the good clinical practice (GCP) standards for electronic data entry and flexible data export, and will be integrated into the interactive website. The data entered will be backed up on a daily basis, be subject to secure access control management to allow secure entry, access, analysis, and export of data by users regardless of their locations and be subject to plausibility and consistency checks during the entry process to enforce high data integrity. All nominal subject data will be anonymized to ensure personal data protection. If several reports taken at different times have to be correlated, pseudo-anonymization will be used.7162 Ethics and disseminations Ethical approval and authorization of the trial is obtained from the Clinical Pharmacology Ethics Committee (Klinikai Farmakol\u00f3giai Etikai Bizotts\u00e1g) and the Hungarian and Nutrition (Orsz\u00e1gos Gy\u00f3gyszer\u00e9szeti \u00e9s \u00c9lelmez\u00e9s-eg\u00e9szs\u00e9g\u00fcgyi Int\u00e9zet), respectively. The Institutional Ethics Committee of St. Istvan and St. Laszlo Hospital was also informed.[28] The trial will be performed in compliance with GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki and relevant Hungarian national laws. Written informed consent will be obtained from subjects before participation in the trial. The original subject signed and dated informed consent form will be stored by the site for 10 years. Other trial data will also be stored for 10 years. The trial results will be made suitable for publication in international scientific journals. DISCUSSION The main objective of this phase IIb trial is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of M-001 as a standalone universal vaccine and when used as a primer for a pandemic influenza vaccine. Currently, the standard criterion to determine influenza vaccine efficacy is based on HAI titer.[25,29,30] However, this criterion is not applicable for M-001 since only conserved epitopes without hemagglutination and neutralization capacity are included in it.[20,25] Previous trials using M-001 have shown that it induces influenza-specific cellular immune responses, which are suggested to be important for protection against influenza disease.[31] The vaccine efficacy of M-001 will therefore be evaluated by multiparametric flow cytometry analysis in the current trial. Flow cytometry is chosen because the assay provides a sensitive technique for qualitative and quantitative analyses of cellular immune responses.[25,32] Only 1 blood sample is needed to simultaneously measure CD-3, CD-4, and CD-8 T-cells and the functional markers for both CD-4 and CD-8 T-cells responses.[24,25,33] The analysis will be standardized and validated before analyzing the clinical samples. In addition to flow cytometry, detection of IFN-g and granzyme B mRNA expression by qRT-PCR assay will be performed. This method has recently been shown to be a highly sensitive measure for the detection of CMI in guinea pigs immunized intradermally with heat-inactivated varicella-zoster virus.[34] The ultimate aim is to develop a set of correlates of protection that could improve the translation of immunological data from small clinical trials in humans into conclusions about protective efficacy. Currently large clinical trials are required for assessing vaccine efficacy (reduction of illness), since the incidence of influenza is only 5%. If such immunological correlates of protection could be identified, they could serve as a surrogate measure of protection in comparatively small trials. M-001 has been tested as a primer for a seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in adults aged 55 to 75 years and the elderly (over 65 years of age).[21] These studies showed that TIV, which was administrated 3 weeks after receiving 1 or 2 administrations of M-001 or placebo, with an interval of 21\u00b12 days, induced higher HAI antibody titers in 7163 individuals primed with M-001. In addition, M-001 also increased the TIV seroconversion rate (percentage of participants with a minimum 4-fold increase in the HAI titer and 1:40 HAI antibody titers) and broadens the antibody responses toward influenza strains other than the TIV strains. This indicates that M-001 has the potential to act as a primer for influenza vaccines in general which is especially important in the case of weakly immunogenic HA-based influenza vaccines, such as a pandemic vaccine. Since it is not feasible to determine the clinical efficacy of a pandemic vaccine in a clinical trial and it takes several months to manufacture a pandemic vaccine, a prepandemic primer such as M-001 represents a breakthrough in pandemic preparedness.[29] Stockpiled M-001 can be administered immediately upon pandemic alert to prime the immune response for the pandemic vaccine still under production, irrespective of the identified pandemic strain which will be included in the pandemic vaccine. The success of this pandemic prime-boost approach is expected to greatly reduce the illness and economic loss caused by an upcoming pandemic. To assess the efficacy of this prime-boost approach, HAI titers toward the H5N1 study vaccine strain (secondary outcome) and other H5 drifted strains (exploratory outcome) induced by the investigational H5 pandemic vaccine, with or without M-001 priming, will be evaluated. Finally, M-001 is a recombinant product, which is produced in Escherichia coli using standard fermentation and purifications methods.[20] This is a simple, scalable manufacturing process. The vaccine production takes only 6 to 8 weeks and it has the possibility of flexible manufacturing year-round, meaning that production can be planned in accordance with market demands, enabling national stockpiles to be maintained for all income class countries.[20,21,35] Furthermore, people with egg-allergies can be vaccinated with the standalone vaccine as the vaccine is not produced in embryonated chicken eggs.[1] 7164 REFERENCES 1.

Multimeric-001 (M-001) is a vaccine candidate developed to induce cellular immune responses and to enhance the humoral immune response and might be able to serve as a broad-spectrum influenza vaccine. Objective To characterize the cellular immune response induced by M-001 and its safety, and to assess its potential to act as a primer for an investigational H5N1 influenza vaccine. Design, setting, participants, interventions This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled phase IIb trial. A total of 225 eligible healthy volunteers aged 18-60 years were randomized 1:1:1 to receive two administrations of M-001 at low (0.5 mg) or high dose (1.0 mg), or saline as placebo. All subjects received a partial dose of AlPO 4-adjuvanted H5N1 investigational pre-pandemic influenza vaccine as a third administration. All administrations were given intramuscularly with a 21 \u00b1 2 days interval. Blood samples were taken from all subjects on days 0, 42 and 63 to assess the immune response. Adverse events were followed throughout the whole study period of 180 days. Results M-001 was safe and well tolerated at both doses. A significant increase in responders for Th-1 cell markers including IFN-g, TNF- and IL-2 was observed for both treatment groups, while no significant increase in Th2-cell markers or CD8+ T-cells was detected. The vaccine did not prime antibody responses against the tested pre-pandemic H5N1 influenza vaccine, though enhanced HAI responses were observed towards a drifted, non-vaccine, H5N1 strain. Conclusions The elevation in CD4+ T-cells indicate M-001's potential to serve as a broad- spectrum influenza vaccine since such elevation is associated with lower virus shedding and less severe illness. Additional efficacy trials are now warranted to further assess M-001's potential as a broadly protective and long-lasting influenza vaccine. 8169 INTRODUCTION Currently approved prophylactic seasonal influenza vaccines target three or four specific virus strains: two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and one or two B viruses (B/Yamagata and/or B/Victoria). The vaccine antigens are aimed at the development of neutralizing antibodies directed to the external influenza virus glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). However, since HA and NA constantly mutate (antigenic drift), the vaccine composition is annually updated to fit WHO's educated guess regarding which strains will be circulating the following season. Despite these efforts, the effectiveness of influenza vaccines is limited for reasons including a mismatch between the circulating virus strains and the vaccine strains [1, 2]. The limitations of currently approved influenza vaccines is even more pronounced in the case of new pandemic strains emerging as a result of antigenic shifts [1,3]. In contrast to vaccines which induce a humoral response, vaccines that trigger a cellular immune response by targeting conserved internal virus proteins (i.e. nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix (M) proteins) can protect against several virus strains [4,5]. CD4+ T-cells play a role in cytotoxic mechanisms and the activation of B- and CD8+ T-cells via different T helper cells, while CD8+ T-cells are responsible for directly killing virus infected host cells [3,5,6]. In contrast to antibody-inducing vaccines that limit infection, T-cell vaccines play a role in viral clearance and therefore may limit the severity of an influenza virus illness [7]. Multimeric-001 (M-001) is a vaccine candidate developed to induce cellular immune responses and enhance humoral responses against the influenza virus. The vaccine contains nine conserved and linear B- and T-cell epitopes from HA, NP and M1 proteins from both influenza A and B virus strains. Since there are no epitopes from the variable HA regions in the M-001, the vaccine does not elicit HAI or neutralizing antibodies. Rather, its direct mechanism of action relies on cell-mediated immunity and involves CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes that secrete T helper 1 (Th1) cytokines such as IFN-gamma (IFN-g). Cumulative results, in various vaccination studies, have shown the ability of synthetic peptides (epitopes) to successfully confer protection against influenza infection [8,9]. Upon immunization with M-001 and further exposure to HA we speculate that the T-cell expansion can trigger intrinsic re-assortment of antibody producing machinery to manufacture pluripotent antibodies with plasticity to recognize related HA variants that contain the conserved HA peptides within the M-001. It is expected that the vaccine can give protection against a broad range of virus strains by its direct (CMI based) and indirect (HAI based) mode of action. Previous studies have shown that the vaccine is safe and can induce or enhance both cellular and humoral immunity [10,11]. The vaccine was also shown to enhance the humoral response for a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in elderly people (> 65 years of age). Moreover, subjects immunized with M-001 prior to the 2011/12 season TIV developed seroprotective antibody responses against the 2014/15 strain, a strain that was not known to circulate at the 2011/12 trial [12]. Especially older adults and elderly are the target population for M-001. Ageing is associated with changes in the immune response such as a decline in Th1 relative to Th2 8170 cytokine production. A decrease in Th1 cytokines is related to a decrease in the recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells and consequently an increased risk of influenza illness. A vaccine such as M-001 that can retune the Th1/Th2 imbalance is expected to improve the protection against influenza and its complications in this population [13,14]. The aim of this current Phase IIb trial was to further characterize the cellular immune response induced by M-001 and its safety in healthy volunteers aged 18 - 60 years (primary endpoints of the trial). Furthermore, the potential of M-001 to act as a primer for an investigational pre-pandemic H5N1 influenza vaccine was evaluated (secondary endpoint). METHODS Study design and Participants The study was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled phase IIb trial to assess the immunogenicity and safety of M-001 as a standalone vaccine and as a pandemic primer. The study protocol was approved by the Hungarian ethics committee and the national competent authority. Eligible subjects were healthy males and non-pregnant females aged 18 - 60 years. More details on the study design and subjects' eligibility criteria are described elsewhere [15]. Interventions Eligible subjects were randomized (1:1:1) to receive two administrations of M-001 at low (0.5 mg) or high dose (1.0 mg), or saline as placebo. All subjects received a partial dose of an aluminum phosphate gel (AlPO 4)-adjuvanted H5N1 investigational pre-pandemic influenza vaccine (3 \u00b5g which is half of the registered dose) as a third administration. All administrations were given intramuscularly with a 21 \u00b1 2 days interval. Blood samples were taken from all subjects on days 0, 42 and 63 to evaluate the influenza-specific cellular and humoral immune responses. Subjects completed Adverse Event (AE) questionnaires until day 42 for the collection of solicited and unsolicited AEs. Unsolicited and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were followed throughout the whole study period of 180 days. Outcomes Primary outcomes The primary outcomes were safety and the cellular immune response. For safety, the solicited AEs in all subjects up to day 42 and all unsolicited AEs and SAEs reported up to day 180 after the first vaccine administration were evaluated. All AEs were coded according to the MedRA coding dictionary Version 19.1. 8171 The cellular immune response elicited by M-001 was assessed by multiparametric flow cytometry analysis in all subjects on day 0 and 42 (21 days following the last M-001 dosing). Laboratory analysis was performed at the Robert Koch Institute (Berlin, Germany). Briefly, PBMCs were thawed, washed and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C before further washing and counting. 500 000 PBMCs per well were incubated for 24 hours with six different peptide pools corresponding to the M-001 vaccine in the presence of co-stimulatory antibodies (CD28 and CD49d) and fluorophore-labelled anti-CD107a antibody. Control stimulants included medium alone and staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB). After stimulation, cells were stained for viability and after fixation and permeabilization, incubated with an FcR-inhibitor before staining with fluorophore labelled antibodies specific for clusters of differentiation and cytokines: CD3, CD4, CD8, IFN-g, interleukin-2 (IL-2), TNF-a, IL-4, and These markers were selected to characterize the activated PBMCs and their response (Th1 or Th2). Using an LSRII cytometer, 200 000 events for each sample were acquired and the results evaluated using FlowJo, setting gates as follows: PBMC->viable->CD3 +->CD4+ or CD8+. Within the CD4 and CD8 gates, positive gates for each of the cytokine markers (and CD107a) were automatically set using the unstimulated control for each PBMC sample. The number of cells falling in the respective positive gates after stimulation was then used for statistical analysis. Secondary outcome The secondary outcome was the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers for the H5N1 study vaccine strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) in all subjects on day 0 and 63. HAI assays were performed at the Hungarian National Center of Epidemiology (Budapest, Hungary). Seroconversion (SCR) was defined as the proportion of subjects with a pre-vaccination HAI-titer (Day 0) 1:10 and a post-vaccination and post-vaccination to pre-vaccination titer. Seroprotection (SPR) was defined as the proportion of subjects with a HAI titer 1:40. Moreover, we assessed the proportion of subjects with a 4-fold HAI-titer increase from baseline (Day 0). Exploratory outcomes Exploratory outcomes were the serum single radial hemolysis (SRH) titers evaluated toward the H5N1 vaccine strain toward H5 drifted strains (A/Cambodia/RO405055/2007, A/Hong Kong/213/2003 and A/Turkey/Turkey/1/2005) in all subjects were evaluated on Day 0 and 63. SRH assays were performed at the Hungarian National Center of Epidemiology (Budapest, Hungary) and the HAI assays against drifted strains at BiondVax Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Ness Ziona, Israel). SRH seroconversion was defined as a negative serum at pre-vaccination and a positive post-vaccination serum (area 25 mm 2 or a significant increase in antibody titer, i.e. at least 50% increase in SRH). Seroprotection was defined as SRH titer > 25 mm 2. Moreover, the association between the cellular immune response and the HAI response was analyzed.8172 Sample size The minimum sample size was determined on the basis of the production of IFN-g by T-cells. We estimated a background rate of 5% in the placebo group and it was expected that M-001 would result in at least 5 times higher rates, or an absolute increase of 25% responders in the vaccinated arms [10]. With a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and power of 80%, 60 subjects were needed per arm. Assuming a \"lost to follow up\" rate of 15%, a total of 222 subjects were required. Randomization Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to one of the three treatment groups using the web-based system ALEA [16]. Within each treatment group block randomization was performed based on the age of the subject (<50 years and 50 years). Subjects were allocated to the next randomization number available which was identical to the treatment number allocated by the randomization list. Blinding The trial was double-blinded. In brief, the preparation of M-001 formulations and controls was performed by an unblinded qualified person (QP). The unblinded QP prepared the syringes containing the study treatment assigned by the randomization schema. The syringe content was hidden by a label since M-001 and saline differ in appearance. The syringe, including subject's randomization code, initials and date of birth, was given to blinded study personnel who administered the injections. Statistical Analysis Analyses were performed with the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The ITT-population included all vaccinated subjects who received the first vaccination. However, for quality reasons, 5% of FACS samples from subjects were disregarded due to the lowest cell counts and all analyses were performed based on the remaining cell counts. This had no effect on the number of participants in the data analysis. The cellular immune response was analyzed using the Mixture Models for Single-Cell Assays (MIMOSA) package in R version 3.3.2 to assess the counts of cytokine positive and negative PBMCs. Briefly, MIMOSA is a two-component Beta-Binominal mixture, using MCMC/EM to estimate the model parameters using the cell counts across all subjects as arising from mixture of two processes, either from the observations that are generated from the non-responder distribution, or from the responder distribution. Based on false discovery rates, significance levels lower than 0.05 were considered indicative of a positive response. Responders were defined as subjects whose T-cells responded to stimulation to any of 6 peptide pools from the vaccine, and the response is vaccine-specific if it exists at the post-vaccine time point, but not at the pre-vaccine time point. Subjects with a positive response at baseline for a specific marker were excluded (referred to as modified intention to treat (MITT) population). The humoral immune response was also analyzed with R. Chi-8173 square test was applied for testing the statistical difference between treatment groups for the rate of subjects who seroconverted and who were seroprotected. ANOVA or T-test was applied to analyze the change in HAI-titer (ratio) across the treatment groups. Throughout the analyses, a p-value of 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Participant Characteristics In total 245 males and females aged 18-60 years were screened for trial participation (Figure 1). Among those, 20 subjects were screening failures and were not enrolled in the study. Of the eligible 225 subjects who were randomized, 4 withdrew their study participation (1 subject after randomization, 3 after the first vaccination) and 2 were lost to follow-up (Figure 1). In total 219 subjects completed the whole study.

The majority (320 AEs, 75%) were unrelated or unlikely to be related to the study medication. Among the possibly, probably and definitely related AEs, the intensity was mostly mild and not higher than moderate (Table 2); only three related moderate AEs were reported (injection site pain, injection site hematoma and headache). Injection site pain and induration were the most frequently reported related AEs. These AEs were short lasting (1-5 days), with a maximum duration of 8 days for one subject. 3 SAEs (pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, vaginal prolapse), each of which were unrelated to the study treatment, were reported by 2 subjects. 8175 Table 2 Adverse events probably, possibly and definitely related to the study treatment ITT population Adverse eventTreatment group 1 (low dose M-001) N = 75Treatment group 2 (high dose M-001) N = 74Treatment group 3 (saline) N = 75 Subjects Events Subjects Events Subjects Events n % n % n % n % n % n % General disorders and administration site conditions Chills Mild 1 1.4 1 1.4 1 1.3 1 1.3 Fever Mild 1 1.3 1 1.3 Hematoma injection siteMild 4 5.3 4 5.3 1 1.4 1 1.4 1 1.3 1 1.3 Moderate 1 1.3 1 1.3 Induration Mild 1 1.4 1 1.4 Injection site erythemaMild 3 4.1 4 4.0 3 4.1 4 5.4 4 5.3 5 6.7 Injection site indurationMild 4 5.3 4 5.3 10 13.5 10 13.5 3 4.0 3 4.0 Injection site pain Mild 8 10.7 11 14.7 9 12.2 11 14.9 6 8.0 6 8.0 Moderate 1 1.3 1 1.3 Injection site pruritus Mild 2 2.7 3 4.0 4 5.4 5 6.8 Injection site redness Mild 4 5.3 4 5.3 Injection site swelling Mild 3 4.0 3 4.0 4 5.4 5 6.8 3 4.0 3 4.0 Injection site warmth Mild 1 1.3 2 2.7 3 4.1 3 4.1 1 1.3 1 1.3 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Myalgia Mild 1 1.4 1 1.4 Pain in extremity Mild 3 4.0 3 4.0 2 2.7 2 2.7 1 1.3 1 1.3 Nervous system disorders Headache Moderate 1 1.3 1 1.3 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders PruritusMild 1 1.4 1 1.4 Vascular disorders Circulatory collapse Mild 1 1.3 1 1.3 N = total number of subject's treatment group; n = total number of subjects experiencing specific adverse event or total number of adverse events; % = n / N 8176 Cellular immunity According to the MITT analyses, the high dose treatment group showed a statistically significant increase in IFN-g, IL-2 and TNF-a from CD4-positive T-cells on Day 42 (p 0.05) (Table 3, Figure 2), compared to immunization with M-001 alone. The low dose treatment group showed a statistically significant increase in both IFN-g and IL-2 from CD4 positive T-cells. Also, a small, but not statistically significant, increase in IL-4, IL-17 and CD107a from CD4 positive T-cells was observed, especially in the high treatment group. CD8+ T-cell response was low and no statistically significant difference was found between the treatment groups.

The study confirms previous findings regarding the safety of M-001 at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg when administered twice intramuscularly [11]. A statistically significant increase in CD4+ T-cells that produce Th1 cytokines was observed for both treatment groups, while no significant increase in CD8+ T-cells was detected. Moreover, the vaccine did not prime the antibody response against the investigational pre-pandemic H5N1 influenza vaccine though significant enhanced HAI responses were observed towards a non-vaccine strain. The majority of AEs were not related to the study treatment. Those which were related were mostly mild and did not have an intensity higher than moderate. All related AEs were transient. This is in line with previous clinical trials evaluating M-001 [9, 10]. Related AEs were mostly local events, such as injection site erythema and induration. No statistically significant difference between the number of events or subjects experiencing a specific AE was observed between the treatment and control groups. This study therefore further confirms the positive safety and tolerability profile of M-001. The administration of high dose (1.0 mg) M-001 resulted in a statistically significant increased proportion of CD4+ IFN-g+, IL-2 + and TNF-a+ PBMCs. Administration of the low dose (0.5mg) resulted in a significant increase in CD4+ IFN-g + and IL-2+ PBMCs. The finding of an increase in IFN-g CD4+ T-cells is in line with previous M-001 studies [11]. The further evaluation of the immune response revealed that, compared to saline, a significantly higher proportion of subjects in both the low and high dose treatment groups secreted two of the three cytokines simultaneously. The increase in these three markers indicates that M-001 induces mainly a Th1 response which is important for viral clearance. Studies have shown a relationship between influenza disease severity and pre-existing CD4+ T-cells in adults naive to a particular strain. These pre-existing CD4+ T-cells, which responded to influenza internal proteins, were associated with lower virus shedding and less severe illness, implying that CD4+ T-cells activated during a previous infection could limit disease severity in the absence of specific antibodies [17, 18]. It should be further explored if multiple-cytokines were co-produced by a CD4+ T-cell. The advantage of such a multiple cytokine response is discussed by Kannaganat et al ., showing that, multiple-cytokine-producing antiviral CD4 T-cells are functionally superior to single-cytokine-producing cells. Their results demonstrate a strong positive association between the cytokine coproduction capacity of a virus-specific CD4 T -cell and its other functional characteristics and suggest that vaccines should aim to elicit T -cells that coproduce more than one cytokine as shown with M-001 [19]. No influenza-specific CD8+ T-cell response was detected after vaccination, in contrast to a previous trial evaluating the cellular immune response in elderly people (> 65 years). In that previous trial, a significant elevation of IFN-g+ CD8+ T-cells was observed 21 days after the second intramuscular injection of 0.5 mg M-001. It is unclear why such elevation 8181 was not observed in this current trial. It could be that a CD8+ T-cell response occurred but peaked before day 21, since the optimal timing for the evaluation of CMI is 10-14 days after vaccination [20]. Otherwise in elderly the Th1/Th2 and CD4/CD8 balance might be different then in younger adults [14]. We found no priming effect of M-001 for the pre-pandemic H5N1 investigational vaccine. In previous clinical trials the prime-boost schedule was used to show M-001's potential to protect by indirectly inducing elevated HAI responses when M-001 was used as primer a few weeks before administration of an HA-based vaccine such as TIV. The pandemic vaccine used in this trial was AlPO 4-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine. In another trial that evaluated the immunity to different doses of the H5N1 vaccine, the administration of a single adjuvant dose of 6 mcg and 12 mcg was highly effective: the single administration of 6 mcg or 12 mcg induced 70% seroconversion whereas administration of 3.5 mcg induced 37.7% seroconversion [21]. Therefore, it was decided in this trial to use a partial dose of 3 mcg, which was expected to induce ~40% seroconversion. However, seroconversion in all treatment groups (including placebo) in this current trial was only ~10% for the pandemic vaccine strain. It might be that in the absence of memory responses to avian influenza strains, the low content of HA in the partial dose of H5N1 vaccine was insufficient to induce an immune response. An elevation in the proportions of seroconversion and the HAI mean ratio was observed toward the non-vaccine A/Turkey/Turkey/1/2005 strain, however it is unclear why an elevation was only seen for this strain. The elevation in CD4+ T-cells indicate M-001's potential to serve as a broad-spectrum influenza vaccine since such elevation is associated with lower virus shedding and less severe illness. However, additional trials are needed to further assess M-001's potential as a broadly protective and long-lasting influenza vaccine. In particular, future studies should assess the clinical efficacy (reduction in incidence of influenza infections or its severity) of the vaccine and its cross-protection ability. Future studies will use high dose (1.0 mg) of M-001 since this dose is more immunogenic than the low dose and similarly safe and tolerable. REGISTRATION EudraCT number: 2015-001979-46.

Modifying virological factors such as the effect of vaccine match status and circulating influenza virus (sub)types/lineages ( Chapter 2 ) as well as methodological factors as the definition of the control group ( Chapter 3 ) were evaluated. In the second part of this thesis, the safety and tolerability of vaccine adjuvants that are used in formulations in pre-marketing influenza vaccine trials were evaluated ( Chapters 4 and 5 ). In the final part of this thesis, we presented an overview on guidelines for ethical and competent authority approval for a pre-registration vaccine trial in different European countries ( Chapter 6 ). In addition, the clinical evaluation of a novel influenza vaccine concept in a pre-registration phase two trial was presented ( Chapters 7 and 8 ). Influenza vaccine effectiveness in the Netherlands The effectiveness of currently marketed influenza vaccines is particularly low when the vaccine strains do not match the circulating viruses and when A(H3N2) is the dominant influenza virus ( Chapter 2 ). A vaccine mismatch has occurred in more than half of the past influenza seasons in the Netherlands (seven out of the 11 seasons from 2003/2004 until 2013/2014). Low vaccine effectiveness for the A(H3N2) influenza virus subtype has been found in other studies [1,2]. The low effectiveness might be explained by virological and epidemiological differences between influenza viruses. The influenza A(H3N2) virus has shown to have a higher mutation rate compared to the A(H1N1) and B viruses, and it is associated with more (severe) infections [3-5]. This could result in a different number of cases in each influenza season, and consequently affect the influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE). For several seasons, there was an inconsistency between the vaccine match status and the A(H3N2) IVE, i.e., an absence of effect was found despite a vaccine match. One of the speculations is that vaccination in a prior year influences the effects of influenza vaccination in the current season [6]. It has been hypothesized that repeated vaccination might negatively interfere with the effectiveness of a current vaccine. The immunologic mechanism is not exactly known, but it may be explained by the phenomenon that antibodies of persons who are vaccinated against influenza in a previous season will cross-react with the vaccine antigen given in a current season [7,8]. As a consequence, the effectiveness of a current vaccine may be reduced [8]. This effect is postulated to be greater when the antigenic distance between the vaccines is small and especially when the previous vaccine does not match the circulating strains [6,8]. Several papers did not find any evidence for such a negative interference while others did [7,9-11]. Recent studies show that, when such a detrimental effect was detected, this was especially pertaining to the influenza A(H3N2) virus subtype [6,7,11,12]. Hence, this phenomenon might also, in part, be an explanation for the low IVE estimates for A(H3N2) found in Chapter 2. Such an effect could, unfortunately, not be addressed in our studies since no information on prior vaccinations was present. Another explanation for low vaccine effectiveness pertains to the growing of the vaccines in eggs. For example, in the 2012/2013 9188 season, the low vaccine effectiveness was not caused by an antigenic drift but by mutations in the egg-adapted A(H3N2) vaccine strain [13,14]. From a methodological point of view, the definition of the control group may also influence IVE estimates in test-negative case control design studies ( Chapter 3 ). In Chapter 3, we concluded that controls who tested negative for influenza and other respiratory viruses (pan-negative controls) seem less valid as a control group since a high proportion of patients in this group likely visits the general practitioner because of a non-infectious cause of an influenza-like illness (ILI). In this control group compared to the other control groups, patients were, on average, older and had a higher prevalence of chronic diseases. When using controls that were positive for another respiratory virus (non-influenza positive controls), the IVE estimates were more consistent with previous effectiveness studies and clinical trial data. According to several other researchers, the non-influenza virus positive control group is also the best control group to use since the presence of differential misclassification is highly unlikely because there is a confirmed infectious cause of ILI in both cases and controls [15-17]. A recent meta-analysis from Feng et al . including our study and eleven other studies which also estimated the IVE with three control groups (all influenza negative, non-influenza virus positive and pan-negative) did not find any difference in the IVE estimates based on the control group that was used. According to the investigators, influenza-negative controls are likely to produce vaccine effectiveness results that are just as reliable as the other control groups due to the absence of virus interference [18]. The test-negative design is commonly applied since, compared to other observational studies, it introduces less confounding and misclassification errors because cases and controls are selected from the same source population, and the influenza infection status is known of all of the patients [19,20]. However, the study design is still vulnerable to confounding, selection bias, and limited applicability. For example, the elderly and the patients with a chronic disease could be more frequently selected for influenza virus infection detection since they are at a higher risk of developing severe influenza complications, and might be more susceptible to health care-seeking behavior. The influenza vaccination coverage in such at-risk patient groups is also higher. Moreover, selected patients are not a representative sample of patients in the population since most persons with ILI will not visit their general practitioner; therefore, the vaccine effectiveness from the test-negative design cannot be interpreted as vaccine effectiveness against infection in the total targeted population [19]. Also, the specificity and sensitivity of the laboratory test used to detect influenza virus infection, and thereby the classification of cases and controls, influences the 'true' estimation of the vaccine effectiveness [19,21]. Future studies using the test-negative design should take into account these confounding factors and uncertainties by adjusting for potential confounders (e.g., age, presence of chronic medical conditions, previous vaccination status). Further exploration of effect modification on the IVE estimates against (different) virus subtypes is needed. 9189 Safety and tolerability evaluation of vaccine adjuvants A strategy to improve the immune response to vaccine antigens is the incorporation of an adjuvant into a vaccine formulation. The inclusion of an adjuvant has several advantages such as the enhancement of the immunogenicity of antigens and a reduction of the amount of antigen. However, the adjuvant should have an acceptable balance between the beneficial effects on the immune response and the risk of local and systemic adverse events [22]. In Chapters 4 and 5 we evaluated the safety and tolerability of adjuvants that are currently under investigation in pre-marketing influenza vaccine clinical trials. Based on the evaluated limited number of studies, we found no specific concern for the evaluated adjuvants Montanide ISA 51 TM (ISA 51), QS-21, and ISCOMATRIX, but we advise caution especially when using ISA 51. Safety concerns with respect to the use of adjuvants in vaccines have been raised over a long period of time, and many adjuvants have been developed in the past but were never accepted for routine vaccination due to these concerns [22]. Safety concerns have also been raised for licensed adjuvants, such as during the 2009 influenza pandemic for an AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine (Pandemrix \u00ae). The administration of Pandemrix\u00ae was associated with an increase in narcolepsy cases in children and adolescents, and it was hypothesized that this was caused by the oil-in-water adjuvant AS03. In both Sweden and Finland, an increase in childhood narcolepsy cases was reported in the months after introduction of the vaccine [23,24]. Other studies conducted in Ireland, England, Norway, and France also found increased narcolepsy incidences in young children and adolescents (until the age of 20 years) associated with Pandemrix \u00ae [25-29]. In Canada, where another AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine (Arepanrix \u00ae) was used, fewer incidences of narcolepsy cases were reported than in Europe [30]. In contrast, to date, no subject who received an MF59-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine (Focetria \u00ae) was reported as having narcolepsy [31]. Another important finding during the pandemic in China where there was a significant increase in narcolepsy cases independent of the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination implies that vaccine-associated narcolepsy may not only have been caused by the AS03 adjuvant alone [32,33]. The causal relationship with narcolepsy may be explained by the differences in the amounts of nucleoprotein in the vaccines; a conserved epitope of the nucleoprotein might have triggered a cross-reactive immune response to receptors in the brain which are associated with the development of narcolepsy. Pandremix \u00ae had the highest nucleoprotein quantity compared to Arepranix \u00ae and Focetria \u00ae. The adjuvant could have boosted the immune response, generating higher amounts of antibodies cross-reacting with the specific receptors in the brain and thereby accelerating the time to develop narcolepsy [29]. The European Medicine's Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded in 2012 that an increased risk of narcolepsy was seen in several countries and that this cannot be ruled out for other countries [34]. The uncertainties about the safety of AS03 in the pandemic vaccine highlights our findings in Chapters 4 and 5 where we concluded that an appropriate trial design including at least a large enough active control group with only the adjuvant under study is desired for future trials that evaluate adjuvanted-vaccines. 9190 Ethical and competent authority approval of clinical trials Before any clinical trial can start, ethical and competent authority approval needs to be obtained. The European Union (EU) Directive 2001/20/EC was implemented in 2001 with the aim to harmonize the national procedures for the ethical approval of clinical trials in EU Member States ( Chapter 7 ). However, the directive has been implemented differently in the national laws of Member States since directives are only binding to the result that has to be achieved. In Chapter 7, we have illustrated these differences in the ethical and competent authority review procedures in five EU countries for a vaccine trial. We found differences among the countries in the documents that have to be submitted for the review procedures, the submission procedures, language requirements, organization of the ethics committees (e.g., national, regional, institutional), and the role of the competent authority in the approval procedure. Especially for multicenter trials, it is difficult and expensive to carry out cross-border trials since a single opinion is required from each Member State that will participate. In 2014, the EU adopted a new clinical trial regulation which is directly applicable for EU Member States and will repeal Directive 2001/20/EC if the regulation is implemented [35]. It is now forecasted that the implementation will occur in 2019 [36]. The aim of this regulation is to harmonize the national ethical approval procedures by, e.g., an installment of an EU portal for the application procedure and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of clinical trial applications [37]. For multinational trials, this still means that the ethical approval is carried out by each concerned Member State. One part of the application (e.g., relevance of the trial, investigator's brochure, requirements concerning the manufacturing, labelling) will be assessed by a reporting Member State, and the assessment report drafted by the reporting Member State should be reviewed by all concerned Member States. The reporting Member States shall take into account all considerations of the concerned Member States before sending the assessment report to the sponsor of a trial. In addition, all concerned Member States should evaluate country specific documents (e.g., informed consent, rewarding and compensation of subjects, insurance) [38]. The new regulation will have several important consequences for the Member States such as the dual approval by an ethics committee and the competent authority. For example, in the Netherlands, the competent authority will no longer have a role in the assessment of a clinical trial, as this will only be done by the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (CCMO) or a medical research committee. The CCMO will have an important coordinating role in assigning a study to a medical research committee or the CCMO and in the communication with other Member States in the case of a multinational trial [36]. Also, the ambitious shorter timelines for the evaluation process and the collaboration between different Member States for multinational trials are interesting new challenges which have to be dealt with by all Member States when the regulation comes into force in 2019 [36]. Time has to show if this regulation will indeed harmonize the procedures of the Member States without having any consequences on the number of trial applications and delay in the launching of a trial. 9191 Clinical evaluation of broad-spectrum influenza vaccine Finally, as described in Chapter 2 , a mismatch between the circulating virus strains and vaccine strains occurs frequently resulting in a suboptimal IVE. In addition to other limitations of currently marketed influenza vaccines (e.g., yearly update, selection of vaccine strains based on HAI assays with ferret anti-sera, egg-based production), there is a quest for influenza vaccines that give the target population broad protection against multiple influenza virus strains. The protocol of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled phase IIb trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of such a vaccine is described in Chapter 7 . Healthy volunteers aged 18-60 years were randomized 1:1:1 to receive two administrations of Multimeric-001 (M-001) at a low (0.5 mg) or high dose (1.0 mg) or saline as a placebo. All of the subjects received an investigational aluminum phosphate gel (AlPO 4) adjuvanted pre- pandemic H5N1 influenza vaccine as a third administration. M-001's potential as a standalone vaccine and to act as a primer for the investigational H5N1 vaccine was assessed. M-001 was proven to be safe and was able to increase CD4+ T-cells with both doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg (Chapter 8 ). M-001 was able to increase CD4+ IFN- +, IL-2+ and TNF-a+ cells which implies a T-helper 1 (Th1) cell response. These cytokines promote different mechanisms such as the production of antibodies via the activation of B-cells and they activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes [39]. Moreover, studies show that CD4+ T-cells might also act as antiviral cytotoxic T-cells themselves and, therefore, may have a direct effect [40,41]. In contrast to previous studies with M-001, we found no appreciable difference between the treatment groups in the induction of CD8+ T-cells, that are important for the direct killing of influenza virus-infected cells [42,43]. Though there appeared to be a small increase in antibody titers for the drifted H5N1 A/Turkey/Turkey/1/2005 strain in individuals primed with M-001, no appreciable priming effect for the H5N1 investigational vaccine was observed. This low response might be explained by the low dose of hemagglutinin (3 \u00b5g instead of 6 \u00b5g in the marketed vaccine) in the investigational H5N1 vaccine. This may have resulted in insufficient induction of an immune response in the absence of memory responses to avian influenza strains. Vaccines such as M-001 that induce a cellular immune response by targeting conserved internal influenza proteins may have the potential to mediate an immune response against several virus strains. Hence, such vaccines will not prevent an influenza infection but can play an important role in viral clearance and, therefore, in the reduction of influenza disease severity. Studies have shown that pre-existing virus-specific CD8+ T-cells in humans were correlated with less severe illness during the 2009 pandemic in the absence of cross reactive neutralizing antibodies [44]. Another study showed that CD4+ T-cells and not CD8+ T-cells activated by an earlier infection were associated with lower virus shedding and less severe illness in the absence of any detectable neutralizing antibodies [45]. This points out the ability of vaccines that target T-cells to protect against new seasonal and even future pandemic virus strains [46]. The induction of a Th1 response is especially important for elderly people since, with aging, a decline in Th1 relative to Th2 cytokine production occurs [47,48]. This 9192 shift is considered to be related with a decrease in the recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells and, consequently, an increased risk of influenza illness [39,47]. The stimulation of a Th1 response could, therefore, provide a more effective protection in older adults [47,48]. Future perspectives In order for M-001 to be marketed as a broadly reactive (or universal) influenza vaccine further work has to be carried out. It should be proven that M-001 is able to reduce the incidences of influenza infections (clinical efficacy) and that the vaccine is able to induce a more durable, long-term, immune response [46]. In addition, its safety and immunogenicity among the target group for influenza vaccination should be proven. Moreover, in general, other issues still have to be clarified regarding the breadth of protection that has to be afforded by a 'universal' influenza vaccine, the regulatory pathway to licensure, and the evaluation methods of the immunogenicity and the clinical efficacy. Evaluation methods other than the HAI assay should be developed to assess immunogenicity since influenza vaccines that target conserved epitopes other than the HA globular head region of the influenza virus do not have any hemagglutination capacity. Furthermore, for the evaluation of the novel vaccines that mainly target the cellular immune response, new assays should be developed, and new correlates of protection need to be identified and validated. The inclusion of an adjuvant in a universal influenza vaccine should be considered with caution. Novel vaccines which are currently being evaluated might need an adjuvant to enhance the immune response, however, our studies and the Pandremix\u00ae affair shows that a good safety evaluation is needed before such a vaccine can be marketed. The underlying mechanism of adverse events caused by adjuvanted vaccines is very complex. When a 'universal' vaccine that can give the population broad protection against multiple influenza strains can be marketed, this will mean a breakthrough in influenza vaccine research and public health. The yearly prediction of circulating influenza strains for vaccine formulations and the yearly vaccination campaigns could belong to the past. Also, the time-dependent egg-production will no longer be needed since the production of novel vaccines that are currently in the development pipeline are not egg-dependent [49]. For the pharmaceutical industry that produces the current registered influenza vaccines, this will mean that the production and sale strategies need to be changed. As some companies are already investigating, the development and/or production of universal influenza vaccines should be high on the priority list. The government should have an important role by stimulating the pharmaceutical industry to switch gears or to fund small and medium enterprises that produce universal influenza vaccines. Most importantly, when a universal influenza vaccine can be marketed, it can further reduce the mortality and morbidity rates from influenza. Such a vaccine has the potential to substantially reduce the social and economic impact of influenza virus infections since it might protect the general population against both seasonal and pandemic influenza. However, to be able for a universal influenza vaccine to truly have this unprecedented large beneficial effect, 9193 efforts should be continued to increase the influenza vaccination coverage. For example, in the Netherlands, vaccination coverage has been dropping by a few percent each year since the 2009 pandemic until even 50% in 2015 among the total target group for influenza vaccination [50]. The population should be accurately informed about the working mechanism of such a universal vaccine and the importance of vaccination (e.g., reduced risk of severe illness, complications, protection of vulnerable patients). Current research on other administration routes of the influenza vaccine could also contribute to the increase in the vaccination coverage. Currently licensed vaccines and vaccines under development are mainly administered by the parenteral route (intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intradermal). Parenteral administration has several disadvantages, especially for third world countries, such as the need of trained healthcare workers, limited acceptance due to needle phobia, and the need for clean disinfected water for reconstruction of the vaccine [51-53]. The pulmonary delivery of an antigen might, for example, have several advantages over parenteral administration. The administration is non-invasive and it may induce, in contrast to parenteral administered vaccines, both local (mucosal) and systemic immune responses since the antigen is directly delivered at the 'porte d'entr\u00e9e' of the pathogen. Therefore, the pulmonary delivery could best mimic the induction of the immune response in the respiratory tract after a natural infection by a pathogen [52,54]. Moreover, for influenza, the mucosal immune response may give broader protection rather than only inducing systemic immune response since mucosal antibodies are more cross reactive [55,56]. Therefore, for example, a universal influenza vaccine delivered by a dry powder inhaler that is cheap to manufacture and easy to use would be the ideal influenza vaccine; such an administration is currently under investigation [51]. A dry powder vaccine also does not need a cold-chain since dry powder formulations have increased stability and longer shelf life compared to liquid formulations. Most of the currently available influenza vaccines should be stored at 2 to 8 oC. However, when the temperature is too high or too low, the vaccine might lose its potency due to damage to the vaccine content. Therefore, a cold chain should be organized to make sure that the vaccine is stored at the correct temperature from the manufacture until the point of vaccination [57,58]. However, this is especially a challenge in third world countries. When an influenza vaccine that does not need a cold chain can be marketed, this could contribute to the increase in the vaccination coverage and health equity [58].9194 CONCLUSION Both virological and methodological factors influence influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates when using the test-negative case-control study. These factors should be taken into account when estimating vaccine effectiveness and interpreting the estimates. The effectiveness of currently marketed influenza vaccines in the Netherlands is low, especially for the A(H3N2) influenza virus. Adjuvants could be used to increase efficacy, however, the inclusion of an adjuvant should be considered with caution because of the associated adverse events. To accurately address the safety of vaccine adjuvants and adjuvanted vaccines, appropriate trial designs including a large enough active control group and a standardized reporting system for adverse events are required. The frequent mismatch between the vaccine and circulating virus strains over the past decade in the Netherlands highlights the need for influenza vaccines that protect the target population against a broader spectrum of influenza virus strains. A universal influenza vaccine could make sure that the uncertainties in the process of the yearly prediction of the circulating strains, the selection of the vaccine strains, and egg-dependent production belong to the past. M-001 has the potential to mediate an immune response against several influenza viruses and, therefore, to cause a breakthrough in the influenza vaccine market and public health. However, further research is needed to assess M-001's potential such as its clinical efficacy and the ability to induce a durable, long-lasting immune response. 9195 REFERENCES 1.

Accessed September 1, 2017198 199 SUMMARY Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza virus infections and related diseases. Currently, the influenza vaccine has to be updated annually due to antigenic drift of the virus. Despite the yearly update, the influenza vaccine effectiveness varies per season, per country, and even per influenza (sub)type/lineage. Efforts are being made to develop influenza vaccines that give the population broad protection against multiple influenza virus strains (a 'universal' influenza vaccine). In Chapter 2, we estimated the influenza vaccine effectiveness over 11 seasons in the Netherlands using the test-negative design (TND) case-control study and investigated the effect of vaccine match status and circulating influenza virus (sub)types/lineages. In seven out of the 11 influenza seasons, the vaccine strains did not match the circulating strains. In general, the vaccine showed the highest protective effect when the vaccine strains matched with the circulating viruses and was particularly low when the vaccine did not match with the circulating viruses and when influenza A(H3N2) was the dominant virus subtype. Also, the control group used in the TND case-control study influences the influenza vaccine effectiveness estimate. In Chapter 3, we estimated the influenza vaccine effectiveness using all influenza negative patients (all patients tested negative for influenza virus infection), non-influenza virus positive patients (patients tested negative for influenza virus but positive for another respiratory virus), and pan-negative patients (negative for influenza and other respiratory viruses). We concluded that pan-negative patients seem less valid as a control group since a high proportion of patients in this group likely visits the general practitioner because of a non-infectious cause of influenza-like illness. Patients in this group were, on average, older and the prevalence of any chronic disease was higher compared to the cases and other control groups. The influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates when using non-influenza positive controls were more consistent with previous effectiveness studies and clinical trial data likely due to limiting controls without an infectious cause of a respiratory disease. A strategy to increase the efficacy of an influenza vaccine is the incorporation of an adjuvant. However, the inclusion of an adjuvant should be justified and should have an acceptable balance between the beneficial effects on the immune response and the risk of local and systemic adverse events. In Chapters 4 and 5, we assessed the safety and tolerability of adjuvants that are currently being tested in pre-registration clinical trials for (universal) influenza vaccines. Based on the evaluated limited number of studies, we found no specific concern for the adjuvants Montanide ISA 51 TM (ISA 51), QS-21, and ISCOMATRIX, but we advise caution especially when using ISA 51. This is based on the reported serious adverse events and premature termination of two controlled trials with healthy subjects using ISA 51. Studies have shown that the adverse events might be preventable to a certain extent with the proper mixing of the antigen with ISA 51 to a stable emulsion by using two-syringe mixing instead of vortex-mixing. We advised in both chapters that future studies evaluating adjuvanted-vaccines should include an active control group (only antigen or antigen with a licensed adjuvant) and that a standard coding system for adverse events should be used. This 200 is recommended in order to accurately address the safety and tolerability of a vaccine adjuvant and to be able to present a complete overview of the occurrence and frequency of adverse events experienced by trial subjects. Before a clinical trial can start, ethical and competent authority approval needs to be obtained. In Chapter 6, we assessed the differences in the ethical approval and competent authority authorization procedure for a vaccine trial under EU Directive 2001/20/EC in five European countries. We found differences among the countries in the documents that have to be submitted for the review procedures, the submission procedures themselves (e.g., digital, on paper, web-portal), language requirements of the documents, the organization of the ethics committee (e.g., national, regional, institutional), and the role of the competent authority in the approval procedure (marginal review vs. complete review). Especially for multicenter trials, it is difficult and expensive to carry out cross-border trials since a positive opinion is required from each Member State where a trial will be conducted. A more harmonized procedure, therefore, is desirable. Time has to show if the new clinical trial regulation will indeed harmonize these procedures among EU Member States. Finally, Chapter 7 describes the protocol of a multicenter, randomized, double blind, and controlled phase IIb trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a universal influenza vaccine (Multimeric-001, M-001) both as a standalone vaccine and as a pandemic primer. Healthy volunteers aged 18-60 years were randomized 1:1:1 to receive two administrations of M-001 at a low (0.5 mg) or high dose (1.0 mg) or saline as a placebo. All of the subjects received an investigational aluminum phosphate gel adjuvanted H5N1 pre-pandemic influenza vaccine as a third administration. In Chapter 8, we showed that the vaccine was proven to be safe and able to increase CD4+ IFN- +, IL2+ and TNF-+ cells after stimulation with influenza peptides. Such an elevation implies an influenza-specific T-helper 1 (Th1) cell response. In contrast to previous studies with M-001, no appreciable difference was found among the treatment groups in the CD8+ T-cell response. Though there appeared to be a small increase in antibody titers for a drifted H5N1 strain, no priming effect for the H5N1 investigational strain was found. The elevation in CD4+ T-cells indicate M-001's potential to serve as a broad spectrum influenza vaccine since such an elevation is associated with lower virus shedding and less severe illness. Additional trials are needed to further assess M-001's potential. Future studies should especially assess its ability to reduce the incidence of influenza infections.201 NEDERLANDSE SAMENV (sub)types/lijnen onderzocht.
