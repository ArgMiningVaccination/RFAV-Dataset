Vol. 04-8Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is published once each month by the Department of Administration, Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a monthly compilation of all administrative rule-making documents in Idaho. The Bulletin publishes the official rulemaking notices and administrative rule text of state agency rulemakings and other official documents as necessary. State agencies are required to provide public notice of rulemaking activity and invite public input. The public receives notice of rulemaking activity through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and the Legal Notice published monthly in local newspapers. The Legal Notice provides reasonable opportunity for public input, either oral or written, which may be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the Rulemaking Notice published in the Bulletin. After the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all information submitted in regard to the rule. Comment periods are not provided in temporary or final rule-making activities. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is cited by year and issue number. For example, Bulletin 02-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2002; Bulletin 03-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2003. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; Volume No. 02 -1 refers to January 2002; Volume No. 03 -2 refers to February 2003; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January of 2003 is cited as Volume 03-1. The December 2002 Bulletin is cited as Volume 02-12. RELATIONSHIP TO THE I DAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is published once a year and is a compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules in effect in Idaho. In an effort to provide the reader with current, enforceable rules, temporary rules are also published in the Administrative Code. Temporary rules and final rules that have been approved by the legislature during the legislative session, and published in the monthly Idaho Administrative Bulletin, supplement the Administrative Code. Negotiated, proposed, and pending rules are not printed in the Administrative Code and are published only in the Bulletin. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect, or to determine if a change has occurred, the reader should refer to the Cumulative Index of Administrative RuleMaking , printed in each Bulletin. TYPES OF RULEMAKINGS PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The state of Idaho administrative rulemaking process, governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises five distinct activities: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings involve all five. At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies often engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building in controversial or complex rulemakings. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of administrative rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interest ed parties and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule. Agencies are encouraged, and in some cases requ ired, to engage in this rule making activity whenever it is IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 6 August 4, 2004 - Vol. 04-8feasible to do so. Publication of a \"Notice of Intent to Promulgate\" a rule in the Administrative Bulletin by the agency is optional. This process should result in the formulation of a proposed and/or temporary rule. PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the agency is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a \"Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\" in the Bulletin. This notice must include: a) the specific statutory authority (from Idaho Code) for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the substance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format; d) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule;e) the manner in which persons may make written co mments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to whom comments on the proposal may be sent; f) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation as provided in Section 67-5222, Idaho Code; and g) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may proceed to the pending rule stage. A proposed rule does not have an assigned effective date unless published in conjunction w ith a temporary rule. An agency may vacate a proposed rulemaking if it decides not to proceed further with the promulgation process. TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; or c) conferring a benefit; If a rulemaking meets any one or all of the above requir ements, a rule may become effective before it has been submitted to the legislature for review and the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. However, a temporary rule that imposes a fee or charge may be adopte d only if the Governor finds that the fee or charge is necessary to avoid an immediate danger which justifies the imposition of the fee or charge. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is approved, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution or when the rule has been replaced by a final rule. State law required that the text of both a proposed rule and a temporary rule be published in the Administrative Bulletin. In cases where the text of the temporary rule is the same as the proposed rule, the rulemaking can be done concurrently as a proposed/temporary rule. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 7 August 4, 2004 - Vol. 04-8An agency may, at any time, rescind a temporary rule that has been adopted and is in effect. If the temporary rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or if it has been published concurrently with a proposed rulemaking that is being vacated, the agency, in most inst ances, should rescind the temporary rule. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it become a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\". This includes: a) a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule; b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective; d) an identification of any portion of the rule imposing or increasing a fee or charge. Agencies are required to republish the text of the rule wh en substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that members of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the Section(s) that have changed from the proposed text are re published. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\" is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is in effect and enforceable. No pending rule adopted by an agency will become final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review. Where the legislature finds that an agency has violated the legislative intent of the statute under which the rule was made, a concurrent resolution may be adopted to reject the rulemaking or any part thereof. A \"Notice of Final Rule\" must be published in the Bulletin for any rule that is rejected, amended, or modified by the legislature showing the changes made. A rule that has been reviewed by the legislature and has not been rejected, amended or modified will become final with no further legislative action. No rule shall become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule was submitted for review. However, a rule that is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided in the rule.

Internet Access - The Administrative Code and Administrative Bulletin are available on the Internet at the following address: http://www2.state.id.us/adm/adminrules/ HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin are organized by a numbering system. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections with a number of subsections. An example IDAPA number is as follows: IDAPA 38.07.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"IDAPA 38\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05, which is the Department of Administrations's Division of Purchasing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 9 August 4, 2004 - Vol. 04-8DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. All rulemaking actions (documents) are assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The \"Docket Number\" is a series of numbers separated by a hyphen \"-\", (38-0501-0401). The docket numbers are published sequentially by IDAPA designation (e.g. the two-digit agency code). The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-0401\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"0401\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket r eceived during the year; in th is case the first rule- making action in calendar year 2004. Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (see Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: \"(BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS)\" INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CITATIONS TO ADMINISTRATIVE RULES IN THE CODE AND BULLETIN When making a citation to another Section or Subsection of a rule that is part of the same rule, a typical internal citation may appear as follows: \"...as found in Section 201 of this rule.\" OR \"...in accordance with Subsection 201.06.c. of this rule.\" The citation may also include the IDAPA, Title, or Chapter number, as number of the rule. \"01\" denotes the Chapter number of the rule. : \"201\" references the main Section number of the rule that the citation refers to. Citations made within a rule to a different rule chapter (external citation) should also include the name of the Department and the name of the rule chapter being referenced, as well as the IDAPA, Title, and Chapter numbers. The following is a typical example of an external citation to another rule chapter: \"...as outlined in the Rules of the Department of Administration, IDAPA 38.04.041, \"Rules Governing Capitol Mall Parking.\"IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 10 August 4, 2004 -

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of the supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking : Amendments of the Athletic Commission's statutes by the 2004 Legislature limit unsupervised fighting contests and exhibitions in an effort to protect pub lic health, safety, and welfare. In order to preclude unsupervised fighting contests and exhibitions, all martial arts were included within the definition of boxing. As a result of the new legislation, all activities conducted by martial arts schools located in Idaho will be regulated unless exempted by the Commission. This rule is necessary to en sure that as of July 1, 2004, martial arts schools and martial arts students are able to continue their activities without regulation by the Commission in those areas where public health, safety, and welfare has not historically been subject to abuse or concern. This rule clarifies which martial arts activities are to be regulated (exhibitions and contests wh ich involve combative contact between the contestants and participants) and which martial arts activities are to be deemed exempt from regulation (practices, belt promotion testing and non- combative demonstrations). TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(a), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: Adoption of the rule as a temporary rule with immediat e effect is necessary for co mpliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law. FEE SUMMARY: No fee is being imposed or increased by this rulemaking. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because the rule needs to be effective July 1, 2004 to comply with the effective date of amendments made to Title 54, Chapter 4, Idaho Code, by the 2004 Legislature.

In addition, it may be accessed on the State Department of Education website at http:// www.sde.state.id.us/SpecialEd/. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a statement in nontechnical language of the substance and purpose of the intended negotiated rulemaking and the principle issues involved: Current administrative rules related to Idaho's personnel standards became effective s econdary to State Board of Education and legislative review on April 1, 1997. These st andards set class size ratio goals or teacher load goals for instructional personnel and student to personnel ratios for pupil personnel. The proposed rule change would expand these goals to include special education teachers and speech-language pathologists. The goal of the State Department of Education is to sup port the retention of qualified special education teachers and speech-language pathologists and to ensure the provision of a free appropriate public education to students with disabilities.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed regular rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Section(s) Title 33-105. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than August 18, 2004. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of it supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The rule change provides further clarification between school and district/LEA sanctions for failing to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) under the federal \"No Child Left Behind\" Act (NCLB). Specifically changes were made to rename School Improve ment to distinguish between the plans required for all Idaho schools and that are required for failing to meet AYP. Also, Alternate Governance was renamed \"Restructuring\". Under the federal law, restructuring incl udes two phases: creating a plan for alternative governance and the actual restructuring of a school. This rulemaking clarifies that difference. The rules create a separate District/Local Education Agency (LEA) section to more clearly outline the sanctions that apply only to districts/LEAs and outline the previous sanctions that continue to be applicable with increasing sanctions and years missing AYP. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section(s) 67-5226(1)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: Compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid imme diate danger and the fee is described herein: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted, because this is for clarification purposes.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of the supporting reasons for temporary rulemaking and nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: More stringent accountability requirements for Medicare, Medi caid, and third party payors in the private sector (i.e., insurance companies, benefits management companies, ma naged care groups, etc.) are placing an ever-increasing administrative burden on each and every prescription. This administrative burden on pharmacists creates a negative impact on health care in the state, whic h needs to be dealt with immediately to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. To allow licensed pharmacists adequate time to focus on the pharmacology as pects of the prescription and adequate time to focus on the individual patients and counseling for those patients, there is an immediate need to increase the number of pharmacy technician s per licensed pharmacist from two to three. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(a), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: Adoption of the rule as a temporary rule with immediate effect is necessary fo r the protection of the public health, safety, or welfare. FEE SUMMARY: No fee is being imposed or increased by this rulemaking. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because the rule needs to be effective immediately to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explana tion of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: In June 2003, the Idaho Mining Association (IMA) filed a Petition for Initiation of Rulemaking to revise Idaho's mercury criteria in accordance with new EPA guidance released in November 2002. In Oc tober 2003, the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) initiated negotiated rulemaking to consider IMA's proposed revision and other updates to Idaho's metals criteria that are determined to be necessary and prudent. The text of the proposed rule was developed by DEQ in conjunction with a negotiating committee made up of persons having an interest in the development of this rule. All users of Idaho's waters, part icularly dischargers of mercury and other metals, may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. Six human health criteria for 3 metals have been updated (Sb, Hg, & Zn), including a new fish tissue criterion for methylmercury, which necessitated that the committee and DEQ develop guidance on its implementation. Also updated are eleven aquatic life criteria for six metals (As, Cd , Cr III, Cr IV, Ni, and Zn). DEQ is also proposing to drop the low-end limit on hardness used in application of hardness dependent metals criteria, affecting Cd, Cr III, Cu, Pb, Ni, Ag and Zn criteria in waters with less than 25 mg/L hardness. These changes are based on newer science and aquatic toxicity studies, and, in the case of human health, an updated EPA criteria development methodology. All proposed updates are per the new (2002) EPA recommendations, but not all EPA 2002 recommendations have been proposed for adoption in Idaho. Several of EPA's recommendations were set aside for future action. The two aquatic life criteria for mercury are \"reserved,\" m eaning old existing criteria are removed and no new criteria proposed. Reservation of both the mercury aquatic life criteria is consistent with previous EPA action in promulgation of the California Toxics Rule. It does, however, depart from EPA's 2002 recommendations of 1.4 ug/L dissolved Hg as an acute criterion and 0.77 ug/L as a chronic criterion , which were incorporated in IMA's petition. It is also inconsistent with EPA's mercury criterion document, which calls into question the chronic criterion's adequacy for protecting some species of fish, but does not call into question the recommended acute criterion. DEQ is specifically seeking comment on reservation of the two aquatic life criteria for mercury, or the appropriateness of their adoption in Idaho. EPA's 2002 recommendation on removing the low-end hardness limit implies that metals toxicity versus hardness relations remain linear and extend all the way to zero hardness. Though data exists that shows metals toxicity does DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0102-0302 Water Quality Standards/Wastewater Treatment Requirements Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 190 August 4, 2004 - Vol. 04-8continue to increase at hardness below 25 mg/L, down to 7-10 mg/L, DEQ knows of no data at even lower hardness, and is uncertain whether the hardness-toxicity relations re main linear. Therefore, DEQ is also specifically seeking comment and information on the removal of the low-end hardness limit. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Langua ge the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. While not part of this rulemaking, DEQ is also seeking public comment on the Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria. The Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria and support documents for the criteria changes may be obtained at http://www.deq.state.id.us/rules/58-0102- 0302_proposed.htm or by contacting Don Essig at (208) 373-0119 or dessig@deq.state.id.us. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to pr esent the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in November 2004 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2005 legislative session if approved by the Legislature. IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: The water quality criteria for toxic compounds are not broader in scope or more stringent than federal law or regulations, and do not regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government. Where changes in criteria are proposed, the resu lting criteria are no more st ringent than EPA's current 2002 national recommendations. EPA currently has no guidance on implementation of its recommended fish tissue criterion for methylmercury. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The text of the proposed rule has been drafted based on discussions held during a negotiation conducted pursuant to Idaho Code Section 67-5220 and IDAPA 04.11.01.812 through 815. The Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, October 1, 2003, Volume 03-10, page 585.

CCC = column B2 value X WER. f.Criterion expressed as total recoverable (unfiltered) concentrations. g.If the CCC for total mercury is exceeded more than once in a three (3) year period in ambient water, the edible portion of aquatic species of concern must be analyzed to determine whether the concentration of methyl mercury exceeds the FDA action level (one (1.0) mg/kg). If the FDA action level is exceeded, the Director must notify the EPA regional administrator, initiate a review and as appropriate, revision of its mercury criterion in these water quality standards, and take other appropriate action such as the issuance of fish consumption advisory for the affected area. No aquatic life criterion is adopted for inorganic mercury. However, the narrative criteria for tox- ics in Section 200 of these rules applies. The Department believes application of the human health criterion for methylmercury will be protective of aquatic life in most situations. h.No numeric human health criteria has been established for this contaminant. However, permit authorities should address this contaminant in NPDES permit actions using the narrative criteria for toxics from Section 200 of these rules. i. Aquatic life criteria for these metals are expressed as a function of total hardness (mg/L as calcium carbonate), the pollutant's water effect ratio (WER) as defined in Subsection 210.03. bc.iii and multiplied by an appropriate dissolved conversion factor as defined in Subsection 210.02.

Factors for Calculating Hardness Dependent Metals Criteria . Hardness dependent metals criteria are calculated using values from the following table in the equations: (5-3-03) a.CMC=WER exp{mA[ln(hardness)]+bA} X Acute Conversion Factor. (5-3-03) X Chronic Conversion Factor.m.Aquatic life criteria for pentachlorophenol are expressed as a function of pH, and are calculated as follows. Values displayed above in the table correspond to a pH of seven and eight tenths (7.8). CMC = exp(1.005(pH)-4.830) CCC = exp(1.005(pH)-5.290) n.PCBs are a class of chemicals which include Aroclors, 1242, 1254, 1221, 11096825 and 12674112 respectively. The aquatic life criteria apply to this set of PCBs. o.This criterion applies to total PCBs, (e.g. the sum of all congener, isomer, or Aroclor analyses). p.This fish tissue residue criterion (TRC) for methylmercury is based on a human health reference dose (RfD) of 0.0001 mg/kg body weight-day; a relative source contribution (RSC) estimated to be 27% of the RfD; a human body weight (BW) of 70 kg (for adults); and a total fish consumption rate of 0.0175 kg/day for the general popula- tion, summed from breakdown + TL4 = 0.0057 kg fish/day. This is a criterion that is protective of the general population. A site-specific criterion or a crite- rion for a particular subpopulation may be calculated by using local or regional data, rather than the above default values, in the formula: TRC = [BW x {R fD - (RSCxRfD)}] / waters in habited by species listed as threat- ened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act or designated as their critical habitat, the Department will apply the human health fish tissue residue criterion for methylmercury to the highest trophic level available for sampling and analysis.

Applicability . The criteria established in Section 210 are subject to the general rules of applicability in the same way and to the same extent as are the other numeric chemical criteria when applied to the same use classifications including mixing zones, and low flow design discharge conditions below which numeric standards can be exceeded in flowing waters. (5-3-03) a.For all waters for which the Department has determined mixing zones to be applicable, the criteria apply at the appropriate locations specified within or at the boundary of the mixing zone of the mixing zones; otherwise the criteria apply through the waterbody including at the end of any discharge pipe, canal or other discharge point. (5-3-03) b.Low flow design discharge conditions. Numeric chemical standards can only be exceeded in perennial streams due to permitted discharges when flows are less than the following values: (5-3-03) i. Where \"1Q10\" is the lowest one-day flow with an average recurrence frequency of once in ten (10) years determined hydrologically; (5-3-03) ii. Where \"1B3\" is biologically based and indicates an allowable exceedence of once every three (3) years. It may be determined by EPA's computerized method (DFLOW model); (5-3-03) iii. Where \"7Q10\" is the lowest average seven (7) consecutive day low flow with an average recurrence frequency of once in ten (10) years determined hydrologically; (5-3-03) iv. Where \"4B3\" is biologically based and indicates an allowable exceedence for four (4) consecutive days once every three (3) years.

Where the harmonic mean flow is a long term mean flow value calculated by dividing the number of daily flows analyzed by the sum of th e reciprocals of those daily flows. (5-3-03) c.Application of metals criteria. (5-3-03) i. For purposes of calculating aquatic life criteria for metals from the equations in Subsection 210.02, the minimum hardness allowed for use in those equations shall not be less than twenty-five (25) mg/l, as calcium carbonate, even if the actual ambient hardness is less than twenty-five (25) mg/l as calcium carbonate. The maximum hardness allowed for use in those equations shall not be greater than four hundred (400) mg/l, as calcium carbonate, except as specified in Subsections 210.03.c.ii. and 210.03.c.iii., even if the actual ambient hardness is greater than four hundred (400) mg/l as calcium carbonate. (5-3-03)( ) ii. The hardness values used for calculating aquatic life criteria for metals at design discharge conditions shall be representative of the ambient hardnesses for a receiving water that occur at the design discharge conditions given in Subsection 210.03.b. (5-3-03) iii. Except as otherwise noted, the aquatic life criteria for metals (compounds #1 through #13 in the criteria table of Subsection 210.02) are expressed as diss olved metal concentrations. Unless otherwise specified by the Department, dissolved concentrations are considered to be concentrations recovered from a sample which has passed through a forty-five hundredths (0.45) micron filter. For the purposes of calculating aquatic life criteria for metals from the equations in footnotes e. and i. in the criteria table in Subsection 210.01, the water effect ratio is computed as a specific pollutant's acute or chronic toxicity values measured in water from the site covered by the standard, divided by the respective acute or chronic toxicity value in laboratory dilution water. The water-effect ratio shall be assigned a value of one (1.0), except where the Department assigns a different value that protects the designated uses of the water body from the toxic effects of th e pollutant, and is derived from suitable tests on sampled water representative of conditions in the affected water body, consistent with the design discharge conditions established in Subsection 210.03.b. For purposes of calculating water effects ratios, the term acute toxicity value is the toxicity test results, such as the concentration lethal one-half (1/2) of the test organisms (i.e., LC5O) after ninety- six (96) hours of exposure (e.g., fish toxicity tests) or the effect concentration to one-half of the test organisms, (i.e., EC5O) after forty-eight (48) hours of exposure (e.g., daphnia toxicity tests). For purposes of calculating water effects ratios, the term chronic value is the result from appropriate hypothesis testing or regression analysis of measurements of growth, reproduction, or survival from life cycle, partia l life cycle, or early life stag e tests. The determination of acute and chronic values shall be according to current st andard protocols (e.g., those published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)) or other comp arable methods. For calculation of criteria using site- specific values for both the hardness and the water effect ratio, the hardness used in the equations in Subsection 210.02 shall be as required in Subsection 210.03.c.ii. Wa ter hardness shall be calcula ted from the measured calcium and magnesium ions present, and the ratio of calcium to magnesium shall be approximately the same in laboratory toxicity testing water as in the site water, or be similar to average ratios of laboratory waters used to derive the criteria. (10-24-03)T iv. Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria. ( ) a.The \"Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria\" describes in detail discharge related monitoring requirements, calculation of r easonable potential to exceed (RPTE) water quality criteria in determining need for mercury effluent limits, and use of fish tissue mercury data in calculating mercury load reductions. The Department shall utilize this guidance, or its updates, when implementing the methylmercury criterion. The \"Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria\" also provides basic background information on mercury in the environment, the novelty of a fish tissue criterion for water quality, the connection between human health and aquatic life protection, and the relation of environmental programs outside of Clean Water Act programs to reducing mercury contaminat ion of the environment.

In applying the methylmercury fish tissue criterion in the context of NPDES effluent limits and TMDL load reductions, the Department will assume change in fish tissue concentrations of methylmercury are proportional to change in water body loading of total mercury. Reasonable potential to exceed (RPTE) the fish tissue criterion for existing NPDES sources will be based on measured fish tissue concentrations pote ntially affected by the discharge exceed ing a specified threshold value, based on uncertainty due to measurement variability. This threshold value is also used for TMDL decisions. Because measured fish tissue concentrations do not reflect the eff ect of proposed new or increased discharge of mercury, RPTE in these cases will be based upon an estimated fish tissue methylmercury concentration, using projected changes in waterbody loading of total mercury and a proportional response in fish tissue mercury. For the above purposes, mercury will be measured in the skinless filets of sport fish using techniques capable of detecting tissue concentrations down to point zero five (0.05) mg/kg. Total mercury analysis may be used, but will be assumed to be all methylmercury for purposes of implementing the criterion. ( ) 04. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permitting . For the purposes of NPDES permitting, interpretation and implementation of metals criteria listed in Subsection 210.02 should be governed by the following standards, that are hereby incorporated by reference, in addition to other scientifically defensible methods deemed appropriate by the Department; provided, however, any identified conv ersion factors within these documents are not incorporated by reference. Metals criteria conversi on factors are identified in Subsection 210.02 of this rule.

The action is authorized by Chapters 44 and 58, Title 39, Idaho Code. In addition, 40 CFR 271.21(e) and Section 39-4404, Idaho Code, require DEQ to adopt amendments to federal law as proposed under this docket. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before August 18, 2004. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made no later than five (5) days prior to the hearing. For arrangements, contact the undersigned at (208) 373-0418. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explana tion of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Idaho's Rules and Standards for Hazardous Waste are updated annually to maintain co nsistency with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's federal regulations implementing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as directed by the Idaho Hazardous Waste Manage ment Act (HWMA). Idaho has historically adopted both required and optional federal regulations so that Idaho's ha zardous waste rules are the same as federal requirements. Optional federal regulations usually allow more flexibility to the regulated community; required federal regulations are necessary to maintain program primacy. Adoption by reference allows the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to keep its rules up to date with federal regulation changes and minimizes the EPA Region 10 effort needed to keep Idaho's authorization current. Adoption by referen ce also simplifies compliance for the regulated community. This proposed rule updates citations to the federal regulations incorporated by reference to include those revised as of July 1, 2004. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Langua ge the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to pr esent the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2004 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2005 legislative session if approved by the Legislature. IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: This proposed rule does not regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government, nor is it broader in scope or more stringent than federal regulations. FEE SUMMARY: No fee is being imposed or increased by this rulemaking. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Due to the nature of this rulemaking, negotiations were not held. GENERAL INFORMATION: For more information about DEQ's programs and activities, visit DEQ's web site at www.deq.state.id.us. ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on questions concerning the proposed rulemaking, contact John Brueck at (208)373-0502 or jbrueck@deq.state.id.us. Anyone can submit written comments by mail, fax or e-mail at the address below regarding this proposed rule. The Department will consider all written comments received by the undersigned on or before August 25, 2004.DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0105-0402 Rules and Standards for Hazardous Waste Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 204 August 4, 2004 - Vol. 04-8Dated this 30th day of June, 2004.
