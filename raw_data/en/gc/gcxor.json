Dr. Bach distilled essences from 38 wildflowers, from agrimony to willow, which could be used individually or in combination to promote emotional well-being. Bach\u00ae flower essence training is suitable for traditional and alternative health care practitioners looking for a safe, non-invasive, side-effect-free healing modality that can be used in conjunction with other treatments. Career Overview Practitioners with Bach\u00ae flower essence training come from a range of backgrounds, from [homeopathy](https://www.naturalhealers.com/blog/homeopathy-career/) to nursing to [massage therapy](https://www.naturalhealers.com/massage-therapy/). Because Bach\u00ae flower remedies are gentle, comforting and safe when used by a trained healer, they can be used to treat many complaints in children, adults and even pets: anxiety, trauma, disturbing emotions such as anger or jealousy, and hyperactivity in children. Often, flower essence healing is used in the management of stress. Practitioners perform in-person or telephone consultations to determine the nature of the problem, and select and mix an appropriate combination of flower essences for each patient. Flower essences complement and can be used safely with any medications or healing methods including: drugs, surgery, [acupuncture](https://www.naturalhealers.com/acupuncture/), homeopathy, [chiropractic](https://www.naturalhealers.com/chiropractic/) and [herbal therapies](https://www.naturalhealers.com/blog/herbal-medicine/). Like homeopathy, there is currently no analytical scientific explanation for why flower essences have such a beneficial effect on people. Current work in psycho-neurobiology, physics and philosophy indicate that humans are bi-dimensional beings, both living in the physical world and a world of thought, quantum fields and vibrations. Because of this, flower essence practitioners work in a fascinating field of exploration to help individual patients. Flower Essences Training and Education What You'll Study in Flower Essences School Bach\u00ae flower essence training includes study of Dr. Bach's 38 flower remedies, as well as the philosophy behind Dr. Bach's healing system: self-help and simplicity. More advanced training involves deeper study of the flower remedies and their subtle differences, as well as consultation skills and other professional matters.
