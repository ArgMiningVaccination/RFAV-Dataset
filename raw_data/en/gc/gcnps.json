Eco-Safe Wood Treatment penetrates into wood fibers, reacts with the natural tannins in the wood, and rids the wood of natural sugars that cause wood decay. This permanently changes the wood structure at a molecular level for a preservative, protectant, and stain that will never fade, flake, or peel away. How often do I need to apply ECO-SAFE Wood Treatment? One easy application penetrates wood forever, with no flaking off, no scraping, and no reapplications needed. The product extends the lifetime of the wood. "}
