The name of... Nature Cure Naturopathic medicine follows an holistic approach to health and well-being, with the primary aim of identifying and treating the underlying causes of illness and disease using nutrition, herbal medicines and lifestyle strategies. The core principle of a Naturopathic treatment protocol is 'healing through nature', so treatment will focus on supporting the body's innate self-healing abilities to overcome any health complaints and regain optimal wellbeing, while avoiding the negative side effects often associated with pharmaceutical medications. As both an art and a science, Naturopathy uses a unique combination of both scientific and traditional evidence in order to treat the person, not the disease. With an emphasis on disease prevention, Naturopathic case-taking often uncovers dis-ease long before a diagnosable pathology develops since particular predispositions in the body can often be identified before the onset of acute disease occurs. A Naturopath's ability to apply natural methods of healing is of considerable importance in our modern world, since environmental factors such as stress, technology, environmental pollution and sub-optimal nutrition play a significant role in health degradation. \"Health is the expression of a harmonious balance between various components of man's nature, the environment and ways of life - nature is the physician of disease.\" ~ Hippocrates What Happens During A Naturopath Consultation? An initial Naturopathic consultation will last about an hour and will involve a comprehensive health review including a detailed discussion of the presenting condition(s), relevant body systems, medical history, diet and lifestyle as well as physical examinations such as blood pressure, and nail, tongue and iris analyses. Follow-up pathology testing such as hair, stool and blood analyses may also be required. Once all the required information has been gathered, a treatment protocol that addresses all aspects of the individual's health status will be formulated in order to support the body with healing. The treatment plan may include nutritional supplements, herbal medicine and other suitable remedies as well as advice on diet, lifestyle and exercise. Referrals to other health practitioners may also be necessary as part of the integrated health care approach. Subsequent consultations generally last for about 30 minutes and will involve a progress review to determine whether any changes are required to the initial treatment protocol as well as any follow-up questions and further supportive strategies. The number of sessions needed will depend on your goals, your current state of health and your individual circumstances.
