The departments are Anthropology, English, History, Philosophy, Political Science and Sociology. The three schools are the Brian Lamb School of Communication, the School of Languages and Cultures, and the Patti and Rusty Rueff School of Visual and Performing Arts. The college offers a variety of programs designed to prepare you for continued intellectual growth and provide specialized training in many areas. In order to prepare properly for the challenge of adult life, you will find in the college's programs a broad range of curricula carefully planned to develop your capacities, abilities and skills. As our society becomes increasingly complex with continued reliance on skill and knowledge, we are confronted by the necessity for better understanding and communication among the various segments of society. Scientists, engineers, physicians, artists, lawyers and public officials must speak to each other in terms mutually comprehensible if the values of their specialties are to be transmitted into plans for action. Knowledge of the humanities with their emphasis on the individual, society and their goals; of the social sciences with their analysis of our attempt to understand and guide society; and of education with its emphasis on transmission of accumulated knowledge from one generation to the next plays a central role in facilitating communication among the parts of society. Such knowledge involves balance, tolerance for all facets of knowledge, respect for all useful skills and techniques and, above all, the understanding of ourselves and others. The College of Liberal Arts offers curricula leading to a B.A. degree. Both introductory and advanced education is available. Most students interested in becoming secondary or elementary teachers should make application to the Office of Certification in the College of Education during the sophomore year. Specific offerings and the requirements for degrees are listed in this online resource. Special Programs Clarence E. Dammon Dean's Scholars Program This program offers a select group of first-year students the opportunity to live in a learning community with other high achievers, to meet faculty and administrators at special events, to take a one-credit seminar on undergraduate research and success with the director of honors, and to pursue research with a member of the College of Liberal Arts (CLA) faculty. All incoming students who are awarded either a Trustees Scholarship or Presidential Scholarship or who qualify for the CLA Honors Program are invited to apply. To qualify for the honors program, first-year students need to have a combined SAT score of 1800 or higher, an ACT score of 26 or higher or be in the upper 10 percent of their graduating class. For more about this program, please see the CLA Honors Program website, www.cla.purdue.edu/academics/honors. Honors Program The College of Liberal Arts Honors Program is designed to provide excellent students with enriched, individualized, unusual educational opportunities. Students who qualify for the program have the opportunity to engage in advanced work with individual professors and to take special courses with limited enrollments available only to honors students. They also are permitted to make special arrangements in conjunction with regularly offered courses that will enhance the particular educational experience. The 4 An equal access/equal opportunity university. All contents Copyright \u00a9 2013 Purdue University. All rights reserved. college works with honors students to discover the most imaginative, exciting and intellectually challenging education available for them within the liberal arts at Purdue. Students must have a GPA of 3.3 or better to apply to the Honors Program; however, beginning students may still take honors courses. To register for honors courses, entering students need to have an SAT score of 1800 (combined) or higher, an ACT score of 26 or higher, or be in the upper 10 percent of their graduating class. To graduate with college honors in Liberal Arts, a member of the program must complete at least 24 honors credits during the undergraduate career. The honors experience at Purdue involves numerous activities beyond the classroom. Honors students are given the opportunity to meet leading professors at special events, to talk with visiting speakers and artists and to participate in the annual Honors Colloquium. The College of Liberal Arts wants honors students to develop strong, confident, inquiring minds. To do that, the program transcends the classroom. By introducing students to men and women shaping the future and aware of the limitations of current knowledge, the college helps students to move past the ordinary constraints of learning and gain a vision of that future.

All rights reserved. Graduation Requirements The requirements for the baccalaureate degree are listed on the following Web page: www.cla.purdue.edu/academics/requirements. In addition, the dean of the College of Liberal Arts certifies that students have completed their plans of study. Attainment of the objectives of the College of Liberal Arts is sought in two ways. One is through the specialized knowledge students acquire as they major or minor in one or more of the subject matters offered by the schools and departments in the college. The other is through the opportunity to gain skill and knowledge in other areas of learning through a combination of requirements and free electives. Pass/Not-Pass Grading Option A student must have earned a grade of \"A,\" \"B\" or \"C\" in a course in order to receive a grade of \"P\" (pass). An earned grade of \"D\" or below will result in a grade of \"N\" (not pass). A student enrolled in a course under the pass/not-pass option must fulfill the same requirements in the course as those registered for a letter grade. The \"P\" or \"N\" will appear on the student's academic record in place of a grade but will not be used in computing a grade index; credit toward graduation is earned with a \"P,\" but not granted for an \"N.\" Students enrolled in the College of Liberal Arts may elect to take courses under the pass/not-pass option subject to the following regulations: A. A student must have a classification of 3 or above and a graduation index of 2.0 or above to enroll in a course under the pass/not-pass option. B. A student may not elect the pass/not-pass option for more than 20 percent of the total credit hours required for graduation. C. A student may elect the pass/not-pass option for any course in the University for which he or she is otherwise eligible to enroll for credit and that does not already appear on his or her academic record. D. A student may not elect the pass/not-pass option for any course he or she plans to use to fulfill a departmental or college requirement. E. A student who passes a course required by the College of Liberal Arts under the pass/not pass option while enrolled in another college or school in the University is considered upon transfer to Liberal Arts to have met the Liberal Arts requirement. F. At the time he or she registers, the student will indicate which courses are to be taken under the pass/not-pass option. Standard registration procedures such as the rules governing drop/add, withdrawal from courses, etc., will be followed.

Each school or department specifies whether a major must be accompanied by a minor. This major or area provides the depth necessary for admission to a graduate school as well as for a well-rounded liberal arts education. The number of hours required for teacher education programs may vary from the patterns of programs described above. Students also may complete a minor (12 to 15 hours). See the following list of nonteaching programs for minors offered in the College of Liberal Arts. Teaching certification programs also are included.

For current information, see the appropriate academic advisor in the College of Liberal Arts Academic Advising Office (www.cla.purdue.edu/students/advising/directory.html). Anthropology Students who are anthropology majors explore human diversity across time and space. In coursework, they study the evolutionary adaptations of the human species globally, from earliest times to the present. Students learn about the archaeological study of ancient societies, fossils, human biology, primate behavior, the structure and development of language, and the diversity of world cultures. Anthropologists study the components of cultural systems, such as the anthropology of health, gender, religious belief systems, political economy and the arts. They also study the process of social change and are engaged in addressing global challenges. Anthropology courses provide the foundation for graduate work in archaeology, cultural anthropology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology and other fields. 17 An equal access/equal opportunity university.

American Studies The American Studies program introduces students to the interdisciplinary study of America as a place, a political and social idea, a set of values and traditions, and a people. The major provides students with the opportunity to examine America through the diversity of its ideas, texts, objects, institutions, practices, and histories as well as through the complex social and political relationships that have shaped and continue to shape the world to which they belong. By drawing on a broad range of knowledge from the humanities and social sciences, students learn to think critically across disciplines as they study America in its national and global contexts. The flexibility and small size of the program permits undergraduates to devise an interdisciplinary academic program best suited to their individual needs and academic interests. The American Studies major can often be completed with a second liberal arts major such as English, History, Sociology or Political Science. Students who major in American Studies have pursued careers in law, business, public policy, government, communications, journalism and education. The minor requires two foundation courses (six credit hours) and three additional courses from a selection. At least two courses must be at the 30000 level or higher. 76 An equal access/equal opportunity university. All contents Copyright \u00a9 2013 Purdue University. All rights reserved.

Asian American Studies The undergraduate Asian American Studies Program at Purdue offers students the opportunity to pursue a minor in Asian American Studies. The program focuses on the complex cultural heritage of Asian Americans and provides students a way to deepen their understanding of issues such as ethnicity, gender, identity and racial history, linking the Asian American experience to the development of America and its multicultural consciousness. While the program focuses on the experience of Asians in the United States, it also can give students a perspective on the Asian American experience within transnational and global contexts. As an interdisciplinary minor, it encourages students to pursue issues of Asian Americans within fields such as history, literature, sociology and art. The Asian American Studies minor consists of 15 hours of courses, which must include ASAM 24000 and 34000, two elective courses in diversity, identities and intersectionality, and two courses in Asian history and society. The elective courses can be selected from a variety of courses throughout the schools and departments in the College of Liberal Arts.

Asian Studies The Asian Studies program encompasses East, Southeast, and South Asia, with special attention to the languages and cultures of China and Japan. Designed for students majoring in any discipline, the courses on Asia offer an invaluable supplement for students anticipating professional employment requiring a basic knowledge of an Asian language and culture. The foundation provided by the courses in language, social science and the humanities also will prepare students for advanced study in the Asian field. This interdisciplinary program offers an undergraduate major and an undergraduate minor that includes both a language and cultural component. Each student is expected to complete Level IV in either the Chinese or Japanese language. The minor requires four additional cultural or area courses (12 credit hours) that should be distributed between a selection from at least two of the following disciplines: history, philosophy, political science and literature (offered in the School of Languages and Cultures). The major requires a survey course from a selection (3 credit hours) and seven additional courses (21 credit hours) from a selection. No more than five of the courses chosen to fulfill the requirements may be in any one discipline. At least one course must be at the 40000 level or higher.

Latin American and Latino Studies Latin American and Latino Studies is an interdisciplinary program that brings together the study of Latin America and Latino communities in the U.S. and the Caribbean. In so doing, students are able to engage in the similarities and differences between the histories, cultures, social institutions, and political systems in countries throughout the Americas and in the Caribbean island-nations. In addition, students study the history and influence of European colonization, slavery, migration, cultural and economic trade, transnationality and globalization on the region. This cross-territorial, interdisciplinary approach is what makes Latin American and Latino Studies so exciting. Latin American and Latino Studies works closely with other academic schools, departments and programs on campus, as well as with the Latino Cultural Center. Through cooperative efforts, we offer a rich variety of courses and academic and cultural events that center on specific issues pertinent to Latin American, Latino and Caribbean interests. The Latin American and Latino Studies Program has affiliated faculty in the School of Languages and Cultures and in the departments of Anthropology, English, History and Political Science. The Latin American and Latino Studies program currently offers a 15-credit minor that can compliment any major, especially if you have an interest in internationalizing your course of study and potential career objectives. The minor is designed to introduce students to an interdisciplinary study of the history, peoples, and cultures of Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as the study of Latin American and Caribbean communities in the United States. Students are required to take LALS 25000: Introduction to Latin American and Latino Studies, two courses in Literary and Cultural Studies and two courses in history, philosophy and social sciences. See www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/idis/latin-american for further information. 88 An equal access/equal opportunity university. All contents Copyright \u00a9 2013 Purdue University. All rights reserved. Linguistics The Linguistics program introduces the student to linguistics, the scientific understanding of language as the essential human tool with an ambitious goal of gaining insight into the way the mind works. The central core of the program consists of a small number of courses that deal systematically with various levels of linguistic structure \u2014 sound, sign, word, sentence and meaning. The desired learning outcomes are critical thinking, problem-solving ability, analytical creativity, excellent communication, and professional and personal ethics. The undergraduate major consists of a total of 33 credits. There are four courses in the core (LING 20100, 31100, 31500 and 32100). Beyond the core, those majoring in Linguistics will take two courses in the linguistics of a specific language, two courses in a less-commonly taught language and a three-course elective component. Students working for a minor in Linguistics will take one elective course beyond the core. The 50000-level courses that follow are available to undergraduate or graduate students, and they may be substituted for the undergraduate course in a specific area of linguistics. The Linguistics program encourages students to become directly involved in faculty research, to get hands-on experience in the research process and to take courses from among Purdue's excellent offerings that provide skills, knowledge and experience to distinguish them from the crowd when interviewing for a job. Opportunities with Linguistics faculty exist in the areas of endangered languages, sign-language linguistics, baby's acquisition of language, second-language acquisition in adults, language disorders, neurolinguistics, computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, English as a second language, second-language writing and language-teaching technology (among others).

Medieval and Renaissance Studies The concept of Medieval and Renaissance Studies is an integral part of the tradition of the University. The interdisciplinary major and minor are designed to appeal to students who desire to cultivate a broadly integrated understanding of Western civilization. Unlike the vertical orientations of departmental disciplines, which follow one field of study from its beginnings to the present, the Medieval and Renaissance Studies Program cuts horizontally across 15 subject areas, such as art, architecture, drama, music, literature and philosophy, which were closely related in the Middle Ages. The program presents a variety of ways to acquire perspectives concerning the nature and origins of the world in which we live. The major in Medieval and Renaissance Studies requires a minimum of 33 hours of coursework: 30 hours to be selected from among 70 courses in the School of Languages and Cultures; the Patti and Rusty Rueff School of Visual and Performing Arts; and the departments of English, History, Philosophy and Political Science \u2014 and six hours of interdisciplinary courses. The minor in Medieval and Renaissance Studies requires a minimum of 15 hours of coursework, consisting of 12 hours of departmental courses and 3 hours of an interdisciplinary course.

Peace Studies Peace Studies is an interdisciplinary field of study that examines the causes of, and proposed cures for, violence (sociological, economic and psychological) in human affairs. It is a recognized discipline of study across the globe. Scholars study issues of war and peace, development and underdevelopment, the institutionalization of racial and gender discrimination, economic inequality and its connections to physical violence, and how war and conflict may be related to environmental devastation. Peace Studies also examines the mechanisms by which peoples can move from violence and war to peace and justice. Students can earn a minor in Peace Studies that includes a core course, POL 23000 (Introduction to the Study of Peace) and four courses selected by students \u2014 in collaboration with a faculty mentor \u2014 that draw upon themes relevant to the study of peace. The Peace Studies committee also oversees an undergraduate research fellowship award, organizes panels on peace studies issues and provides students with information about careers in peacemaking occupations. Religious Studies Through a multifaceted approach, the Religious Studies Program focuses on one of the most enduring and urgent sets of human concerns. As such, it is a valuable major as well as a significant double major or minor for students in any major in any college. The program offers the opportunity to study the religious traditions of the world from the perspectives of several different departments at Purdue. To fulfill the requirements for either the major or the minor, students may choose from a number of courses offered in the departments of Anthropology, English, History, Philosophy and Sociology, as well as others. The program's interdepartmental approach is designed to help students tailor the program to their special interests while broadening their understanding of the different aspects of the religious life and thought of humankind. Members of the faculty and staff are committed to fostering students' intellectual and personal development. As such, the program offers extracurricular events to supplement in-class experiences, such as film viewings and discussions, lectures by world-renowned experts in the field, associated student groups and more.

Course Information https://selfservice.mypurdue.purdue.edu/prod/bwckctlg.p_disp_dyn_ctlg Officer Education Programs Purdue offers officer education programs sponsored by the Army, Navy-Marine Corps and Air Force. The purpose of the programs, which are entirely voluntary, is to educate and train young men and women in preparation for commissioning as officers in the armed services. The prerequisites for graduation as a commissioned officer are successful completion of the undergraduate baccalaureate degree requirements and certain specified professional courses. These professional courses, which are taken in conjunction with the regular courses required for a degree, are part of the University's official online course repository (https://selfservice.mypurdue.purdue.edu/prod/bwckctlg.p_disp_dyn_ctlg). In addition to these professional courses for which academic credit is granted, each service requires from one to two hours per week of extracurricular military instruction for which Air Force, Army and Navy-Marine Corps ROTC participants receive academic credit. These courses also are listed online. The officer education programs of the three services are similar. Each service offers scholarship and non-scholarship programs. Nonscholarship students are eligible to compete during their freshman and sophomore years for a scholarship. Specific details of each service program are outlined on succeeding pages. For additional information, contact the applicable military department. Aerospace Studies The Air Force ROTC program recruits, motivates and educates highly qualified students to become United States Air Force officers. To accomplish this goal, the Air Force ROTC curriculum is divided into several major areas: General Military Course (GMC), Professional Officer Course (POC), Leadership Laboratory, Conditioning, and Field Training. Aerospace Studies offers three- and four-year programs. The General Military Course (GMC) is taken during a student's freshman and sophomore years. Each week consists of a one-semester academic class, Leadership Laboratory and Conditioning. In the freshman year, students are introduced to the basic organization and roles of the Air Force, the benefits of an Air Force career, the Air Force community and what an Air Force officer does. The sophomore year is dedicated to the study of Air Force history. The Professional Officer Course (POC) comprises the last two years of Air Force ROTC and normally is taken during a student's junior and senior years. Each week consists of a three-semester-hour academic class, Leadership Laboratory and Conditioning. During the junior year, students are introduced to leadership, followership, and management concepts using practical application and discussion. In the final year, students are introduced to United States foreign policy trends, regional study issues and preparation for service in the active duty Air Force. Once enrolled in the POC, cadets sign a contract agreeing to serve on active duty for a specified period of time. This contract entitles them to a monthly, nontaxable stipend during the academic year. Interested students should contact the Air Force ROTC detachment for more information. The Leadership Laboratory is a one-semester-hour course that provides every student enrolled in Air Force ROTC with the opportunity to gain leadership experience. The Leadership Laboratory is open to students who are members of ROTC or who are eligible to pursue a commission as determined by the professor of aerospace studies. Within the cadet wing, which is similar to the command structure of an Air Force base, the cadets receive a progressive sequence of leadership experiences. As freshmen, cadets learn 97 An equal access/equal opportunity university. All contents Copyright \u00a9 2013 Purdue University. All rights reserved. basic drill maneuvers and receive briefings on military customs and courtesies. Sophomores are given their first chance to command a flight of cadets in preparation for summer field training attendance. POC cadets are charged with planning and organizing the entire operation of the cadet wing. Base visits and flight orientations along with guest speakers enhance the Leadership Laboratory experience. Conditioning is a one-semester-hour physical training course designed to prepare students for the physical requirements of military service and to help them maintain a healthy lifestyle during college. The class consists of everything from distance running to calisthenics and strength training. Field Training (FT) normally occurs between a student's sophomore and junior years in college. Field training is mandatory for entrance into the Professional Officer Course and is normally four weeks in duration. Training consists of traditional military training and practical exercises to enhance leadership skills. Cadets attending field training receive training pay and travel allowances. Air Force ROTC College Scholarships are available to highly qualified students on a competitive basis. The scholarship pays most or all of the student's college tuition and fees, $900 for books and a tax-free subsistence allowance of between $300 and $500 a month. Interested individuals may contact the Air Force ROTC detachment for scholarship details. Students must meet minimum GPA requirements and military retention standards to compete for and retain scholarships.

Aerospace Studies Head of the Department: Col. Thomas B. Frooninckx Professor: Col. T.B. Frooninckx, M.S. Professors: Maj. M.A. Miller, B.S.; Capt. J.M. Law, M.S. Military Science The Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (AROTC) at Purdue University is established for the purpose of training young men and women for service as officers in the United States Army. Those who successfully complete degree and program requirements are commissioned as second lieutenants in either the reserve or active forces in one of more than 17 professional career fields. Students enrolled in any curriculum offered by the University that leads to a baccalaureate degree are eligible to participate in the Army ROTC program. The Army ROTC program is divided into a basic course for freshmen and sophomores and an advanced course for juniors and seniors. Many students enroll in the basic course to determine their interest in a military career. Students do not incur any military service obligation by enrolling in any of the basic course classes. Those who complete the basic course may enter the advanced course with consent of the department head. Students accepted into the advanced course incur an eight-year military service obligation after they are commissioned as second lieutenants. This service obligation can be active, reserve or a combination of both. Basic Course Students in the freshman-level courses receive two credits per semester and attend one hour of class and two hours of leadership laboratory each week. Classes are designed to explain the lifestyle and duties of a professional Army officer; to present career opportunities in the military; and to provide students with a background in communications, leadership and military skills that will benefit the individual, regardless of the ultimate career choice. Laboratory periods are designed to teach leadership-related skills and to develop 98 An equal access/equal opportunity university. All contents Copyright \u00a9 2013 Purdue University. All rights reserved. self-confidence and teamwork. Students receive professional development classes in the laboratory that include developing leadership skills, basic rifle marksmanship and weapons familiarization, water survival, drill and ceremony, individual and squad movement techniques, and basic rappelling. Students in the sophomore-level classes receive three credits a semester and attend two hours of class and two hours of leadership laboratory each week. Development of fundamental leadership and managerial skills is stressed in both the classroom and the leadership laboratory. The focus of classroom training shifts to the development of more advanced military skills such as land navigation, small unit tactics, performance-oriented training and individual instruction, and a survey of the Army's branches and functions. Two-Year Program This program is available to students who missed the opportunity to take the basic courses. It is also open to graduate students and others with at least four semesters remaining toward completion of degree requirements. Students entering the two-year program must attend the four-week Leadership Training Course (LTC) at Fort Knox, Ky., in lieu of the basic course. Successful completion of LTC will result in being eligible for a two-year scholarship. Veterans Qualified veterans and members of the Indiana National Guard may participate in the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP) and enroll directly in the advanced course and receive constructive academic credit for the basic course. Advanced Course During the junior and senior years, additional emphasis is devoted to developing leadership and managerial skills. The subject matter includes an analysis of behavioral concepts as related to leadership, management of resources and analysis of management operations using military units as a model. Advanced-course students receive four credits per semester and attend four hours of class and two hours of leadership laboratory training each week. They receive an allowance of $450 to $500 a month during each month school is in session. Advanced-course students attend 28 days of training at Fort Lewis, Wash., in the summer between the junior and senior years. This Leader Development and Assessment Course (LDAC) provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate knowledge of skills acquired in the classroom and to gain practical leadership experience. It also validates their qualifications to become second lieutenants in the United States Army. Advanced-course students and \"contracted\" students are required to enroll in the section of PES 11400 titled Army ROTC Physical Conditioning. The course is worth one semester credit hour and meets for one hour, three times a week. The physical training program is designed to improve students' muscular strength and endurance, flexibility and body composition. This course prepares students to excel during the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) conducted during the school year, at LDAC and upon commissioning. It also provides them with a better understanding of the Army fitness program, how to conduct and lead a physical training session, and the key elements to better physical fitness. Army Scholarship Program Students enrolled in Army ROTC may compete for and receive four-year, three-year and two-year Army ROTC scholarships that pay full tuition and fees, $1,200 per year for textbooks and $300 to $500 a month subsistence allowance. 99 An equal access/equal opportunity university.
