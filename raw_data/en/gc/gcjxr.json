There is very little practical difference - in 21st century America - between MDs and DOs, although DOs are more likely to incorporate some form of manipulation (back, spine) into their practice. Both types of doctors have the same types of privileges, skills, and federal (Medicare, etc) recognition. Chiropractic, in my experience, is good for treating some types of back pain and back injury, but is NOT a cure-all for other types of ailments, which is why it continues to have a relatively negative connotation -- some practitioners adhere to the belief that chiropractic can treat/cure just about anything. posted by Chiropractic, in my experience, is good for treating some types of back pain and back injury, but is NOT a cure-all for other types of ailments, which is why it continues to have a relatively negative connotation -- some practitioners adhere to the belief that chiropractic can treat/cure just about anything. posted by [davidmsc](http://www.metafilter.com/user/4123)at [4:43 AM](/56365/Are-chiropractors-and-osteopaths-different-Are-they-quacks#848035)on February 5, 2007 As handee is from the UK it should be noted that osteopaths in the UK are not the same as in the US. UK osteopaths are not medical doctors but rather practitioners of manipulation based therapies, as is a chiropractor. Osteopaths concentrate more on muscle manipulation whereas chiropractors focus more on joints and nervous systems. I had some back problems that I believe were alleviated by a chiropractor although I suspect that it also could have been from the constant ice and Advil that she prescribed. I also once attended an open day at an osteopathic medicine college in London and ultimately didn't buy it. posted by I had some back problems that I believe were alleviated by a chiropractor although I suspect that it also could have been from the constant ice and Advil that she prescribed.

(in fact, I know of one local chiropractor who actually has a masseuse in the office with him) If there is truly something structurally wrong with your spine (bulging or herniated disc, for instance) there isn't a damn thing a chiropractor can do to, except for a temporary relief of the tension. posted by If there is truly something structurally wrong with your spine (bulging or herniated disc, for instance) there isn't a damn thing a chiropractor can do to, except for a temporary relief of the tension. posted by [Thorzdad](http://www.metafilter.com/user/20558)at [6:12 AM](/56365/Are-chiropractors-and-osteopaths-different-Are-they-quacks#848058)on February 5, 2007 I only have anecdotal evidence to add - I have back pain and used to see an osteopath before I lived in London. She was amazing and used cranial osteopathy to stop my migraines in their tracks. Then I moved to London and went through a series of expensive and useless chiropractors AND osteopaths before I stumbled painfully onto the doorstep of my local physiotherapist (recommended by my GP) and I haven't looked back since. Of course, IANAD, but my advice is to go to your doctor and get a recommendation to a decent physio. They have chiropractors and osteopaths at my physio's practice, too, BTW. posted by Then I moved to London and went through a series of expensive and useless chiropractors AND osteopaths before I stumbled painfully onto the doorstep of my local physiotherapist (recommended by my GP) and I haven't looked back since.

Chiro's tend to be quacks. While occasional back manipulation might be a good thing... exercise is way better. posted by Chiro's tend to be quacks.

This regimen keeps my back pains to a minimum. She is rather small and I am rather pain-intolerant, so if she can't get something to move then she gives it a good rub-down with Biofreeze and we try again in a week. She doesn't force anything. I have never come out of her office in more pain than I went in. Though my hips tend to get out of alignment and after she's straightened them out (so my legs are again the same length) I trip over things. The only osteopath I've seen was an enormous man who muscled me around until I was groaning in pain, then prescribed me some physical therapy at the local NovaCare, which did little to help. posted by She is rather small and I am rather pain-intolerant, so if she can't get something to move then she gives it a good rub-down with Biofreeze and we try again in a week.

I have used conventional MDs (allopaths) in the past (obviously!) and an occasional chiropractor. Both disciplines have their share of dingbats. I have gotten homeopathic remedies from both, so to uniformly label chiros as quacks seems to overlook the possibility that there are fruitcakes in both bins. How many chiropractors have amputated the wrong limb or left a surgical instrument in a body cavity? Most people don't have a clue of what goes into a medical education, nor a chiropractic one. Any MD in his right mind would agree that his/her comprehension of the body and all that that entails is well short of perfect. It is not safe to assume that an MD is an expert, just because of the \"MD\" suffix. Nor does it seem appropriate to globally state that something straddling massage and DO work is quackery. For certain, reasoning skills are normally distributed in both, and that means that half of all allopaths are 'below average'. Presented with a specific problem, one of them might be more likely to resolve it optimally. By optimally, I mean with minimal risk, minimal intervention, and rapid results. That said, I have been occasionally unimpressed with allopaths, and common malpractice awards show them to be batting considerably less than 1000. I have also been unimpressed with chiropractors from time to time. I don't know what kind of chiropractors respondents here have been visiting, but my own experience with strained back and neck muscles and misadjusted vertebrae have been usually reconciled in a single visit. No surgery, no muscle relaxers, no prescriptions. As I said, I'm an engineer, and I recognize that the mechanical system that is a body can indeed be abused in such as way as to leave pieces 'misadjusted' and that someone with training in manipulating the surrounding structures can use physics to reposition the relevant elements. Once every year or two I turn while lifting something and am nearly incapacitated by pain that does not resolve with time. A good chiro can take such a transient injury and resolve it, PDQ. (I wouldn't visit one for cancer, obviously!) What exactly does everyone think an MD does with a disarticulated joint? How about a general dislocation? These MDs resolve with good old mechanical MOVEMENT, supported by clear anatomical knowledge. This approach, I suggest, is shared by chiropractors from reputable institutions... such as Palmer. I am not a proponent of quackery, nor an adherent of magic. I don't buy into homeopathy, crystals, aromatherapy, and I am skeptical of accupuncture. I do trust the lever, however. And I wisely fear both the scalpel and the prescription pad. Sadly, this same discpline competition is repeated in the OB-Gyn/midwife conflict. MD's have a vested interest in have MD-only solutions to medical problems, as do the institutions who teach them. posted by Both disciplines have their share of dingbats.

Here is an anecdotal story. My brother is a tuba player and spent a summer in a marching band. Towards the end of the summer he noticed a strange knot developing in his pectoral muscle that sort of restricted his movement. It persisted for a few months after he let the band. Somewhat alarmed he went to see a doctor, who was unable to diagnose it and suggested he might need surgery. On my mother's advice he went to see an osteopath. In one session, the osteopath figured out the cause of the soreness: in the marching bend, whenever they came to a stop they always raised their right knee high and then stomped the ground in unison on the final step. The force of his foot stomping on the ground, combined with the weight of his tuba, was straining his muscle. She gave him a few simple stretching exercises to do every day and within two weeks he was as good as new. posted by My brother is a tuba player and spent a summer in a marching band.

They think more about systems in your body rather than isolated symptoms. They will generally look to your lifestyle including diet and nutrition, stress level, activity and health before deciding what's wrong with you. DO's tend to argue that their medical education is as rigorous as that of an allopathic school. I don't know about that. They are liscensed and accredited, so it's not like they don't know what they're doing, but they definitely did not get a \"regular\" medical school experience. Not sure about the residency. I think they can do allopathic residencies. So, take that into consideration.

DO student here!! You've gotten some of the differences b/w DO and MD and chiropractor thus far, so I won't delve into that. However, the foundations of osteopathy: the body is a unit (mind, body, spirit); the body is self-healing; structure and function are interrelated; and rational osteopathic care is based upon the previous three principles! (last one seems redundant but nevertheless, an important principle). We can do anything and everything MD's do. Chiropractors are an outgrowth from early osteopathy, before we began to include drugs/pharmacology into our practice (after antibiotics, there was no way getting around using drugs). That said, yes a lot of DOs are getting away from the roots; however, there are a great handful that practice only OMM (osteopathic manipulative medicine/treatment). From just 6 months into my first year--I have been able to treat back pain, muscle spasms, restriction in motion (arms, legs, neck, any joints) and we just finished with cranial motion (great in relieving headaches--tension, migraines, etc) and our last class involved sinus drainage--which I can testify that works (little anecdote--I was congested on that day and after the treatment within the next 10 minutes I was clear as a whistle). All that I have learned to do with nothing but my hands. So in response, you will find DO's in every type of medicine and this special field of OMM with no one else. We can Diagnose and treat, do surgery, whatever you need. I've heard people that love DO more because since we use our hands so much to learn, that doesn't leave us in our practice and thus we are more \"caring, responsive, sensitive\" to our patient's needs. At any rate, I hope this helps! You can always email me if you have any more questions (I think it's in my profile . . . ). posted by You've gotten some of the differences b/w DO and MD and chiropractor thus far, so I won't delve into that.

One DO I knew told me that DOs are basically \"like MDs, but we do manipulations too.\" Their training in anatomy, physiology and pathology is the standard mainstream medical curriculum. Chiropractors, on the other hand, base their diagnoses and treatments on bizarre theories about subluxations and malalignments of the spine and other bones. Mainstream medicine rejects these theories. Bear in mind that \"allopathy\" is not an appropriate way to refer to mainstream medicine as practiced by MDs and DOs. It is a term invented by alternative-medicine practitioners in the 19th century; its use implies an ax to grind. posted by Chiropractors, on the other hand, base their diagnoses and treatments on bizarre theories about subluxations and malalignments of the spine and other bones.
