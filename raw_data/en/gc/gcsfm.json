But in general, when the term 'hot flush' or 'hot flash' is used, it refers to symptoms experienced by women going through menopause. The term 'hot flushes' is mainly used by women going through menopause. In the USA, the term 'hot flashes' is used. Both mean exactly the same thing - the most common symptom experienced by women during menopause. Hot flushes in menopause may be felt all over the body but most commonly affect only the face and neck. Hot flushes often accompany, or contribute as one of the causes of sweating during the menopause. As hot flushes and sweating during menopause are such prominent symptoms, frequently occurring together, many women going through menopause use the terms 'hot flushes' and 'menopausal sweats' interchangeably.

Experiences may differ from individual to individual, but typically women feel a very brief and sudden rush of heat (usually most prominent in the face, neck, and chest), feel flushed, and sweat profusely. Some women feel cold chills after their hot flush. Interestingly, not all women may experience hot flushes. But these women are few and far between.

Each hot flush can last a few seconds or up to several minutes. When do hot flushes go away? Understandably, many women want to know when hot flushes end and whether they go away after menopause. Hot flushes can, unfortunately, last for 7-10 years. The good news is that they usually end post-menopause.

This causes a response designed to cool the body down. More blood goes to the skin (one of the causes of hot flushes and reddening of the skin) and sweat glands start working (the menopausal sweat).
