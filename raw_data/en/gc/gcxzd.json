Well you can!!! Introducing Acupuncture Stickers. Whether you come into our office to try these little miraculous stickers or you buy them directly from the website after our telehealth session. These stickers work immediately and are scientifically proven to help with numerous health issues. Let's breakdown what acupuncture stickers are.. What is an acupuncture sticker? An acupuncture sticker is a small sticker placed on acupuncture points throughout the body to stimulate biochemical and physiological changes in the body without any pharmaceuticals. A small sticker is placed on various points on the body to do exactly what a needle would do. This sticker works by blending phototherapy or light therapy with acupuncture points to effectively work on many health concerns from the comfort of your home. When you stimulate acupuncture points, channels or meridians you can support the body in a very powerful way of healing. Traditional Chinese medicine has many modalities like acupuncture so receiving needles is one way to achieve health benefits but acupressure and stimulation can also be highly beneficial. Our teachers once told the story of a woman who didnt want to receive acupuncture so she did acupressure 3X a day in the orbital area for eye issues and ended up completely recovering from her eye disease. Did you know that there is a very easy way to receive these amazing results from the comfort of your home? Yes! Acupuncture or phototherapy use phototherapy or light therapy at acupuncture points throughout the body. These wearable stickers use a technology that uses light to induce physiological and biochemical changes in the body without any chemical or pharmaceutical. The stickers help to balance all the systems, such as the cardiovascular, digestive, endocrine systems, they can also detox the liver, improve hormones, and much more. Many athletes and olympians, use these stickers to increase stamina, increase strength, reduce recovery time, and balance energy. What can the stickers be used for? ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING, just like acupuncture, it can help with any pain that is chronic or recent, fatigue, sleep or digestive issues. But, in case you didnt know, it can also be used for the skin to enhance its texture just like cosmetic acupuncture or facial rejuvenation. There are about 13 stickers to choose from - anything from losing weight, easing emotions, to improving immunity to repairing muscles. What is the sticker made of? It is a non transdermal sticker, has an adhesive that is non allergenic, you turn it on by holding it, there is no chemical or medication in it, the body heat is the power source to activate. The stickers can also be placed on a pillow, crib or clothing that is worn while sleeping, this is especially useful when treating children. The stickers contain a blend of amino acids, water, stabilized oxygen and naturally occurring organic compounds. These do not enter the body. How does the sticker work? Well, your body needs energy for everything. The sticker works on the electrical systems in the body by activating acupuncture points which are sending signals to elevate antioxidants, healing peptides and reminding the body that it can fix itself. What the heck does that mean? Well they are essentially activating points on the body by providing constant stimulation while you are wearing them which is why it works so well and why it can be so healing. How long do they last? They can be applied for anywhere from 12-48 hours, depending on what we are working on, what sticker you are using and desired effect. Which sticker do I choose?

Phototherapy has been around a long time and has been used for hundreds of years. CBD oil, tinctures, salves, lotions, lip balm, sleep syrup CBD or Cannabidiol products treat a variety of ailments. CBD can be taken internally, or topically in a salve, lotion, roller or massage oil. CBD comes from hemp not marijuana therefore it is non-psycho-active, it is not addicting, and over time you need less. CBD interacts with a system in our bodies called the endocannabinoid system, where we have receptors. Naturally occurring receptors (CB1 and CB2) balance our systems and achieve homeostasis, much like acupuncture. CBD first gained popularity because it is known to treat seizures and fight cancer. We carry a variety of strengths, flavors and varieties. CBD can be therapeutic for a number of medical conditions: - Anxiety or emotional disorders - Depression - Acute or chronic pain/ inflammation (including neuropathy) - Addictions - Insomnia - Autoimmune disease and diabetes (it prevents cytokine, which plays a role in many autoimmune diseases) - Energy regulation - PTSD - Digestive function (treats inflammation and reduces other symptoms) - Acne (inhibits lipid synthesis, reducing acne outbreaks) - Cancer - Treats seizures (epilepsy) Herbs Chinese herbal medicine is one of the most effective ways to achieve results. Herbs can be very specific - meaning targeting a part of the body or a very specific ailment. Chinese herbal remedies are used to help realign an individual's balance in order improve their well being. Ingredients are typically of plant origin which means they include roots, bark, seeds, flowers and leaves. At Natural Point Acupuncture, we will offer \"patent\" prescriptions meaning we will diagnose and prescribe herbs that are in capsule form primarily. Your practitioner will guide and explain which form is the best and specific instructions on how to take them. Essential Oils Essential oils date back to more than 5,000 years ago. At one point they were used to treat virtually every ailment known to man. Essential oils are pure botanical extracts. Due to recent popularity, essential oils have become more mainstream, and are seen everywhere. However, at Natural Point Acupuncture, we only use 100% therapeutic grade essential oils. When essential oils are coupled with acupuncture, its effects are very relaxing and can intensify and lengthen the duration of the treatments. Essential oils can pass through the blood brain barrier which is why they are so effective. Essential oils are lipid soluble which is why they can penetrate the blood brain barrier and have profound influence on the central nervous system. There is a wide variety of uses of essential oils which can range from fighting bacterias and viruses, to hormone balancing and regulating emotions and stress. Your clinician may use essential oils during your treatment. If you have any questions or concerns please make sure to speak to your Acupuncturist.
