This booklet discusses the application of the Course's principles of healing specifically to the practice of psychotherapy. Even though written for professional therapists, it will be of value to anyone interested in how the Course's theoretical principles of healing -- joining with another through the Holy Spirit -- is applied to the field of psychotherapy. The Song of Prayer: Prayer, Forgiveness, Healing was scribed by Helen Schucman from September through November of 1977. This twenty-two page booklet summarizes the Course's teachings on forgiveness and healing as it relates to prayer. It contrasts the meaning of true prayer, forgiveness, and healing with their opposites. The meaning of prayer, asking the Holy Spirit, and what in fact we should be asking for, are all addressed. Healing is seen as the effect of the mind's undoing of the belief in separation through the process of prayer, which is described as \"growth in forgiveness.\" The above supplements are included in the English version of A Course in Miracles and can be purchased separately by clicking on the book covers below.
