Consider the following safety tips: - Only use diffusers in a well-ventilated space, and make sure to dilute the oil as instructed. As another option, you can use aroma sticks or other aromatherapy accessories. - Don't ingest the oils, which can cause vomiting or other toxic reactions. - Many essential oils are toxic to pets, so use them with caution.3 If you're planning to apply essential oils topically, like for aromatherapy or massage therapy, consider the following safety tips as well: - Make sure you're not allergic to any of the ingredients. If you get a red, itchy rash or hives after rubbing the oil on your skin, be sure to contact your doctor. - Never apply undiluted oils directly to your skin. When mixing a carrier oil (lotion, cream, butter, shampoo, etc.) with an essential oil, avoid using dilutions above 5% for adults and 2% for kids.4 Looking for a way to relieve stress or minor aches and pains?
