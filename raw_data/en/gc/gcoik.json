The management and high cost of LBP put a tremendous burden on the healthcare system. Many risk factors have been identified, such as lifestyle, trauma, degeneration, postural impairment, and occupational related factors; however, as high as 95% of the cases of LBP are non-specific. Currently, LBP is treated pharmacologically. Approximately 25 to 30% of the patients develop serious side effects, such as drowsiness and drug addiction. Spinal surgery often does not result in a massive improvement of pain relief. Therefore, complementary approaches are being integrated into the rehabilitation programs. These include chiropractic therapy, physiotherapy, massage, exercise, herbal medicine and acupuncture. Acupuncture for LBP is one of the most commonly used non-pharmacological pain-relieving techniques. This is due to its low adverse effects and cost-effectiveness. Currently, many randomized controlled trials and clinical research studies have produced promising results. In this article, the causes and incidence of LBP on global health care are reviewed. The importance of treatment by acupuncture is considered. The efforts to reveal the link between acupuncture points and anatomical features and the neurological mechanisms that lead to acupuncture-induced analgesic effect are reviewed.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2018-06-25", "cleaned_text": "Acupuncture and Neural Mechanism in the Management of Low Back Pain\u2014An Update [https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines5030063](https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines5030063) [Acupuncture - Basic Research categorised according to duration as acute (less than 6 weeks), sub-acute (between 6 and 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks) [ [4](#B4-medicines-05-00063), [5](#B5-medicines-05-00063), [6](#B6-medicines-05-00063)]. [7](#B7-medicines-05-00063)], work performance [ [8](#B8-medicines-05-00063), [9](#B9-medicines-05-00063)], and is a major reason for people to seek medical consultation [ [10](#B10-medicines-05-00063), [11](#B11-medicines-05-00063)]. This disorder contributes to a substantial burden on individuals, employers, the healthcare system and society in general. According to a report published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2013, back pain, together with neck pain, was the second highest cause amongst the 20 leading non-fatal health outcomes from the year 2000 to 2011 [ [12](#B12-medicines-05-00063)]. [13](#B13-medicines-05-00063), [14](#B14-medicines-05-00063)], highlights the extent of health loss due to diseases, injuries, risk factors, prevalence and mortality rate by age, sex, and geography at specific points in time. In the GBD 2016, LBP was the number one cause for the most years lived with disability (YLDs) in the world [ [13](#B13-medicines-05-00063)]. [14](#B14-medicines-05-00063), [15](#B15-medicines-05-00063)]. Because LBP does not cause mortality, therefore YLDs are the same as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). DALYs for LBP, together with neck pain, was on the 4th position out of the 30 leading global DALYs in the GBD 2016 [ [14](#B14-medicines-05-00063)]. This was much higher than the average DALYs related to road injuries, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer [ [14](#B14-medicines-05-00063)]. The overall estimation of DALYs for LBP in 2016 was 57.6 million, which represents more than 40% of the total number of 140 million DALYs of all the musculoskeletal disorders combined. In Austria, the GBD 2015 for YLDs and DALYs due to LBP and neck pain are ranked at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively [ [16](#B16-medicines-05-00063)]. [12](#B12-medicines-05-00063)]. Hoy et al. estimated that the ranges of prevalence of LBP at a point, 1-month, 1-year and over a lifetime were 18.3%, 30.8%, 38.0% and 38.9%, respectively [ [17](#B17-medicines-05-00063)]. In the GBD 2016, it was estimated that the prevalence of LBP for the year 2016 was more than 511 million of the world's population, an increase of 18.0%, as compared to 2006 [ [7](#B7-medicines-05-00063)]. LBP results in high costs to society due to increased demands on the healthcare system and work absence. In the USA alone, it has been estimated that LBP costed between US $100-200 billion yearly [ [1](#B1-medicines-05-00063)]. This amount has more than doubled from 1991 to 2016 [ [18](#B18-medicines-05-00063)]. 2. Causes and Risk Factors of Lower Back Pain [19](#B19-medicines-05-00063), [20](#B20-medicines-05-00063), [21](#B21-medicines-05-00063)]; lumbar spine degeneration [ nerve entrapment [ [24](#B24-medicines-05-00063), [25](#B25-medicines-05-00063), [26](#B26-medicines-05-00063)]. Other causes associated with an increased risk of LBP, include infections, autoimmune diseases, orthopedic occupational ergonomic factors related to heavy physical work, repetitive actions due to occupational requirements [ [1](#B1-medicines-05-00063), [2](#B2-medicines-05-00063), [34](#B34-medicines-05-00063), [35](#B35-medicines-05-00063), [36](#B36-medicines-05-00063), sports-related injuries [ [40](#B40-medicines-05-00063), [41](#B41-medicines-05-00063)]; sedentary lifestyle, prolonged sitting or inactivity and lack of exercises [ [42](#B42-medicines-05-00063), [43](#B43-medicines-05-00063), [44](#B44-medicines-05-00063)]; post operation or surgery-induced [ [45](#B45-medicines-05-00063), from other medical conditions [ [47](#B47-medicines-05-00063), [48](#B48-medicines-05-00063), [49](#B49-medicines-05-00063)]; lifestyle factors [ [50](#B50-medicines-05-00063)]; poor trunk control and postural impairment [ [51](#B51-medicines-05-00063)]; psychosocial and behavior-related factors from smoking, alcohol abuse, obesity, [59](#B59-medicines-05-00063), [60](#B60-medicines-05-00063)]. However, it is often difficult to identify the back problems [ [1](#B1-medicines-05-00063), [63](#B63-medicines-05-00063), [64](#B64-medicines-05-00063), [65](#B65-medicines-05-00063)] are not associated with a specific patho-anatomical origin, or attributed to any recognizable pathology patterns. 2.1. Age and Gender [17](#B17-medicines-05-00063)], and women have higher LPB prevalence of the rate of LBP is recorded worldwide and might be related to women's involvement in the workforce, while their house chores do not diminish [ [69](#B69-medicines-05-00063), [70](#B70-medicines-05-00063)]. LBP's risk factors specific to women comprise exposure to musculoskeletal loads due to pregnancy [ [71](#B71-medicines-05-00063), low bone mineral density [ [80](#B80-medicines-05-00063), [81](#B81-medicines-05-00063)]; and conditions associated with ageing [ [59](#B59-medicines-05-00063), [82](#B82-medicines-05-00063)]. In contrast, certain studies show that men have a higher rate of LBP [ [1](#B1-medicines-05-00063), [2](#B2-medicines-05-00063)], especially those involved in heavy physical work and repetitive movements [ [1](#B1-medicines-05-00063), [2](#B2-medicines-05-00063), [6](#B6-medicines-05-00063), [38](#B38-medicines-05-00063), [39](#B39-medicines-05-00063)]. 2.2. Obesity and Smoking [67](#B67-medicines-05-00063)]. The association between obesity and LBP remains controversial. Few studies on the relation between obesity and LBP have been published so far. Obesity is considered as one of the elements that contributes to the increasing rate of that the rate of LBP increases in parallel with the rate of body mass index (BMI) [ [83](#B83-medicines-05-00063)]. As stated by a guideline by WHO, an adult is viewed as overweight when the BMI is greater or equal to 25, and one is considered obese when the BMI has reached 30 or more [ [85](#B85-medicines-05-00063)]. In addition, increased BMI also affects the incidence of neck pain and arthritis [ [86](#B86-medicines-05-00063)]. A group of studies led to speculation of connections between smoking and obesity that may result in LBP [ [67](#B67-medicines-05-00063), [87](#B87-medicines-05-00063)]. Yet, such a conclusion was challenged by another study, which did not find such link between LBP, smoking and obesity [ [88](#B88-medicines-05-00063)]. 3. Theories of Pain [89](#B89-medicines-05-00063)], is a simple tool to judge a patient's perspective of pain, to translate a subjective level of pain into an objective measurement. [90](#B90-medicines-05-00063)]. According to Merskey and Bogduk, \"pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage\" [ [91](#B91-medicines-05-00063)]. [92](#B92-medicines-05-00063)]. This gave rise to many modern studies about pain management, such as nerve blocking and analgesic effect by acupuncture. The Gate Control Theory of Pain, which was proposed in 1965 by Melzack and Wall, suggested that the brain has a \"gate\" mechanism either blocking or allowing pain messages to reach the brain [ [93](#B93-medicines-05-00063)]. Although their theory was later proven to be flawed, it did provide a useful overall concept of how pain is experienced and many researchers engaged in this field of study. One of them resulted in the invention of transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) for the management of LBP [ [94](#B94-medicines-05-00063)]. [95](#B95-medicines-05-00063)]. Two years later, a group of British scientists led by Hughes and Kosterlitz, found the breakthrough in the field of molecular receptor studies, the discovery of enkephalin [ [96](#B96-medicines-05-00063)]. This was followed by studies that led to our current knowledge of endorphins, the body's very own natural mechanism of painkiller [ [97](#B97-medicines-05-00063), [98](#B98-medicines-05-00063), [99](#B99-medicines-05-00063), [100](#B100-medicines-05-00063)]. 4. Pain Mechanism [101](#B101-medicines-05-00063)]. The nociceptors, part of the architecture of neural circuits, are spread all over the body, from the superficial layers of skin to the deeper tissues and internal organs. [102](#B102-medicines-05-00063), represent motor fibres connected to voluntary muscles and include certain sensory fibres that transmit position sensation from skeletal muscles. A fibres carry non-noxious stimuli and convey the sensations of touch, vibration and pressure from the skin [ [111](#B111-medicines-05-00063)]. There are only two types of nerve fibres involved in the transmission of painful impulses. The A fibre is myelinated, enables fast transmission of impulses and produces sharp and well localised pain. The second type, the unmyelinated C fibre, is slow in transmission and produces dull or burning pain, the exact location of which is diffused and poorly localised [ [105](#B105-medicines-05-00063), [106](#B106-medicines-05-00063), [107](#B107-medicines-05-00063), [109](#B109-medicines-05-00063)]. Kagitani et al. demonstrated that acupuncture stimulation enables production of various autonomic functions on both A and C fibres [ [110](#B110-medicines-05-00063)]. While Zhao suggested that stimulation by manual acupuncture (MA) and electroacupuncture (EA) activates A and C fibres to produce an analgesic effect [ [112](#B112-medicines-05-00063)]. these pharmacological treatments produce limited pain relief and are accompanied by serious side effects, such as drowsiness, dizziness, addiction, allergic responses, reversible reduction of liver function, and negative impacts on gastrointestinal functions [ [1](#B1-medicines-05-00063), [5](#B5-medicines-05-00063), [61](#B61-medicines-05-00063), [113](#B113-medicines-05-00063), [114](#B114-medicines-05-00063), [116](#B116-medicines-05-00063), [117](#B117-medicines-05-00063)]. At least one of these side effects is experienced in approximately 25 to 30% of patients treated with opioids [ [118](#B118-medicines-05-00063)]. The major problem with this approach is that pain may be temporarily relieved but the source of LBP is not identified and alternative treatments of LBP are required. These include multidisciplinary rehabilitations based on physiotherapy, spinal manipulation, exercise therapy, massage therapy, cognitive-behaviour therapy, yoga, tai-chi, and acupuncture [ [5](#B5-medicines-05-00063), [61](#B61-medicines-05-00063), [65](#B65-medicines-05-00063), [113](#B113-medicines-05-00063), [115](#B115-medicines-05-00063)]. Here, the focus is on a critical assessment of the benefits of acupuncture in LBP treatment. 5.1. Acupuncture [119](#B119-medicines-05-00063)]. Despite a lack of well-designed clinical studies supporting its efficacy, and skeptical opinions from many, it is nevertheless well accepted by many patients globally. Acupuncture is legally recognised by many countries in Asia, Australia, America, Canada, and some parts of Europe and Latin America [ [120](#B120-medicines-05-00063)]. [120](#B120-medicines-05-00063)]. [121](#B121-medicines-05-00063)]. As of December 2010, there were approximately 305,000 registered Complementary & Alternative Medicine (CAM) providers across Europe, including 96,380 acupuncturists. Eighty-thousand were medical and 16,380 were non-medical practitioners [ [122](#B122-medicines-05-00063)]. In Austria, there were 3531 doctors qualified with the diploma of acupuncture from the Austrian Medical Association (Diplom f\u00fcr Akupunktur der \u00d6sterreichischen \u00c4rztekammer) in 2011 [ [123](#B123-medicines-05-00063)]. According to the Law of Health Services Austria (Bundesgesetz \u00fcber die Gesundheit \u00d6sterreich), acupuncture is a scientifically recognized treatment that can be provided in hospitals [ [124](#B124-medicines-05-00063)]. In contrast with increasing interest and practice of acupuncture, there is a persistent lack of infrastructure and funding dedicated to research and teaching in this field [ [125](#B125-medicines-05-00063)]. 5.2. Brief History of Acupuncture [126](#B126-medicines-05-00063)]. The second part is called Ling Shu (The Spiritual Pivot) and explains acupuncture therapy such as the description of meridians, functions of the acupuncture points, needling techniques, types of Qi and the location of 160 points [ [127](#B127-medicines-05-00063)]. Two other classic texts which mention acupuncture in depth are Nan Jing (The Classic of Difficult Issues) [ [128](#B128-medicines-05-00063)] and Zhen Jiu Jia Yi Jing (The Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion). The latter was written by Huangfu Mi, who added another 189 acupuncture points to reach a total of 349 [ [129](#B129-medicines-05-00063)]. The precise history of these four books is unclear as they were edited, annotated and reinterpreted several times. Another obstacle of learning and understanding the teaching of TCM is the difficulty in translating these ancient Chinese texts [ [130](#B130-medicines-05-00063)]. [131](#B131-medicines-05-00063)], there is undocumented evidence to when and where the origin of acupuncture came from due to the loss of many of the valuable ancient texts. The archaeological discovery of \"bian shi\" (a kind of flattened and sharpened stone) from the era of the New Stone Age in China (8000-2000 BC), was believed to represent the ancient acupuncture needle for treating illnesses by pricking certain parts of the body. During the Warring States (475-221 BC), metal needles were developed to substitute the stone needles [ [132](#B132-medicines-05-00063)]. [133](#B133-medicines-05-00063)]. The very first acupuncture description that appeared in the West was written by Wilhelm Ten Rhyne in 1683, a physician employed by the Dutch East India Company, who was based in Japan [ [134](#B134-medicines-05-00063)]. [135](#B135-medicines-05-00063)]. He described his first-hand experience of acupuncture with an emergency appendectomy and post-operative care while on his assignment to China prior to President Nixon's visit. This has prompted many doctors visiting China to observe and study the effectiveness and benefits of acupuncture, with a specific interest in its use for surgical analgesia [ [136](#B136-medicines-05-00063), [137](#B137-medicines-05-00063), [138](#B138-medicines-05-00063), [139](#B139-medicines-05-00063), [140](#B140-medicines-05-00063)]. 5.3. Theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine [141](#B141-medicines-05-00063)]. [142](#B142-medicines-05-00063)]. Qi, the essence of life, is believed to circulate within special conduits in the body termed meridians and collaterals that connect all parts of the body, including connecting the organ systems with each other and their related sense organs. When there is insufficiency of Qi, or when the meridians are blocked, this causes an imbalance between Yin and Yang, perturbs the meridians, hinders the smooth flowing of Qi and results in stagnation of Qi and blood, leading to pain and illness [ [143](#B143-medicines-05-00063), [144](#B144-medicines-05-00063), [145](#B145-medicines-05-00063), [146](#B146-medicines-05-00063)]. 6. Acupuncture Principles [146](#B146-medicines-05-00063)]. Stimulation on the acupuncture points by acupuncture needle enables unblocking of the meridians, hence promoting a smooth flow of Qi [ [147](#B147-medicines-05-00063)]. 6.1. The Anatomical Structure of Acupuncture Points and Meridians [148](#B148-medicines-05-00063), [149](#B149-medicines-05-00063), [150](#B150-medicines-05-00063), [151](#B151-medicines-05-00063)]. Deadman et al., in their book, A Manual of Acupuncture [ [151](#B151-medicines-05-00063)], mentioned that \"centuries of observation of the existence of tender spots on the body during the course of disease, and the alleviation of symptoms when they were stimulated by massage or heat, led to the gradual discovery of the acupuncture points\". This sheds a bit of light on the origin of acupuncture. The meridians and the acupuncture points can be compared with airline travel routes: They exist on a map but cannot be \"seen\". [152](#B152-medicines-05-00063)]. Many scientists tried to reproduce his result but failed. That was because Kim did not mention what kind of staining blue dye was used in his studies [ [153](#B153-medicines-05-00063)]. In 2002, Shin et al. confirmed the existence of PVS [ [154](#B154-medicines-05-00063)]. [155](#B155-medicines-05-00063)]. Independent experiments involved injection of radioactive tracers at acupuncture points to attempt to map out and visualize the routes of meridians [ [156](#B156-medicines-05-00063), [157](#B157-medicines-05-00063), [158](#B158-medicines-05-00063)]. An alternative study by Langevin and Yandow led to the hypothesis that networks of interstitial connective tissue constitute the link between acupuncture points and meridians tissue [ [159](#B159-medicines-05-00063)]. Ultrasound imaging reveals a visible connective tissue forming an intramuscular cleavage plane at acupuncture points but not at control points [ [159](#B159-medicines-05-00063)]. Another anatomical distinctive feature of acupuncture points is high densities of nerve endings [ [160](#B160-medicines-05-00063), [161](#B161-medicines-05-00063)]. [162](#B162-medicines-05-00063), [163](#B163-medicines-05-00063), [164](#B164-medicines-05-00063)]. However, Stux and Pomeranz were quite skeptical about these kinds of electrical properties [ [165](#B165-medicines-05-00063)] and Kramer et al. concluded that skin electrical resistance at acupuncture points can either be lower or higher compared to the surrounding area [ [166](#B166-medicines-05-00063)]. In 2010, Litscher et al. developed a miniaturized 48-channel skin impedance measurement system for needle and laser acupuncture [ [164](#B164-medicines-05-00063)]. This system was further improved and a new multi-channel skin resistance measuring system, called GEDIS (Graz ElectroDermal Impedance measurement System) was used to differentiate the electrical skin resistance measurement between an acupuncture point and a placebo point. The system performs \"electrodermal mapping\", and shows that the skin resistance at the acupuncture point has lower impedance values as compared to the non-acupuncture point [ [167](#B167-medicines-05-00063)]. [168](#B168-medicines-05-00063), [169](#B169-medicines-05-00063), [170](#B170-medicines-05-00063)]. Marcelli, Peuker and and Cheng, have made some studies of the morphological characteristics between the meridians and the anatomical structure [ [171](#B171-medicines-05-00063), [172](#B172-medicines-05-00063), [173](#B173-medicines-05-00063), [174](#B174-medicines-05-00063)]. Shaw and McLennan did an anatomical dissection study based on investigation of cadaveric specimens. They concluded that acupuncture points and meridians are purposefully named to reflect the observable physical form, e.g., heart meridian, lung meridian, etc. [ [175](#B175-medicines-05-00063)]. Anatomical dissections in ancient China are mentioned in chapter 12 of the Huang Di Nei Jing Ling Shu. Here, the imperial physician Qi Bo explains the fundamental structures of the human organism to the emperor Huang Di. The physician says: \"After someone has died his body can be anatomically dissected and be examined (for medical investigation)\" [ [127](#B127-medicines-05-00063)]. As another source of evidence to prove that acupuncture points are anatomically correct, the chapter 42 of Nanjing describes the length, diameter, weight and capacity of the internal organs [ [120](#B120-medicines-05-00063)]. In chapter 7 of Book 3 from Mi Huang-Fu's Jia Yi Jing, the measurement of bones and intestines, and the volume of the stomach and intestines were clearly explained [ [129](#B129-medicines-05-00063)]. That is why the names for the internal organs used today are the same as the name of TCM organs defined more than 2000 years ago from Huang Di Nei Jing Ling Shu [ [127](#B127-medicines-05-00063)]. [146](#B146-medicines-05-00063)]. LU 7 Lieque (Broken Sequence) is also the Luo-Connecting Point of the Lung meridian. From LU 7, the meridian branches out and links to the large intestine meridian, at LI 4 Hegu (Joining Valley), also known as Yuan-Source Point [ [151](#B151-medicines-05-00063)]. From an anatomical point of view, both points are located at the branch from the main cephalic vein, which is supplied by the radial nerve [ [176](#B176-medicines-05-00063)]. This evidence supports that acupuncture points and meridians correspond to anatomically defined positions in the human body. Pushing this idea further at the molecular level, Zhang et al. studied the connection between the heart and stomach meridians to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and gastrointestinal disorders (GIDs) and found that both CVDs and GIDs express sets of genes which are functionally related [ [177](#B177-medicines-05-00063)]. [178](#B178-medicines-05-00063)]. The fascial anatomy has a striking anatomical correlation to acupuncture points and meridians. Finando and Finando suggest that all fundamental characteristics of acupuncture treatment are consistent with stimulation of the fascia [ [179](#B179-medicines-05-00063)]. 6.2. Acupuncture Points, Ashi Points, Myofascial Trigger Points (mTrPs) and Referral Pain [180](#B180-medicines-05-00063)]. Inspired by this study, Travell et al. realized that pressure applied to specific points (later defined as trigger points) relieved pain from shoulder and arm pain [ [181](#B181-medicines-05-00063)]. Later, Travell together with Simons, through their collaboration published their texts Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction, the Trigger Point Manual in 1983 [ [182](#B182-medicines-05-00063), [183](#B183-medicines-05-00063)]. Trigger points were described as locally tender points associated with focal areas of muscle shortening termed \"taut bands\". When palpated, trigger points can feel like small nodules within the muscle and may refer pain distally [ [182](#B182-medicines-05-00063), [183](#B183-medicines-05-00063)]. Dorsher, did a study based on Travell and Simons' texts, and found that 93.3% of the common myofascial trigger points (238 out of 255) correspond to the classical acupuncture points [ [184](#B184-medicines-05-00063)]. [144](#B144-medicines-05-00063)]. Ashi points, are very comparable to trigger points and were first mentioned in Bei Ji Qian Jin Yao Fang (Important Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces for Emergency) compiled by Sun Simiao in the Tang dynasty [ [185](#B185-medicines-05-00063)]. Chapter 13 of Huang Di Nei Jing Ling Shu, describes a treatment method, referring to Ashi points as \"tenderness was taken as needling point\" [ [127](#B127-medicines-05-00063)]. Ashi points are also used in other methods of treatment, such as Japanese shiatsu, Thai massage and Swedish deep tissue massage [ [186](#B186-medicines-05-00063)]. [187](#B187-medicines-05-00063), [188](#B188-medicines-05-00063)]. This kind of referred pain occurs due to the sharing of information between visceral and somatic afferent nerve fibres within overlapping spinal cord segments. The confusion about the origin of pain results from the density of sensory nerves higher in the skin than the heart [ [189](#B189-medicines-05-00063)]. [190](#B190-medicines-05-00063)]. Their findings provide a possible morphological and physiological explanation for the relation between referred cardiac pain and HM [ [190](#B190-medicines-05-00063)]. It is thus not surprising that traditionally, HM is being used to treat cardiac related illness, such as palpitation or cardiac arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, myocardial give a detailed explanation about Qi formation. The production of Qi comes from the combination of food that we take and air that we breathe. Food is digested by the stomach and the nutrition is absorbed by the spleen and sent to the lung to form gathering Qi. The gathering Qi assists the lung in controlling Qi and breathing, and enhances the heart's function of governing blood and blood vessels. It combines with original Qi that originates from the kidney and can be compared to the dynamic motive force that activates and moves the functional activity of all the organs, to form true Qi. True Qi is the final stage in the process of refinement and transformation of Qi. True Qi is further divided into nutritive Qi and defensive Qi. The main function of nutritive Qi is to nourish the internal organs. Nutritive Qi is also related to blood, and flows in the channels and blood vessels. Nutritive Qi is activated whenever a needle is inserted in an acupuncture point. As the name implies, defensive Qi means to defend or to protect the body. Unlike nutritive Qi, it flows outside of the channels [ [192](#B192-medicines-05-00063)]. 7.1. How to Relate Qi to Molecular Knowledge of Modern Medicine? [188](#B188-medicines-05-00063)]. ATP is also involved in the process of muscle contraction and relaxation [ [188](#B188-medicines-05-00063)], inflammation [ [102](#B102-medicines-05-00063)] and the analgesic effect [195](#B195-medicines-05-00063), [196](#B196-medicines-05-00063), [197](#B197-medicines-05-00063), [198](#B198-medicines-05-00063), [199](#B199-medicines-05-00063), [200](#B200-medicines-05-00063), [201](#B201-medicines-05-00063)], as explained below. 7.2. Energy and Information [131](#B131-medicines-05-00063)]) and won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1937. He quoted \"In every culture and in every medical tradition before ours, healing was accomplished by moving energy\" [ [202](#B202-medicines-05-00063)]. The word \"energy\", for Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi, meant a cloud of electrons held together by nuclei [ [203](#B203-medicines-05-00063)]. He published a trilogy [ [202](#B202-medicines-05-00063), [204](#B204-medicines-05-00063), [205](#B205-medicines-05-00063)], based on his observation in the presence of energy in the living organisms during his study on cancer research. His study of energy in biology was linked to the role of purines and ATP as extracellular signaling molecules [ [206](#B206-medicines-05-00063)]. Later, this would have a great impact on the research of acupuncture. James Oschman, author of Energy Medicine, described the involvement of energy in the healing processes. The body is capable to take in, store, release, conduct, and utilise various kinds of energy and information [ [207](#B207-medicines-05-00063)]. [102](#B102-medicines-05-00063)]. For example, action potential takes place by sending electrical impulses to the brain through afferent nerve fibres, such as in the event of pain or injury. To carry the information from one neuron to the next, neurotransmitters require energy in the form of ATP [ [208](#B208-medicines-05-00063)]. An action potential is also triggered by the stimulation of acupuncture needle insertion, which in turn affects the activities in the brain neuronal network [ [209](#B209-medicines-05-00063)]. [210](#B210-medicines-05-00063)], hypothesizes that the acupuncture meridians are electrical conductors that send injury signals to the brain, which responds with the appropriate level of direct current to stimulate healing in the injured area. He also believed that the conductivity of the skin is much higher at acupuncture points. [211](#B211-medicines-05-00063)], believed that Qi is equivalent to or perhaps the same as the electromagnetic energy found in biologically closed electrical circuits (BCEC). Its Yin and Yang components may be compared to the positive and negative electrical charges of closed circuit ionic flow. If the acupuncture needle is inserted through the normal muscle into the injured muscle, it thus acts as a short circuit to enable the flow of ions. This facilitates healing of the injured tissue. Both Becker [ [210](#B210-medicines-05-00063)] and Nordenstr\u00f6m [ [211](#B211-medicines-05-00063)] believed that the process of healing might work electrically. [212](#B212-medicines-05-00063)]. The body's fluctuating magnetic fields, such as those from the heart are 100 times stronger than the field generated by the brain and can be detected up to a meter away from the body, in all directions, using SQUID-based magnetometers [ [213](#B213-medicines-05-00063)]. Both the magnetic fields produced by the heart and brain, can be measured via electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG), respectively. Russek et al. proposed that the heart plays the major role in generating as well as integrating the flow of energy in the body [ [214](#B214-medicines-05-00063)]. [215](#B215-medicines-05-00063)]. The balance between Yin and Yang that constitutes Qi could reflect cellular activities, which balance the actions of endogenous agonists and antagonists, and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems [ [216](#B216-medicines-05-00063)]. 8. Is Acupuncture a Placebo Intervention? [217](#B217-medicines-05-00063)]. [Table 1](#medicines-05-00063-t001)summarized some of the RCTs of LBP treated with acupuncture. There was no special search strategy used to select the publications for [Table 1](#medicines-05-00063-t001)and [Table 2](#medicines-05-00063-t002)and therefore it is rather an overview than evidence based on a systematic search method. Most articles can be found in the database Pubmed. 8.1. In the Wake of Double-Blind Randomised Control Trials (RCTs) [233](#B233-medicines-05-00063)]. The idea was put forward by Austin Bradford Hill back in 1937 [ [234](#B234-medicines-05-00063)]. Before the mid-20th century, the practice of informed consent was not mandatory. Patients were often not informed of their involvement in a clinical study and did not realize that they might receive a placebo instead of a real treatment [ [235](#B235-medicines-05-00063)]. [217](#B217-medicines-05-00063), [234](#B234-medicines-05-00063), [235](#B235-medicines-05-00063), [236](#B236-medicines-05-00063)]. Such biases originate from several sources. Patients' awareness of trials might lead to exaggerated expectations and researchers might depend heavily on the pharmaceutical industry funding and may not be effectively protected from transmitting their sponsor's bias in favour of a new drug [ [247](#B247-medicines-05-00063), [248](#B248-medicines-05-00063)]. Surveys showed that double-blind methodologies are still not always properly applied to clinical tests [ [236](#B236-medicines-05-00063), [249](#B249-medicines-05-00063), [250](#B250-medicines-05-00063), [251](#B251-medicines-05-00063)]. 8.2. The Placebo Effect [237](#B237-medicines-05-00063)]. According to Shapiro, a placebo is defined as \"any therapeutic procedure (or a component of any therapeutic procedure) which is given (1) deliberately to have an effect, or (2) unknowingly and has an effect on a symptom, syndrome, disease, or patient but which is objectively without specific activity for the condition being treated. The placebo is also used as an adequate control in research. The placebo effect is defined as the changes produced by placebos\" [ [252](#B252-medicines-05-00063)]. [235](#B235-medicines-05-00063)]. Miller and Kaptchuk proposed this kind of placebo effect as \"contextual healing\", in which a specific clinical encounter contributes to therapeutic outcomes [ [253](#B253-medicines-05-00063)]. Jay Katz, author of The Silent World of Doctor and Patient, noted that \"Physicians and patients may gradually learn that the placebo effect is an integral and inevitable component of the practice of medicine, that it constitutes its art and augments its science\" [ [254](#B254-medicines-05-00063)]. Kerr et al. expressed \"neurophenomenological\" as the reason that caused the placebo effect from sham acupuncture due to the palpation and touch by the practitioner and tactile stimulation by sham acupuncture needles [ [255](#B255-medicines-05-00063)]. [238](#B238-medicines-05-00063), [239](#B239-medicines-05-00063), [240](#B240-medicines-05-00063)]. Expectation of benefit also plays an important role in the efficacy of placebo interventions [ Powerful Placebo\", suggests that placebos can relieve pain arising from physiological causes and have an average significant effectiveness of 35.2 \u00b1 2.2% [ [256](#B256-medicines-05-00063)]. 8.3. Clinical Studies [Table 1](#medicines-05-00063-t001), placebo was significantly more effective than no-treatment groups or even standard medical care. This was demonstrated by an impressive series of three-arm studies in German Acupuncture Trials (GERAD) for relief of LBP [ [223](#B223-medicines-05-00063)]. Subsequently, the outcome of treatment of chronic LBP by acupuncture was so positive that German insurance companies agreed to cover the cost of such treatments [ [223](#B223-medicines-05-00063), [257](#B257-medicines-05-00063)]. [255](#B255-medicines-05-00063)], several studies proposed that afferent nerve fibres are involved in response to acupuncture treatment [ [110](#B110-medicines-05-00063), [112](#B112-medicines-05-00063)]. 8.4. Acupuncture Points for Lower Back Pain [Table 2](#medicines-05-00063-t002), only six out of 15 RCTs stated precisely which acupuncture points were used for the treatment of LBP. Of these, the most commonly used acupuncture points are GV 3, BL 23, BL 25 and BL 40. GV 3, BL 23 and BL 25 are all local points, while BL 40, located in the popliteal fossa, is a distal point for treating LBP. Other distal points are BL 60 and K 3, they are situated behind the lateral and medial malleolus. [232](#B232-medicines-05-00063), [258](#B258-medicines-05-00063)]. Lee et al. did an investigation based on 53 clinical studies and came out with a summary of the most frequently used acupuncture points for the treatment of LBP [ [258](#B258-medicines-05-00063)]. It clearly shows that both the bladder and gallbladder meridians are the chosen choice for treating LBP with acupuncture, especially BL 23 (51%), follow by BL 25 (43%), BL 24, 40, BL 60 and 30 (32% each), BL 26 and BL 32 (28% each), and GB 34 (21%). In the opinion of Maciocia, the proper selection of local and distal points is based on the location and the nature of pain, and depends on the condition, if it is either acute or chronic [ [144](#B144-medicines-05-00063)]. 8.5. Clinical Relevance [176](#B176-medicines-05-00063)], acupuncture points BL 23, BL 24 and BL 26 improve circulation to the local tissues and resolve myofascial dysfunction and promote tissue recovery. BL 25 is stimulated to relax the myofascia and free the nerves which are entrapped and irritated. BL 40 may improve circulation and nerve health by reducing myofascial tension caused by neurovascular compression. BL 60 and K 3 are located on each side of the ankle, and represent the distant points for LBP. They contain an extensive sympathetic nerve supply that provides homeostatic effects. GB 30 sits on top of the sciatic nerve and is a good choice to treat sciatica caused by piriformis entrapment syndromes. GB 34, located on the neck of fibular, is a choice point to treat common peroneal (fibular) nerve syndrome. GV 3, which is supplied by the spinal segmental nerve and the somatosomatic as well as somatovisceral reflex connections, has neuromodulatory properties for treating LBP, paraparesis, sciatic pain, genitourinary conditions, and lower gastrointestinal disorders. 9. Mechanism of Acupuncture [259](#B259-medicines-05-00063)]? According to Robinson, this interesting phenomenon is due to a higher density of sensory and sympathetic nerve fibres attached to blood vessels in distal than in proximal segments. Such an anatomical arrangement accounts for the relatively stronger autonomous responses associated with distal acupuncture points, especially those at the ends of the channels [ [176](#B176-medicines-05-00063)]. Dellon et al. came to the same conclusion concerning the higher concentration of sympathetic innervation in the foot [ [260](#B260-medicines-05-00063)]. [197](#B197-medicines-05-00063), Such micro-injury caused by the puncturing of the acupuncture needle in the skin results in release of ATP as anti-nociception agents that block pain was mentioned in the chapter 1 of Huang Di Nei Jing Ling Shu [ [127](#B127-medicines-05-00063)], literally means \"the arrival of vital energy\", which is widely viewed as an important role in the process of achieving therapeutic effectiveness of acupuncture treatment [ [127](#B127-medicines-05-00063), [165](#B165-medicines-05-00063), [271](#B271-medicines-05-00063), [272](#B272-medicines-05-00063), [273](#B273-medicines-05-00063), [274](#B274-medicines-05-00063)]. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study conducted by Napadow et al. shows an increase of blood flow to the penetrated sites that are linked to the sensation of Deqi [ [275](#B275-medicines-05-00063)]. Kong et al. found that the different intensity of acupuncture sensations is associated with the effect of analgesia [ [276](#B276-medicines-05-00063)]. Spaeth et al. concluded that real acupuncture tends to produce a stronger Deqi sensation and better clinical outcomes as compared to sham acupuncture [ [277](#B277-medicines-05-00063)]. However, White et al. indicated that the sensation of Deqi does not impact the efficacy of acupuncture treatment [ [278](#B278-medicines-05-00063)]. 9.2. Needle Grasp [159](#B159-medicines-05-00063), [279](#B279-medicines-05-00063), [280](#B280-medicines-05-00063)]. These authors hypothesize that the manoeuvre of the needle (by rotation or piston movement) causes needle grasp, and hence, Deqi is a result of collagen and elastic fibres winding and tightening around the needle. Such a mechanism is responsible for the increase in pull-out force induced by needle rotation [ [159](#B159-medicines-05-00063), [279](#B279-medicines-05-00063), [280](#B280-medicines-05-00063), [281](#B281-medicines-05-00063)]. The higher density of connective tissues at acupuncture points might explain the occurrence of needle grasp [ [159](#B159-medicines-05-00063)]. [159](#B159-medicines-05-00063), [279](#B279-medicines-05-00063), [280](#B280-medicines-05-00063), [281](#B281-medicines-05-00063)]. In addition, the manipulation of the acupuncture needle causes remodeling of fibroblasts in the connective tissue [232](#B232-medicines-05-00063)]. This conclusion arose from the fact that both real and sham acupuncture in these RCTs are involved in tactile stimulation [ [255](#B255-medicines-05-00063)]. The reason behind such phenomenon is due to the stimulation of the afferent nerve fibres [ [110](#B110-medicines-05-00063), [112](#B112-medicines-05-00063), [282](#B282-medicines-05-00063)]. Such superficial pressure via sham needling intervention can have significant effects on the brain's limbic system [ [245](#B245-medicines-05-00063), [283](#B283-medicines-05-00063)]. Acupuncture fMRI studies have shown that both tactile stimulation and acupuncture manipulation activate neural activities and thus might have a potential effect on pain modulation [ [283](#B283-medicines-05-00063), [284](#B284-medicines-05-00063), [285](#B285-medicines-05-00063), [286](#B286-medicines-05-00063)]. [287](#B287-medicines-05-00063)]. It is therefore plausible that many sham acupunctures, used as control procedures in acupuncture studies, activated this group of afferents and hence produced analgesic effects [ [110](#B110-medicines-05-00063), [112](#B112-medicines-05-00063)]. Zhou et al. concluded that afferent fibres of type II (A) and III (A) are responsible for transmitting the acupuncture signal, which are important for acupuncture analgesia [ [168](#B168-medicines-05-00063)]. theory of pain, which was proposed by Melzack and Wall back in 1965 [ [93](#B93-medicines-05-00063)], and later by Melzack, suggested that the stimulation by the acupuncture needle activates the inhibitory brainstem system and therefore blocks pain signals [ [291](#B291-medicines-05-00063)]. release of endogenous opioids an acupuncture needle have been well documented by many studies. This suggests a link between acupuncture and signaling mediated by neurotransmitters. [293](#B293-medicines-05-00063)]. A recent study conducted by Grissa et al. compared the effectiveness of acupuncture versus morphine in the management of acute pain in the emergency department. A reduction of pain by 92% was observed in patients treated with acupuncture, while morphine-treated patients experienced only 78% reduction. In addition, acupuncture-treated patients had a much faster pain recovery time (an average of 16 min compared to 28 min in the morphine control group) [ [294](#B294-medicines-05-00063)]. 9.5. ATP as Neurotransmitter [295](#B295-medicines-05-00063)]. In that same year, Drury and Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi described the effects of ATP on heart excitability, lowering of blood pressure and coronary vasodilation [ [206](#B206-medicines-05-00063)]. Research by Holton and Holton in 1954 identified ATP as a neurotransmitter in the somatosensory system. They demonstrated that ATP is released from peripheral endings of primary sensory neurons [ [296](#B296-medicines-05-00063)]. The signaling function of ATP in peripheral tissues was confirmed by numerous investigations done by Geoffrey Burnstock. This led to the discovery of Purinergic Signaling that consists of neurotransmission by purinergic receptors [ [297](#B297-medicines-05-00063)]. [298](#B298-medicines-05-00063)]. ATP activates P2X ligand-gated ion channel 3 receptors (P2X3), which are located on sensory nerves. Resulting signals modulate the pathways that lead to the CNS responsible for conscious awareness the core molecule of ATP and of nucleic acids, forms a unique link among cell energy, gene regulation, and neuronal excitability [ [302](#B302-medicines-05-00063)]. Adenosine is recognised by specific receptors, which regulate neuronal and non-neuronal cellular functions. As a neurotransmitter, adenosine regulates pain transmission in both the spinal cord and in the periphery [ [303](#B303-medicines-05-00063)]. Adenosine acts as an endogenous anti-inflammatory agent and as such plays an important role as a signaling molecule in immunity and inflammation [ [304](#B304-medicines-05-00063)]. Hence, adenosine is involved in nearly every aspect of cell function. [195](#B195-medicines-05-00063)]. In another study conducted by the same group in human subjects, they used tissue microdialysis to demonstrate the increased release of adenosine, adenosine monophosphate (AMP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and ATP at stimulated acupuncture points [ [196](#B196-medicines-05-00063)]. Both studies show that the concentration of interstitial purines were increased by mechanical stimulation from the acupuncture needle. In contrast, transgenic mice lacking adenosine A1 receptors do not show any sign of pain reduction [ [195](#B195-medicines-05-00063)]. [195](#B195-medicines-05-00063), [199](#B199-medicines-05-00063)]. Hurt and Zylka suggested that a longer period of pain relief might be achieved by injecting prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) into the acupuncture points [ [305](#B305-medicines-05-00063)]. Both dCF and PAP are agonists of ATP production in response to acupuncture treatment [ [195](#B195-medicines-05-00063), [305](#B305-medicines-05-00063)]. But the opposite is observed when an adenosine receptor antagonist, such as caffeine, is either taken orally or injected at the acupuncture points, which then interfere with the analgesic effect of acupuncture [ [199](#B199-medicines-05-00063), [306](#B306-medicines-05-00063)]. Interestingly, from their observation, Tang et al. concluded that the higher efficacy of acupuncture in China than in western countries could be due to the lower consumption of coffee in China than in Europe and America [ [268](#B268-medicines-05-00063)]. 10. Discussion [1](#B1-medicines-05-00063), [2](#B2-medicines-05-00063), [3](#B3-medicines-05-00063), [4](#B4-medicines-05-00063)]. There are increasing numbers of patients seeking complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, as a mean to supplement the conventional treatments. Many studies have produced conflicting results relating to the efficacy of acupuncture as a method to treat LBP. This is probably due to a small sample sizes, a lack of blinding procedures and improper methodological assessment tools [ [5](#B5-medicines-05-00063), [61](#B61-medicines-05-00063), [65](#B65-medicines-05-00063), [113](#B113-medicines-05-00063), [115](#B115-medicines-05-00063)]. [Table 1](#medicines-05-00063-t001)). It was interesting to observe the outcomes from the verum and sham acupuncture groups ( [Table 1](#medicines-05-00063-t001)). Both groups produced better results than conventional therapies or non-treatment groups and it was obvious that verum acupuncture produced slightly better results than sham acupuncture. The reason behind such a phenomenon could be attributed to tactile stimulation. Both puncturing the skin by acupuncture needle, and stimulation by sham needle on the skin surface, activate the afferent sensory receptors, leading to results of some of the systematic reviews indicated that acupuncture might be an effective treatment for chronic LBP in the short-term, conclusions among the reviews are inconsistent overall. 11. Conclusions [310](#B310-medicines-05-00063)]. A meta-analysis of 33 RCTs of acupuncture for LBP showed better results than sham acupuncture and no treatment [ [311](#B311-medicines-05-00063)]. Meanwhile, the evidence for efficacy of the German Acupuncture Trials (GERAD) of 1162 patients with chronic low back pain compared verum acupuncture, sham acupuncture and a conventional therapy group as the control. The effectiveness of acupuncture, both verum and sham, was almost twice that of conventional therapy 6 months after the trial [ [223](#B223-medicines-05-00063)]. Acupuncture is recommended for patients with chronic LBP due to its cost-effectiveness [ [312](#B312-medicines-05-00063)] and low adverse effects [ [313](#B313-medicines-05-00063)].
