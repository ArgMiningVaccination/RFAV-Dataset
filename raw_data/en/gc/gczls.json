taste, touch, smell, hearing, and sight Cannabinoid Receptors21-25 Receptors are CB1and CB2 CB1- mostly expressed in the brain, but also found in adipose tissue, liver, muscle, GI tract, and in reproductive and cardiovascular tissues CB2- mostly expressed in immune cells G-protein coupled receptors CB1Receptor28 Effects of CB1are glutamate, and D-aspartate CB2Receptor28 Present mainly on peripheral tissues and central immune cells Activation of this receptor leads to: Immunosuppression Anti-inflammatory effects Anti-nociceptive effects What is CBD?10 Cannabidiol (CBD) is a cannabinoid, but it does not affect mind or behavior It is useful in reducing pain and inflammation, controlling epileptic seizures, and possibly treating mental illness and addictions What is THC?10,11,31 THC is short for 9- tetrahydrocannabinol It is a potent antioxidant with neuroprotective properties THC is a partial agonist for the CB1 receptor CB1 receptors regulate the release of other neurotransmitters What is THC?10,11 THC increases appetite and reduces nausea THC may also decrease pain, inflammation, and muscle control problems The FDA has approved the use of THC for appetite and nausea reduction purposes Dronabinol Pharmacokinetics & Pharmacodynamics Forms of medical marijuana2 Smoked - most common form Capsules Vaporization Edible form Suppositories Liquid to drink Pharmacology of Cannabis Cannabinoids are highly lipop hilic and lipoprotein bound Volume of distribution (Vd) = 10 L/kg Blood concentrations are therefore not directly related to the drug effect The release from the lipid stores along with enterohepatic recirculation accounts for retention of THC Terminal half-life is > 4 days in frequent users Pharmacology of Cannabis Urine THC can be detected for days after use Passive inhalation - requires very high concentrations of smoke in a small enclosed area Very unlikely Onset and duration of cannabis Physical and psychosocial effects commence within minutes after use Usually within 15 minutes Peak effects occur within 30 minutes to 60 minutes post-smoking and last 2-4 hours Psychosocial effects can stay for up to 4 to 8 hours depending upon route of administration Oral has a slower onset, but longer durationPsychosocial effects Effects do not depend on blood concentration Depends partially on the dose Effects are dose-dependent and route-dependent Lower dose effects: euphoria, relaxat ion, wide range from exhilaration to introspection, distortion of time and some visual hallucinations, memory distortions (especially short-term memory), hunger Higher dose effects: anxiety, tension, an ger, confusion, hallucinations, paranoia, and panic attacks Pharmacokinetics of smoking THC31 Bioavailability: 10-25% 50% of the THC content is delivered into smoke 50% of smoke is exhaled again 60% of inhaled smoke may be metabolized by the lung Peak concentrations are reached within minutes T1/2distribution: 0.5hr T1/2elimination: 30hr THC31 Bioavailability: 5-20% Usually 1/3 of that smoked due to gastric degradation and extensive first pass metabolism effects High patient variability Can lead to increased toxicities because delayed effect Multiple low peak concentrations dose: >18mg Tolerance to THC exists via the down regulation of the CB1 receptors High tolerance occurs with chronic use Low tolerance occurs with intermittent use Vaporization Cannabinoids vaporize at a temperature lower than combustion Results in lower percent of noxious chemicals Pharmacodynamics of THC32 Elevation in heart rate: average >19bpm Increase in subjective feeling high Decrease in subjective alertness Increase in motor instability Body sway PK/PD Model of THC32 In study by Zuuman et al, subjects were given increasing doses (2, 4, 6, 8mg) of THC via vaporizer at 1.5hr intervals PK/PD Model THC32 cannabis on Hormones Males: Decreases luteinizing hormone (LH) Decreases follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) Decreased Prolactin Decreased growth hormone (GH) Females: More sensitive than males to THC effects Higher estrogen levels Marijuana effects on the brainMarijuana effects Hypothalamus: increased appetite Brain stem: nausea relief, lowered blood pressure, drowsiness, decreased pain, decreased spasticity, and decreased tremor. Hippocampus: memory impairment Marijuana effects Cerebral cortex: altered consciousness, perceptual distortions, memory impairment, delusions, hallucinations Cerebellum: loss of coordination Amygdala: changes in anxiety, pain attacks, lowered traumatic memories, decreased hostility Uses of medical marijuanaQualifying Medical Conditions3 Alzheimer's Disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Cachexia C Crohn's Disease Severe and chronic pain Severe and persistent muscle spasms Ex.

The Role of Ketamine in Psychiatry, Addiction, and Pain ManagementBackground Ketamine first synthesized in 1960s as alternative to phencyclinde Initially, used as a dissociative anesthetic Limited use in contemporary anesthes ia due to side effects, namely psychedelic symptoms (Niesters et al. 2013) More commonly used in animal anesthesia (Morgan, Curran 2012) At subanesthetic doses, produces analgesiaPharmacology A non-competitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor - blocks glutamate action S(+) isomer has higher affinity fo r NMDA receptor than isomer (Morgan, Curran opioidergic receptors (Niesters et al. 2013)Psychiatric effects Emergence symptoms after IV infusion - hallucinations, delusions, 'out-of- body' experiences Induces transient symptoms of schizo phrenia in healthy patients but no evidence linking chronic ketamine use to diagnosis of psychiatric disorders Frequent users exhibited profound im pairment of long and short term memory (Morgan, Curran 2012)Reward and Dependence Increases dopaminergic modulation in the brain (similar to other addictive substances) activates reward pathway Interaction with \u00b5 opioid receptor s may contribute to its rewarding properties Some case reports of ketamine dependence but no large scale studies undertaken so incidence of ketamine dependence is unknown Frequent users report increasing dose over time (tolerance) (Morgan, Curran 2012)Role in Alcohol Dependence Study by Krupitsky and Grinenko 1997 demonstrated benefit of adding ketamine psychedelic therapy (KPT) to standard therapy 65.8% of KPT group showed total abstin ence > 1 year compared to 24% of standard treatment groupRole in Depression IV infusion of ketamine resulted in rapid antidepressant effect, but only lasted 1-2 weeks 0.5 mg/kg dosing was used in one study Response rates 24 h after ketamine infusion (71%) matched the rates after 6-8 weeks (65%) of standard monoaminergic therapy (Naughton et al. 2014) Rapid reduction in suicidal ideation independent of antidepressant effect (Caddy et al. 2014)Role in Depression Dissociative and psychotomimetic effe cts followed ketamine infusion but did not last longer than 80 min (Caddy et al. 2014) Bottom line: ketamine's antidepressant effects peak at 24 h post infusion and generally last 1-2 weeksRole in Depression Clinical use? Can provide immediate relief until monoaminergic therapy takes effect Prevent loss of work or school days Reduce suicide Shorten hospital stays Overall, good safety profile associated with single dose of ketamine (not enough info on repeated infusions) (Naughton et al. 2014)Role in Pain Management Antagonism of NMDA receptor thought to modulate pain Potent analgesic at sub-anesthetic doses (0.5-1 mg/kg/hr) that prevents sensitization of spinal neurons to painful stimuli (Morgan, Curran et al. 2012) Roles in acute, chronic, and cancer/palliative care painRole in Pain Management Acute pain Recommended to start 0.1 mg/kg i.v. ketamine and titrating up with a limit of 0.5 mg/kg Dose required for treating acute pain can lead to loss of consciousness in patients (Persson 2013)Chronic Pain A 2003 review of chronic neuropathic pain conditions concluded that evidence for the efficacy of ketamine is moderate to weak Long-term efficacy and safety of ketamine is not well-studied (Persson 2013)Role in Pain Management Not well-established in cancer/palliative care pain (Persson 2013) May be used as adjuvant therapy if standard therapy is not effecive Caution since ketamine may upregulate mTor, which accelerates tumor growth (Naughton et al. 2014) Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) Current level of evidence is 2B - weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence Need large, well-designed controlled trials (Azari et al. 2012)Role in Pain Management Ketamine in postoperative pain syst ematic review by Laskowski et al. 2012 Treatment group: ketamine + opioid if necessary Placebo group: just opioid IV ketamine effective at reducing op ioid consumption and delaying time to first analgesic dose in patients with postoperative pain Increased neuropsychiatric effects a ssociated with postoperative Pain Management Postoperative pain (cont.) IV ketamine better in some situations Least opioid reduction in head and neck surgery Upper thoracic and abdominal surgeries had greater opioid reduction VAS pain scores > 7/10 showed gr eatest reduction in opioid use Site of surgery and intensity of pain affect the degree of opioid reduction Despite using more opioid, 78% of placebo groups experienced significantly more pain than ketamine treatment groups Implies that ketamine improves overall quality of pain control (Laskowski et al. 2011)Summary/Conclusion Ketamine is still undergoing exper imental study in regards to its antidepressant effects, not ready for consistent clinical use Ketamine has analgesic properties but has limited use in treating various types of pain Well-designed, randomized clinical tr ials required to corroborate case reports of efficacy Further investigation into ketamine's mechanisms of action may elucidate how to better utilize ketamineReferences 1.
