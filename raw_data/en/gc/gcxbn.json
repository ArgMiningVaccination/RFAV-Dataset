In areas remote from urban or industrial activities, the levels of PAH found in unprocessed foods reflect the background contamination, which originates from long distance airborne transportation of contaminated particles and natural emissions from volcanoes and forest fires. In the neighbourhood of industrial areas or along highways, the contamination of vegetation can be ten-fold higher than in rural areas (Hancock et al. , 1970, personal communication from Lambr\u00e9, C., 2002; Larsson and Sahlberg, 1982). Processing of food (such as drying and smoking ) and cooking of foods at high temperatures (grilling, roasting, frying) are major sources generating PAH (Guillen et al. , 1997; Phillips, 1999). Levels as high as 200 \u00b5g/kg food have been found for individual PAH in smoked fish and meat. In barbecued meat, 130 \u00b5g/kg has been reported whereas the average background values are usually in the range of 0.01-1 \u00b5g/kg in uncooked foods.Contamination of vegetable o ils (including olive residue oils) with PAH usually occurs during technological processes like direct fire drying, where combustion products may come into contact with the oil seeds or oil (Speer et al. , 1990; Standing Committee on Foodstuffs, 2001). Examples of PAH levels in a numbe r of foods can be found in table 1.1.1. 1.1.1 Sources of environmen tal PAH contamination Foods can be contaminated by PAH that are pr esent in air (by deposition), soil (by transfer) or water (deposition and transfer). The sources , natural and mostly anthropogenic, of PAH in the environment are numerous and include (IPCS, 1998): /g252 Stubble burning (Ramdahl and Moller, 1983) and spreading of contaminated sewage sludge on agricultural fields (Hembrock-He ger and Konig, 1990; cited by IPCS, 1998). /g252 Exhausts from mobile sources (motor vehicl es and aircrafts). Close to an emission source such as a motorway, very high concentrations of PAH were detected in the surface layer, but soil at a depth of 4-8 cm was two times less contaminated (Butler et al., 1984; cited by IPCS, 1998). Close to highwa ys, concentrations of PAH in the soil in the range of 2-5 mg/kg can be found whereas in unpolluted areas, the levels are in the range of 5-100 \u00b5g/kg. The distribution and con centration of PAH in soil, leaf litter, and soil fauna depend broadly on the distance from the roadside.A6/g252 Industrial plants (e.g. aluminum foundries, incinerators). /g252 Wood preservation, use of tar coated wood. Oyst ers and mussels grown in beds with tar or creosote coated wood posts may be contaminated with PAH. /g252 Domestic heating with open fireplaces. Levels of PAH in the atmosphere appear to be higher in the winter than in the summer period. /g252 Burning of coal for thermal and electric energy. The quantity emitted varies widely depending on the quality of coal and on the combustiton process. /g252 Burning of automobile tires or of creosote treated wood releases considerable amounts of PAH. /g252 PAH present in tobacco smoke contaminate bot h the atmosphere of the kitchen and the foods during preparation and cooking. /g252 Oil pollution of surface waters and soils. /g252 Forest fires and volcanic eruptions (Hites et al. , 1980; cited in IPCS, 1998). 1.1.2 Physical and chemical properties of P AH influencing their occurrence in foods The occurrence of PAH in foods is influenced by the same ph ysicochemical characteristics that determine their absorption and distribution in man. These are their relative solubility in water and organic solvents, which determine their capacity for transport and distribution between different environmental compartments and their uptake and accumulation by livingorganisms. The transportation of PAH in the atmosphere is influenced by their volatility. The chemical reactivity of PAH influences adsorption to organic material or degradation in the environment. All these factors determine the persistence and capacity of PAH tobioaccumulate in the food chain. PAH are lipophilic and generally have a very poor aqueous solubility. PAH accumulate in lipid tissue of plants and animals. PAH will not tend to accumulate in plant tissues with a high water content and limited transfer from the soil to root vegetables will occur. The rate of transfer varies widely and is also influenced by soil characteristics, the plant and thepresence of co-pollutants. PAH adsorb strong ly to the organic fraction of soils and do not penetrate deeply into most soils, theref ore limiting both leaching to groundwater and availability for uptake by plants. Some PAH are semi volatile but most of them tend to adsorb on organic particulate matter.Heavier PAH preferentially associate with particulate matter so atmospheric fall out is aprincipal route of contamin ation (Edwards, 1983; Nielsen et al. , 1996). PAH with 5 or more aromatic rings are found predominantly on pa rticulates, (usually on small (< 2.5 \u00b5m) particles such as fly ash and soot). PAH with 2 or 3 rings are almost entirely in the vapor phase, those with 4 rings bein g in an intermediate position. A7Consequently, vegetables with large leafs, grazing cattle and poultry which may ingest particulate matter from soil are susceptible to contamination by PAH adsorbed to particles.The waxy surface of vegetables and fruits can concentrate low molecular mass PAH mainly through surface adsorption. PAH concentrati ons are generally greater on plant surface (peel, outer leaves) than on internal tissue. Careful washing may remove up to 50% of thetotal PAH. Particle bound PAH ar e easily washed off the surface whereas those in the waxy layer are less efficiently removed, washing may alter the apparent high to low molecular mass PAH profile. When particulates fall out into surface water, they are transported in suspension and surfaceadsorbed PAH finally end up in fresh water or marine sediments. PAH are strongly bound to these sediments which constitute a poten tial pollution reservoir for PAH release under specific conditions. Sediment-dwelling and filtering organisms are most susceptible to contamination. Most organisms have a high bio-transformation potential for PAH resulting in no significant bio-magnification in th e aquatic food chain. However filter-feeding bivalves (e.g. mussels and oysters) filter large volumes of water and have a low metabolic capacity for PAH, they may accumulate PAH. The water-soluble low molecular mass PAHare rapidly degraded in water but sustained release of PAH in waste water can result in elevated concentrations in bivalves grown cl ose to industrialized areas. The accumulation of sediment-adsorbed PAH depends on the contaminant (Baumard et al. , 1998, personal communication from Lambr\u00e9, C., 2002). Degradation PAH are chemically stable and very poorly degraded by hydrolysis (Howard et al. , 1991; cited in IPCS, 1998) but are susceptible to oxidation and photo-degr adation in light. PAH half lives in air range from a few hours to days and estimated PAH half lives in soils varyfrom several months to several years. Abiotic degradation may remove 2-20% of two and three ring PAH in contaminated soils (Park et al. , 1990; cited in IPCS, 1998). PAH with 4 or more aromatic rings persist in the environment but they are often strongly adsorbed toorganic matter. Following degradation, oxidiz ed reaction products may be formed which tend to react with biological components. Reaction with nitrogen oxides and nitric acid in the atmosphere can form nitro derivatives, which could contaminate foods. Thus although parent compounds cannot always be detected in PAH contaminated foods, degradation products or derivatives, some of which have significant toxicity, may be present. The half- lives in soil and air depends on various parame ters (e.g. type of adsorption onto particles, molecular weight) and range from hours to da ys for air and months to years for soil.A8Biodegradation The most significant information on biodegr adation is summarized below (IPCS, 1998): /g252 The biotransformation potentia l of aquatic organi sms depends on the activity of their cytochrome P450-dependent mixed-function oxidases (James, 1989; cited in IPCS, 1998). Biotransformation mainly takes place in liver, lung, kidney, placenta, intestinal tract, and skin (Cerniglia, 1984; cited in IPCS, 1998). /g252 The initial transformation step in invertebrates is usually slower in vertebrates. /g252 Invertebrates excrete differences in biotransfo rmation of PAH between different species of crustaceans. /g252 There are marked differences in biotransformation for different PAH within each species of crustaceans. /g252 Limited information prevents conclusions on biotransformation by algae, plants and fungi. 1.1.3 Contamination of food with PAH during processing and smoking Processing procedures, such as smoking and drying, and cooking of food is commonly thought to be the major source of conta mination by PAH. Depending on a number of parameters: time, fuel used, distance from the heat source and drainage of fat, type (grilling, frying, roasting), cooking results in the production in the food of a number of compounds including PAH. Although not precisely kno wn, it is likely that there are several mechanisms of formation of PAH such as melted fat that undergoes pyrolysis when dripping onto the heat and pyrolysis of the meat due to the high temperature (Lijinsky and Shubik, 1965 a, b). A comparison of PAH levels in duck breast steaks, undergoing various processing and cooking treatments for 0.5 hour to 1.5 hours, showed that charcoal grilled samples without skin contained the highest amount of total PAH (320 \u00b5g/kg), followed by charcoal grilling with skin (300 \u00b5g/kg), smoking (210 \u00b5g/kg), roasting (130 \u00b5g/kg),steaming (8.6 \u00b5g/kg) and liquid smoke flavourin g (0.3 \u00b5g/kg). For PAH that are classified as carcinogenic (IARC class 1 or 2 A and B), the trend was the same with the exception that smoked samples contained the highest amount (35 \u00b5g/kg). In addition, the highest amounts of total and carcinogenic PAH were observe d after smoking of duck breast samples for 3 hours (53 \u00b5g/kg) (Chen and Lin, 1997). Contamination of water may le ad to intake of PAH throug h drinking water and cooked foods. The levels are usually below 1 ng/L in drinking water but can be higher when asphalt or coal tar coating of storage tanks and water distribution pipes are used.A91.1.4 Analytical Methods Following homogenization of the foodstuff, P AH are extracted using different techniques prior to clean up and purification. PAH are most often identified and quantified using either gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection (FID) or coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet orfluorescence detection or coupled to MS. In addition to potential losses of PAH dur ing homogenization, extraction and clean up, there are a number of other factors that ma y lead to erroneous results. During sample collection and storage it is important that the sample not be exposed to tobacco smoke, light and high temperatures (leading to volatilizati on and/or chemical conversion). Also storage for a prolonged time before analysis may result in the reaction of some PAH with components of the food matrix. Attention should also be paid to the possibl e co-elution of some PAH. For example, under the gas chromatographic conditions genera lly used, chrysene ]anthracenes may co-elute and give rise to only a single peak. When HP LC is used the separation of benzo[ may be critical. 1.1.5 Examples of data for various contaminated foods Examples of PAH levels in foods can be found in table 1.1.1. The criteria used to select the pertinent studies from the literature are descri bed in chapter 1.2 \"Profile of PAH occurring in food\". Barbecue PAH formation during charcoal grilling was s hown to be dependent upon the fat content of the meat, the time of cooking and the temper ature. For example a heavily barbecued lamb sausage contained 14 \u00b5g/kg of carcinogenic PAH (Mottier et al. , 2000). The presence of PAH was studied in several samples of meat and fish that were grilled on two geometrically different gas barbecues. In c ontrast to a horizontal barbecue, the vertical A10Notes, see end of table.Table 1.1.1 PAH concentrations measured in individual foods (\u00b5g/kg) Food group meat and meat products fish and marine foods mussels vegetables Food meat grilled fish smoked smoke d smoked smoked canned \"control\" from shellfish kale lettuce alettuce lettuce < 0.05 10.0 32.0 Phenanthrene 32.0 65.3 81 6.1 1.5 1.6 4.3 1.6 383 802Fluoranthene 0.5 297 0.8 107 9.1 26.0 16.3 11.2 < 1.4 4.1 117 28.0 9.3 5.5 146 176Pyrene 0.6 354 0.8 111 5.3 20.5 10.2 7.4 1.2 3.2 70 6.4 6.6 69.0 119 Benzo[a]fluorene 0.9 0.9 11.0 20.7 Benzo[b]fluorene 0.7 1.6 5.0 14.7 Benzofluorene, sum Benzo[ghi]fluoranthene Benz[a]anthracene 0.1 108 0.1 26.7 0.6 2.5 1.7 3.7 0.8 2.7 15 7.0 15.3Benzo[c]phenanthrene 0.3 0.8 9.2 Chrysene 0.2 0.7 0.6 2.5 Chrysene+triphenylene 2.7 8.7 1.6 5.2 62 20.0 47.7 Benzo[b]fluoranthene 0.04 0.1 0.1 1.2 0.2 2.7 15.4 6.1 Benzo[k]fluoranthene 0.01 0.04 0.1 0.5 0.4 n1.5 8.0 3.7 Benzo[b+j+k]fluoranthene 197 16.5 7.9 28.7 < 2.3 3.1 11.0 29.3 Benzo[a]pyrene 0.1 157 0.1 8.4 0.1 1.2 0.8 1.3 0.9 5.9 4.2 5.6 0.5 0.6 3.0 11.3Benzo[e]pyrene 0.03 60.9 0.1 4.8 0.3 4.8 3.9 17.6 7.9 0.7 0.7 4.0 11.3Perylene 0.02 0.3 < 0.1 1.8 0.5 1.7 < 0.2 0.1 1.0 2.7 Anthanthrene <0 . 0 5 Benzo[ghi]perylene 0.1 114 0.1 3.0 0.03 0.7 < 0.1 1.6 1.6 9.2 7.7 10.0 < 0.6 0.4 3.0 6.0Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene 1.1 < 0.1 1.1 < 0.8 4.5 7.9 2.4 < 0.4 3.0 8.7 Dibenz[a,h]anthracene 0.01 0.03 < 0.02 < 0.1 < 0.2 1.6 1.0 Dibenz[a,h+ac]anthracene < 6.1 < 1.0 0.4 < 0.1 0.1Dibenzo[a,h]pyrene 0.7 Dibenzo[a,i]pyrene 0.3A11Notes, see end of table.Table 1.1.1 (Cont'd) Food group fruits and confectionary cereals fatty foods Food grapes fbisquits pudding, biscuits sugar and bran breakfast milled bread white sunflower sunflower sunflower soya oil olive oil corn oil and cakes sweets cereals wheat bread oil oil oil 1.7 Anthracene 2.5 < 0.3 < 0.3 9.4 < 0.3 0.9 < 3.0 0.3 < 0.4 2.5 < 0.1Phenanthrene 29.5 < 2.0 < 2.0 94 10.0 < 2.0 3.8 43.3 1.0Fluoranthene 26.5 1.0 1.4 0.7 130 0.4 1.8 1.0 0.7 2.7 3.4 3.1 < 1.5 12.5 2.5Pyrene 11.5 2.0 47 0.6 1.6 0.5 2.7 1.0 2.6 < 2.4 9.2 2.6Benzo[a]fluorene < 1.5 Benzo[b]fluorene < 1.0 Benzofluorene, sum 29 0.6 Benzo[ghi]fluoranthene < 0.7 < 0.7 < 0.7Benz[a]anthracene 2.0 < 0.1 1.3 0.2 11 0.1 < 0.1 0.2 0.1 1.0 0.9 1.4 2.6Benzo[c]phenanthrene < 0.4 < 0.4 < 0.4Chrysene < 0.4 0.7 0.7 0.1 < 0.4 0.2 1.5Chrysene+triphenylene 9.0 9.7 0.3 1.5 5 3.9Benzo[b]fluoranthene 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.03 0.2 0.1 1.6 1.3 1.2 Benzo[k]fluoranthene 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.04 0.1 0.1 0.6 0.7 0.6 Benzo[b+j+k]fluoranthene 3.5 16 0.6 1.5 2.3 2.9 Benzo[a]pyrene 1.5 0.1 0.4 0.15 5.4 0.04 0.2 0.1 0.1 1.0 1.3 0.7 0.9 0.6 1.2Benzo[e]pyrene 1.5 0.7 5.2 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.7 0.7 1.3Perylene < 1.0 0.7 < 0.1 0.2 < 0.2 0.3Anthanthrene 0.1 < 0.2 Benzo[ghi]perylene < 1.0 < 0.1 0.6 < 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.1 1.2 1.4 0.5 1.3 < 0.4 1.0Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene < 1.0 < 0.2 0.7 < 0.2 0.1 < 0.2 0.2 0.9 1.2 0.4 0.8 0.4 0.8Dibenz[a,h]anthracene 0.1 < 0.01 < 0.01 0.3 < 0.5 < 0.2Dibenz[a,h+ac]anthracene <0 end of table.Table 1.1.1 (Cont'd) Food group others Food corn oil corn oil vegetable lard and margarine cheese butter chocolate beer skimmed dried fruit desiccated oils dripping milk powder 2.4 1.8 0.1 0.6 2.5 1.2 0.7 29.4Pyrene 19.1 4.7 3.5 2.3 2.1 0.8 1.2 3.6 0.8 1.3 24.5Benzo[a]fluoreneBenzo[b]fluoreneBenzofluorene, sumBenzo[ghi]fluorantheneBenz[a]anthracene 10.7 1.9 0.8 1.5 0.1 0.1 0.5 0.2 0.2 3.8Benzo[c]phenanthreneChrysene 11.7 2.1 0.7 1.9 0.1 0.1 0.7 0.2 0.3 4.8Chrysene+triphenyleneBenzo[b]fluoranthene 10.5 0.9 0.7 0.2 0.8 0.04 0.03 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 2.8 Benzo[k]fluoranthene 5.1 0.5 1.0 0.4 1.1 0.1 0.03 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 1.3 Benzo[b+j+k]fluorantheneBenzo[a]pyrene 10.7 0.9 1.3 0.4 1.7 0.04 0.1 0.2 0.04 0.1 0.1 3.4Benzo[e]pyrene 1.8 0.7 2.3 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 2.5PeryleneAnthanthrene < 0.1Benzo[ghi]perylene 6.1 < 0.4 1.5 0.5 1.8 0.1 0.2 0.6 0.1 0.2 0.1 4.5Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene 7.3 0.7 2.3 0.8 2.9 0.04 0.2 0.3 0.04 0.2 0.2 1.9 Dibenz[a,h]anthracene 2.3 < 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.3 < 0.01 < 0.01 0.03 < 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.1 Dibenz[a,h+ac]anthraceneDibenzo[a,h]pyrene Dibenzo[a,i]pyreneA13Notes table 1.1.1 -

Smoked foods On a quantitative basis, the data reported in the literature are highly variable. Such variations can be attributed in part to the di fferent procedures used to evaluate the presence of PAH, but the main reason for such discrepanc ies is the difference in procedures used for smoking. Such variables include: the type and composition of wood, type of generator, oxygen accessibility, temperature of smoke generation, and smoking time. PAH content in smoked fishery products from modern smoking kilns with external smoke generation and products from traditional smoking kilns ha ve been compared. The average benzo[ a]pyrene concentration determined for the traditional kilns was 1.2 \u00b5g/kg with a sum of carcinogenic compounds of 9 \u00b5g/kg, and 0.1 \u00b5g/kg and 4.5 \u00b5g/kg respectively, for the modern kilns (Karl and Leinemann, 1996). In Annex II of Directive 88/388/EEC (EEC, 1988), a maximum level of 0.03 \u00b5g benzo[ a]pyrene per kg as a result of the use of (smoke) flavourings has been set for foods tuffs or beverages as consumed. Regarding the generation of liquid smoke fla vorings, it has been showed that poplar wood generated the highest number and concentrati on of both total and carcinogenic PAH, while oak, cherry tree, beech samples were simila rly less effective. Hardwoods instead of softwoods have also been recommended, indee d, dry woods generate more PAH because of their higher smoke generation temperature (Guillen et al. , 2000). Vegetable oils Vegetable oils and fats are a significant source of PAH in the diet, either directly, as in the case of vegetable oils used for seasoning and margarine used for cooking, or indirectly by their incorporation into other foods such as the cereal-based products, biscuits and cakes (Dennis et al. , 1991). The occurrence of PAH in vegetable oils (including olive residue oils) is mostly related to the drying processes of the seeds where combustion gases may come into contact with the seeds (Speer et al. , 1990; Standing Committee on Foodstuffs, 2001). The levels of PAH in crude edible oils vary widely and refining (based on the deodorization step) reduces the concentration of a number of the lower mol ecular weight compounds such as fluoranthene, while no corresponding effect is observed for th e higher molecular weight PAH. The level of the latter may be reduced by treatment with activated charcoal (Larsson et al. , 1987); this refining method has been reported to be widely used (Dennis et al. , 1991).A15Coffee, tea Roasting and drying of coffee beans and tealeaves increase the PAH content (Stall and Eisenbrand, 1988). However, the PAH concentra tions found in the beverages were lower than in the beans/leaves (Lintas et al. , 1979; Maier, 1991). A Finnish study showed that roasted ground coffee and dried tealeaves cont ained high levels of PAH namely 100-200 \u00b5g/kg and 480-1400 \u00b5g/kg, respectively. However, PAH could not be detected in tea and coffee beverages (Hietaniemi et al. , 1999). A Spanish study on coffee brew samples s howed that their total PAH (8 compounds) content depends mainly on the sa mple elaboration. For instance, coffee brew made from de- caffeinated and green coffee beans were found to contain mean concentrations of 2.0 and 1.7 ng PAH/L coffee brew, respectively. The highest concentration (2.9 ng PAH/L ofcoffee brew) was found in coffee brew prepared from torrefied (roasted in the presence of sugar) beans (Kayali-Sayadi et al. , 1999). All the samples contained benzo[ a]pyrene and dibenzo[ a,h]anthracene. These results are in good agreement with available data for benzo[ a]pyrene in coffee brew, which are at the level of 1 ng/L (De Kruijf, 1987, personal communication from Lambr\u00e9, C., 2002). Human milk In a study conducted in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1984 a number of individual PAH compounds were found at concentrations ranging from 5 to 15 ng/kg human milk. Benzo[ a]pyrene was detected at a concentra tion of 6.5 ng/kg (number of samples not available; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinscha ft, 1984, cited in IPCS, 1998). In an Austrian study (Lechner et al., 1991), benzo[a]pyrene was not detected in any of 41 samples of human milk from the region of Tyrol (limit of detection: 0.1-1 \u00b5g/kg). In another German study, PAH levels rang ing from 3 to 30 ng/kg human milk were found (Heeschen, 1985; cited in IPCS, 1998). A Scientific Co-opera tion task (EC, 2001a) aimed at the collection of occurrence data of PAH in food in EU member states is current ly ongoing. A report will become available in 2003. 1.1.6 Measures to reduce PAH contamination of foods The amount of PAH formed during cooking or processing of food depends markedly on the conditions used. Simple practices are know n to result in a significantly reduced contamination of foods by PAH (Lijinsk y and Ross, 1967; Lijinsky, 1991; Knize et al. , 1999) as well as by other undesirable cont aminants. This may include selectingA16preferentially lean meat and fishes, avoiding contact of foods with flames for barbecuing, using less fat for grilling, and, in general, c ooking at lower temperature for a longer time. Broiling (heat source above) instead of grilling can significantly reduce the levels of PAH. Actually the fat should not drip down onto an open flame sending up a column of smoke that coats the food with PAH. The use of me dium to low heat, and placement of the meat further from the heat source, can greatly reduce formation of PAH. The intensity of flavour is not necessarily associated with the dept h of the brown color of grilled foods. It is therefore needless to overcook the food to ge t the flavour. However, cooking must always remains effective as regards inactivation of any possible contaminating bacteria orendogenous toxins. In some countries (e.g. Norway) the food aut horities have banned the sa le of shellfish and mussels caught in areas contaminated with PAH. The public is advised not to catch and consume PAH-contaminated she llfish and mussels. Depuration of contaminated mussels in clean water will not reduce their level of PAH significantly. The waxy surface of vegetables and fruits can concentrate low molecular mass PAH mainlythrough surface adsorption. The concentrati ons of PAH are generally higher on plant surface (peel, outer leaves) than in internal tissue. Consequently, careful washing may remove, on average, up to 50% of the total PAH. Particle bound high molecular mass PAH which remain on the surface are easily washed off whereas low molecular mass compoundswhich are in the vapor phase can penetrate th e waxy layer of fruits and vegetables and, therefore, are less efficiently removed by washing. 1.2 Profiles of PAH occurring in food The Committee noted that there were large differences in the choice of the PAH determinedby various authors making comparisons between results from analysis of food by different authors almost impossible. The Committee therefore examined the possibility of usingbenzo[ a]pyrene (which almost always is included in any analysis) as a marker for PAH in foods. The patterns of PAH distributi ons (profiles) relative to benzo[ a]pyrene in various foods were examined. In par ticular, the Committee considered the uncertainties in using benzo[ a]pyrene as a marker for the class of P AH compounds or for a defined set of PAH (e.g. the carcinogenic PAH). The PAH profiles were calculated from studies selected from the literature according to thefollowing criteria:A17/g252 The concentrations of both benzo[ a]pyrene and several other PAH are quantified; i.e. they are not reported as 'not detected' or 'less than'. /g252 The concentration of benzo[ a]pyrene is not equal to (nor a little above) its limit of detection: at this concentr ation level the accuracy is poor and hence any profile is poorly reliable. /g252 The concentrations in the individual sample(s) or the mean concentration(s) are reported, and not only the ranges. /g252 The study was performed in the European Union. /g252 The study was published as from 1980. /g252 The study does not provide clearly inconsistent results. /g252 The selected foods are of some relevance due to their higher consumption or their representativeness (e.g., high number of samples or consumption in different geographical areas). Table 1.2.1 shows PAH prof iles relative to benzo[ a]pyrene in different foods. For any food/ investigation, the profile is re ported as a set of ratios betwee n the available concentrations of any PAH and benzo[ a]pyrene ([PAH]/[BaP]). For data completeness, the PAH concentrations as measured in the individua l foods from which the profiles were calculated, are given in table 1.1.1 in chapter 1.11. 1 The [PAH]/[BaP] ratio calculated from these concentrations may not be exactly the same as the one reported in table 1.2.1. This is because, for some foods, the profile in table 1.2.1 is the mean of the profiles in the individual samples, and not the profile calculated from the mean concentrations.A18 Notes: see end of

The ratio for each PAH was also re-calculated excluding (at most and when applicable)10% of the pertinent studies giving the results most distant from the overall mean/medianvalue (i.e., as many studies were used in the re-calculation as corresponded to a minimum of 90% of all the studies concerning that P AH; hence this procedur e was applied to PAH determined in at least 10 studies). This exercise allows evaluating the overall profilevariability not affected by extreme values, which possibly derive from specific individual foods/investigations or from any poorly accurate determination (which is not infrequent in the analysis of PAH complex mixtures, especially due to co-eluting problems). For the sake of comparison with the use of benzo[ a]pyrene as an indicator of carcinogenicity by inhalation, the profiles are also reported for coke-oven fumes, urban air and coal tar (profiles are limited to carcinogenic PAH for the first two matrices). This is because: [a] WHO established a carcinogenic unit risk for benzo[ a]pyrene as indicator air constituent for PAH, based on epidemiological data from studies in coke-oven workers(WHO 2001); [b] according to the EC (2001b) on 'Ambient air pollution on PAH', benzo[ a]pyrene can be used as a marker of the carcinogenic risk of airborne PAH compounds; [c] some experimental studies con cerning PAH carcinogeni city by ingestion (and considered in this report, see chapter 2.4) included comparison with coal tar administration in the diet (Culp et al. , 1998; Koganti et al. , 2000). Finally, to examine whether it is possible to distinguish the PAH profiles on the basis of different sources, two subsets of foods were selected and compared: those which are expected to be contaminated only by atmospheric contamination and those where PAH areformed during processing (tables 1.2.3-1.2.5). The following conclusions may be drawn on the variability of [PAH]/[BaP] in different foods: /g252 higher-molecular mass PAH. /g252 The variability for almost all the higher-molecular mass PAH - from benzofluorenes upwards - results to be within a factor of ten. The variability markedly decreases after excluding (at most) 10% of data, resulting within one order of magnitude for all these PAH. This holds especially for carcinogenic benzo[ a]pyrene results to be constant in different foods within a factor of five. /g252 It appears that benzo[ a]pyrene may be used as an indicator of occurrence and concentrations of PAH from benzofluorenes upwards, at least in terms of orders of magnitude. Benzo[ a]pyrene may however not be used as an indicator of lower- molecular PAH. /g252 The median profile of carcinogenic PAH is very similar to those in coke-oven fumes and in urban air, within an approximate factor of two. /g252 The PAH median profile is also similar to that one of coal tar, well within one order of magnitude. In particular, for carcinogenic PAH, the ratios between the values of [PAH]/[BaP] in coal tar and in foods (median values) are in the range 0.5-1.1. In evaluating the variability of profiles re sulting from table 1.2.1, it should be taken into account that a significant part of variability is likely to be consequent to: [a] the different analytical procedures adopted in different investigations, [b] any poor accuracy possibly present in some investigations and/or some PAH (see above). So, when the comparison of profiles in different foods is based on analyses performed in the same laboratory with the same procedure, as is the case of the investigation of Dennis et al. (1991), the variability for the higher-molecular PAH (from benz[ a]anthracened upwards) results to be at most within a 5-fold factor, without excluding any food (t able 1.2.2); a higher [PAH]/[BaP] ratio of 8.7 is only observed for dibenz[ ah]anthracene. The accuracy of its determination however is affected by the measured concentrati on levels laying around the detection limit. In comparison with foods contaminated by de position and with all foods overall considered, processed foods show markedly different profiles only for anthracene and phenanthrene, these PAH being more abundant in processed foods. As to the other PAH, and especially for the carcinogenic ones, the profiles appear to be similar, any difference resulting to bewithin an approximate factor of two (both between them and in comparison with 'all foods').A27Table 1.2.2 PAH profiles relative to BaP ([PAH]/[BaP]) in different foods, as calculated from the investigation of Dennis et al.

It is not possible to generate other intake estimates for theEuropean population because: (i) food consumpti on surveys were carried out only in a very few countries and were not based on common crite ria, and (ii) the available information on PAH occurrence data in national diets is sc arce and generally limited to a few foodstuffs. Comparative intake data for individual PAH were collated from five total diet studies (TDS) conducted in the United Kingdom (two studies: Dennis et al. , 1983; COT, 2002), Italy (Turrio-Baldassarri et al. , 1996), The Netherlands (De Vos et al. , 1990) and Austria (Pfannhauser, 1991). Moreover, benzo[ a]pyrene intakes are also available for Sweden (Beckman Sundh et al. , 1998), Germany (State Committee for Air Pollution Control, 1992; cited in IPCS, 1998) and the USA (Butler et al. , 1993; Kazerouni et al. , 2001). The US intake, which is not of direct concern in this document, is c onsidered here for the sake of comparison. The protocols adopted in these surveys are re ported here below as they are known from the original literature; other deta ils are given with the intake results in table 1.3.1. The protocols are not homogeneous; in partic ular, there may be some gaps in the representativity of some food classes in some total-diet samples. The comparability is also affected by the 'not detected' concentration data (as to the variability of their occurrenceand of the limit of detection (LOD), and their treatment in the calculations). In particular, 'not detected' data were assumed equal to zero or to the LOD, resulting, respectively, in underestimated or over estimated concentrati ons/intakes. Conseque ntly, the intakes estimated from different studies s hould not be directly compared. UK/1. Total-diet samples were prepared at fi ve colleges in geographically diverse areas. They were based on a national average diet (Buss and Lindsay, 1978). The reported results are the means of the five samples; no bi as, however, was apparent for samples from different geographical locations. UK/2. Total-diet samples were collected throug hout one year (2000) at 2 weekly intervals from 24 randomly selected locations representa tive of the UK as a whole. A total of 115 retail food samples were purc hased, prepared/cooked for consumption and combined to form 20 food groups. Using the mean PAH concentrations in each food group, mean and high-level (97.5th percentile) dietary intakes were estimated for adults and children of different age ranges. Consumption data were from the National Diet and Nutrition Surveys.A32Italy. Food intakes were determined from a 10,000 household survey (Turrini et al. , 1991) for four geographical areas (north-easter n, west-eastern, southern, whole nation).The reference diet samples were built accordingly. A 5-day diet sample (about 8.5 kg) was set- up for each diet, including any local f ood item; food and beverages were prepared according to the prevalent regional habits. Th e market basket composition is reported in table 1.3.2. The Netherlands. A food consumption survey was carried out among about 200 18-yr-old men, with an emphasis on food consumption in the previous 14 days. Correspondingly, 10 samplings (market baskets) we re performed during a period of 2.5 years (one every three months) in a town in the centre of The Netherlands. The market basket composition isreported in table 1.3.2. Austria. A duplicate diet study was performed by analysing 10 samples constituted by the weekly composites of portions from each meal, as consumed by 10 persons. Sweden. The benzo[ a]pyrene intake was calculated on the basis of national food consumption data and the available analytical data in Swedish foods. USA/1. The survey was conducted during three phases, each one for a period of two weeks, in a town of New Jersey. A total of 9-10 homes were monitored in each phase. Portions of each meal consumed by one participant per household were collected and composited into weekly samples. USA/2. The consumption of different food ite ms was estimated by a Food Frequency Questionnaire based on the Second National Hea lth and Nutrition Examination Survey. The questionnaire was completed by 228 male/female subjects in Washington and included details on frequency of consump tion and portion sizes. Benzo[ a]pyrene concentrations were measured in the most common food items cons umed in the American diet. Food items were collected in a town of Maryland and incl uded both house and national brands. They were bought in stores. Cooked meats were purchased from fast food stores and restaurants. The dietary intakes, as estimated from these national surveys, are shown in table 1.3.1. The results allow to draw the following conclusions. /g252 Notwithstanding the different protocols a nd the different dietary habits, the PAH intakes result to be fairly uniform in the f our EU countries where a total diet study is available for a set of PAH. In fact, for each PAH, the estimated intakes are generally within one order of magnitude, di fferences being relatively small.A33/g252 In particular, the PAH intakes calculated in the Dutch and Italian studies, as well as in the older UK study (Dennis et al. , 1983), are quite similar. Lower mean intakes were calculated in the Austrian study and in the more recent UK study (COT, 2002). /g252 According to surveys conducted in six EU countries, the mean or national-averaged dietary intake of benzo[ a]pyrene for an adult person was estimated in the range 0.05 to 0.29 \u00b5g/day. Higher intakes were calculated at regional level (0.32 \u00b5g/day in southern Italy) or for individual diets (up to 0.36 \u00b5g/day in Austria) or in the worst-case scenario obtained after assuming ingestion of foods ea ch one at the highest found contamination (0.42 \u00b5g/day in The Netherlands). /g252 The mean or national-averaged intakes are consistent with the mean benzo[ intakes estimated in the two US surveys (0.05-0.14 \u00b5g/day). Quite higher individual intakes were however calculated in one survey (Butler et al. , 1993): up to 0.57 \u00b5g/day in the two winter phases and up to 1.15 \u00b5g/day in the third one (in late summer). According to the authors, th e food diaries did not support a contribution of seasonal differences in cooking style (e.g., increased barbecuing during summer) toseasonal trends. /g252 From the findings of the five TDSs, the pers onal intakes of other PAH may span three orders of magnitude, up to some \u00b5g/day. Th e highest intakes seem to be found among the lower-molecular (3- a nd 4-ring) PAH. The scarcity of data and their poor comparability (both for food consumption a nd PAH occurrence) do not allow, however, to draw more precise conclusi ons on a ranking of PAH intakes. /g252 Based on the mentioned limitations of this da ta collation, the inta kes so far estimated should be used in terms of orders of ma gnitude. In fact, there is indication of an important variability (spatial or temporal or inter-individual) possibly associated with the mean calculated values: /g183 The differences in PAH intake among nor thern and southern Italy resulted to be within a low factor of two. /g183 The range of the German benzo[ a]pyrene intake was reported within a factor of seven (but no information is available on how this range was calculated). /g183 The range of the Austrian intake for 10 individuals during the same week spans one to two orders of magnitude, pending on the PAH. /g183 An even higher inter-individual variability was reported for the benzo[ a]pyrene intake in a US survey (Butler et al. , 1993). A considerable variability was alsoA34evident in the daily estimated intakes for a given individual from one week to the next (no similar study is available for European countries). Finally, the Committee noted that: /g252 only one national intake estimate is available based on recent surveys (COT, 2002): all the other intakes are based on a food c onsumption survey or on food collection performed in the 80s (in the 70s in one case); /g252 no estimate is available on the in take by specific risk groups.

The same methodology adopted for the adult population (see 'UK/2' study in the pr evious section) was used for children. The intakes (per kg body weight) are presented in table 1.3.3 together with those of adults for comparison purposes (the years of consumpti on surveys are given in the table, note b). The daily intake of benzo[ a]pyrene , as well as of all PAH, progressively decreases with increasing age. This holds true for both the mean exposure and the high level (97.5th percentile) exposure. The youngest age group (1.5-2.5 years) is the highest exposed one, with an intake (of both benzo[ a]pyrene and all PAH) about 2.4-fold higher than for adults. The available information on levels of PAH in human milk was inadequate to assess the intake by infants during periods of breastfeeding. 1.3.3 Temporal trends in intake An evaluation of temporal trends in diet ary intakes is possible only for the United Kingdom: two TDS are available (Dennis et al. , 1983; COT, 2002) with foods collected at an interval of 21 years (1979 and 2000). A di rect comparison, however, is limited by some factors: the food groupings and the sets of P AH determined are different, and the 1979 data were calculated only as 'lower-bound' values (i.e. 'not detected' data were treated as 'zero', see also table 1.3.1). On the basis of the available data and after re-elaborating the 1979 figures, the COT made a comparison of 1979 and 2000 data and focused on the three PAH classified by IARC as intake of benzo[ a]pyrene and benz[ a]anthracene is 4- to 5- fold lower for 2000 than for 1979, both as m ean exposure and as high level exposure (97.5th percentile); /g183 also the upper-bound intakes for 2000 the lower-bound is also likely to have decreased but the extent of the decrease cannot be estimated as dibenz[ a,h]anthracene was not detected in any food group in 2000.A40A decrease in benzo[ a]pyrene intake was also observed by COT (2002) for children. A comparison between the 1979 and 2000 survey s is shown in table 1.3.4. The upper-bound intakes in 2000 are about 65% of the lowe r-bound intakes in 1979, both as mean and as high level estimates.

Two sets of results (Dennis et al. , 1983, and De Vos et al., 1990) are sufficiently comparable as to the food groupings and are reported in table 1.3.5. In the former UK study (Dennis et al. , 1983), the major contributors were the 'oils and fats'group and the 'cereals' groups. They contributed, respectively, 50% and 30% to benzo[ a]pyrene intake; their median contribution to the intake of 11 PAH was, respectively, 34% and 31%, respectively. The 'oils and fats' group had the highest individual PAH levels, but the 'cereals' group, although neve r showing high individual PAH levels, was a major contributor due to its relative weight to the total diet. The third major contributor was 'vegetables' (8% and 12%, respectively), likely due to the atmospheric fall-out of particle- bound PAH. Smoked meat and smoked fish made a very small contribution to the pertinent food groups ('meat' and 'fish') and these in tu rn were not major components of the diet. Consequently, barbecued food provided a very small part of the dietary intake of PAH. These results were substantially confirmed in the subsequent study of the Dutch diet (De Vos et al. , 1990). The major contributors to the daily benzo[ a]pyrene 'cereal products' was found to contribute most (about 27%) to the intake of the sum of 17 PAH (listed in table 1.3.1) - again attributed to the high consumption share - , followed by 'sugar and sweets' (about 18%) and 'oils a nd fats' (about 14%). It should be noted, however, this Dutch ranking may be affected by the high occurrence of 'not detected'A43values for most PAH and most foodstuffs , as well as by the surprisingly high concentrations of some compounds (namely, dibenzo[ a,e]pyrene, dibenz[ a,j]anthracene, 6- methylchrysene and 3-methylc holanthrene). The authors coul d not explain the surprisingly large share of the 'sugar and sweets' group (sug ar, chocolate products, jellies, licorice). The relatively high contribution of the 'oils and fats ' group was, at least partly, attributed to the well known elevated PAH concentrations possibly present in vegetable oils. The UK estimated contributions were also confirmed in a Swedish study (Larsson, 1986; cited in IPCS, 1998 and in Beckman Sundh et al. , 1998). When considering the sum of 11 PAH (list not available), cereals were found to be the highest contributors (about 34%), followed by vegetables (about 18%) and by oils and fats (about 16%). Significant intakes were also found for 'fruit and sugar' gr oup and for smoked meat products. Smoked fish and grilled foods showed the high est PAH levels in the Swedish study. They made a modest contribution to the intake, howev er, since they are minor components of the usual diet. This confirms the above-men tioned conclusion of the UK study (Dennis et al. , 1983) that barbecued food provides a very small pa rt of the PAH intake. It holds at least in areas where barbecuing is an infrequent activity. This cooking method, however, may significantly contribute if it is part of the us ual diet, especially with long cooking times and high levels of doneness (very well-done rather than medium-done). Consistent with the Swedish study, in the USA (Kazerouni et al. , 2001) the highest benzo[ a]pyrene levels (up to about 4 ng/g of cooked meat) were found in grilled/barbecued very well-done steaks and hamburgers, and in grilled/ba rbecued well-done chicken with skin. Differently from the available European surveys, however, grilled/barbecued meat contributed a high 21% to themean daily intake of benzo[ a]pyrene (resulting in the second contributing food group, after 'bread, cereal and grain' with 29%). Overall, the results of these studies were consistent in the finding that the food groups contributing most to the total intake appeared to be cereals, oils and fats, and vegetables. This inter-country homogeneity is also consiste nt with the substantial similarity in the composition of market baskets constituting th e Italian and Dutch total diets (table 1.3.2; these two surveys are the only available): for the food groups considered in both the studies, the variation in the daily intake is within an approx imate factor of two. This consistency was partially confirmed in the most recent total diet study, performed in the UK (COT, 2002). In that survey, cereals a nd vegetables are still major contributors but the contribution from 'oils and fats' has fa llen since the previous survey (Dennis et al. , 1983); 'beverages', 'milk and diary products' and 'fruit and sugar' now make significant contributions. The temporal trend in intake of benzo[ a]pyrene , as well as of benz[ a]anthracene and dibenz[ a,h]anthracene, since 1979 in the UK (already mentioned inA44the section 1.3.3 'Temporal trends in intake') appears particularly noticeable for oils and fats and for cereals. On the contrary, in takes from beverages, milk and dairy products appear to have risen: this finding, however, may be affected by the high number of 'not detected' concentrations in 1979 resultin g in lower-bound intakes supposed to be considerably underestimated. A comparison of the most contributing food groups in different surveys is shown in table 1.3.6. A more detailed evaluation of contributions from different food groups is not feasible due to a number of factors possibly involved: the sampling strategy applied (e.g., differences in the coverage of products collected to repres ent a whole food group), the criteria adopted in reporting results, the large varia tions in concentrations in so me of the foodstuffs and food groups, the low number of available complete studies (three: the UK and Dutch studies).A45Table 1.3.5 Mean personal intake of PAH: percentage contribution from different food groups in the UKa and Dutchb diets.

Th e available PAH concentrations in drinking water and in urban atmosphere, as measured in the 1990s in European countries, are reported in table 1.3.7. As regards drinking water, the available data are few. This is likely due to the very lowexpected levels, commonly below the analyti cal limit of detection. The measurements are not easily comparable because of differences in the analytical procedure (particularly regarding the filtration of the sample before extraction) and the coating of the distribution pipes. So, the overall results were approx imated to the nearest order of magnitude. The atmospheric measurements reported in table 1.3.7 were limited to the investigations performed during the whole year due to the well-known seasonal variability of PAHconcentrations. As regards the measurement of 3- and 4-ring PAH, the table includes only the investigations where vapour phase was also collected, besides particulate phase. Air concentrations generally show a good consiste ncy among different investigations and the typical level of concentration is given as an order of magnitude. Based on these concentration data and on the estimated dietary intake (table 1.3.1), table 1.3.8 shows the estimated contribution to the total personal PAH intake from the three routes of exposure. Benzo[ a]pyrene is the compound showing the highest number of measurements, by any route of exposure, and the results are also quite consistent relatively to the other PAH. This makes it possible to compare the individual mean benzo[ a]pyrene intakes (table 1.3.8). Due to the overall uncertainties associated to the original concentration data and mainly to the mean intakes adopted, the results of this co mparison are to be considered as approximate estimates, acceptable as indicative of the actual exposure. As regards the mean benzo[ a]pyrene intake by food ingestion, the average value of the 'range of mean values' (table 1.3.1) is used in the calculation. The total mean daily intake of benzo[ a]pyrene results to be about 0.2 \u00b5g/pers on. The dietary intake accounts for about 90% of it. Drinking-water contributes by less than 1%, thus resulting to be a relatively insignificant route of exposure. The remaining is attributable to ai r inhalation. The latter contribution was calculated on th e basis of a 'typical' benzo[ a]pyrene concentration in urban air (1 ng/m3), commonly measured at road level close to vehicular emissions: the actual personal exposure, however, is expected to be lower, at least for most of theA50population. Hence, the mean intake by food inge stion is likely to contribute by more than 90%.

Occupational exposure is excluded. d CHR + TRI. These benzo[ a]pyrene intake figures are consistent with those calculated in an US study: 12 and 140 ng/day as the mean intakes by, resp ectively, inhalation (based on personal air samples) and ingestion of food (based on prepared food samples) (Butler et al. , 1993). An evaluation of the relative intakes of other PAH is made difficult by the wide ranges of the estimated ingestion by both food and water, as well as by the low number of available data. Taken overall, the data i ndicate that food contributes by fa r most of the intake also for the other PAH, including the lower-molecular ones.A511.3.6 Contribution from tobacco smoking to the benzo[ a]pyrene intake The contribution from the inhalation route may increase markedly for smokers and persons exposed to passive smoking. The mainstream smoke of commercially available filter cigarettes was analysed forbenzo[ a]pyrene in Spain (Kayali and Rubio-Barroso, 1995), UK (Evans et al. , 1993) and USA (Tomkins et al. , 1985): the benzo[ a]pyrene content was found in the range 2-20 ng/cigarette. In the UK investigation, the sales-weight ed mean was found to be 13 ng benzo[ a]pyrene per cigarette for 20 brands representing 58% of UK sales. Assuming this concentration as a mean delivery and that 80% of inhaled particle-bound benzo[ a]pyrene from mainstream smoke is deposited in the respirat ory tract (IARC,1986, p.311), the additional benzo[ a]pyrene intake for a person smoking 20 cigarettes/day is 210 ng, which is in the same order of magnitude of the m ean intake by ingestion of food. Personal exposure to passive smoking is also of high concern for PAH intake. Sidestream smoke was found to contain 10 times more PAH than ma instream smoke (Grimmer et al. , 1987; cited in IPCS, in particular, benzo[ a]pyrene content per cigarette in sidestream smoke was 100 ng vs. 11 ng in mainstream smoke. Persons living in rooms with many smokers may be exposed to benzo[ a]pyrene concentrations in an appr oximate range Valerio et al. , 1996). By assuming an exposure to 10 ng/m3 for 5 hours/day, the additional benzo[ a]pyrene intake by passive smoking is about 40 ng/day.A522H AZARD IDENTIFICATION / CHARACTERISATION Unless otherwise stated, the information used in this assessment is taken from the recent IPCS Environmental Health Crite ria document on PAH (IPCS, 1998). 2.1 Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion 2.1.1 Absorption The two major determinants of gastrointestinal absorption are aqueous solubility and lipophilicity, since absorption requires compounds to go into solution in the lumen of the intestine, pass through the cell walls of intestinal cells and be removed to the circulation. PAH are lipophilic compounds with low aqueous solubility. Those considered in this opinion have log K ow values ranging from 3.4 to 7.3 and aqueous solubilities from 0.17 to 31740 \u00b5g/L at 25 C. Although aqueous solubility generally decreases as the log K ow value increases, there is considerable variability amongst compounds with similar log K ow values reflecting the influence of molecular structure on aqueous solubility. There are three main routes of absorption in humans, lung and respiratory tract followinginhalation of aerosols or particulates contai ning PAH, dermal following skin contact and gastrointestinal tract following ingestion in water or food. For the purposes of this evaluation only the last route will be considered in detail. Rees and colleagues in 1972 showed rapid absorption of benzo[ a]pyrene following intragastric administration in ra ts with highest levels seen in the thoracic lymph nodes after 3-4 hours. Based on results in whole animals a nd intestinal sacs, these workers suggested that absorption of benzo[ a]pyrene involved two phases, uptake by the mucosa followed by diffusion through the intestinal wall (Rees et al., 1972 as cited in IPCS, 1998). Laurent and colleagues (2001) described studies on the absorption of two PAH (benzo[ a]pyrene (log K ow 6.5, aqueous solubility 1290 \u00b5g/L)) following oral administration to pigs in a lipophilic milieu. Two castrated Large White pigs were cathete rised in the portal vein and brachiocephalic artery. Fourteen days post-surgery they were fed 1 litre of milk containing 50 \u00b5Ci of [7,10- 14C]-benzo[ a]pyrene or 15 \u00b5Ci of [9-14C]-phenanthrene and 10 ml arterial and portal blood samples were collected before administrati on and then hourly for 6 hours at 9 and 24 hours.A53Radioactivity was detectable within 1 hour and peaked at 5-6 hours and reached background by 24 hours. The peak radioactivity was higher for phenanthrene despite the 3- fold lower dose. Values in the portal vein were slightly higher than those in thebrachiocephalic artery. The peak time corres ponds with that observed for milk fat and is much longer than glucose (45 minutes) or pr otein (30 minutes). No areas under the curves (AUCs) or other pharmacokine tic parameters are reported. Rahman and colleagues (1986) showed the pr esence of bile increased the intestinal absorption of PAH in Sprague-Dawley rats, absorption of benzo[ a]pyrene (log K ow 6.50, solubility 3.8 \u00b5g/L) (and 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene) being affected more than that of anthracene (log K ow 4.5, solubility 78 K ow 5.18, solubility 135 \u00b5g/L) (Rahman et al., 1986 as cited in IPCS, 1998). Ka wamura and co-workers (1988) demonstrated that the composition of the diet influenced the absorption of co-administered 14C-benzo[ a]pyrene in Wistar rats. The radio-labelled benzo[ administered in a solution, emulsion or susp ension of 200 mg of food or food component and blood samples collected over the first 6 hours and at 24 hours post-administration. The foods and components studied were triolein, soya bean oil, cellulose, bread, rice flake, katsuobushi (dried bonito ), ovalbumin, spinach. The for administration in lipophilic foods (triol ein and soya bean oil) were 50% and 42% of that following intravenous administration in saline. The AUCs for the other foods tested were 20-25% of that following intravenous administration in saline except for cellulose (around 30%), all were significantly lower than the lipophilic foods. These data suggest that the bioavailability of PAH from food will be in the range of 20-50% and that it increases with increasing content of li pophilic components in the food. 2.1.2 Distribution Distribution of PAH has been studied in rode nts and levels in tissues are influenced by several factors; the PAH, route of administr ation, vehicle, time of tissue sampling after treatment and presence or absence of induc ers or inhibitors of hydrocarbon metabolism. However three common traits are observed; ther e are detectable levels of PAH (probably more accurately PAH-derived material) in almo st all organs, those organs rich in adipose tissue act as depots from which material is slow ly released and high levels are found in the gastrointestinal tract irrespective of the route of administration. Following intravenous administration benzo[ a]pyrene was rapidly removed from the bloodstream with a distribution half-life of le ss than 1 minute. The rate of clearance of radioactivity after administra tion of radio-labelled benzo[ a]pyrene was increased after pre- with inducers of metabolism either benzo[ a]pyrene or phenobarbital.A54Whole body autoradiography was used to st udy distribution in mice and their fetuses following intravenous administration of 14C-labelled 3-methylchol anthrene to pregnant dams. Radioactivity was widely distributed in maternal tissues and was detected in fetuses showing that it crossed the placenta (T akahashi and Yasuhira 1973, Takahashi 1978 as cited in IPCS, 1998). Similar resu lts have been obtained follo al., 1992, as cited in IPCS, 1998). In a small study in humans, samples of milk, placenta, mate rnal and umbilical cord blood were taken from 24 women and analysed for selected PAH. The highest levels of benzo[ a]pyrene, dibenz[ a,c]anthracene and chrysene were observed in milk and umbilical cord blood but levels were only above the det ection limit in half of the samp les. Nevertheless the authors concluded that both fetuses a nd infants were exposed to PAH which were presumed to be from the maternal diet (Madhavan a nd Naidu, 1995 as cited in IPCS, 1998). Table 2.1.1 Mean levels of PAH in cancer free liver (N=6) and fat (N=10) biopsy samples obtained at autopsy from humans PAH Liver concentration \u00b5g/kg wet weightFat From: Obana et al. (1981) Limited data are available describing measurement of tissue levels of PAH in autopsy orbiopsy samples from humans. Graf a nd colleagues reported average benzo[ a]pyrene levels of 0.32 \u00b5g/100 g dry tissue in liver, spleen, kidney, heart and skeletal muscle and 0.2 \u00b5g/100 g dry tissue in lung based on autopsy samples from normal humans with a wide age range (Graf et al., 1975 as cited in IPCS, 1998). Obana a nd colleagues (1981) measured the levels of nine PAH in cancer free liver and fa t biopsies and the results are shown in tableA552.1.1. Pyrene was the most abundant PAH but the range for all the PAH levels varied markedly (up to 40-fold). The variation in individual PAH prof iles was consistent. 2.1.3 Elimination and excretion The majority of PAH metabolites are excreted in urine, bile and faeces. Urinary excretion has been studied more extensively than fa ecal excretion, although research on faecal metabolism has increased following recognition of the importance of enterohepatic cyclingof PAH metabolites. The effect of interactions between different PAH on their elimination is complex andcompound specific. Bartosek and colleagues (1984) administered three PAH to rats at two dose levels of total PAH, 11.4 mg or 22.8 mg in olive oil. Chrysene, benz[ a]anthracene and triphenylene were adminis a]anthracene was also administered as equimolar mixtures (11.4 mg of each) with chrysene or triphenylene. Increasing the benz[ a]anthracene dose from 11.4 mg to 22.8 mg had a greater effect (roughly three-fold in blood and liver) on the relative ava ilability of non-tr ansformed benz[ a]anthracene as determined by the AUC in blood and tissues. The authors postulated that this was due to saturation of elimination processes. In contrast the availability of chrysene was lower and appeared to decrease as the dose increased, attributed to its limited intestinal absorption.The availability of triphenylene altered in a dose related manner. All these data were supported by the results of perfusion exper iments in isolated livers. Following co- administration of rysene and benz[ a]anthracene the faecal elimination of chrysene was unaffected (remaining at 25% of dose) whereas that of benz[ a]anthracene doubled from 6 to 13%. Similarly doubl ed 3 to 6%. Benz[ a]anthracene also resulted in increased relative availability of chrysene in other tissues (blood, liver, brain, adipose tissue and mammary tissue) measured by the AUC in these tissues. In perfused livers chrysene clearance fell in the presence of benz[ a]anthracene from 6.85 ml/min to 4.85 ml/min. The effect was more pronounced in the lipid rich adipose and ma mmary tissue. In contrast the relative availability of triphenylene decreased in the presence of benz[ a]anthracene but no changes were observed in its disappearance rate. The authors noted that the AUC decreased in theorder triphenylene > benz[ a]anthracene > chrysene, and that their aqueous solubility decreased in a similar order. The group noted that these interactions were occurring at relatively high doses, the significance of these interactions at lower dose levels and forhuman risk assessment were unclear.A562.1.4 Enterohepatic cycling of PAH Evidence for enterohepatic cycling was found af ter intratracheal cannulated Sprague-Dawley in rats and rabbits showed the in vivo persistence of benzo[ a]pyrene metabolites as a result of enterohepatic cycling. Chipman and colleagues demonstrated that bile was the major routeof excretion in bile-duct cannulated ra ts in the initial urinary excretion was 3%. These workers showed thatmutagenic or potentially mutagenic derivatives may be excreted via bile into the intestine (Chipman et al., 1981, Chipman 1982, Boroujerdi et al., 1981 as cited in IPCS, 1998). The gastrointestinal microflora have been show n to hydrolyse glucuronic acid conjugates of biliary PAH metabolites resulting in the formation of potentially reactive compounds (Renwick and Drasar 1976, Chipman et al., 1981, Chipman 1982, Boroujerdi et al., 1981 as cited in IPCS, 1998). Other metabolites such as thio-ether conjugates have also been reported to undergo enter ohepatic cycling (Hirom et al., 1983, Bakke et al., 1983 as cited in IPCS, 1998). A study of the pharmacokinetic s and bioavailability in rats following oral or intravenous administration of 2-15 mg/kg bw 14C-labelled pyrene provided strong evidence of enterohepatic cycling (Withey et al., 1991 as cited in IPCS, 1998). 2.1.5 Metabolism Studies of metabolic pathways in whole animals have largely been restricted to the simpler compounds whereas hepatic homogenates, microso mes, cultured cells and explants are the principal method for studying the metabo lism of larger more complex compounds. Metabolism and excretion has been studied in whole animals for naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene, benz[ a]anthracene dibenz[ a,h]anthracene and 3-methylcholanthrene. The metabolism of benzo[ a]pyrene is described in detail below. The metabolism of PAH has been studied in a number of human cells and tissues including bronchus, colon, mammary cell aggregates, ke macrophages. Whilst similar meta bolites are formed in many of the in vitro tissue or cell preparations, both the relative levels and rate of formation are tissue or cell, species and strain of animal specific. The indivi dual variability is marked with around 75-fold variation in the extent of PAH activation as measured by DNA adduct formation reported in human bronchus, mammary cell ag gregates and macrophages.A57What can metabolism do Metabolism of xenobiotics is di vided into two phases; phase 1 generally involves alteration of the structure of the compound to increase polarity and phase 2 addition of polar groups. Although metabolism was originally considered to be the inactivation or detoxification of foreign compounds, it has become increasingly clear that the actual situation is more complex and can result in either increased or decreased reactivity of the compound. Further phase 1 metabolism can occur when the initia l introduction of a polar group does not alter physicochemical properties markedly and reactive metabolites can also occur fromrearrangement or metabolism following conjugation. The genera l scheme of PAH metabolism involves oxidation to a range of primary 2 metabolites with glutathione, glucuronic acid or sulphate. Studies using simple PAH such as naphthalene demonstrated that similar phase 1 metabolites were produced following incubation with hepatic microsomes or tissue homogenates as afteradministration to animals. The metabolism of PAH has been extensively studied in vitro often in microsomal fractions of rat liver but also in many other tissue preparations. These in vitro methods are considered to adequately represent the in vivo metabolism of PAH. Activation - Phase 1 Phase 1 metabolism modifies the structure of xe nobiotics by introducing into their structure more polar chemical groups such as hydr oxy groups. An example would be the phenol metabolites of benzo[ a]pyrene in the diagram below. These alterations can make compounds more electrophilic resulting in increas ed reactivity e.g. the epoxide metabolites of benzo[ a]pyrene, in this example the metabolite can react readily with water to form a diol. However the diol and phenol metabolites of benzo[ a]pyrene are still able to fit the active sites of the phase 1 enzymes and this results in the introduction of a second epoxide group into the metabolite. The reactivity of th e resulting diol or hydroxy epoxide depends on the relative positions of the substituents si nce this affects the electrophilicity of the compound. - Phase 2 The binding of conjugating groups especially su lphate or glutathione increases the bulk and aqueous solubility of compounds but can some times result in the formation of a reactive compound. This arises when alterations in the electrophilicity of the compound (e.g. 9-hydroxymethylanthracene; Flesher et al. , 1998) after conjugation result in formation of a leaving group, the loss of this group is th ermodynamically favoured. This requires sequential metabo lism involving methylation in electron dense meso-region, hydroxylation of the methyl derivative, conjugation with a good leaving group such asA58sulphate and subsequent leaving of the group resulting in formation of a highly reactive carbonium ion. Deactivation The modification of the struct ure can decrease the activity of compounds either directly (through modification of a reactive group e.g. formation of triols and tetraols from diolepoxides) or indirectly (through increasing the probability or rate of elimination e.g. introduction of epoxide or phenol groups allowing fo rmation of conjugates). The overall balance between the various reacti ons within an individual tissue will be a function of the specific enzymes found in that ti ssue, the availability of other substrates e.g. glutathione in the tissue and the levels of PAH within that tissue. Adduct formation An adduct is a chemical grouping which is co valently bound to a large molecule such as DNA or protein and covalent binding of PAH to protei ns was first described in 1951. There is much more information on the covalent binding of electrophilic PAH metabolites to nucleic acids since characterisation of the products formed should be simpler, there is greater homogeneity of the nucleophilic nucleic acids than proteins and principally becausesuch modifications could result in permanen t alteration of cell phe notype. The covalent binding of dibenz[ a,h]anthracene to DNA in vivo was first reported in 1961. Subsequently the levels of DNA binding of (Brookes and Lawley 1964 as cited in IPCS, 1998). The majority of PAH metabolites shown to react with nucleic acids are vicinal diolepoxides, mainly diol epoxides of other possibilities includeactivation of benzo[ j]fluoranthene in mouse skin via a non-bay region diol epoxide and the production of hydroxymethyl derivatives of methyl substituted PAH which following conjugation can form electrophilic sulphate esters. The usual sites of attack on nucleic acid bases are the extranuclear amino groups of guanine and adenine. Although many of the PAH-de oxyribonucleoside adducts formed in human cells and tissues have not been fully characterised, the available evidence from bronchial epithelium, colon, skin and cultured mammary cells suggests adducts formed are very similar to those from corresponding rodent ti ssues. The major adduct is formed on the N2 position of guanine. Diol epoxides are also thought to react frequently with the N7 position of guanine but these adducts are labile and their detection is difficult. N7 adducts are normally spontaneously released.A59Interaction can result in DNA damage such as strand nicking, which may also be of significance in carcinogenesis. Studies on the biological effectiveness of PAH-nucleic acid adducts demonstrated that differences in the biological activities of 7-ethyl- and 7- methylbenz[ a]anthracene were not due to differences in the mutagenic potential of the adducts formed. A similar conclu sion was drawn from studies on a series of bay- and fjord- region epoxides. Therefore whilst data are not available on all PAH-nucleic acid adducts, currently they should all be considered as potentially damaging to the organism. Table 2.1.2 DNA adduct formation following adminis tration to WBC 108 4.3 +/- 0.5 Lung adducts at t max (2 days) per 108 nucleotides6.9 +/- 2.3 0.5 +/- 0.2 20.5 +/- 5.1 skin adducts at t max (2 days) per 108 nucleotidesNot measured 70.3 +/- 14.0 Not measured stomach adducts at t max (1 day) per 108 nucleotides1.6 +/- 0.5 Not measured Not measured Cmax \u00b5g/24 h 4.5 4.8 11.5 AUC \u00b5g 12 18 31 Godschalk and colleagues (2000) measured DN A adduct formation in stomach, lung, skin and WBC following administration to rats of 10 mg/kg bw benzo[ by oral gavage, dermal and intratracheal routes. The adducts were determined at the time of maximum generation in each tissue but skin and stomach adducts were only determined after dermal and oral gavage administration respectively. They also determined some pharmacokineticparameters allowing comparison of the total and peak systemic exposure. These results demonstrate that adduct formation occurs at both the site of contact and systemically but adduct levels cannot readily be correlated with peak or total systemic benzo[ a]pyrene exposure.A60Arif and (1999 ) intraperitoneal routes in DMSO or by the intrag astric route in corn oil. At 6 hours, 2, 5 and 14 days post treatment DNA adducts were isolat ed from target (mammary epithelium) and non-target tissues (lung, liver, heart, bladde r, in mammary epithelium were 2640 +/- 532 adducts/109 nucleotides were 10 to 65 fold higher than in lung, liver, heart, bladder and pancreas (ranked in decr easing order) and consisted of 1 major (30%) and at least 6 minor adducts except in liver where 4 additional adducts were formed. Benzo[a]pyrene as an example of metabolism Benzo[ a]pyrene, and PAH in general, can undergo a multitude of simultaneous and sequential metabolic transformations, which compounds the difficulty of ascertaining the biological effects of particular metabolites after benzo[ a]pyrene treatment. Benzo[ a]pyrene metabolism has been studied in a range of human tissue preparations. The metabolic profiles of human tissues are qualitatively similar to those in animal tissues and theidentified metabolites are identical. The differences in susceptibility of different animal or human tissues to the carcinogenic properties of benzo[ a]pyrene can be accounted for by quantitative differences in its metabolism or activation. However for some PAH such as benz[ a]anthracene studies have indicated species dependent bioactivation. The initial stage of benzo[ a]pyrene metabolism is the formation of several epoxides by microsomal CYP-depende nt mono-oxygenase. These epoxides can have to hydrolys is by dihydrodiols or transferase. undergo further oxida metabolism. 4,5- dihydrodiol forms a range of metabolites. The 9,10-dihydrodiol predominantly forms its 1- and 3-phenol (triol) derivatives with only small quantities of the 9,10-diol-7,8-epoxide. The 7,8-dihydrodiol principally forms 7, 8-diol-9,10-epoxide with little or no triol. The diol epoxides which hydrates to the 9-hydroxy-4,5- dihydrodiol. Other enzymes such as prostaglandin H synthase, a myeloperoxidase system and lipoxygenases can or 6-hydroxybenzo[ a]pyrene may occur either spontaneously or metabolically by prostaglandin H synthase yielding 1,6-, 3,6- and 6,12-quinone. These enzymes may be of significance when levels of CYP are low such as in uninduced cells or inchronic irritation or inflammation. A61Figure 2.1.1 Taking benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide as an exampl e, four isomers can be generated as there are two enantiomers of each diastereoi somer. In rat liver microsomes (+) 7,8-epoxide is formed in excess relative to the (-) isom er, the (+) isomer accounting for around 90% of the metabolites generated. The (+) 7,8-epoxide is stereospecifically th e isomer with the highest tumour inducing activity and that predominantly cova lently bound to DNA following benzo[ a]pyrene exposure in various mamma lian cells and organs. Metabolism of other PAH The table below gives an overview on the di hydrodiols, diol-epoxides and other reactive metabolites, so far identified from the PAH covered in this opinion. The table includes identified dihydrodiols and their presumed reactive carcinogenic/mutagenic metabolites. Thetable is intended to identify which PAH can form adducts and should be considered in conjunction with table in the genotoxicity se ction. However much of the evidence with the more complex compounds comes from studies in vitro using hepatic homogenates, microsomes and cultured cells, this may not be representative of the preferred routes of in vivo metabolism. Thus the identification of a particular metabolite indicates the potential for its formation but not evidence that it is generated in vivo . 9-hydroxymethylanthracene is an example of a model compound which cannot be metabolised by phase 1 reactions to vicinal bay-region dihydrodiol-epoxides but is a potentelectrophilic PAH (IPCS, 1998) or more of each CYP family (1, 2 or 3) is capable of metabolising one or more PAH. Studies using a model compound, such as benzo[ a]pyrene, demonstrated that the catalytic properties of different CYPs differ in PAH metabolism. The importance of a particular CYP in PAH metabolism is affected by two other factors; its mode of regulation and the tissue specificity in its expression. CYP1A1 can metabolise a wide range of PAH molecules. It is present in many tissues butconstitutive levels are generally low. Induction of CYP1A1 is controlled by the Ah receptorand since PAH can activate this receptor PAH are capable of inducing their own metabolism. Following induction CYP1A1 can reach high levels in some tissues (placenta, lung, peripheral blood cells) but hepatic expr ession levels remain low. Other CYPs are considered more important in the metabolism of benzo[ a]pyrene. For a more detailed discussion of Ah receptor m odulated effects see section 2.2. CYP1A2 can also metabolise PAH, but its capacity to metabolise benzo[ a]pyrene (to its 3- hydroxy metabolite) is 20% the me tabolic capacity of CYP1A1. CYP1A2 is very active in forming benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-dihyrodiol and subsequently its diol epoxides. Evidence exists that CYP1A2 can activate 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene. CYP1A2 is also controlled by the Ah receptor but its hepatic levels are much higher than those of CYP1A1. Thus despite its low capacity its high expression could give it an important role in diol epoxide formation. The CYP1B subfamily is capable of metabolising PAH and its expression is also controlledby the Ah receptor. There is limited information on its expression and catalytic properties. The constitutive levels of CYP2B enzymes are extremely low in humans but they arestrongly induced by phenobarbital type inducers. CYP2B6 was shown capable metabolising benzo[ a]pyrene to and 9-phenols and trans-dihydrodiols by human CYP2B6 cDNA in human lymphoblastoid cell line. CYP2B enzymes arole in 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene metabolism. The CYP2C subfamily contains several members expressed at high level in liver and more than 1 member may be capable of metabolising PAH. Both CYP2C9 and CYP2C8, albeit to a lessed degree, can metabolise a]pyrene to 3- and 9-phenols and trans-dihydrodiols. The CYP2C enzymes may play a prominent role in the metabolism of benzo[ a]pyrene and 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene in phenobarbital induced is one of the most abundant CYP enzymes in human liver. CYP3A can metabolise benzo[ a]pyrene and some of its dihydrodiols to several products. Human CYP3A4 was the most important enzyme in the 3-hydroxylation of benzo[ a]pyrene. A number least two families of UDP glucuronyl transferases (UGTs) have been shown to undertake glucuronidation. UGT1A6 has been shown to glucuronidatephenol and quinol metabolites whilst UGT2B7 glucuronidates diols. The specific families involved in some glucuronidations are unknown. At least three glutathione transferases (GSTA1-1, GSTM1-1 and GSTP1-1) have been shown to play roles in the metabolism ofbenzo[ a]pyrene Toxicokinetic influences on the toxicity of PAH In assessing the effects observed after ad ministration of PAH a number of factors concerning the compound and the enzymes involved in its metabolism need to be considered. As noted in the introduction to th e metabolism section and the legend preceding the table of PAH metabolites, much of the data on metabolism has been generated using a range of in vitro experimental systems. These ranges in complexity from isolated enzymes to perfused tissues and identify the potential for generation of spec ific metabolites under defined conditions but are not capable of de monstrating the extent to which these are produced in vivo . Thus information on PAH metabolism is suitable for hazard identification. As previ ously noted there are in vivo data only for a very limited subset of PAH, these data mainly identify the final excreted products of metabolism. The intermediate steps in the generation of these final metabolites, particularly evidence for the occurrence of relatively short lived metabolites, have been determined though in vitro experiments. It is not currently possible to use data on the metabolism of PAH to assess or rank risk for most PAH. However these data can provide evidence that supports, supplements or clarifies observations from othe r hazard identification studies i.e. adds to the weight of evidence. In considering the weight given to meta bolism data as supporting evidence a number of factors need to be considered. The majority of studies on metabolism and toxicokinetics are on discrete compounds whereas exposure throug h food and the environment is to a mixture of different PAH. Since exposure is to a mixture of PAH there will be interaction betweenseveral of these factors. In addition exposur es from other sources such as environment or smoking will also play a role. A66These factors include; - route of administration in a pa rticular study and the relevance of this to PAH exposure, - tissue specificity and tissue levels of a particular enzyme or enzyme family, whether this can account for the observed toxicity and the extent to which dietary PAH is distributed to these tissues, - differences in the specificity and kinetics of the human forms of these enzymes compared to animal or recombinant forms, - substrate specificity of the enzymes, - induction or constitutive le vels of the enzymes, - effect of components of the diet or the PAH mixture affecting the rate or route of metabolism, and - concentration and effect of co-factors or other reactants. There is evidence that at high dose levels some PAH can affect the excretion of other PAH however the significance for humans at lower exposure levels is not known 2.1.6 Summary of absorption, distributi on, metabolism and e limination of PAH The toxicokinetic data indicates that the absorption of PAH following oral administration is affected by the other components of the diet. The evidence suggests that the oral bioavailabilty of PAH ranges from around 40 -50% in highly lipophilic milieus to 20-25% in less lipophilic milieus a nd mixed food. The absorbed PAH are widely distributed particularly to fatty tissues. PAH are associated with toxic effects at the site of first contact and systemically. All PAH can be metabolised by phase 1 enzymes to electrophilicmetabolites under experimental conditions. These metabolites are able to react with proteins and DNA, but these metabolites can al so be deactivated by further metabolism. Effects are related to the extent of electrophile producti on and detoxification in vivo . Thus reactive metabolites are not formed to a significant extent from anthracene in vivo whereas for benzo[ a]pyrene they represent a significant or major route of metabolism and this is reflected in the data on the genotoxicit y and carcinogenicity of these compounds. In using the metabolism data for the risk a ssessment of an individua l PAH certain questions require an answer. Firstly the ability of th e compound to produce an electrophile has to be established. The degree to which this represents a major route of metabolism and the characteristics (reactivity, stability, inactiv ation) of the electroph ile require elicitation. Finally the possible effects of route of administration, species specificity or dose dependency on the metabolism n eeds addressing. In general all PAH have the potential to generate electrophiles, and all probably do produce electrophiles at some concentration or in some circumstances. However several PAH do not produce these to an appreciableA67extent in vivo e.g. anthracene whereas for other compounds they represent a significant or major route of metabolism e.g. benzo[ a]pyrene. 2.2 Significance of receptor mediated effects 2.2.1 Introduction Polycyclic aromatic hydrocar bons (PAH) elicit many adverse biological effects, including immunosuppression, teratogenicity, tumour promotion and hormona l effects. All of these seemingly unrelated biological effects are believed to be mediated by the sustained activation of the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the subsequent di sturbance of cellular homeostase. The AhR is a ligand-dependent tr anscriptional regulato r of several genes including enzymes involved in the metabolis m of xenobiotics, e.g. cytochrome P4501A family as well as genes encoding factors involved in cell growth and differentiation. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (TCDD) is the most efficient ligand known for the AhR, that has subsequently been termed the dioxin receptor. 2.2.2 The Ah-receptor The aromatic hydrocarbon receptor is a helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is member ofthe Per-Arnt-Sim family of transcription factor s (Wilson and Safe, 1998). The AhR is located in the cytoplasma associated with two molecules of hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) andanother protein. The hsp90 is important for protein folding and ligand recognition, i.e. dissociation of hsp90 from the unliganded Ah R abolishes AhR ligand binding activity. The hsp90 is released following the formation of the AhR-ligand complex due to conformationalchanges in the AhR protein. Subsequently, the ligand-AhR complex enters the nucleus where it forms an active heterodimer with a nuclear protein AhR, nuclear translocator (ARNT). This AhR-ARNT-complex binds to specific DNA sequences located in the 5'-flanking regions ofthe genes regulated by the AhR. These consensus sequences, termed AhR response elements (AHRE) (also called dioxin responsive elemen ts (DRE) or xenobiotica responsive elements (XRE)), are located in the promoter and enhancer regions of target genes. The four corenucleotides, CGTG, appears to be critical for the formation of ligand:AhR:ARNT:AHRE complex. In rodents, at least seven AHRE core consensus sequences in the CYP1A1 have been identified, but they bind the ligand:AhR:ARNT complex with varying affinities.Subsequently to the binding, it is assumed that the complexes can migrate to the higher- affinity AHRE enhancer sequences. Binding of the ligand:AhR:ARNT complex to an AHRE is in the major groove of DNA, resulting in an distortion of the DNA and a localized loss ofnucleosomes at the promoter site resulting in increase in gene expression. The AhR alsoA68control basal gene expression, suggesting that trans-activation occurs in the endogenous ligand or that an endogenous ligand occupies the binding site on the AhR allowing its interaction with certain AHREs. Not only the core sequences but also the ne ighbouring bases are important for the binding. This requirement may explain differences in AhR-mediated toxicity by PAH and TCDD ligands. Exposure of mice to PAH induces the expression of Bax in oocytes. This effect is AhR dependent but is only i nduced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene and not by TCDD. This difference in the action between TCDD a nd PAH is conveyed by a single base pair flanking the AHRE in the Bax promoter region (Matikainen et al. , 2001). Formation of the ligand:AhR:ARNT:AHRE complex results in an up-regulation of tran- scription and subsequent increases in mRNA a nd protein levels of genes containing the AHRE concensus sequence in their regulatory regions, e.g. CYP1A1 (see figure 2.2.1). Figure 2.2.1 (Denison and Phelan, 1998).A69Other proteins in addition to AhR and ARNT are required to mediate the action of TCDD and related chemicals by binding to the trans-activating domain of the AhR (Elferink and Whitlock,1994). In addition to CYP1A1, a large number of ot her genes and gene products are known to be up-regulated, e.g., the Ah gene battery. Ma ny of these genes are involved in critical metabolic and physiological events e.g. phase I and II enzymes, proteins involved in signal transduction, and growth factors. Some of the genes involved in the carcinogenic process and containing AHRE are shown in table 2.2.1 (Lai et al. ,1996). The expression can thus be induced by PAH and consequently influence the carcinogenic process induced by PAH or other carcinogens present in the diet. Table 2.2.1 AhR-receptor mediated /g97 The mode of action of AhR-processes has b een focused on genes with the AHRE consensus sequence. However, there are indications that AhR is likely to interact with other signallingpathways to cause the observed toxic response. Protein-protein inter action is an important mode of action for transcription factors. The activated AhR interacts with NF- /g107B, a key nuclear transcription factor, and this interaction is associated with mutual functionalmodulation of gene expression controlle d by the transcription factors (Tian et al. , 1999). NF-/g107B controls genes that are involved in immunosuppression, carcinogenesis, cell growth and apoptosis. Therefore, some of the toxic outcomes of PAH exposure related to carcinogenesis may be mediated through this pathway. In addition to up-regulation, the AhR is also involved in the PAH-induced down-regulation of various genes that play key roles in cell growth and differentiation, and their down- regulation by PAH may contribute to the toxic effects elicited by these compounds. CYP2C11, the predominant CYP enzyme expre ssed in human liver, was down-regulated by PAH, and the down-regulation correlated with the binding affinity of the PAH to the AhR and its transformation. The mechanism of this down-regulation is not clear, but lower CYP activity may decrease the ability to meta bolize toxic compounds and hormones (Safa et al. , 1997). A down-regulation of liver methionine adenosyltransfer ase gene expression by PAH has also been reported. This enzyme is i nvolved in syntheses of the most important biological methyl donor, and decreased activ ity will as such influence many important processes involved in cellular defence agains t toxic compounds, e.g. synthesis of GSH. A70This effect may not be mediated solely by the AhR, as a similar effect was not observed with TCDD (Carretero et al. , 2001). 2.2.3 Variation in AhR levels The AhR has been detected in most-cells and tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract. Large interspecies and interstrain differen ces in the concentration of AhR have been reported, the level in responsive mice (C57BL/6) being highest in the liver and lung. A single aminoacid change (A375V) in the ligand binding region is principally responsible for the high- to low-affinity AhR phenotype. In humans, the receptor has been found in, e.g. liver, lung, colon and placenta with the highes t level in the lung. A 4-fold interindividual variation in expression ha s been reported (Hayashi et al. , 1994). Genetic polymorphisms have been observed in the human AhR gene, some of which results in aminoacid changes. However, none of these polymorphisms appears to be associated with either inducibility of the marker enzymes, CYP1A1, or binding affinity of the receptor-ligand complex to the AhRE (Wong et al. , 2001; Cauchi et al. , 2001). 2.2.4 PAH and AhR mediated effects Many of the toxic responses elicited by PAH are mediated through the AhR. These effects have been observed mostly in experimental animal studies, in vitro toxicological studies and few human studies. AhR and immunotoxicity The immunosuppressive effect of PAH is partly dependent on the planarity of the molecule and its capacity to bind to the Ah-receptor (see chapter 3.6). A functional Ah-receptor is required for proper function of the immune sy stem as has been demonstrated using transgenic mice lacking the AhR. The AhR-/- mice at 2 to 3 weeks of age contained 75%fewer lymphocytes in the spleen compared to mice expressing the receptor, but AhR deficiency does not affect the development of normal thymus subpopulations (Fernandez- Salguero et al. , 1995). Furthermore, it has been shown that the AhR can influence PAH-mediated immunosuppression (Near et al. , 1999). The spectrum of PAH immunotoxic outcomes suggests that PAH interfere withthe ly mphocyte programmed cell death/apoptosis machinery, e.g. induction of cell , 2000). The induction of pre-B-cell apoptosis is not a direct effect of the PAH on the pre-B-cells but is influenced by local interactions with AhR-expressing marrow stromal cells (Yamaguchi et al. , 1997). TheA71induction of pre B-cell apoptosis may be de pendent on PAH metabolism, as TCDD did not induce apoptosis and that metabolite s of PAH, e.g. 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene-3,4- dihydro-diol was more potent (Mann et al. , 1999). However, PAH can also induce non- AhR mediated apoptosis, e.g. fluoranthene i nduces apoptosis in murine T-cells, but the mechanism of this process is currently not known (Yamaguchi et al. , 1996). AhR and carcinogenicity The AhR play an important role in PAH- induced carcinogenesis. Early animal studies showed a correlation between inducibility of arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity and PAH-induced lung carcinogenesis. Using cultured human lymphocytes, it was shown that people expressing the high-inducibility phe notype had an increased risk of developing lung cancer (McLemore et al. , 1978). For a limited number of PAH, there was no link between their ability to induce AHH activity a nd lung cancer potency in the mouse lung adenoma carcinogenesis model (Ross et al. , 1995). Recent studies have demonstrated that mutant AhR cell lines and AhR null allele mice are relatively resistant to chromosomal damage induced by cigarette smoke. Furthermore, benzo[ a]pyrene induced tumours in wild type mice but not in the AhR null allele mouse (Shimizu et al. , 2000), suggesting an important role for AhR in PAH carcinogenesis. The role of AhR is not entirely clear, but usin g an AhR antagonist that did not influence CYP1A1 activity, the antagonist protects against benzo[ a]pyrene-induced bone marrow cytotoxicity and genotoxicity which suggest the AhR signalling has a net potentiation effect on PAH genetic toxicity (Dertinger et al. , 2001). Using biomarkers for exposure and early biol ogical effects, it was demonstrated that following intra-gastric administration benzo[ a]pyrene, higher levels of benzo[ a]pyrene- 7,8-diol-9.10-epoxide-DNA adduct and SCE in bone marrow cells were observed in Ah- non responsive mice (DBA/2) than in Ah-responsive mice (Brauze et al. , 1997). Difference in susceptibility to PAH-induced carcinogenesis has been demonstrated in several studies using Ah-inducible and non-inducible mouse strains (see chapter 2.3). In a multivariate analysis using data from assays that describe biological effects of PAH, i.e. bacterial mutagenicity, enhancement and inhibition of bacterial mutagenicity, AhR affinity,induction of CYP1A1, all the AhR affinity variab les were statistically relevant to describe carcinogenicity. were poor inducers. In the partial least square regression analysis a negative correlation between mutagenesis and enzyme induction was found (Sj\u00f6gren et al. , 1996). Using the induction data from the CALUX assay, no correlation between mutagenicity and inducibility for the 25 PAH from which mutagenic potency data were available, was observed(Machala et al. , 2001a). A72AhR and reproductive and developmental toxicity Studies in B6(Ah-inducible) and D2 (non-indu cible) mice have demonstrated that PAH- induced reproductive toxicity is mediated through the AhR. These effects are described in details in chapter 2.5. 2.2.5 Other receptor mediated effects In addition to AhR mediated induction, the ma rker enzyme CYP4501A1 is also induced by another cytosolic receptor, the 4S PAH binding protein. The 4S protein specifically binds certain PAH with high affinity and undergoes nuclear translocation. This protein has been identified as glycine-N-methyltransferase, and the homodimer form of the enzyme acts as the receptor (Bhat et al. , 1997). TCDD does not bind to th e 4S PAH binding protein. The human glycine N-methyltransferase gene is only expressed in the liver, pancreas andprostate (Chen et al. , 2000). The toxicological consequences of this altered expressing are not fully understood. The steric resemblance of PAH to steroid molecules led to the postulation that they wouldbe able to bind to the same receptor as steroid hormones, and both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that PAH has bot h oestrogenic and anti-oestrogenic activity. Using a model ER- /g97 transactivation system it has been shown that phenolic metabolites rather than the parent compound are re sponsible for the effect (Charles et al. , 2000). The potency of 3-hydroxy-benzo[ a]pyrene and 9-hydroxy-benzo[ equivalent to that of oestradiol. 2.2.6 Other PAH-mediated biological effects Chemically induced carcinogenesis involves three operational stages of which promotioninvolves some reversible, nongenotoxic events, i.e., removal of the initiated cells from the homeostatic control mechanism. The mechanism of this tumour promoting activity and the role of the AhR is not clear, but it could be a relevant role of PAH-induced carcinogenesis.Down-regulation of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) by tumour promoting compounds is considered to be a critical step in the carcinogenic process. Strong correlation has been found between tumour promoting activity in the two-stage skin carcinogenesismodel and the ability of the compound to inhibit GJIC. In an in vitro test system it was found that different PAH do inhibit GJIC (table 2). It is interesting to note that several PAH considered to be non-mutagenic or possessing low carcinogenic activity belong to the mostpotent PAH inhibitors of GJIC, e.g. fluoranthene, 5-methylchrysene and picene. However,A73the IC50 of PAH are 1000-fold higher than TPA, that is the reference promoting compound (Bl\u00e1ha et al. , 2002). Apoptosis plays in important role in carcinog enesis, e.g. stimulation of apoptosis increases the removal of damaged cells whereas inhibiti on of apoptosis increases the probability for malignant transformation. An interesting difference in AhR mediated toxicological response between PAH and dioxin s is that PAH induces the Bax gene and subsequent apoptosis in oocytes 2001). 2.2.7 Structure-activity correlations The biologic activities of the PAH are dependent on the structures of the individual compounds, as the chemical structure is impor tant for the binding of the compound to the AhR. The relationship between structure and effe ct has been studied in experimental studies and in modelling systems using the information obtained in the experimental studies. Short term bioassays Numerous short-term bioassays of AhR-mediated activity are available. They are based on the mechanism of AhR mediated responses: 1) induction of cytochrome P4501A-dependent 7-ethoxyresorufin O-dethylase (EROD) activity, 2) binding affinity of the ligand to the receptor, 3) binding of ligand:AhR to the consensus sequence measured by the gel retardation of AhR binding (GRAB) assay, an d 4) AhR-mediated reporter gene expression. The AhR activating potency of PAH can be tested in different test systems, animals and cell cultures. A dose-response relationship for rece ptor binding affinity and induction of AHH activity has been determined for 29 PAH in rat liver. It was apparent that the magnitude ofeffects was strongly dependent on the che mical structure, and compounds with the phenanthrene structure fused to at least one be nzo ring had the strongests effects. However, no correlation between the two markers could be established (Piskorska-Pliszczynska et al. , 1986). The various testsystems have different sensitivity and activity in relationship to thereference compound, TCDD. The difference in potency for CYP1A1 expression cannot be explained simply in terms of receptor a ffinity. The difference between TCDD and PAH may in part be due to a metabolic depl etion of the PAH ligand whereas TCDD is not metabolized. Using TCDD as the inducer, large differences in response could be observed in cells from different species and of differen t origin, ranging from 6-fold induction in cells from hamster to 66-fold in human cells (Garrison et al. , 1996). A positive association wasA74established for the amount of ligand:AhR and induction of CYP1A1 activity for the potent ligand, TCDD. New test systems to determine AhR mediat ed responses have been developed taking advantage of the knowledge on the molecular m echanism. Molecular constructs containing a reporter gene under the control of single or multiple AHRE have been developed. These contructs have been used to develop 1) cell lin es, that are transfected with the reporter gene, and 2) transgenic animals that express the reporter gene in all tissues. The cell lines can either be transiently transfected or the reporter gene can be incorporated in the genome.Exposure of the cells to AhR agonists activ ates the production of the reporter gene products, the activity of which can easily be measured. Several different reporter genes and cell types have been used. The most frequently used assay to detect AhR-agonists incomplex mixtures is the chemical-activated luciferase expression (CALUX) assay. An alternative reporter gene is the enhanced green fluorescent protein, providing a method with a higher capacity (Nagy et al. , 2002). The CALUX assay has been used to determine AhR activation by PAH. The AhR inducing potencies of PAH were expressed as induc tion equivalency factors (IEF) relative to benzo[ a]pyrene. The IEF was calculated as a ratio of EC50 and/or EC25 of the reference inducers and the concentration of the PAH induc ing the same level of luciferase activity. The activity was significantly lower for the PAH than TCDD. Short exposure to PAH (6hrs) leads to a significantly higher AhR-me diated activity than long exposure (24 hrs), suggesting that CYP1A1 mediated metabolism lowers the concentration of the active compound (Machala et al. , 2001a). The AhR-inducing potency of many PAH is demonstrated and both in in vivo and in vitro systems. Induction equivalency factors (IEF) relative to the potency of benzo[ a]pyrene have been established using the CALUX assay in rat hepatoma H4IIE cell line (Machala et and are listed in table 2.2.2.A75Table 2.2.2 Induction potency of PAH relative to benzo[ a]pyrene 1 Compound IEF BaP GJIC2 Flu ni 2.6 Ant ni ni Fla 1.05E-2 10.9 Py 7.57E-3 3.0 BaA ni DBahP 2.80 - 5-MeChry 3.07 8.2 Pic 0.12 7.5 Chry 3.25 - IP 44.20 ni NPyr 1.10 ni DBaiP 2.59 ni DBajA 2.16 ni BjF ni the PAH 2Arbitrary Gap-Junctional intercellulat communicationA76The metabolism of PAH could play an important role in the determination of AhR- mediated activity as the hydroxylated metabolites may have a different affinity for the receptor than the parent compound. The transi ent induction of AhR- mediated activities is assumed to be a result of the disappearance of the inducing PAH following metabolism by the induced CYP1A1 activity. Although the AhR demonstrates a strict spec ificity for planar PAH, non-planar compounds i.e. 7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydro-benzo[ a]pyrene also induce CYP1A1 activity but with a delayed time course. Planar PAH o-quinones were found to be potent inducers of AhR- mediated activities, e.g. CYP1A1 activity. The PAH quinones are formed by aldo-keto reductase activity that is induced by the AhR signalling pathway (Burczynski and Penning, 2000). Even in cells expressing high level of AhR, no activation and translocation of the activated PAH:AhR complex to the nucleus were obser ved at low concentrations of the PAH, suggesting that a threshold may exist for the AhR mediated toxic responses. In the absence of a functional CYP1A1 activity or by inhibition of CYP1A1 activity, several genes in the Ah-gene battery are up-regulated (Alexander et al. , 1999). Some PAH act as mixed agonists facilitating PAH:AhR translocation but donot support transc of these assays, especially the CALUX assay have been used to assess the level of inducers in complex mixtures e.g. river se diments, air pollution particles (Vondr\u00e1cek et al. , 2001; Hamers et al. , 2000). For complex mixtures th e results were expressed as benzo[ a]pyrene equivalents. In the analysis of complex mixtures there is significant discrepancy between the different assays, e.g., GRAB and CALUX, demonstrating that the in vitro bioassay alone is not a good predictor of the ability of a chemical to activate AhR. Modelling The computer-automated structure evaluation (CASE) program, that automatically selectsrelevant descriptors for struct ure-activity relationships has been used to analyse the binding of various PAH to the AhR. The binding activity was determined by an electrofocusing assay. The fragments from PAH that were mo st important for the AhR binding were found to contain the classical \"bay\" region and were as such identical to the same regions that were responsible for carcinogenicity (Rannug et al. , 1991). A772.2.8 Potentiation Potentiation between different PAH on the effect of AhR can be mediated at many different levels. One of these is competitive inhibition at the 4S-PAH binding protein leaving a higher concentration of the more potent Ah R-ligand to bind the receptor. In the case of benzo[ a]pyrene and benzo[ ghi]perylene, a potentiating effect in in vitro was only seen at high concentrations of benzo[ ghi]perylene. The effect was seen both on the protein and mRNA level of CYP1A1. Benzo[ ghi]perylene acted by activating theAhR, causing it to translocate to the nucleus and to form a ligand:AhR:ARNRT:AHRE complex. No effectwas seen on any of the parameters at the concentrations of benzo[ a]pyrene and benzo[ ghi]perylene used (Cherng et al. , 2001). 2.2.9 Summary In addition to their direct mutagenic activity, PAH can also influence many other processes involved in carcinogenesis. The main focus has been on the induction of enzymes involved in the metabolism of PAH and other carcinogens. This alteration will influence the level ofthe ultimate carcinogenic metabo lite and as such the carcinogenic activity of the parent PAH. In addition to its effect on the initiation stage, the PAH also have an effect on the promotional stages, e.g. inhibition of in tracellular communication, resulting in clonal expansion of initiated cells. The defence mechanism against tumour formation includes immunosurveillance and cell death of damaged cells, e.g. apoptosis, and PAH influence both these processes. All the latter processes are regulated through the AhR. Most ofinformation is based upon studies involving a non-PAH AhR ligand, TCDD. The affinity of PAH to the AhR is significantly lower than that of TCDD, and this difference is positively correlated with differences in the toxic and biological activity of these chemicals.Differences in biological re sponse between dioxins and PAH are not only a result of the affinity to the receptor but also the DNA- sequence at the binding site for the ligand- receptor complex. 2.3 Variation in the susceptibility of humans 2.3.1 General aspects More than a 70-fold inter-individual variation in formation of carcinogen-DNA adducts was observed when human tissues were exposed to the same dose of carcinogenic PAH (Autrup,1986). This difference could be due to variation in uptake and biotransformation of the PAH or in the repair of the formed PAH-DNA adducts. Some of the enzymesA78responsible for the e.g. cytochrome P-450, glutathione S-transferase, epox ide hydrolase (see chapter 3.1). Many of the enzymes involved in the metabo lism of PAH have a polymorphic distribution, and the genetic basis for some of these polymorphisms has been identified. The genetic polymorphisms can have different effect on th e rate of metabolism depending on the type and location of the genetic alteration. A si ngle nucleotide polymorphism in the coding sequences results in altered substrate specificity and enzyme kinetics, whereas a change in the regulatory region will results in an altered level of the normal enzyme. Lack of enzymeactivity has been observed in case of de letion of the gene or when the genetic polymorphism is in the splice site. A genetic polymorphism has been defined as a genetic change that can be seen in at least 1% of the population. However, activity of the enzymes will not only depend on the genotype but may change asa consequence of exposure to other chemicals that can either increase the expression of thegene, e.g. mediated by the Ah-receptor (see chapter 2.2) or inhibit the enzyme activity by binding to the active site of the enzyme. Many of the compounds present in fruit and vegetables that exhibit chemopreventive activ ity induce enzymes that are involved in the detoxification of PAH. Dietary habits charact erized by frequent consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables and high intake of antioxidants were strongly associated with reduced level of PAH-DNA adducts (Palli et al. , 2000). Aberrant metabolic capacity due to a genetic polymorphism may be more important at low levels of exposure than at high levels of ex posure and could as such alter the threshold for the toxic response. At high doses of the to xic compound, the relevant enzymes are saturated both in efficient and poor metabolizers resu lting in efficient metabolism, whereas this would not occur at low doses. It is ther efore likely, that under exceptional exposure conditions (very high levels) that the individual susceptibility is not that important. However, low-dose exposure to carcinogens is widespread and its effects are likely to be modulated by genetic susceptibility (Vineis et al. , 1994). Genetic polymorphism in xenobi otic metabolizing enzymes is not associated with an increased cancer risk by themselves as they are not involved in the carcinogenic process. However, they alter the risk of, e.g. PAH in the diet, by changing the ratio of activation/deactivation of the carcinogeni c compound, and thus these genes are called \"effect-modifying\". In the following, the role of genetic polym orphism in xenobiotic metabolising enzymes is described. For details on the me tabolism of PAH see chapter 2.1.A79A nomenclature system for gene polymorphisms in the CYP1A1and the GSTM1 enzymes (amongst others) has been proposed by Garte and Crosti (1999). The ge ne name is followed by an asterisk, followed by an Arabic number (1 for the wild type) designating the specificpolymorphism in chronological order of first publication. The final number may be followed by letters A, B, etc. when allelic subtypes exist. 2.3.2 Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Members of the CYP1A family of enzymes play a central role in the activation of carcinogenic PAH. Four-point mutations have been detected in the CYP1A1 gene resulting in four variant alleles CY P1A1*2 (previously CYP1A1*2A), CYP1A1*5. The CYP1A1*2 and *3 genotypes have been associated with an increased risk of lung and renal cancer in smokers, and are associated with high CYP1A1 inducibility (Longuemaux et al. , 1999). The effect of *2 and *3 is especially pronounced in heavy smokers , suggesting that the PAH in tobacco smoke interacts with the Ah-receptor resulting in the induction of CYP1A1 enzyme in these genotypes and more of the ultimate carcinogen is formed. A slight increased risk for breastcancer was also associated with the *2 and *3 genotypes in smokers. Using benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-DNA adduct as a marker of exposure, a significantly higher level of adducts was observed in lymphocytes, lung and placenta from individual homozygotes in *2/2 than the other genotypes (Rojas et al. , 2000). CYP1B1 is very active in the metabolism of PAH-diols to their ultimate carcinogenic forms. Transgenic animal experiments have shown that mice that do not express the CYP1B1 gene are almost completely protected against acute bone marrow toxicity and proleukemic effects when exposed to 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene. This suggests that in the absence of the biologically reactive metabolite of not et al. , 2000). Seven different genetic polymorphims of the CYP1B1 gene have been identified, and these variants results in amino acid changes of the enzyme that result in altered enzyme activity. In an in vitro test system, only slight differences among these variants in ability to transform the PAH-diol into mutagenic activity was observed, the Se r119/Leu432 having slightly higher activity (1.2-1.5-fold) than the other variants including Ser119/Val432 (Shimada et al. , 1999). However, in a preliminary small epidemiolo gical study the low activity Val 432 variant (CYP1B1*2) was associated with an increase d risk of colorectal cancer (Fritsche et al. , 1999). However, this finding cannot be repeated in a larger case-control study (G. Smith, personal communication).A80A number of allelic variants of CYP1A2 have been identified, and the activity of the enzyme is polymorphically distributed in hum ans. However, the genetic basis for this polymorphism has not yet univocally been iden tified. CYP1A2 activity is highly inducible, and differences in exposure to inducers, e.g. smoking, food compounds, may be more important than any genetic differences. Relativel y strong associations have been described suggesting that genetically determined high activity of CYP1A2 may be a risk factor forcolon cancer (Brockm\u00f6ller et al. , 2000). CYP3A enzymes are the major CYP450 in human liv er accounting for approximately 25% of the total CYP activity. This enzyme is invol ved in the metabolism of PAH to diols, but it has a lower Vmax and is less stereospecific than either CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 (Roberts- Thomson et al. , 1993). Large individual differences in the activity are reported, but the genetic basis for the variation is still under investigation. Two different isoenzymes of CYP3A, 3A4 and 3A5, have been found. Six di fferent genetic varian ts of CYP3A4 has been identified, 3 of which are resulting in an lower activity, but the frequency of thesepolymorphisms is low in caucasian popula tions. A genetic polymorphism has been identified in the isoenzyme 3A5, a single nu cleotide change at a splice site, the G6986A having normal splicing and thus normal activity. The frequency of this variant in Caucasian populations is 5% (Husterts et al. , 2001). No epidemiological studies to link this polymorphism and PAH exposure with cancer risk has been reported. 2.3.3 Glutathione S-Transferases (GST) The GST are key phase II enzymes which play a critical role in protection against electrophilic PAH metabolites formed by phase I metabolism. At least five related gene families, mu, alpha, pi, theta and sigma, have been identified. Only GSTM and GSTPappear to play a role in the detoxification of PAH metabolites, and functional genetic polymorphism has been identified in bot h of these genes. Functional genetic polymorphisms have also been detected in GSTA . However, this enzyme is involved in the detoxification of aromatic a mines, and the GSTA1*B genotype that show an intermediate level of expression, has an increased risk of colorect al cancer (Coles et al. , 2001). Deletion of the GSTM1 gene occurs in approximately 50% of the Caucasian population, and it is anticipated that the group lacking th e gene (GSTM1*2/2) has a decreased ability to detoxify the ultimate carcinogenic form of PAH and subsequently an increased risk ofcancer. A significantly increased risk of lung and bladder cancer was observed in individuals lacking the GSTM1 gene (GSTM 1*2/2), and an interaction between smoking and the genotype was observed, i.e. the risk ratio was higher in the smokers than in non-smokers. The effect of GSTM1*2/2 was even more pronounced at low doses, i.e. fewA81cigarettes. In contrast to the PAH-related cancers, no clear association of GSTM1*2/2 and gastric cancer (Setiawan et al., 2000) and colorectal cancer has been observed (Gertig et al. , 1998), and neither smoking nor sm oking length had any effect. It has been estimated that the lack of GSTM 1 activity is responsible for approx 17% of bladder cancer cases in smokers, and nearly 50% of lung cancer cases in women exposed to environmental toba cco smoke (Bennett et al. , 1999). Bulky carcinogen-DNA adducts are considered reliable biomarkers for exposure to PAH. These biomarkers have been used in many m onitoring studies to assess total PAH exposure. At low exposure levels of PAH, the leve l of the adducts in lymphocyte DNA was significantly higher in the GSTM1*2/2 subg roup than in people expressing the gene. However, a protective effect of GSTM1 on the adduct level was not seen in people occupationally exposed for high doses of PAH (Autrup, 2000). These observations suggest that the GSTM1 genotype is more important at low dose exposures as those experienced with PAH in the diet than at high doses. A higher level of PAH-DNA adducts was obser ved in breast tissue from patients lacking GSTM1 activity, whereas the GSTM1 genotype did not influence a dduct level in normal people. This suggest that alternative pathwa ys to detoxify the ultimate carcinogenic form exist in normal breast tissues, e.g. expressi on of GSTP in normal but not in cancerous tissues. GSTM1 activity indirectly influences th e induction of CYP1A enzymes. Frequent consumers of cruciferous vegetables w ith the GSTM1*2/2 genotype express a higher CYP1A2 activity than people expressing GS TM1. The compound present in the vegetables and responsible for the inducti on is metabolised by GSTM1, a nd enhanced the excretion of isothiocyanates. Thus GSTM1*2/2 individuals have a higher pharmacologically active dose of the inducer, and thus frequent consumers of cruciferous vegetables had higher CYP1A* activity (Probst-Hensch et al. , 1998). A protective effect of isothiocyanate in lung carcinogenesis was primarily seen in GSTM1*2/2 (London et al. , 2000). An increased risk of lung cancer has been observed in current smokers with a low intake of cruciferous vegetables but not in the high intake group (Spitz et al. , 2000). In the case of colorectal cancer a decreased risk was observed in the group with high broccoli intake and GSTM1*2/2 genotype. The hypothesis in this case is that the isothiocyanate present inhibits CYP450 activity and induces phase II enzymes, e.g. GST (Lin et al. , 1998). These data indicate a complex interaction between dietary factors and genotype of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes, and thus the risk of PAH-induced carcinogenesis.A82GSTP1 plays an important role in PAH-induced carcinogenesis, e.g. GSTP1 null mice has an increased risk for PAH-induced skin carcinogenesis (Henderson et al. , 1998). GSTP1 shows large variations in the ability to detoxify the various active metabolites of PAH andto reduce mutagenicity in an experimental model system, e.g. the mutagenicity of the + enantiomers of BPDE was reduced 65% whereas the activity of the - enantiomers was only reduced 15% (Seidel et al. , 1998). Large inter-individual vari ation in GSTP1 activity has been observed. Two genetic polymorphisms have been detected both of which resulted in amino acid change, Ile104Val and Ala113Val. The genetic changes are located within the region coding for the active site of the enzyme and the consequence of the amino acidchange is altered enzyme kinetics and substrate specificity. The ValVal variant is the most active variant in the detoxification of the ultimate carcinogenic form of BPDE than the other variants (Hu et al. , 1999), whereas the IleAla form is the most efficient in detoxifying the diolepoxides of benzo[ g]chrysene and benzo[ c]phenanthrene (Hu al. , 1998) which indicate that GSTP1 genetic polymorphism may be an important factor in differential susceptibility of humans for PAH-induced carcinoge nesis. An increased risk of lung cancer was seen in the GSTP1*1/1 group when exposed for PAH (Ryberg et al. , 1994) and an increased bulky carcinogen-DNA adduct level was seen in people with the same high risk genotype (Autrup, 2000). 2.3.4 Others Microsomal epoxide hydrolase diols, e.g. benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-oxide into benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol. This reaction is in competition with GST mediated detoxifica tion, and high mEH activity will increase the formation of the ultimate carcinogenic form of the PAH at the expense of detoxification. Two genetic polymorphisms that encode amino acid substitutions have been identified, i.e.exon 3 Tyr113 His and exon 4 His139Arg. The activity of the variants are not significantly different, but the expression of the correspondi ng proteins is changed, 40% decrease and 25% increase, respectively. It has been suggested that the amino-acid change may result inaltered enzyme stability and consequently an altered enzyme activity. The his113his and his139his genotype are risk factors for colorect al adenomas in heavy smokers and in people with a frequent intake of fried and broiled meat. Using an imputed mEH genotype, the very slow metabolizers, 0 or 1 \"fast\" alleles, exposed for cigarette smoking had a significantly increased risk (Ulrich et al. , 2001). However, these results are in conflict with others as a slight but not statistically increased risk fo r colorectal adenoma was reported for carriers of the high activity alleles. However, when combined with exposure to PAH, smoking status or consumption of well-done cooked meat an increased risk was observed (Cortessis et al. , 2001). The \"fast\" phenotype was also associated with an increased risk for ovarian cancer in smokers, while it did not have any major impact on bladder cancer. Using chromosomalA83aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes as the biomarker, BP induced higher level of damage in the carriers of the \"fast\" genotype, and this effect was especially significant in individuals that are classi fied as GSTM 1*2/2 (Salama et al. (MPO) is a phase I metabolic enzy me found in monocytes/macrophages and is involved in th e metabolism of benzo[ a]pyrene to the highly reactive benzo[ a]pyrene- 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide. A genetic polymorphism has been detected in the SP1 transcription factors binding site in the regulatory regi on. The G to A nucleotide shift influences the binding of a transcription factor and thus in fluencing the basal level of the enzyme, the GG genotype having higher enzyme level. In vitro, the G-variants confers a 25-fold higher transcriptional activation compared to the A-variant. A lower risk for lung cancer was observed in the low activity phenotype, but only in people exposed to tobacco smoke andthis was especially significant at high doses (Schabath et al. , 2000). A higher level of PAH adducts was also seen in atopic dermatitis patients with the GG genotype treated topically with coal tar ointment (Rojas et al. , 2001). This suggest an important role of MPO in the activation of PAH to DNA binding metabolite s. An interesting sex difference was observed, as women with the GG genotype did not have an increased risk for lung cancer. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) is important in the biotransformation of xenobiotica. The enzyme specifically prevents the formation of benzo[ a]pyrene-quinone- DNA adducts. However, it is involved in th e activation of nitro-PAH to mutagenic metabolites which makes interpretations difficult when co-exposure occurs. High NQO1 activity should as such prevent against PAH- induced carcinogenesis, and NQO1 deficiency does also increase susceptibility to benzo[ a]pyrene-induced mouse skin carcinogenesis (Long et al. , 2000). A genetic polymorphism in NQO1 has been detected, a C to T transition at bp 609, that has been associated with a reduced enzyme activity. This polymorphism has also been linked to increa sed lung cancer risk in Caucasians when stratified according to exposure, e.g. smoking habits (Rosvold et al. , 1995). 2.3.5 DNA repair An increased risk of cancer and malignant transformation in cellular systems have been associated with a decrease in repair capacity. Bulky DNA adducts, such as those induced by PAH , may be repaired by base excision repa ir (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways. Genetic polymorphism in DNA repair enzymes have been reported, e.g. ERCC1 where an amino acid substitution lys751Gln, where the Lys/Lys carriers have suboptimal DNA repair capacity, and a G to A mutation in XRCC1 resulting in aminoacid change Arg399Gln. The genetic polymorphisms infl uence the bulky carcinogen DNA adduct level and sister chromatid exchange in human mononuclear cells (Duell et al. , 2000). CarriersA84with at least one Lys751 allele had a higher adduct level than the Gln/Gln carries when exposed to PAH in ambient air, whereas polymorphisms in XRCC1 and XRCC3 did not significantly alter th e DNA adduct level (Palli et al. , 2001). These results suggest that individual with low DNA repair capacity may have an increased risk of PAH-induced cancers. 2.3.6 Conclusion The exact influence of genetic polymorphism on risk for PAH carcinogenesis is not completely elucidated as compensatory mechanism, or alternative enzymatic pathways make take over. Genetic polym orphisms in genes involved in the metabolism of PAH have many faces - sometime beneficial, sometime detrimental. The actual effect may depend on the number of gene-gene and gene-environmen t interactions including interactions of polymorphic enzymes with the dose of the PAH, chemical nature of PAH and interactionwith nutritional status. The current information suggests that the effect of these polymorphism depends on the level of exposure, i.e. the enzymes may be more important at low dose of exposure such as those expe riences by food-borne PAH. Although CYP enzymes are involved in the phase I metabolis m of many chemical carcinogens, it has not been possible to identify any specific relations hip between a risk alle le of a CYP and cancer development (Ingelman-Sundbe rg, 2001). However, the metabolism of PAH is very complex involving several comp eting pathways involving different enzymes, and it is the ratio between bioactivation and detoxification that determine the genotoxic effect. It is therefore important to define a high-ri sk population, e.g. GSTM1*2/2, the mEH fast phenotype and CYP1A1*2/ or CYP1A1*3/. The frequencies of high-risk genotypes in Caucasian populations is lis ted in table 3.3.1 (Garte et al. , 2001). The group having all three high-risk genotype will represent approximate ly 1 % of the European population, as the genes are not linked.

The LD 50 values (table 2.4.1) indicate th at the acute oral toxicity is moderate to low.

(1989)A872.4.2 Short-term toxicity In dogs a single oral dose of 3 or 9 g napht halene or a total dose of 10.5 g per animal given over seven days induced anaemia. All three animals showed neurophysiological symptoms (Zuelzer and Apt, 1949). After oral administration of 100 mg anthracene or phenanthrene/kg bw per day to rats for four days increased carboxylesterase activity in the intestinal mucosa was observed. Rats given 50 or 150 mg/kg bw per day of benzo[ a]pyrene of benz[ a]anthracene showed activity in the intestinal mucosa whereas renal microsomal carboxylesterase activity was moderately induced (Nousiainen et al. , 1984). Wistar rats treated orally with Benzo[ a]pyrene and benz[ a]anthracene were much more effective than the other substances, increasing liver weights by 27 and 19%, respectively (T\u00f6rr\u00f6nen et al. , 1981). Death due to myelotoxicity was observed af ter daily oral administration of benzo[ a]pyrene at 120 mg/kg bw to poor-affinity Ah receptor DBA/2N mice for one to four weeks, whereas high-affinity C57 Bl/6N mice survived with no myelotoxicity for at least six months under these conditions (Legraverend et al. , 1983). After administration (gavage) of 175, 350 and 700 mg/kg bw per day acenaphthene to mice for 90 days increased liver weight and cellu lar hypertrophy were observed in the two highest dose groups. The NOAEL was 175 mg/kg bw per day (US EPA, 1989a). With anthracene no treatment related effects were observed in CD-1 (ICR) BR micefollowing gavage doses up to 1000 mg/kg bw per day for at least 90 days. The NOAEL was the highest dose tested, 1000 mg/kg bw per day (US EPA, 1989b). Fluorene was administered by gavage to CD-1 mice at a dose of 125, 250, or 500 mg/kg bwper day for 13 weeks. Haematological changes, an increase in the absolute and relativeweight of liver, kidney and spleen, and an in crease in the amount of haemosiderin in the spleen and in Kupffer cells of the liver wa s observed in mice treated with 250 or 500 mg/kg bw per day. The NOAEL was 125 mg/kg bw per day (US EPA, 1989c). Dose-dependent nephropathy and liver toxici ty (increased liver weight, increased ALAT activities, and microscopic lesi ons) were observed in CD-1 mice given 250, or 500 mg/kgA88bw per day fluoranthene by gavage for 13 week s. No adverse effects were observed at 125 mg/kg bw per day (US EPA, 1988). In a 90-day study in mice, naphthalene adminis tered at oral daily doses (gavage) of 5.3, 53 or 133 mg/kg bw caused a decrease in bodyweight and relative spleen weight in the highest dose group. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were decreased in all dosed females, but the clinical significance of this observation is unclear. The NOAEL was 53 mg/kg bw per day (Shopp et al. , 1984). In Fisher 344 rats admistered 0, 25, 50, 100, 200 or 400 mg naphthalene/kg bw per day by gavage for 13 weeks (5 days a week), decreased bodyweight and microscopic kidney lesions were observed in the two highest dose groups. The NOAEL was 100 mg/kg bw perday (adjusted: 71 that ingested 150 mg/kg bw per day naphthalene for the first three weeks and 200- 220 mg/kg bw per day for a further 11 weeks, reduced weight gain and food intake, enlarged livers with cell oedema and congestion of the liver parenchyma, and inflammation of kidney cells were observed (Kawai, 1979). Oral administration (gavage) of 0.5-1 g/kg bw per day naphthalene for periods of 4-13 weeks induced the development of cataracts in rats, mice, and rabbits . Particularly in the eyes of rabbits cataracts developed within a few days of repeated oral administration. It was postulated that P450-dependent bioactivation of naphthale ne to naphthoqninone or a free- radical derivative are essential for the induction of cataracts (Wells et al. , 1989). The effect could be reduced by pretreatment with P450 inhibitors and antioxidants and or glutathione depletors (IPCS, 1998). were 75, 125, or 250 mg/kg bw per day pyrene by gavage for 13 weeks. Dose-dependent nephropathy, characterized by the presence of multiple foci of renal tubular regeneration, often accompanied infiltrates and/or foci of interstitial fibrosis. The renal lesions in all groups were described as minimal or mild. Relative and absolute kidney weights were lo wer in mice at the two higher doses. The NOAEL was 75 mg/kg bw per day (US EPA, 1989d). Wistar rats (10 per dose, and sex) treated with benzo[ a]pyrene (dissolved in soy oil) with doses of 0, 3, 10 or 30 mg benzo[ a]pyrene/kg bw, 5 days a week were sacrficied after 3 month (additional sacrifice to the chronic car cinogenicity study carried out by Kroese et al. , 2001). A dose-related increase in liver weight was seen in male rats from 10 mg/kg bw onwards. In the highest dose group liver weight (females) and thymus weight (males andfemales) were significantly increased. A dose-related increase in basal cell hyperplasia inA89the forestomach was found in ma les and females in the two highest dose groups. This effect was accompanied by an increase in the number of mitotic cells in the lamina muscularis mucosa of the forestomach in the same dose gr oups. An increase in thymus atrophy (males and females) was ved Benzo[ a]pyrene, 100 and 200 mg per kg of body weight, was given to groups of 30 day old female CD1 mice and 21 day old female Sprague-Dawley rats by gavage twice with a four-day interval, and the animals were terminated 3 weeks later. Benzo[ a]pyrene induced aberrant crypts foci of the colon in a dose-related fashion. The mouse was 15 times more sensitive than the rat (Tudek et al. , 1989). A series of PAH were investig ated for their ability to induce nuclear anomalie s (NA) in the mouse gastrointestinal tract. Among the compounds tested, 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthrene was the most effective inducer of NA in all ga strointestinal tract tissues examined, with the relative potency in duodenum of 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthrene being much benzo[ e]pyrene did not have any effect. When binary mixtures of some PAH were administered the yield of NA was less than that expected by simple additivity (Reddy et al.,1991). Groups of six male C57/B6 mice, adapted to hum an diets, were treated by gavage with 200 mg benzo[ a]pyrene per kg of body weight. After 24 hours, the frequency of colonic nuclear aberrations was increased by benzo[ a]pyrene treatment; most markedly in mice fed a diet low in fibre and protein (O'Neill et al. ,1991). Nuclear anomalies were induced in crypts of duodenum and colon of a group of 10 male B6C3F1 mice treated with a single oral dose of 0.79 mmol benzo[ a]pyrene per kg of body weight. In a similar group of mice pre-adapted to 1800 ppm chloroform for 30 days prior to the benzo[ a]pyrene administration the level of nucl ear anomalies induced in the proximal colon by benzo[ a]pyrene was reduced by four-fold (Daniel et al. ,1991). Groups of 15 male F344 rats were initiated for liver carcinogenesis by a single intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamin e (200 mg/kg bw) and by two-thirds partial hepatectomy at week three. At week two benzo[ a]pyrene was incorporated in the diet at a level of 33 mg/kg and this treatment continued for six weeks. Benzo[ a]pyrene caused only marginal increases in the area of glutathione S-transferase P-form-positive foci in the liver(Hasegawa et al. at a single dose of gamma-glutamyltrans- peptidase-positive islands) in the livers of female Sprague-Dawley rats when the rats were both pre-treated and promoted with polychlor inated biphenyls at a dose which strongly induced aryl (Deml et al. ,1983). Benzo[ a]pyrene (80 bw once a week by gavage 150 mg/kg in the diet), pyrene (100 mg/kg by gavage, a week by (100 mg/kg bw once a week by gavage 200 mg/kg the diet, and 7,12- dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene (30 mg/kg bw once a week) administered for 6 weeks were tested for initiation of the induction of liver hyperplastic nodules in male F344 rats (16-20 per group). Test chemicals were administered during the initiation stage after which rats were fed dietary N-2-fluorenylacetamide (2 -FAA) for 2 weeks in conjugation with a necrogenic dose of CCl4 to enhance produc of preneoplastic liver lesions in the rat. 7,12-Dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene was 20 times more potent than benzo[ a]pyrene which was 10 times more potent than benz[ a]anthracene. Administration by gavage was more effective than ingestion with the diet. Anthracene and pyrene had no effect (Tatematsu et al.,1983). 2.4.4 Long-term toxicity A group of 28 BD I and BD III rats received anthracene in the diet from the age of about 100 days, at a daily dose of 5-15 mg per rat. Administration was terminated when a total dose of 4.5 g per rat had been achieved, on da y 550. The rats were observed until they died (some lived for more than 1000 days). No tr eatment-related effects on lifespan or on gross or histological appearance of ti ssues were observed (Schm\u00e4hl, 1955). Non-responsive strains of mice (C57B1/6, C3H/HeN, and Balb/cAnN) had increased relative liver weights after they were fe d for 180 days on a diet containing benzo[ a]pyrene resulting in an intake of 120 mg/kg bw per day (Robinson et al. , 1975). A912.4.5 Oral carcinogenicity studies evaluated by IPCS (1998) The vast majority of the long-term studies c onducted on PAH were designed to assess their carcinogenicity. Most studies to assess th e carcinogenic potential of single PAH were carried out following dermal, subcutaneous, or inhalation exposure (an overview is given in table 2.4.5). Only a limited number of studies de alt with oral administration, the route of exposure that is most relevant for the current report. The following will particularly concentrate on the results obtained in oral carcinogenicity studies. An overview of these studies is presented in table 2.4.4. Anthracene orally administered to rats for 2-2.5 years did not show a clear carcinogenic response (IARC, 1983) (table 2.4.4). A single administration of benz[ a]anthracene by gavage did not produce tumours in mice whereas repeated oral administrations to mice produced hepatomas and lung adenomas, aswell as a few forestomach papillomas (IARC, 1973). A single dose of 200 mg benz[ a]anthracene administered by gavage to female Sprague-Dawley rats did not induce mammary tumours within 60 days, whereas 7-methylbenz[ a]anthracene and 12- methylbenz[ a]anthracene were reported to produce mammary tumours (Huggins and Yang, 1962) (Tab le 2.4.4). Groups of 20 female albino mice were treated with a single intragastric dose of 0.2 mg benzo[ a]pyrene per mouse (corresponding to 6 mg/kg of body weight). After 43 weeks a total of 14 tumours in the forestomach was observed in 5 of 11 surviving animals. Single doses of 0.05 mg (1.5 mg/kg of body weight) and 0.012 mg (0.36 mg/kg of body weight) produced 0/9 and 2/10 tumours, respectively. No tumours were seen in 9 surviving control animals. No tumours were seen in the glandular part of th e stomach or other parts of the alimentary canal (Peirce 1961). Nine female Sprague-Dawley rats (50-65 days of age) were given a single oral dose of 100mg benzo[ a]pyrene. Within 60 days the mammary gland (papillary adenocarcinomas) (Huggins and Yang, 1962). In a study with Sprague-Dawley rats of both se xes (3 1/2 months of age) daily doses of 2.5 mg benzo[ a]pyrene per rat for 8-12 months induced papillomas of the oesophagus and forestomach in 3 out of 40 animals (Gibel, 1964). Groups of male and female white Swiss mice, which were fed diets containing 250 or 1000mg of benzo[ a]pyrene per kg diet for various time periods, developed squamous papillomas and carcinomas of the forestomach in a dose dependent manner. All mice fed 1000 mgA92benzo[ a]pyrene per kg diet and examined after 86 days had tumours. In the group fed 250 mg benzo[ a]pyrene per kg diet 25% developed gastric tumours when fed for more than 85 days. A high incidence of lung adenomas was also observed in these mice (Rigdon and Neal 1966).No increases in stomach tumours were found in mice after 110 days of treatment with diets containing up to 30 mg benzo[ a]pyrene /kg diet, while 40-45 mg/kg diet for 110 days induced stomach tumours in about 10% of the mice, and more than 70% of mice fed 50-250 mg/kgdiet for 122-197 days had stomach tum ours. A diet containing 250 mg benzo[ a]pyrene /kg fed for different time periods produced the following incidences of stomach tumours: one day, 0%; 2-4 days, 10%; 5-7 days, 30-40%; 30 days, 100% (Neal and Rigdon, 1967). Theresults of these two studies have been compiled in the following two tables (tables 2.4.2 and 2.4.3): Table 2.4.2 Frequency of forestomach tumours in female mice after administration of benzo[ a]pyrene (BaP) in the feed (Rig don and Neal, 1966; Neal and Rigdon, 1967).

Daily administration of benzo[ a]pyrene in olive oil in the diet of 70 days old female albino mice (strain not specified) for 14 months, in a concentration of 4 mg per kg feed, resulted in 13/160 animals with tumours of the forestom ach (11 papillomas, two carcinomas). In control groups 0/117 (olive oil) and (untre ated controls) developed gastric tumours. When benzo[ a]pyrene was administered in an ethanol solution instead of drinking water 5/81 tumours of the forest omach developed (Chouroulinkov et al. , 1967). A vast number of studies have been perfor med in female mice where the development of forestomach neoplasia and lung adenomas after peroral administration of benzo[ a]pyrene have been demonstrated. In general, thes e studies have been performed in order to investigate various dietary factors capable of inhibiting the tumourigenicity of benzo[ a]pyrene , and therefore have normally used a dose regimen for benzo[ a]pyrene , known to be effective in the mouse. Most ofte n female mice, 7-10 weeks of age, have been used. Benzo[ a]pyrene has typically been administered by gavage at doses of 1-4 mg/kg bw 1-2 times a week for 2-4 weeks 15-30 weeks the incidences of lung adenomasand/or forestomach recorded (IPCS 1998).A94Oral benzo[ a]pyrene doses estimated to be between 6 and 12 mg/kg body weight/day induced leukemia in non-responsive (Ahd/Ahd) mice after 100 or more days, but not in responsive mice (Ahb/Ahd). It was suggested th at a higher dose is obtained in the bone marrow of non-responsive mice than in re sponsive mice (Nebert and Jensen, 1979a, 1979b; Nebert et al. , 1980). Oral administration of a single dose of benzo[ a]pyrene (100 mg) produced tumours of the mammary gland (papillary adenocarcinomas) in female Sprague-Dawley rats (Huggins and Yang, 1962). In another study using the same strain of rats daily doses of 2.5 mgbenzo[ a]pyrene per rat for 8-12 months induced a few of the oesophagus and forestomach (Gibel, 1964). Benzo[ a]pyrene was administered for 87-131 week s to groups of 32 male and 32 female Sprague-Dawley rats either as an admixture to the diet or by gavage in an aqueous 1.5% caffeine solution. Benzo[ a]pyrene in solution was given as doses of 0.15 mg/kg body weight either: 1) 5 days per week (annual dose: 39 mg/kg body weight), 2) every 3rd day (18 mg/kg body weight/year), 3) or every 9th day (6 mg/kg body weight/year). When mixed in the diet the doses were: 4) 0.15 mg/kg body weight 5 days a week (39 mg/kg bodyweight/year) or 5) 0.15 mg/kg body weight every 9th day (6 mg/kg body weight/year). Similar groups given either caffeine solution or control diet served as controls. A significant increased number of rats with forestomach papillomas was observed in group 1 to 4 (14, 25, 11, and 9 rats with tumours, respec tively) compared to 1 in group 5) and 2 and 3 tumours in the control groups. No other tu mours were found significantly different from control levels (Brune et al. , 1981). A diet containing 500 ppm benzo[ a]pyrene was given to 13 hamsters four days per week for up to 14 months. A total of 12 tumours (t wo in oesophagus, eight in the forestomach and two in the intestine) were seen in eight hamsters (Chu and Malmgren, 1965). Bi-weekly administration of 2-5 mg benzo[ a]pyrene by gavage produced 5 papillomas of the stomach in 67 hamsters treated for one to five months, seven papillomas and two carcinomas in 18 hamsters treated for six to nine months and five papillomas in eight hamsters treated for 10-11 mont hs (Dontenwill and Mohr, 1962). A low incidence of large bowel neoplasms was induced in a group of 30 male Syrian hamsters of the inbred strain BIO given 0.8 mg benzo[ a]pyrene once weekly for 30 weeks. The experiment was terminated after 1 year. The incidence of colon neoplasms was 6% after benzo[ hamsters mg 3-methylchol anthrene, twice weekly induced tumours in 20% of animals (Wang et al. , 1985). Dibenz[ a,h]anthracene administered orally dissolved in PEG-400 or olive oil to mice induced forestomach papillomas or pulmonary adenomas or carcinomas (Table A). Also, mammary carcinomas and haemangioendotheliomas been reported in mice followingoral administration (Wattenberg, 1973; IARC, 1973). Results obtained by Morris et al. (1960) feeding rats a diet containing 0.05% fluorene for up to 18 months did not show a clear increase in tumour incidence, though the results could not be interpreted as clearly negative. Th erefore IPCS (1998) classified the study as \"questionable\" (see table 2.4.4). Two studies in rats with oral administrati on of naphthalene or phenanthrene did not show an increase in tumour incidence. It should be noted that most of the studies mentioned above were performed before 1970 and were carried out without using controls , using test compounds not clearly defined, or using inadequate experimental designs. The criteria used by WHO (IPCS,1998) to classify a study as \"valid\" (see table 2.4.4) were (i) an appropriate study protocol, i.e. use of concurrent controls (sham or vehicle), 20 or more animals per group, and study duration of at least six months; and (ii) sufficient doc umentation, including detailed description of administration, results, and the survival of animals.

In fact , the study of skin carcinogenicity of PAH, alone or in combination with tumour prom oters, has provided much of the background for the initiation/promotion theory in chemical carcinogenesis (IPCS, 1998). Benzo[ a]pyrene is the only PAH that has been tested for carcinogenicity following inhalation. After long-term inhalation of 10 mg benzo[ a]pyrene per m3, cancer of the respiratory tract occurred in 35% of golden hamsters (Thyssen et al. , 1981; Pauluhn et al., 1985). However, pulmonary carcinogenicit y has been shown for a number of PAH in studies using direct application (instillation) of the PAH into the respiratory tract ofrats and hamsters (IPCS, 1998). Benzo[ a]pyrene and many other PAH are potent inducers of liver and lung tumours (within half a year) following intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection of newborn animals al. , 1987; IPCS, 1998). In their evaluation of the data on the carci nogenicity of individual PAH, IPCS (1998) concluded that the following PAH should fluoroanthene were suspected questionable. Of these, naphthalene was considered to be not carcinogenic due to its negativ e genotoxicity, the others were further evaluated. In its final evaluation the IPCS found, that considered not carcinogenic (IPCS, 1998). In most studies, the site of the tumour development was related to the route of administration, i.e. oral administration indu ced gastric tumours, dermal application induced skin sarcomas. However, tumour induction restricted to the sites of application (IPCS, 1998; Kroose et al. , 2001). In animal bioassays using the sa me potent carcinogenic PAH. Benzo[ j]- andA102benzo[ k]fluoranthene are of moderate are relatively weak carcinogens. Table 2.4.6 Overview of IARC evaluation (1983, 1987) of evidence for carcinogenicity to humans of PAH PAH Compound IARC conclusion Animals \"Overall\" Anthanthrene L 3 3 I 3 I 3 Benzo[c]phenanthrene I 3 Benzo[a]pyrene S 2A Benzo[e]pyrene I 3 Chrysene L 3 Coronene I 3 L 3 Dibenz[a,c]anthracene L 3 2B 3 3 I 3 I 3 carcinogenic to humans; 3: not classifiable A103Based on all available information judging da ta from studies concerning all different routes of administration (dermal, (1983, 1987) has classified 32 different PAH with respect to the evidence for carcinogenicity in experimental animals and humans (table 2.4.6). 2.4.7 Carcinogenicity of comple x mixtures containing PAH In the recent feeding study that compared the tumourigenicity of coal tar with that of benzo[ a]pyrene in female B6C3F1 mice it was shown that when benzo[ a]pyrene was administered alone the major site of tumour formation (papillomas and squamous cellcarcinomas) was the forestomach. When benzo[ a]pyrene was part of coal tar mixtures the formation of forestomach tumours seemed to be in accordance with the benzo[ a]pyrene content of the mixtures. However, in addition to the forestomach tumours the coal tar mixtures also produces increased incidences of alveolar and bronchiolar adenomas and car cinomas, liver tumours, tumours of the small intestine, and haemangiosarcomas. The overall carcinogenic potencies of the complex coal tarmixtures were 2-5 times higher than that of benzo[ a]pyrene (Culp et al. , 1998) (see 2.4.7). The 4-7 ring PAH fraction of condensate fro m car exhaust (gasoline, diesel), domestic coal stove emissions, and tobacco smoke contained almost all the carcinogenic potential of PAH. This was found in a se ries of studies using skin painting, subcutaneous injection and in trapulmonary implantation of different fractions. It was concluded from the skin painting tests of different condensates that benzo[ a]pyrene represented about 5-15% of the carcinogenic potency of the exhaust condensates from petrol-driven vehicles and coal-fired domestic stoves. When tested by lung implantation in the rat, benzo[ a]pyrene contributed a somewhat lower percentage of the (<1 - 2.5%) al. , 1984). A dose-related lung carcinogenic effect wa s observed in rats exposed by inhalation to a coal tar/pitch condensation aerosol at ex posure levels corresponding to either 20 or 46 \u00b5g benzo[ a]pyrene/m3. The lifetime lung tumour risk for rats exposed to 1 \u00b5g benzo[a]pyrene/m3 as a constituent of this complex mixture was calculated to be 2% (2x10-2). In comparison, the WHO (2001) estimated a unit lung cancer risk for humans of nearly 9% (8.7x10-2) per \u00b5g benzo[ a]pyrene/m3 in ambient air based on epidemiological data on workers exposed to coke-oven emissions from coking plants. It was suggested that in the evaluation of the lung carcinogenicity of PAH adsorbed on inhaled fine particles the likely enhancing properties of the inflammatory effects of particles on lung tissue shoul d be considered (Heinrich et al. , 1994). A1042.4.8 Recent oral carcinogeni city studies on benzo[ a]pyrene not evaluated by IPCS (1998) Two recent oral carcinogenicity studies with benzo[ a]pyrene have become available since the evaluation in 1998 by WHO. In a study to compare the tumourogenicity of coal tar with that of benz[ a]pyrene female B6C3F1 mice were fed diets c ontaining 0, 5, 25 or 100 mg/kg benz[ a]pyrene (dissolved in acetone) for 2 years. Equivalent doses are 0, 0.7, 3.6 or 14 mg benzo[ a]pyrene/kg bw. Papillomas and 46/47, with significant and dose incidences at 25 and 100 mg/kg. The incidenc es of 0/48, 2/46, 23/48. In the latter two tissues only the highest dose group differed significantly from the solvent control (Culp et al. , 1998). DNA adducts determined with the 32P- postlabelling method in the forestomach of a subset of mice fed benzo[ a]pyrene for 4 weeks, were increased in a linear manner as function of the dose. The major adduct has been characterized as dG-N2- benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (Culp et al, 1996). In the same experiment groups of 48 fema le B6C3F1 mice were fed diets containing 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 or 1.0% of coal tar mixture I containing 2240 mgbenzo[ a]pyrene/kg as determined by HPLC (dose levels equivalent to 0.03, 0.09, 0.32, 0.96, 1.92 or 3.2 mg benzo[ a]pyrene/kg bw), and 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3% of coal tar mixture II containing 3669 mg benzo[ a]pyrene/kg as determined by HPLC (equivalent to 0.16, 0.52 or 1.1 mg benzo[ a]pyreneP/kg bw). A significantly increased incidence of alveolar and bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas was found at 0.3, 0.6 and 1.0% of mixture I (27/47, 25/47 and 21/45 versus 2/47 in the control), and at 0.1 and 0.3% of mixture II (10/48 and 23/47 vers us 2/47 in the control). A significant increase in tumours of the forestomach wa s found at 0.3 and 0.6% of mixture I (14/46, 15/45 versus 0/47 in the control) with a dis tinct lower incidene (6/41) in the highest dose (1%). Forestomach tumours were also observed at 0.3% of mixture II (13/44). Also the incidence of liver tumours (14/45 at 0.3% mixture I), tumours of the small intestine (22/36 and 36/41 at 0.6 and 1.0% mixture I, respectively) and haemangiosarcomas (0.3 and 0.6% mixture I and 0.3% mixture II) was significantly increased. In a subset of mice fed coal tar mixture I for 4 weeks, DNA adducts were determined in forestomach and small intestine. In the forestomach adduct levels increased in a dose-related manner. In the small intes tine adduct levels increased until the 0.6% dose, with a sharp decrease in the highes t dose (1.0%), where the tumour incidenceA105was greatest. Therefore the authors conclude d that coal-tar induced cytotoxicity and cell proliferation may be critical factors for tumour induction in this tissue (Culp et al, 1996). Table 2.4.7 Composition of the coal tar mixtures used in the mice carcinogenity study (Culp et al, 1998) Compound 7640 10 100 Pyrene 5092 7220 Wistar rats (52 per dose, and sex) were treated with benzo[ a]pyrene (dissolved in soy oil) with doses of 0, 3, 10 or 30 mg benzo[ a]pyrene /kg bw, 5 days a week for 104 weeks. The most prominent carcinogenic effects were observed in the liver and the forestomach. In the forestomach the incidence of combined papilloma and for males. The incidence of combined adenoma and carcinoma in the liver was respectively 0/52, 2/52, 51/52 for fe males, and 0/52, 4/52, for males. Besides these major target sites, benzo[ a]pyrene treatment also induced soft tissues sarcomas at various sites (oesophagu s, skin, mammary), as well as tumours of the auditory canal, skin, and oral cavity , small intestine and the kidney (Kroese et al. , 2001).A106A separate experiment in the rat chroni c carcinogenicity assay concerns DNA adduct formation. DNA adducts detected by using the 32P-postlabelling method are found in all tissues, with remarkably high levels in organs devoid of any tumour development (i.e. lungs, kidneys). This leads the author s to conclude that \"factors additional to DNA adducts formation apparently are critical to tumour development by benzo[ a]pyrene \" (Kroese et al. , 2001). 2.5 Reproductive and develo pmental toxicity of PAH 2.5.1 Introduction The reproductive and developmental toxici ty of PAH has been reviewed by IARC (1983), ATSDR (1995b) and IPCS (1998). The information below is taken from these reviews, supplemented by a litera ture search from 1998 onwards. Many PAH metabolised by the cytochrome P-450 system are also inducers of that enzyme system via activation of arylhydr ocarbon receptors (AhR). As with other aspects of PAH toxicity, enzyme inducti on generally enhances the toxic response. Inducibility of the cytochrome P-450 system is determined by genotype. Thus, in reproduction and developmenta l toxicity studies both the maternal and the fetal genotype are relevant to and fo rmation of placental PAH-DNA adducts It has been shown that benzo[ a]pyrene readily crosses the placenta in mice and rats and that dibenz[ a,j]acridine (or its metabolites) and dibenz[ a,h]anthracene also cross the placenta (IARC, 1983). It is reasonable to assume that because of their lipid solubility, most PAH are likely to pass into the embryo and fetus. PAH-DNA adducts are found in the human pl acenta and in fetal tissues (umbilical artery and vein, liver and lung) indicating that PAH are transferred to and activated by the human fetus (Autrup, 1993). Placental a nd fetal adducts are found in both smokers and non-smokers, but relative adduc t levels are significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers (Hansen et al. , 1993; r\u00e1m et al. , 1999). They are also higher in women living in an area with high airborne pollution compared with women in a less polluted area (r\u00e1m et al. , 1999) A1072.5.3 Reproductive toxicity in experimental animals The majority of investigations for reproduc tive and developmental toxicity in animals have been on benzo[ a]pyrene. Benzo[a]pyrene The main observations on mice are summa rised in table 2.5.1, taken from the IPCS review (IPCS, 1998). Benzo[ a]pyrene was administered via the diet to Swiss mice, at doses corresponding to 33, 67 or 133 mg/kg bw/day, for for varying time periods of 20-30 days before mating, during gestation and parturition. No effects were found on the numbers of offspring or on numbers of sperm in th e testicular lumen (Rigdon and Neal, 1965). Administration of benzo[ a]pyrene by oral gavage to CD-1 mice for 10 days from day 7-16 of pregnancy at doses of 10, 40 and 160 mg/kg bw/day, reduced the numbers of pregnant females reaching parturition at 160 mg/kg bw/day and reduced the fertility of F 1 offspring in all dose groups when bred with untreated animals (see table 2.5.3) (Mackenzie and Angevine, 1981). There were significant altera tions in gonadal morphology and germ cell development and almost complete sterility of F 1 offspring at 40 mg/kg bw/day. PAH can affect female fertility by destruction of oocytes. In studies in DBA/2N mice,a single intraperitoneal (ip) injection of benzo[ a]pyrene given 14 days before mating in doses ranging from 10-500 mg/kg bw reduced pup numbers in a dose-dependent manner. In a second experiment primord ial oocytes were destroyed in a dose- dependent manner by single doses of 5-500 mg/kg bw given 21 days before sacrifice. The threshold for these effects was estimated to be around 2.7-3.4 mg/kg bw (Mattison et al. , 1980). Destruction of oocytes by PAH has been shown to be an AhR- mediated effect, involving increased expression of the Bax gene in oocytes (see section on \"Significance of receptor-mediated effects\"). In experiments with B6 (Ah-inducible) and D2 (non-inducib le) mice given a single ip injection of 100 mg benzo[ a]pyrene/kg bw 13 days before sacrifice, primordial oocytes of B6 mice underwent more rapi d destruction than those of D2 mice (Mattison and Nightingale, 1980). This effect corresponded to a two- to threefold increase in ovarian arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity in B6 mice after treatment. This correlation was not f ound in analogous experiments with D2B6F 1 mice, in which AHH activity was increased by two- to threefold, but the oocyte destruction was similar to that observed in D2 mice (Mattison and Nightingale, 1980). The IPCS review (IPCS, 1998) commented th at this demonstrates an inconsistent consequence of strain differences in genotype and that the sum of activation, detoxification, and repair seem s to be decisive for the process of oocyte destruction.A108Benzo[ a]pyrene and diol epoxide, were administered by injecti on at a single dose of 10 \u00b5g into the right ovary of B6, D2, and D2B6F 1 mice. Various reductions were observed in ovarian volume, weight, and follicle numbers after 2 weeks, with compensatory hypertrophy in the left ovary, in all strains given benzo[a]pyrene or its metabolites. This metabolites (Mattison et al. , 1989). There are no recent studies in rats . Dietary administration of benzo[ a]pyrene to female rats for 28-days had no effect on the oestrous cycle and no effect on fertility when these rats were bred with untreated males (Rigdon and Renn els, 1964). When male and female rats were given benzo[ a]pyrene in the diet at a dose equivalent to around 50 mg/kg bw and bred there was said to be fewer pregnancies and increased stillborn and resorbed fetuses, but the data ar e poorly reported (Rig don and Rennels, 1964). Other PAH More recent studies by the US EPA on other PAH are descri bed in the review by the ATSDR (1995b). Mice were treated orally by gavage for 13 weeks with acenaphtheneup to 700 mg/kg at 1000 each at 500 mg/kg bw/day. There were no effects on male or female reproductive organ weights or histology, ex cept in the case of acenaphthene, where reduced ovary weights were observed at 700 mg/kg bw/day but not at 350 mg/kg bw/day. 2.5.4 Developmental toxicity in experimental animals Developmental toxicity (embryolethality, reduced fetal weight and malformations) has been reported in to benz[ a]anthracene, dibenz[ table 2.5.2, modified from the IPCS review (IPCS, 1998). The important studies are discussed below. Benzo[a]pyrene Benzo[ a]pyrene is embryotoxic to mice and the size of the effect is partly dependent on the genetically determined induction of the cytochrome P-450 mono-oxygenase receptor, Ah, of the mother and fetus by PAH (IARC, 1983; IPCS, 1998). In the case of an inducible mother (Ahb/ Ahb and Ahb/ Ahd, B groups), the genotype of the fetus is not crucial because the active metabolites formed in the mother appear to cross theplacenta, causing fetal death or malformati on. In contrast, when the mother is non- inducible (Ah d/ Ahd, D group), the genotype of the fe tus is important; one litter may contain both inducible fetuses that are affe cted and non-inducible fetuses that are not.A109Another influential factor is the route by which benzo[ a]pyrene is given to the mother. The three studies described below and in table 2.5.2 illustrate these aspects. Injection of benzo[ a]pyrene ip at 50 or 300 mg/kg bw on day 7 or 10 of gestation was more toxic and teratogenic in genetically inducible C57Bl/6 (Ahb/ Ahb) than in In and (C57Bl/6)(AKR)F 1 \u00d7 AKR back-crosses (father \u00d7 F 1 mother), allelic differences at the Ah locus in the fetus correlated with dysmorphogenesis. Th e inducible fetal Ahb/ Ahd genotype results in more stillborn and resorbed fetuses, decreased fetal weight, increased frequency of congenital anomalie s, and enhanced P-450-mediated covalent binding of benzo[ a]pyrene metabolites to fetal protein and DNA, when compared with fetuses of the non-inducible Ahd/ Ahd genotype from the same uterus. In the case of an inducible mother (Ahb/ Ahd), however, these parameters do not differ in Ahb/ Ahd and Ahd/ Ahd fetuses in the same uterus, presumably because of the increased benzo[ a]pyrene metabolism in maternal tissues and placenta (Shum et al. , 1979). An inducible genotype is not the only fact or involved in the reproductive toxicity of benzo[ a]pyrene. In a study in which C57Bl/6 female mice (Ah inducible) were mated with C57Bl/6, DBA/2, or BDF 1 male mice (B groups), and DBA/2 females (non- inducible) were mated with C57Bl/6, DBA/2, or BDF 1 males (D groups) and received ip injections of benzo[ a]pyrene, fetal mortality increased dose-dependently in all groups except the DBA/2 \u00d7 DBA/2. Fetal bod y weight was reduced dose-dependently in all experimental groups, but the effect was more pronounced in D than B groups, as was a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of cervical ribs (Hoshino et al. , 1981). These results suggest that Ah-inducible fetuses are more sensitive to lethal events, whereas those of non-inducible dams are mo re susceptible to a decrease in body weight and an increased incidence of cervical ribs. The incidence of externalmalformations may, however, differ in mice of different genotypes after treatment with benzo[ a]pyrene, even if both dams and fetuses are inducible. The toxicity of benzo[ a]pyrene was investigated in pregnant Ahd/ Ahd \u00d7 Ahb/ F1 and Ahb/ Ahd F1 back-crossed mice fed benzo[ a]pyrene in the diet at 120 mg/kg daily on days 2-10 of gestation (Legraverend et al. , 1984). Embryos of D females (Ahd/ Ahd genotype; non-inducible) showed more signs of toxicity and malformations than Ahb/ Ahd embryos. Fetuses of B females (Ahb/ Ahd genotype) did not show these changes. The auth ors suggested that reduced benzo[ a]pyrene metabolism in the intestine had caused high concentrations in the embryos, and more toxic metabolites (benzo[ a]pyrene-1,6- and -3,6-quinones) were detected in the Ahd/ Ahd embryos than in Ahb/ Ahd embryos. These results were in contrast to those reported after ip injection by Shum et al. (1979) and Hoshino et al. (1981). The route of administration can thus affect th e magnitude of the observed effects. A110Three studies on the postnatal effects of in utero exposure to benzo[ a]pyrene on mouse offspring, with maternal administrati on dermally, ip or orally, showed adverse effects on offspring after birth, including an increased incidence of tumours, immunological suppression, and reduced fe Benzo[ a]pyrene given to pregnant rats on day 15 or 19 of ge station caused alterations at the thymic glucocorticoid receptors in the offspring, suggesting binding to the pre-encoded hormone receptors and interference with receptor maturation (Csaba et al. , 1991; Csaba and Inczefi-Gonda, 1992). Strong suppression of immunological parameters was found in the progeny of mice that had been treated ip with benzo[ a]pyrene at mid-gestation (Urso and Johnson, 1987). Benzo[ a]pyrene is also a transplacental carcinogen, producing lung and/or liver tum ours in the offspring of mice and rabbits given benzo[ a]pyrene during gestation (IARC, 1983). PAH would not be expected to cause malformations, when given during embryogenesis, via DNA adduct formation. Mechanistic studies in the mouse suggest that benzo[ a]pyrene may act as an embryotoxic and teratogenic agent via generation of reactive oxygen species et al. , 1995; Winn and Wells, 1997) . There are few studies in rats sugges ting embryolethality and developmental neurotoxicity from benzo[ a]pyrene exposure during gestation. Hood and co-workers have investigated the effects of nose-only inhalational exposure to a benzo[ a]pyrene:carbon black aerosol in the rat. Controls received carbon black only. Exposure to the aerosol at 100 \u00b5g/m3 for 4h on day 15 of gestation resulted in augmentation of the developmental expre ssion profile of the Sp1 gene, which is actively expressed in developing brain, in various regions of the brain in pups 3-15 days postnatally (Hood et al. , 2000). More recent work, published in abstract only (Nayyar et al. , 2001) has confirmed increased ex pression of Sp1 in pups from rats given a single oral gavage dose of 0.70 \u00b5g TCDD/kg bw on day 14 of gestation and/or inhalational exposure to benzo[a] pyrene:carbon black aerosol at 100 \u00b5g/m3 of for 4h per day on days 14-17 of gestati on. Inhalational exposure to benzo[ a]pyrene:carbon black aerosol at 25, 75 or 100 \u00b5g/m3 for 4h per day from days 10-19 of gestation caused dose-related reductions in embry onic survival of 27%, 62% and 69% respectively, associated with reductions in maternal plasma prolactin concentrations (Archibong et al. , 2001). Sp1 expression in the brain was increased in the pups from all treated groups at 3-20 days of age in a ssociation with raised brain tissue levels of the tetrahydro-benzo[ a]pyrene metabolite (Hood et al. , 2001). Naphthalene Studies naphthalene in mice are summa rised in table 2.5.2. Administration of 300 mg/kg bw/day oral gavage to pregna nt CD-1 mice during organogenesis caused maternal toxicity (deaths and reduced we ight gain) and reduced numbers of live offspring but no malfor mations (Plasterer et al. was admin istered by gavage at 50, 150, or 450 mg/kg bw per day to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats on days 6-15 of gestation. The dams showed signsof toxicity including lethargy, slow breathing, prone body posture, and rooting, and these effects persisted after the end of dosing with the high dose. The bodyweight gain of treated animals was reduced by 31 and 53% at the two higher doses. Naphthalene did not induce developmental toxicity. Th e maternal NOAEL was < 50 mg/kg bw per day (National Toxicology Program, 1991). In a second study, doses of 0, 20, 80, or 120 mg/kg bw per day were given to rabbits by gavage during days 6-19 of gestation. There were no signs of maternal toxicity or developmental toxicity (National Toxicology Program, 1992). Administration of 395 mg/kg bw/day naphthalene ip to Sprague-Dawley rats on days 1-15 of gest ation had no effects on mothers or fetuses (Hardin et al. , 1981). 2.5.5 Reproductive and developmen tal toxicity in humans Since PAH nearly always occur in combination with other pollutants, there are few specific investigations on the reproductive or developmental effects of exposure to PAH in humans. The few studies on populati ons with high exposures to airborne pollutants, in which PAH exposure was assesse d as one of the variables, are reviewed below. Epidemiological studies on cigare tte smokers, who are exposed to many different smoke components in cluding PAH, are not revi ewed here since PAH have not been specifically identified as play ing a causal role in the known effects of smoking in pregnancy. Czech studies An extensive investigation of the human h ealth effects of airborne environmental pollutants has been conducted in the Czech Republic (r\u00e1m, 2001). Teplice, a heavily polluted mining area in Northern Bohemia, was selected as a model district and thedistrict of Prachatice in Southern Bohemia, an agricultural area, was selected for comparison. In the late 1980s the mining districts of Northern Bohemia were considered among the most heavily polluted in Europe. The potentially significantpollutants involved include d particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10), sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, meta ls, volatile organic compounds and PAH. Amelioration of pollution began in the early 1990s. The impact of air pollution on fecundab ility and pregnancy outcome was studied between 1994 and 1999 (Dejmek et al. , 2001), based on self-a dministered maternal questionnaires and medical records on all si ngleton births in Teplice and Prachatice. Daily data on air pollution came from continuous monitoring of PM 2.5, PM 10, SO 2 and carcinogenic PAH. The proportion of coupl es conceiving in the first unprotected menstrual cycle was used as the measure of fecundability and infants below the 10thA112centile of birth weight for gestational age was used as a measure of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). A reduction in fecundability was found in association with increasing exposure to SO 2 in the second month before conception but there was no association with exposure to carcinoge nic PAH. After adjustment for confounding variables, a significantly increased risk for IUGR was established for mothers from Teplice exposed to PM 10 levels >40 \u00b5g/m3 during the first month of gestation. A similar but weaker association was found for PM 2.5. No increased risk of IUGR was found in Prachatice in relation to PM 10 or PM 2.5 concentrations. A highly significant and exposure-related response for IUGR wa s found in Teplice in association with exposure to carcinogenic PAH at medium or high concentrations during the first month of gestation; the adjusted Odds Ratios (OR) were 1.59 (95% Confidence Interval 1.06-2.39) for exposure to 15 to <30 ng/m3 (P<0.025) and >30 ng/m3 (P<0.0043). No significan t associations were observed in later months of gestation. A similar rela tionship between IUGR and exposure to carcinogenic PAH in the firs t month of gestation was also seen in Prachatice, despite lower exposures to particulate matter. In another study, enzyme activities were measured in human placental samples from Teplice and Prachatice (Machala et al. aromatase (CYP19), which converts androgens to oestrogens, was disruption; placen tal-fetal production of oestro gens in humans is important in the maintenance of pregnancy and is an indicator of embryonic well-being. The activity of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), a marker of CYP1A1 induction, is used as a biomarker of exposure to co mpounds interacting with AhR; activation of the AhR by dioxin-like compounds has been shown to suppress oestrogen receptor (ER)-mediated responses. This study showed reduced aromatase activity in placental samples from Teplice and an association between reduced aromatase and IUGR(P<0.05). EROD activity was increased in Te plice samples compared with Prachatice (P<0.02). A study of neurobehaviour has also been c onducted in children aged 7 years or older in Teplice, Prachatice and Znojmo (a district where natural gas rather than brown coal is used for heating and power generation) (Otto et al. , 2001). This showed poorer neurobehavioural performance in Teplice children. While the results suggest that in utero exposure to air pollutants may be associ ated with subsequent neurobehavioural impairment, it is not known which, if any, of the several air pollutants present mightbe involved. Studies on human semen quality in Teplice and Prachatice showed an association between high levels of air pollution during the 90 days before sperm collection and increased percentage of abnormal sp erm (morphology, head shape and chromatin structure) and reduced sperm motility (Perreault et al. , 2001). However, no analysisA113has been undertaken as yet on whether th e effects are related to any particular pollutant. Polish studies Whyatt and co-workers have published a seri es of studies on 70 mother-infant pairs from Krakow in Poland, a city with high air pollution including PAH, and 90 fromLimanowa, an area with lower ambient po llution but greater indoor coal use. They measured PAH-DNA adduct formation in ma ternal and umbilical white blood cells. They found a dose-related increase in ma ternal and newborn PAH-DNA adduct levels with increasing ambient pollution at the women's place of residence in those who were not employed away from the home (p<0.05) (Whyatt et al. , 1998). They also investigated whether genetic differences in activation and detoxification capabilities may modify PAH-induced DNA da mage in maternal and newborn white blood cells (Whyatt et al. , 2000). There was no association between maternal DNA adduct levels and polym orphisms of either the transferase P1 enzyme (GSTP1). Howe ver, adduct levels were higher among newborns with the CYP1A1 MspI restriction site (heterozygotes and homozygotes combined), which has been linked with increased enzyme activity, compared with newborns lacking the restriction site (p= 0.06). Similarly, adduct levels were higher among GSTP1 ile/val and ile/ile newborns, compared with val/val newborns, the val allele having more catalytic efficiency towards PAH diol epoxides. The presence of both CYP1A1 MspI and GSTP1 ile/ile gave a higher increase in adduct levels, than the presence of either alone in newborns. The same group (Perera et al. , 1999) also found that the newborns with PAH-DNA adducts greater than the median value had significantly reduced birth weight (p=0.05), birth length (p=0.02) and head circumfe rence (p=0.0005). The reduction in birth weight was 147 g in those with adducts abov e the median value compared with those below the median. These effects are known to be associated with maternal smokingand indeed birth weight and length in this study correlated significantly with newborn plasma cotinine levels. Thus there is no evidence that the effects were attributable to the PAH component of tobacco smoke. Since exposure to cigarette smoke rather than ambient air pollution may be important in PAH-DNA adduct formation, Whyatt et al. (2001) also investigated in the same white blood cell samples the influence of ci garette smoking on adduct formation using plasma cotinine as a biomarker of exposure to cigarette smoke. There was a significant correlation between paired newborn/maternal samples for plasma cotinineand aromatic-DNA adduct leve ls but not PAH-DNA adduct levels. In 80 mother- newborn pairs for which the blood samples were drawn within 1 h of each other, levels of PAH-DNA adducts were significan tly higher in the newborn than in the paired maternal sample (p<0.05). Since fe tal exposures to PAH via blood are 10-foldA114lower than paired maternal exposures, the authors suggest that there is reduced detoxification of PAH in the fetus and increased susceptibility of the fetus to DNA damage, which would have impli cations for risk assessment. Ukrainian study In a Ukrainian study, 7 different the placentas of 200 women from the general population living in two industrialised cities in the Uk raine, Kyiv and Dniprodzerzhinsk (Gladen et al. , 2000). All 7 PAH were detected in all pl acentas, at concentrations ranging from 0.06 - 13.05 ng/g dry weight, except for a single placenta in which benzo[ a]pyrene was not found. Total PAH concentrations ranged from 2.16 - 43.50 ng/g dry weight.There was no relationship between mean birth weight and tertiles of concentrations of any individual PAH or total PAH. Adjustme nt for known predictors of birth weight did not affect this result. US study A US investigation, described by the authors as a pilot study, has used information on mothers and their pregnancy outcomes from 222,406 live birth certificates and 1,591 fetal death certificates from 1990 and 1991 comb ined with air quality data from the US Environmental Protection Agency Cumu lative Exposure Project in New Jersey, a highly urban state (Vassilev et al. , 2001 a,b). Exposure categories were based on tertiles of modelled average \"polycyclic organic matter\" (POM) for each census tract in New Jersey. Plural births and births with chromosomal anomalies were excluded. After adjustment for confounders, ORs fo r small for gestational age births were significantly raised for the highest POM exposure tertiles for both term and pre-term births. The ORs for all births we re 1.22, 95% CI 1.17-1.27 (individual-level confounders) and 1.13, 95% oup-level confounders). Comparing highest with lowest tertiles, the ORs we re 1.31 (95% CI 1.15-1.51) for very low birth weight, 1.19 (95% CI 1.02-1.39) for fetal death and 1.25 (95% CI 1.19-1.31) for premature birth. 2.5.6 Discussion and conclusions There is limited or no evidence in animals on the reproductive toxicity of individual PAH, other than benzo[ a]pyrene and naphthalene. In oral studies, benzo[ a]pyrene was without effects on reproductive capacity in a single generation study in mice up to 133 mg/kg bw/day via the diet, but impaired fertility was seen in the offspring of femalemice given >10 mg/kg bw/day by gavage. A NOAEL for this effect has not been established. A single, poorly reported study in the rat, in which 1000 ppmbenzo[ a]pyrene (c.50 mg/kg bw/day) was given in the diet, reported an effect on fertility. Intraperitoneal administration of benzo[ a]pyrene resulted in toxicity to theA115ovary (destruction of primordial oocytes, reduc ed ovarian weight). An oral study with acenaphthene has shown reduced ovarian weig ht at a high dose of 700 mg/kg bw/day. There is clear evidence for developmental toxicity of benzo[ a]pyrene in mice from oral and ip administration in the form of embryonic and fetal death, reduced fetal weight and malformations. The occurrence a nd extent of the developmental toxicity is dependent in part on maternal and fetal genotypes. In mice of a susceptible genotype 120 mg benzo[ a]pyrene/kg bw/day via the diet was developmentally toxic. A NOAEL for the oral route has not been estab lished. In the rat sc administration of benzo[a]pyrene caused fetal deaths a nd reduced fetal weight and inhalational administration of benzo[ aerosol at 25-100 \u00b5g/m3 caused dose- related embryonic deaths. However, there are no oral developmental toxicity studies on benzo[ a]pyrene in the rat. Naphthalene given orally was without any developmental toxic effects in well-reporte d studies in the rat and rabbit and was not teratogenic in the mouse. Information on the possible effects of PAH in human pregnancy is very limited. ACzech study has reported an associati on between an increased incidence of intrauterine growth retardation and airbor ne exposure to high levels of PAH (>15 ng/m 3) (Dejmek et al. , 2001). However, a significant association was only present in the first month of gestation. This obs ervation is difficult to reconcile with observations from other agents causing IUGR , such as cigarette smoke, which usually exert their main effects during the last trimester of pregnancy. A study from Poland also reported lower birth weight in associ ation with levels of PAH-DNA adducts in cord blood above the median (Perera et al. , 1998). However, the findings on birth weight in this study were correlated w ith exposure to tobacco smoke and were not necessarily due to the PAH component of tobacco smoke. The Czech study findings also contrast with those of Gladen et al. (2000), who found no association between birth weight and placental tissue concentr ations of 7 different PAH in 200 women from two cities in the Ukraine. A pilot study in the USA has indicated possibleadverse effects of high exposure to pol ycyclic organic matter on birth weight, prematurity and fetal death, which the aut hors suggest should be further examined to identify specific hazardous air pollutants (Vassilev et al. , 2001 a,b). As with studies on cigarette smokers, evidence from these studies is difficult to interpret because of the possible or known co-exposure to other pollutants. Thus the data from animals and humans are insufficient for risk assessment. Although adverse effects on reproduction and developmen t in animals have generally been seen only at relatively high doses of benzo[ a]pyrene (compared to doses inducing carcinogenic effects), the experimental database for oral risk assessment is sparse and NOAELs for reproductive and developmenta l effects have not been established.A116Table 2.5.1 Effects of benzo[ a]pyrene on fertility in experimental animals Species (strain) Sex/No. per groupRoute of administration Duration, dose Effects Reference Mouse White M 5Diet Up to 30 days before mating, 33, 67, or 133 mg/kg bw/ day NOEL: 150 mg/kg in lumen of testes; number of offspring Rigdon and Neal (1965) Mouse White Swiss F 5-65 Diet 20 days before mating 33, 67, or 133 mg/kg bw/ day NOEL: 150 mg/kg bw per day Parameter: number of offspring Rigdon and Neal (1965) Mouse DBA/2N F 15 Intraperitoneal Day 14 before mating, 10, 100, 200, or 500 mg/kg bw once 10, 100 mg/kg bw: dose- dependent al.

The majority of the reports that ar e quoted and discussed hereafter have been published after the IPCS evaluation of PAH (I PCS, 1998). Whatever the route of exposure, the resulting effects have been considered mostly at the systemic level, very few studieshave looked for alterations of the local gut immune system. Immunosuppression is associated with an increased susceptibility of the exposed individuals to the development of cance rs or of infectious diseases, whereas immunopotentiation results in an increased secr etion of cytokines by immune cells, thus leading to inflammation. This may in tur n, and under specific circumstances, facilitate tumour development, expression of hypersensitivity (allergy, contact hypersensitivity) or auto immunity. Depending on various parameters in the design of the protocol such as route of exposure, end point, high or low leve l of dosage, model used, immunosuppression or immunopotentiation can be observed (Burchie l and Luster, 2001). However, in the available literature, imm unosuppression is the most frequent effect reported after exposure to PAH, immunopotentiation being only reported to occur after either atmospheric or topic exposure, or by using in vitro systems. Most of the reports published in the literature have used either subcutaneous andintraperitoneal injection or inhalation, as th e route of exposure. Immunotoxicity resulting from ingestion of PAH in contaminated food can be considered by taking into account only the experimental studies in which immunotoxicity have been evaluated after oral intake of a diet contaminated with PAH. Alternatively, given the possible links between the various local mucous immune systems, it can be of some interest to consider alterations of the pulmonary immune system that have been observed after inhalati on for assessing the possible impact of ingested PAH on the gut immune system. In addition, because it has been reported that some PAH when taken into the diet may induce DNA adducts in the lungs, translocations from one organ to anothe r may result in \"at distance\" effects. Finally, it must be noted that most of the immunotox ic effects that are reported for PAH are not thought to be due to parent compounds but rather to their reactive epoxide metabolites (Davila 2001).A1242.6.1 Immunosuppressive effects possibly leadin g to either increased susceptibility to cancer or infectious diseases Oral exposure to 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene (gavage with 50 to 150 mg/kg bw in corn oil) induced suppression of the gut-associ ated and splenic mitogen responsiveness of lymphoid cells in female B6C3F1 mi ce. The total administered dose of 7,12- dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene seems to be a more impor tant determinant of immunotoxicity than the length of exposure (Davies et al. , 1991). In the absence of any clinical evidence of toxicity, benzo[ a]pyrene treatment (50 or 100 mg/kg bw per day for 5 days by intraperitoneal injection) of female B6C3F1 mice induced a reduction in the thymic cellularity as well as an alteration of thymocyte differentiation, a reduced cellularity of the bone marrow was also noted (Holladay and Smith, 1995a). The immunosuppressive (to T-ce ll-dependent and -independent antigens) effect of a mixture of 17 congeners including PAH with 2 (indan, naphthalene, 1- administration to B6C3F1 mice. Female mice were gavaged with 0 to 312 mg/kg of the 17 congeners mixture. Immunotox icity was assessed by measuring the effects of the substances on splenocyte responses to sheep red blood cells (a T-cell dependent antigen) and trinitrophenyl-lipopolysaccharide (a T-ce ll independent antigen) using the plaque forming cell (PFC) assay. Both PFC respons es were inhibited, serum anti TNP IgM titers were also reduced. PAH with 4 rings or more were primarily responsible for the effect. (Harper et al. , 1996). Treatment of male Wistar rats by gava ge for 35 days with 3, 10, 30, or 90 mg/kg bw benzo[ a]pyrene (extended OECD 407 protocol) i nduced various immunotoxic effects such as decrease in thymus and lymph nodes weight s, decreased absolute and relative B cell numbers in the spleen, decreased RBC and WBC numbers. Decreased serum IgM and IgA levels were noted after treatment of the animals with 30 and 90 mg/kg, respectively. The highest dose of treatment resulted in a significant decrease of NK cells activity in thespleen. Thymus weight changed and spleen B-cell populations were affected at a dose of 10mg/kg, a level where no overt toxicity was noted (De Jong et al. , 1999).A1252.6.2 Mechanistic studies Two main mechanisms are usually suggested as promoting immunosuppression. One involve the reactivity of PAH with the Ah rece ptor and the other their capacity to modulate the intra cellular calcium concentration of immune cells. In any case, antigen and mitogen receptor signaling pathways are altered (Burch iel and Luster, 2001) lead ing to proliferation and/or death (apoptosis) of immune cells. Role of the Aromatic Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) Although broadly recognized, the importance of the role of the AhR may vary given the PAH in cause. As an example, it has been shown that bone marrow stromal cell CYP1B1 metabolism of 7,12- dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene, but not required a]anthracene-induced pre B-cell apoptosis (Heidel et al. , 1999). As it is the case with dioxins, the immunosuppr essive effect of PAH is dependent on their capacity to bind the Aromatic Hydrocarbon Receptor (Silkworth et al. , 1984; Silkworth et al., 1995; Quadri et al. , 2000). As controlled by the AhR, immunotoxicity of PAH can be attributed to induction of apoptosis in bone marrow derived pre-B cells (Near et al. , 1999). This apoptosis closely resembles the proce ss by which developing immune systems are purged of pathologic auto immune lymphocytes. (Mann et al. , 1999). Using a bone marrow derived pre-B cell line (BU-11) cultured on a monolayer of the AhR+ bone marrow derived stromal cell line (BMS2), it has been shown that pre B-cell death is controlled by the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor/transcription factor (AhR ) and/or genes regulated by the AhR (Near, et al. , 1999). In a mitogenesis assay and pro liferation; dibenz[ a,c]anthracene an thracene not immunotoxic at the concentrations tested. Using the same assay system, alpha-naphthof lavone, an Ah receptor antagonist and an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 was able to the immunosuppressive of benzo[ a]pyrene and 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene but not 3-methylcholanthrene which indicated a different mechanism of action (Davila et al. , 1996) Role of Ca++ Intracellular Ca++ concentration signaling is often associated with cell proliferation and cell death (apoptosis) in lymphocytes (Krieger et al. , 1994; Davila et al. , 1995). It should be noted that alterations in calcium mobilization have mostly been observed in in vitro studies.A126When added at a dose of 10micromolar for 16 min. in the culture medium, various PAH have been shown to increase the cytosolic Ca++ concentration in the HPB-ALL human T- cell line. Protein tyrosine kinase activation may partially explain the increase in Ca++ mobilization induced by PAH. Th e increase in intracellular Ca++, whereas PAH with Ca++ increase in the HPB-ALL human cell line. (Krieger et al. , 1994). A similar observation has been reported with human peri pheral blood mononuclear cells (Mounho et al. vitro metabolic bi oactivation of benzo[ a]pyrene is important in its capacity to mediate disruption of Ca++ homeostasis through mediating ry anodine receptor dysfunction, the associated the o-quinone metabolite benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-dione (Pessah et o ffsprings after treatment in utero Benzo[ a]pyrene given to pregnant rats on day 15 of gestation caused a relative decrease in the number but not in the binding affinity of thymic glucocortico\u00efds receptors in theoffsprings. This suggests binding to the pr e-encoded hormone receptors and interference with receptor maturation (Csaba and Inczefi-Gonda, 1992). Fetus from pregnant mice injected intr a-peritoneally with 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene at 10 or 25 mg/kg daily on gestational days 13 to 17 were collected on day 18. Significant thymic atrophy was noted and fetal liver cellu larity was reduced to 80 and 49% of control. The percentage of liver cells expressing CD 44 antigen was reduced by 77% of control by treatment with 25 mg 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene. The percentage of Mac-1+ and CD45+ fetal liver cells was re duced at both 10 and 25 mg/kg dose level by 61 and 50% and 45 and 40%, respectively (H olladay and Smith, 1995b). Progeny from benzo[ a]pyrene exposed (150 \u00b5g/g bw) primiparous mice injected during the second trimester of pregnancy may be immunol ogically compromised as a consequence of the profound alterations that are observed in the maternal T-cell populations in the thymus and the spleen. In mice, progeny from benzo[ a]pyrene exposed (150 mg/kg bw) primiparous mothers, injected during the second trimester of pregnancy, were severely compromisedimmunologically. Immunodeficiency (abnormalities in the T cell-mediated responses causedA127by disruption of T cell differentiation) occurred early after birth (1 week) and persisted for 18 months (Urso and Johnson, 1987; Urso et al. , 1992; 1994). After 12-18 months the progeny developed high incidences of hepatomas, 1999, 2000). When benzo[ a]pyrene was administered postnatally (after 1 week) both immune suppression and tumour incidence were substantiallylower (Urso and Gengozian, 1982). Benzo[ a]pyrene-induced splenic disruption could be due to changes in the differentiation potential of T precursor cells (Urso and Johnson, 1988; Rodriguez et al. , 1999 and 2000). Mice exposed in utero to benzo[ a]pyrene have a persistent defective T-cell di fferentiation which results in an abnormal T-cell behaviour possibly leading to a defective recognition of antigens (Urso et al. , 1994). Whether prenatal exposure to certain immunotox icants such as PAH may play a role in postnatal expression of autoimmunity in humans is still discussed (Holladay, 2001). 2.6.4 Observations in humans The status of humoral immunity has been evaluated in 274 male workers in Poland including 199 coke oven workers and 76 co ld-rolling mill workers. Coke oven workers were exposed chronically to complex mixtures of air pollutants composed primarily ofPAH. Exposure was 3-5 magnitudes higher in the coke oven group than in the cold-rolling one, it ranged from 0.2 to 50 \u00b5g benzo[ a]pyrene/m 3. As compared to the cold-rolling mill employees, a marked depression of mean IgG and IgA was observed in the coke ovengroup together with a trend to decreased IgM and increased IgE values (Szceklik et al. , 1994). In an other study conducted on 24 male coke oven workers compared to 20 healthy workers without any known history of exposure to P AH, a series of immunological tests were carried out on blood samples. The total dust exposure ranged from 3.0 to 52.2 \u00b5g/m3 of dust, PAH most present benzo[ e]pyrene and indeno1,2,3- significant but slight. They include: decreased mitogenic r eaction of T-cells to phytohemagglutinin, reduced expression of the interleukin-2 rece ptor, impairment of B-cell activity (decreased proliferation and low synthesis rate of IgM) and a decreased oxidative burst in monocytes after challenge. No significant differences were observed between the number oflymphocytic subpopulations in peripheral bl ood and of serum (Winker et al. , 1997).A128In a report on 16 male workers employed in road paving operations, PAH exposure was assessed using urinary 1-hydroxy- pyrene levels; it was found to be significantly higher than in 12 unexposed male controls. The CD4+ percentage and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio were significantly higher in the PAH exposed group, the percentages of CD8+ and CD19+ cells being unchanged. A significant enhancement in serum IgM levels and the percentage of monocytes was noted in the workers co mpared to the control group (Karakaya et al. , 1999). 2.6.5 Immunostimulation leading to allergy or contact hypersensitivity Exposure to low doses of PAH may augmenT-cell signaling pathways, resulting in immune enhancement or an adjuvant effect (Burchiel and Luster, 2001). The metabolic status of the host seems to be a key determinant of individual susceptibility to the development of allergic contact derma titis. Contact hypersensitivity to 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene was observed only in strains of mice that are cap able to metabolize the compound, inhibitors of PAH metabolism reduced DMBA contact hypersensitivity. Depletion of CD8 but not CD4 T-cell populations inhibited contact sensitivity to 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene. It was also observed that among PAH, only those capable to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase were immunogenic (Anderson a]pyrene with the allergen have an adjuvant activitie s on the production of anti IgE antibodies to ovalbumin and Japanese cedar po llen allergen in mice (Suzuki et al. , 1993). Diesel exhaust particulates enhance eosinophil adhesion to na sal epithelial cells and cause degranulation (Terada et al. , 1997) and enhanced human IgE production (Takaneka et al. , 1995). Diesel exhaust particles, their organic extract (in methylene chloride) and the core carbon particles co injected with ovalbumin in mice induced a rapid and marked elevation of albumin specific IgE, IgG1 and also IgG2 a compared with albumin alone. Phenantrene (the most prevalent PAH in diesel exhaust particles) and anthrace ne are both capable of enhancing IGE and IgG 1 production (Heo et al. , 2001). Organic extracts from diesel exhausts e nhances mRNA expression and the production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy subjects of various chemokines involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells (IL-8, MCP-1, and RANTES) (Fahy et al. , 1999). In vitro treatment of human T-cells with pyrene induces the transcription of IL-4 messenger RNA and expression of IL-4 a potent mediator in allergic diseases in primary human T- cells. Pyrene but not related PAH enhanced ba sal transcription of the human and mouse IL- 4 promoter (Bommel et al. , 2000).A1292.7 Genotoxicity of ltiple metabolic transf tives (e.g. diolepoxides, quinones, inte raction with nucleophilic centers of macromolecules. The mechanism of mutagenicity of PAH has been mainly investigated using benzo[ a]pyrene and benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BaPDE) as BaPDE to nucleic acids mainly occurres amino groups of purines (Meehan et al. , 1977). The mutational spectrum induced by BaPDE in bacteria shows a prevalence of G>T transversions, due to the rotationof adducted guanine to syn and its pairing with adenine (Eisenstadt et al. , 1982). A similar spectrum of base-pair substitu tions is induced by BaPDE in mammalian cells in vitro (Keohavong and Thilly, 1992; Yang et al. , 1999), and by benzo[ a]pyrene in vivo in transgenic mice (Kohler et al. , 1991; Miller et al. , 2000) and in the Ha-ras oncogene in mouse skin tumours (Wei et al. , 1999; Prahalad et al. , 1997). Molecular analysis of p53 mutations in lung cancers of smokers shows a similar prevalence of G>T transversions(Hainaut and Pfeifer, 2001), possibly reflectin g the contribution of PAH to tobacco smoke carcinogenesis. In addition to base pair substitutions, bulky adducts of PAH to DNA bases can induce frameshift mutations, deletions, S-pha se arrest, strand breakage and a variety of chromosomal alterations. 2.7.2 Genotoxicity of selected polycyclic aromatic compounds The genotoxic profiles of the 33 non-hete rocyclic polycyclic aromatic compounds considered by IPCS in 1998 have been update d and reevaluated on the basis of literature data available at the Environm ental Mutagen Information Center2. Qualitative results obtained in in vitro and in vivo assays addressing different end-points are summarized in table 2.7.1. Overall evaluati ons on genotoxicity of individual compounds are listed in table 2.7.2. For classification, th e same criteria used under the Directive 91/325/EEC (Labelling Guide) were applied here in. In practice, only PAH with evidence of mutagenicity/genotoxicity (e.g. DNA binding) in vivo were evaluated as established genotoxic agents. 2 Available on and were classified as \"genotoxic\" (table 2.7.2). These PAH may repr esent a priority group for the assessment of the risks of genotoxic and carcinogenic effects. Concerning the induction of germ cell effects, benzo[ a]pyrene, benzo[ a]anthracene and chrysene gave positive results in chromosome aberrations and/or dominant lethals inrodents. No quantitative estimation of the genetic risk associated to PAH exposure can be done on the basis of such data, which do not co ncern transmissible effects. However, the relatively high dosages required to elicit a si gnificant positive response in these assays (in the order of hundreds of mg/kg bw) suggest that the risk of transmissible effects due to the dietary intake of minute amounts of PAH is low. For other six compounds (anthranthene, benzo[ ghi]fluoranthene, of genotoxicity is limited and mainly based on results obtained in in vitro systems. Further studies, especially in vivo , are warranted to clarify the genotoxic potential of these PAH. Equivocal or contradictory data are availa ble for another eight four compounds (anthracene, benzo[ a]fluorene, naphthalene, pyrene) gave totally or mainly negative results in a variety of s hort term tests. Although the strength of the supporting evidence is variable, in first instan ce these four PAH can be considered as not genotoxic or to pose a relatively mi nor risk of irreversible effects. 2.7.3 Mutagenicity of PAH mixtures PAH contaminated foodstuffs have not been di rectly evaluated in mutagenicity studies, possibly because of practical problems related to their occurrence in relatively tiny amounts. On the other hand, numerous mutageni city studies have been carried out on environmental samples containing complex PAH mixtures, such as air particulate,combustion emissions and water sediment extracts. However, in only a few cases has the mutagenicity of crude PAH fractions been correlated to the content of genotoxic PAH. In coal gasification residues, for example, both increasing (Donelly et al. , 1996; Booth et al. , 1998) and decreasing (Donnelly et al. , 1993; Randerath et al. , benzo[ a]pyrene (or benzo[ a]pyrene-equivalents) content have been observed, highlighting the difficulties in the toxicological evaluation of complex mixtures, where the final genotoxic effect may be m odulated by toxic or inhibitory components present in the mixture. For this reason, caution should be used in the quantitative comparison of genotoxic potencies of different PAH mixtures to extrapolate cancer risks according to the so-called comparative potency approach (Lewtas, 1988). 2.7.4 Relationship of genotoxic ity with carcinogenicity Several experimental data show a mech anistic link between DNA adducts formation, mutations, and cancer outcome following PAH exposure (You et al. , 1994; Nesnow et al. , 1995; 1998). Also the evidences of genotox icity and carcinogenicity of the compounds considered in this report show considerab le overlapping (table 2.7.3), highlighting the pivotal role of genetic alterations in the mechanism of carcinogenicity of PAH. However,even though genotoxicity is a most plausible mechanism for PAH carcinogenicity, the correlation between DNA adduct, mutagene sis and carcinogenesis of PAH is not straightforward. In fact, comparable levels of DNA adducts (Goldstein et al. , 1998) and gene mutations (Hakura et al. , 2000) have been detected in tumour target and non target tissues of mice treated with benzo[ a]pyrene, suggesting that genotoxic end-points alone may not adequately predict tumour outcome due to organ/tissue-specific mechanisms.Moreover, the carcinogenicity of PAH is m odulated by the promoting activity of parent compounds which may play a major role, at least at the high doses applied in cancer bioassays. Therefore, mutagenicity/genotoxicit y data should be used with caution in cancer risk characterization. On the other hand, it is conceivable that at the low doses corresponding to PAH uptake from air or food , the initiating effect of PAH may be more important than the promoting activity, and that in vivo mutagenicity data might bemodelled to estimate cancer al. , 2001).A132Table 2.7.1 Synopsis of genotoxicity test with selected hydrocarbons common name (CAS no.)gene mutation in bacteriaDNA damage/ repair in vitrogenotoxicity in lower eukaryotesgene mutation in mammalian cells in vitroin vitro cytogenetics in mammalian cellsDNA binding in mammalian cells in vivomutagenicity/ in vivo (4) neg c (1) acenaphthylene (208-96-8)neg a (1, 3) pos b pos j, n (1) inconcl i m (6) pos m (7)mainly neg o,p,q,r (1)neg w,y (1) benz[ a]anthracene (56-55-3)pos a, b (1) pos d, e (1) pos i (1) neg j (1) pos l, m, n (1) neg m (6, 11)mainly pos o, p (1, 12)inconclusive t u (1, 13)pos c (1, 10) pos (1) pos w, x (1) benzo[ b]fluoranthene (205-99-2)pos a (1) pos d (1) neg o (1) weakly pos p (12)pos c (1, 10) pos (1, 14-16) pos w (1) benzo[ j]fluoranthene (205-82-3)pos a, b (1) pos d (1) weakly pos p (12)pos c (1) pos (1) benzo[ k]fluoranthene (207- 08-9)pos a (1) weakly pos p (12)pos c (1) pos (1) benzo[ ghi]fluoranthene (203-12-3)pos a (1) pos b (17)pos d (1) p (12) benzo[ a]fluorene (238-84-6)neg a (18, 19) neg d (20) (12)A133common name (CAS no.)gene mutation in bacteriaDNA damage/ repair in vitrogenotoxicity in lower eukaryotesgene mutation in mammalian cells in vitroin vitro cytogenetics in mammalian cellsDNA binding in mammalian cells in vivomutagenicity/ genotoxicity in vivo benzo[ p (12) benzo[ ghi]perylene (191-24-2)pos a, b (1) pos d (1) weak pos p (12) pos (1, 21) benzo[ c]phenanthrene (195-19-7)pos a (1) pos d (22) pos p (12) weak pos (22) benzo[ a]pyrene (50-32-8)pos a, b (1) neg i (1)pos d, e (1) pos g, m, n (1) neg f, j, l (1) pos o, p, q, r (1) pos s, t, u (1) pos c (1) pos (1) pos v, w, y, z (1) neg x (1) benzo[ e]pyrene (192-97-2)pos/neg a (1) neg i (1)weak pos/neg d (1)neg n (1) pos p (1, 12) neg o, q (1)neg s, t (1) neg u (8)inconclusive (1)pos/neg w (1) chrysene (218-01-9)pos a, b (1, 23) neg i (1)pos d (1, 24) neg e (1)neg f, j (1) neg m (25)pos d (1, 12) neg o, r (1)weak pos t (26) pos c (1) pos (1) pos w, x (1) coronene (191-07-1)pos a (1) neg b (1)neg d (1) neg (12) cyclopenta[ cd]pyrene (27208-37-3)pos a, b (1) pos o,p (1, 12, 27, 28)pos t (1) pos c (1) pos (29-31) dibenz[ a,h]anthracene (53-70-3)pos a, b (1) pos d, e (1) neg f (1) neg m (6)pos o (1) pos p (12)pos u (9) pos c (1, 10) pos (1, 31) pos w (1, 32, 33) dibenzo[ a,e]pyrene (192-65-4)pos a (1) pos b (34)pos p (12, 34) pos (1) dibenzo[ a,h]pyrene (189-64-0)pos a (1) neg b (34)pos d (1) pos p (34) pos t (1) pos (35) dibenzo[ a,i]pyrene (189-55-9)pos a (1) pos b (34)pos d (1) neg e (1)weak pos p (34) pos (1) pos w (1)A134common name (CAS no.)gene mutation in bacteriaDNA damage/ repair in vitrogenotoxicity in lower eukaryotesgene mutation in mammalian cells in vitroin vitro cytogenetics in mammalian cellsDNA binding in mammalian cells in vivomutagenicity/ genotoxicity in vivo dibenzo[ a,l]pyrene (191-30-0)pos a (1) pos b (34)pos d (1) pos p (12, 34) pos c (36) pos (37, 38) fluoranthene (206-44-0)mainly pos a (1) pos b (1)mainly neg d (1) pos e (39)mainly neg p (1, 12) pos o (1, 39)pos t (1, 39) pos (40) neg v, w (1, 41) fluorene (86-73-7)neg a, b (1) neg d (4) neg e (1)neg n (1) neg/pos p (1, 42)pos s (1) pos c (1) indeno[1,2,3- cd]pyrene (193-39-5)pos a (1) pos d (1) weak pos p (12) pos (1, 43) 5-methylchrysene (3697-24-3)pos a (44) weak pos p (12) pos (1, 15, 31, 45, 46) 1-methylphenathrene (832-69-9)pos a b (1) pos e (1) pos o (1) pos p (12)pos c (1) naphthalene (91-20-3)neg a, b (1) neg d (1) pos m (7) pos s (1) neg w (1) phenanthrene (85-01-8)pos/neg a (1) pos/neg d (1) neg f, j (1) neg m (7)pos/neg p (1, 12) neg o, q (1)neg t (1) mainly neg s (1) neg u (1)neg/margilally pos w (1) pyrene (129-00-0)pos/neg a (1) pos b (1) neg i (48)neg d (1) mainly neg e (1)neg g, h, j (1, 48) neg l, m (6, 48)neg o (1, 47) mainly neg p (1, 12, 47) pos q (1)mainly neg s, t (1) neg u (1, 8, 9)neg (1, 15) neg v, w, y, z (1, 48) triphenylene (217-59-4)pos a (1) pos d (1) pos p (1, 12) pos c (1)A135Notes table 2.7.1 pos/neg: contrasting results reported in independent studies; Assay codes: a, reverse mutation (Ames test, several strains); b, forward mutation (strain TM677); c, DNA binding in mammalian cells in vitro ; d, DNA damage/repair in bacteria; e, DNA damage/repair in mammalian cells; f, mitotic gene conversion in yeast; g, mitotic recombination in yeast; h, forward mutation i n yeast; i, host mediated cytogenetic effects in somatic x, cytogenetic effects germ cells; y, sperm abnormalities; z, d ominant lethals.

It is unequivocal that tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease andthere is also some evidence that occupa tional exposure to combustion products including PAH might also be associated with an increas ed risk of cardiovasc ular disease (Str\u00f6m et microsomes from rat aorta transformed benzo[ a]pyrene into active carcinogenic and toxic metabolites (Thirman et al. , 1994). In humans, PAH adducts have been detected in the endothelium of the internal mammary artery of smokers. DNA adducts has also been detected by 32P-postlabelling in smooth muscle cells of human abdominal aorta affected by arteriosclerotic lesions. The levels of adducts were correlated to current smoking and other atherogenic risk factors. In individuals with the null GSTM1 had higher adduct levels in both non-smokers and smokers (Izzotti et al. , 2001a). It is not established wh ether the DNA adducts are formed from PAH. Similar adducts in the aorta was al so observed in smoke exposed rats (Izzotti et al.,2001b). PAH adducts determined by immunohi stochemistry were also found in the endothelium of microve ssels in the muscular layer of large blood vessels (Zhang et al. , 1998). In human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured in vitro, and induced with - naphthoflavone, benzo[ a]pyrene induced DNA damage as measured by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (Annas et al. , 2002). Benzo[ a]pyrene and 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene caused a decreased secretion of newly synthesised collagen from bovine arterial smooth muscle cells in vitro without reducing the cell number. Total cellular DNA was decreased and the relative collagen secretion increased.When the cells had been preincubated with platelet factors similar effects were observed. Benzo[ a]pyrene and 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene could also induce cell death and release of mitogenic factors, dependingen on the concentration and mode of administration(Stavenow and Pessah-Rasmussen, 1988). Dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene induced proliferation of smooth muscle celles. This effect was inde pendent of the Ah-receptor (Pessah-Rasmussen al. , 1991). transferase (GST) negative human fibroblasts produced relatively more collagene than GST positive fibroblasts ( Pessah-Rasmussen et al. , 1992). Although PAH related adducts have been obs erved in blood vessels in humans and some effects of PAH on vascular cells in vitro , this does not prove that the increased cardiovascular risk following tobacco smoki ng and occupational exposure to combustion products is due to exposure to PAH.A1412.9 Observations in humans 2.9.1 Biomarkers of exposure to PAH Several methods have been de veloped to assess internal exposure to PAH after exposure in the environment and in workplaces. In most studies, metabolites of PAH were measured in urine, 1-hydroxypyrene being widely used. It should be noted that the concentration or excretion of parent PAH compound or meta bolites in body fluids or urine not only is dependent on the external exposure, but also on absorption, biotransformation and excretion, which can vary considerably betw een individuals. Genotoxic endpoints of PAH have been used, but they are unspecific a nd will not be further discussed. Adducts of benzo[ a]pyrene with DNA in peripheral lymphocyt es, and other tissues and with proteins such as albumin have been used as an indicator of the dose of reactive metabolite. Urinary metabolites The metabolites mostly and 1-hydroxypyrene. Also total thioether excretion has b used, but this is unspecific. 1-Hydroxypyrene 1-Hydroxypyrene, a metabolite of pyrene, has been widely used as urinary biomarker of PAH exposure since 1986. Its advantages are that pyrene is present in all PAH mixtures at relatively high concentrations (2-10%) of the total PAH, and in certain environments the pyrene content of the total PAH is fairly constant. However, the relationship between pyrene and benzo[ a]pyrene may vary considerably beteen different exposures. Coal tar contains 2-10 % pyrene and 0.4-0.6 % benzo[ a]pyrene. In studies at different workplaces, a strong correlation was found between the pyre ne concentrations in air and those of benzo[ a]pyrene, other selected PAH, and total PAH (Jongeneelen et al. , 1990; Tolos et Quinlan Pyrene is metabolised predo minantly to 1-hydroxypyrene, which can be measured easily. In contrast to other PAH metabolites, which are excreted mainly in faeces, 1-hydroxypyrene is excreted in urine. The background concentrations of 1-hydroxyp yrene in urine of persons from different countries range from 0.06 to 0.23 \u00b5mol/mol creatinine (Kang et al. , 1995). For non- smokers and non-occupationally exposed indivi duals, food accounted for 99% of the total daily pyrene intake (Van Rooij et al. , 1994a, cited in IPCS, 1998). Five volunteers who ate low-PAH meals and high-PAH meals showed 100- to 250-fold increases in benzo[ a]pyrene dose, accompanied by a four- to 12-fold increase in 1-hydroxypyrene excretion in urine(Buckley and Lioy, 1992, cited in IPCS, 1998). Ten volunteers eating charbroiled beef for five days had a 10-80 fold increase in 1-OH- pyrene glucuronide excretion in urine above background returning to background within 24-72 hours (Kang et al 1995). The intake ofpyrene from cigarette smoking (12 nmol/day) is about the same as the dietary intake from normal food (9.4 nmol/day). Tobacco smokers who are not otherwise exposed to PAH haveA142about twice the level of 1-hydroxypyrene in their urine as non-smokers (Jongeneelen et , 1994a; Levin et al. , 1995, all cited in IPCS, 1998). 1-Hydroxypyrene concentrations in the urine of persons occupationally exposed to PAH at various workplaces are usually increased. De rmal uptake can be a significant pathway in many cases. 1-Hydroxypyrene cannot predict exposure to benzo[ a]pyrene or other carcinogenic PAH as the relative content of these two compounds can vary considerably. DNA adducts DNA adducts with reactive metabolites (mainly diol epoxides) of benzo[ a]pyrene and other PAH have been identified in humans exposed to smoking or living in polluted areas in numerous studies (Kyrtopoulos et al. , 2001). PAH- DNA adducts has also been detected in peripheral white blood cells following human exposure to charbroiled meat (Kang et al. , 1995). Cigarette smokers have high er levels of adducts with PAH in their lungs than non- smokers. As binding of electrophilic PAH me tabolites to DNA is thought to be a key step in the initiation of cancer, measurement of DNA adducts could be an indicator of exposure to PAH and also of the dose of the ultimate reactive metabolite. An increased lung cancer risk has been found among smoking individua ls with a higher level of aromatic DNA adducts in white blood cells (Tang et al 2001). The methods for measuring DNA adducts in clude immunoassays Direct comparisons of adduct levels determined by different techniques may be misleading, however, because different end-points are measured. In the general population the levels of DNA adduct in control subjects range from 0.2 to about 10 adducts per 108 nucleotides in leukocytes (De ll'Omo and Lauwerys, 1993). There are many studies on the effect of adduct level in leukocytes of tobacco smokers and also on populations living in areas polluted by industry; the latter with addu ct levels up to 5-13 adducts per 108 nucleotides. Eating charcoal-grilled be ef resulted in a 1.9-3.8-fold increase above the individual base line adduct levels in four of 10 subjects (Kang et al. , 1995). Workers exposed to PAH in general had elevat ed levels of adduct s (5-70 adducts per 108 nucleotides) (IPCS, 1998). DNA-adducts and 1-hydroxypyrene In general, exposures that lead to the excre tion of high concentrations of 1-hydroxypyrene in urine also lead to elevated DNA adduct levels in white blood cells and significant correlations have been found. Although the concentrations of PAH that occur under different exposure conditions differ by orders of magnitude, the differences in DNA adduct levels are quite small, in contrast to the results of experiments on excretion of 1- hydroxypyrene. In all populations studied, exposed by inhalation or orally, there is substantial inter-individual vari ation in PAH-DNA adduct levels, which is greater than thatA143described for 1-hydroxypyrene excretion in urine. This is probably due to differences e.g. in biotransformation, excretion, DNA adduct re moval etc. (Autrup, 2000, Lee et al 2002). Such interindividual variation result in a wide overlap in the ranges of values between exposed and unexposed subjects in all studies. Protein adducts Because genotoxic compounds can bind to haem oglobin and serum protein, the assessment of PAH-blood protein adducts has also been considered as a possible marker of exposure to PAH. However, studies show conflicting re sults using such adducts as a marker of exposure. Biomarkers and exposure via inhalation and diet In many cases exposure to PAH from food is a confounder when using biomarkers in the evaluation of exposure to PAH by inhalati on. Although increased levels in urinary 1- hydroxypyrene have been found in people livin g in polluted areas exposure from ambient air, large changes in atmospheric levels of PAH is not reflected in urinary 1-hydroxypyreneand DNA-adducts. This indicates that ambient air is relatively unimportant in comparison with dietary PAH and tobacco sm oking (Phillips, 1999; Kyrtopoulos et al. , 2001). In a study of forest fire-fighters in the USA leve ls of PAH-DNA adducts in blood cells were not found to correlate with recent fire-fighting activity, but with recent consumption of charbroiled meat. Surprisingly the PAH DNA-adduct levels were lower in US army personnel fighting oil field fires in Kuwait, po ssibly because a lower intake of charbroiled meat (Phillips, 1999). 2.9.2 Effects of PAH exposures observed in humans Unfortunately there are almost none publis hed studies on health effects in humans following oral exposure to PAH. In th e majority of studies humans have been occupationally exposed to PAH via inhalation and in a few studies the exposure has been dermal. There is little information on human exposure to single, pure polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (PAH) except for accidental expos ure to naphthalene and some data from defined short-term studies of volunteers whic h are not relevant for the human exposure to PAH via food. All other reports are on exposure to mixtures of PAH, which also contained other potentially carcinogenic ch emicals, in occupational a nd environmental situations. Information on the health effects of these mixtures is in practically all cases confined to their carcinogenic potential, for which there is evidence from a number of epidemiologicalstudies, especially for lung cancer and, in some cases, cancers of the skin and of the urinary bladder. Oral exposure to PAH Only one fully reported study on oral PAH expos ure and health effects has been identified (Lopez-Abente et al. , 2001). In some rural areas in Spain wine has traditionally been stored in leather bottles sealed with a tar-like substance (i.e. pez) obtained through boiling andA144destilation of fir and pine w ood, and which contain PAH. In order to assess this exposure with regard to risk of gastric cancer, 59 case s and 53 controls all of who were residents in the Province of Soria, were selected from a case control multi-center study from Spain on gastric cancer. The multi-center study consis ted of 354 incident cases and 354 controls matched by age, sex and place of residence. The exposure to wine stored in tar impregnated leather bottles was assessed by a self-ad ministered questionnair e. A total of 85 questionnaires were returned of which 78, i.e. 38 cases and 40 controls, could be analysed. In the analysis odds ratios (OR) were calculate d by logistic regression taking into account also variables that had been found to be asso ciated with gastric cancer in the multi-center study. Several variables for consumption of wine from leather bottles were reported.Although an increased OR was reported, th e study population was to small to achieve statistically significant increases. An exception was consumption of more than 2 litres of wine/week, which appeared to be associated with gastric cancer particularly in males ORand 95 % confidence interval = 10.5, 1.13- 97.76, p value for trend 0.02. No change in effect estimator was observed upon inclusion of other risk variables in the model. Studies on intake of cooked meat In a published abstract Sinha and co-workers (2001) described the risk of colorectal adenomas and dietary benzo[ a]pyrene intake in a case-control study of 146 newly diagnosed cases and 226 controls. In this stud y dietary intake of red meat, well-done red meat, grilled red meat and exposure to heterocyclic were estimated using a food frequency questionnaire with detailed questions also on meat-cooking methods in combination with a heterocyclic amine and benzo[ a]pyrene database ( Kazerouni et al. , 2001). Increased risks were found with a high intake of red meat, well-done and grilled and heterocyclic amines. The median (10th and 90th percentile) exposure to benzo[ a]pyrene in the controls was 5 ng (0.2-66) ng/day from meat and 73(35-140) ng/day from all foods. In cases, median benzo[ a]pyrene intake was 17 (0.5-101) ng/day from meat and 76 (44-163) ng/day from all foods When multivariate analys is were carried out adjusting for MeIQx and established colorectal adenoma risk factors, the odds ratios (95 % confidence interval) for dietary benzo[ a]pyrene from meat with the first quintile as the referent group were: 1.5 (0.7-3.4, 2.0 (0.9-4.3), 2.6 (1.2-5.7) and 3.3 (1.5-7.4) for the sec ond, third, fourth and fifth quintile. The p-value for trend was 0.01. Increased risk of colorectal adenomas was also associated with benzo[ a]pyrene intake estimated from a ll foods, p-value for trend 0.01. In a short feeding study ten healthy adults were fed a diet enriched with chargrilled meat for 7 days (Fontana et al. , 1999). The meat contained from 8.35 to 15.64 ng benzo[ a]pyrene/ g and also heterocyclic amines : 100 and 50 ng PhIP/g. Whereas the intake of PhIP was estimated to 13-28 \u00b5g/day the intake of benzo[ a]pyrene was not given. The chargrilled meat intake resulted in an induction of CYP1A enzymes both in the liver and the small intestine. No induction of CYP3A4, CYP3A5 or P-glycoprotein in the small or large intestine and CYP3A4 in the liver was observed. There was an inverse correlation betweenthe level of PAH DNA adducts in peri pheral blood cells and both liverA145CYP1A2 activity and enterocyte CYP1A1 prot ein concentration on day 11. It is not clear whether the enzyme induction was due to hete rocyclic amines or PAH as Sinha and co- workers (1994) in a previous study feeding of pan-fried meat containing high levels of heterocyclic amines, but unchanged and low levels of PAH, also found an induction of CYP1A2. PAH in cigarette smoke Tobacco smoke contains a mixture of PAH in addition to numerous other carcinogens. For example levels of 11 ng per cigarette benzo[ a]pyrene were found in mainstream smoke and 103 ng per cigarette in sidestream smoke; th e corresponding values were 6.8 and 76 ng per cigarette for benzo[ e]pyrene, 20 and 497 ng per cigarette for chrysene and triphenylene, and 13 and 204 ng per cigarette for benz[ a]anthracene for mainstream and sidestream smoke, respectively (Grimmer et al. , 1988). Other data on intake by smoking are reported in the section 'Intake estimates'. A large volume of literature exists on the effects of tobacco smoke on human lungs (seeIARC, 1986). On the basis of large body of studi es in many countries, cigarette smoke has been shown to be by far the most important si ngle factor contributing to the development of lung cancer. Other types of cancer caused by cigarette smoking include cancers of the oral cavities, larynx, pharynx, oesophagus, bladder, renal pelvis, renal adenocarcinoma, and pancreas. Based upon studies using implant ation into the lungs of rats Grimmer et al. , 1988 (cited in IPCS, 1998) estimated that PAH with f our or more rings were responsible for 83% of the total carcinogenic activity of sidestream smoke (IPCS,1998). PAH and occupational exposure Many workplaces have atmospheres with h eavy loads of PAH. In general, industrial workers using or producing coal or coal products are exposed to mixtures of PAH The first cancer that might be attributed to an occupational exposure was reported by Pott in 1775, who described the susceptibility of Englis h chimney sweeps to scrotal cancer (Pott, 1775, cited in IPCS, 1998); a second publis by Butlin in 1892 (cited in IPCS, 1998). Epidemiological studies have been conducted on workers exposed at coke ovens in coal coking and coal gasification, at asphalt works, at foundries, and at aluminium smelters and to diesel exhaust. Details of the most recent and most important cohort and case-control studies are given in IPCS (1998) (see also IARC 1983, 1984, 1985). Most important for an evaluation of the possibl e risk of cancer due to exposure to PAH are studies of workers exposed at coke ovens in co ke plants or in coal-gasification processes. Particularly at coke ovens, the PAH concentra tions are considerable, with levels up to 200 /g109/m3 total PAH, but values between some tens of /g109/m3 are more common; extreme values up to 1 mg/m3 total PAH and 100-300 \u00b5g/m3 benzo[ a]pyrene have been reported in the 60s and 70s in eastern European countries (IARC, 1984). Values reported from coalA146gasification plants are lower. In most epidemiological studies on PAH exposed workers, however, the concentrations to which workers were exposed are not available. Significantly increased risks of lung cancer was found am ong coke oven workers including workers in coal-gasification particularly in the large cohort studies (IPCS, 1998). Several epidemiological studies have been performed on the potential risks of handling asphalt. In the meta-analysis of Partanen and Boffetta (1994, cited in IPCS, 1998), increased risks for lung tumours were seen for both pavers and roofers; tumours of the stomach, bladder, and skin and leukaemia were also observed. Workers are exposed dermally to very high concentrations of PAH when impregnating wood with creosote. Increased risk for skin and lip cancer has been observed. Since the work involves some time outdoors, it cannot be ruled out that exposure to sunlight contributed to the risks for cancers of the skin and lip. The PAH concentrations in iron, steel, and ot her ferroalloy foundries reach levels of 50 \u00b5g/m3 and that of benzo[ a]pyrene about 10 \u00b5g/m3. Increased mortality from lung cancer has been observed consistently in many studies of foundry workers (Andjelkovich et al. , 1990, cited in IPCS, 1998). Information on the possible risks for cancer due to exposure to PAH can also be obtained from studies of workers in aluminium plants. During S\u00f6derberg electrolysis, workers may be exposed to 3-35 \u00b5g/m3 benzo[ a] pyrene; workers in the to 0.4- 1.2 \u00b5g/m3 benzo[ a] pyrene. An increased risk for lung cancer, but also urinary bladder cancer has been found in several studies with exposure in a S\u00f6derber g potroom. The risk of bladder cancer may be due to exposure not only to PAH but also to aromatic amines, which have been detected in the potrooms. Increased risks for lung cancer were found in several studies of workers exposed to diesel exhausts (WHO, 1996). In comparison with the occupations described above, the concentrations of PAH to which these worker s are exposed are usually relatively low. The benzo[ a]pyrene concentrations in automobile repair shops and garages reach about 70 ng/m3, and truck drivers are exposed to less than 10 ng/m3. The increased risk is seen for workers in se veral occupations, which have exposure to PAH in common. Although other carcinogenic chemical s were present, they differed with each occupation. Furthermore, tobacco smoking is a confounder in several studies, but this factor in general cannot explain the excess risk. Ai rborne high-molecular-mass PAH, which are considered to be the most carcinogenic, are ad sorbed mainly onto par ticulate matter, and it was often difficult to distinguish the toxicological effects caused by particles from thosecaused by the PAH themselves.A147PAH exposure from unvented coal combustion in homes Interdisciplinary studies were conducted to investigate exposure to PAH and the high lung cancer rates in a rural county, Xuan Wei, located in Yunnan Province, China (Mumford et al., 1987, cited in IPCS, 1998). Mortality from lung cancer in this county is five times the Chinese national average, especially among the women, who have the highest rate in China. The mortality rate from lung cancer was correlated with domestic use of 'smoky' coal (medium-volatile bituminous coal with low sul phur and high ash) as fuel for cooking and heating, but not with use of wood or smoke less coal. Monitoring of air during cooking inside the homes showed that women were expos ed to extremely high levels of PAH, with a mean benzo[ a] pyrene concentration of 14.7 \u00b5g/m3, comparable to the levels to which coke-oven workers were exposed. Urine samp les from Xuan Wei residents confirmed that they were exposed to high concentrations of alkylated PAH. Thus, alkylated PAH may play an important role in the etiology of lung cancer in Xuan Wei (Mumford et al. , 1995, cited in IPCS, 1998).

This metabolite has been su ggested to be a diol-epoxide containing a phenolic hydroxyl group situat ed on a ring remote from the diol-epoxide termed a triol epoxide, believed formed fro m phenolic dihydrodiols. Two adducts were isolated following treatment of mouse skin with 3H-chrysene, one with chromatographic properties similar to chrysene anti-1,2-diol-3,4-epoxide adduc ts whilst the second was more polar and resembled products of microsomal metabolism of chrysene-1,2-dihydrodiol or 3- hydroxychrysene, it was postulated to be the result of further metabolism of 9-OH- chrysene-1,2-diol. The metabolis m of chrysene has been studied in a number of biological systems. Benzo[b]fluoranthene Initial studies on benzo[ b]fluoranthene indicated that none of the identified metabolites accounted for the potent tumourigenic activity of bay region metabolite anti- benzo[ b]fluoranthene -9,10-diol-11,12-epoxid e is not primarily responsible for the genotoxicity and the adducts formed in vivo are more polar than those from benzo[ b]fluoranthene-9,10-diol. Metabolism studi es have shown that the principal metabolites following in vitro metabolism of Further studies showed the involvement in tumourigenesis in mouse skin of phenolic dihydrodiols resulted in similar adducts those seen in mouse skin with 5-OH- benzo[ b]fluoranthene-9,10-diol suggesting this is further metabolised to the diol epoxide and guanosine is the principal ba se involved in adduct formation. Dibenzanthracenes. Dibenzanthracenes illustrates the effect that conformational and sp atial arrangements can have on the metabolism and reactivity of PAH. There are differences in mutagenic and carcinogenic have two bay regions but differ in the location of the two ar omatic angular rings on the anthracene spine. Studies on initiating activity in mouse skin of the three possible dihydrodiols of dibenz[ a,c]anthracene showed that the 1,2- and 10,11-dihydrodiols were more potent than dibenz[ a,c]anthracene itself whilst the 3.4-dihydrodiol was not (the latter is a putativeA187precursor of bay region diol epoxide). Adducts were not detected in mouse skin following treatment with dibenz[ a,c]anthracene in vivo. However dibenz[ a,c]anthracene produced adducts in vitro in both microsomal metabolism in th e presence of DNA and primary cultures of hamster embryo cells. These had chromatographic characteristics of anti-10,11- diol-12,13-epoxide DNA adducts. Although the 10,11-dihydrodiol shown to be metabolised to its non-bay-region diol epoxid e by rat liver microsomes, there were a number of other adducts observed in this test system. The 10,11-dihydrodiol is the intermediate in the activation of dibenz[ a,c]anthracene which may be activated to a vicinal non-bay-region epoxide either with or w ithout additional metabo lism elsewhere in the molecule. Both in vitro and in vivo studi es on the metabolism of dibenz[ a,h]anthracene have identified more than 20 metabolites. Although dibenz[ a,h]anthracene-3,4-diol (pecursor of the bay region diol epoxides) is formed extensively and is a potent initiator in mouse skin, it has not been shown to be converted to the vicinal diol epoxides by dibenz[ and its form a range of polyhydroxylated products including bis-dihydrodiols, it was hypothesised that an epoxide formed through further metabolism of a bis-diol. Subsequent studies demonstrated that dibenz[ a,h]anthracene was activated to a minor extent via the bay-region diol-epoxide anti-dibenz[ a,h]angthracene-3,4-diol-1,2-epoxide but the major adduct resulted from with dibenz[ a,h]anthracene-3,4,10,11-bis-diol, which co-chromatographed with the major adduct following treatment of mouse skin with dibenz[ a,h]anthracene or dibenz[ a,h]anthracene-3,4-diol. Studies showed that ( /g177)anti-dibenz[ a,j]anthracene-diol-epoxide was a more potent than its parent compound as a tumour initiator in mous e skin. This together with of both syn- and anti-dibenz[ a,j]anthracene diol epoxides thymus DNA. Tritiated dibenz[ a,j]anthracene in mouse keratinocytes formed of regi on diol epoxide DNA adducts to both guanosine and adenosine residues but much of the radi oactivity was associated with more polar compounds. In mouse epidermis 11 radioactive peaks were identified. The principal adduct was formed from (+)anti-dibenz[ a,j]anthracene-diol-epoxide bound to a guanosine residue, the isomer having an absolute configur ation of (4R,3S)-diol -(2S,1R)-epoxide. This configuration represents the most tumourigenic configuration of the four configurationalisomers of bay region benzo[ c]phenanthrene. The more pol ar products were shown to include three adducts tentatively identif ied as arising from the 3,4-10,11-bis-diol of dibenz[ a,j]anthracene. This effect of structure on the microsoma l metabolism, DNA binding and tumourigenicity of PAH can also be seen with the nitro-substituted PAH. For example studies on 7- nitrodibenz[ a,h]anthracene demonstrated that nitro- substitution perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the aromatic moiety resulted in weak or non-direct acting mutagenicity and lower tumourigenicity. This was due to the generation of reactive metabolites of theA188ring structure and nitroreduction was not i nvolved in the metabolic activation leading to tumour formation. Anthracene Data are available on the metabolism of anthrace ne in vitro and in rats in vivo, suggesting that the major route followed is based on 1,2- epoxidation followed by epoxide hydrolysis and conjugation of the resulting dihydrodiol. There is also some evidence that, in the rat,methylated metabolites (including the weakly tumourigenic 9,10-dimethylanthracene) may also form by a different metabolic route. Information on anthracene metabolites other than those found in the urine is almost completely lacking. Given that significant metabolism of PAH occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, the absence of data on bile and faeces metabolites is notable. Information regarding toxicokinetics and metabolism in man are completely lacking.However, the pattern of anthracene metabolism in the rat broadly follows that of other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, for which human metabolism is known to be qualitatively similar to that of the rat. This suggests that, on a qualitative level, human metabolism of anthracene may also be comparable to that seen in the rat. On the other hand, it is clear that no evaluation of the relative quantitative importance of competing metabolicpathways in man can be made. In the absen ce of other information, it will be assumed that the metabolic pathways of anthracene in man are not different from those observed in the experimental animal systems investigated. Anthracene illustrates the role of metabolic interactions in determining the risk from a specific compound. It further dem onstrates how metabolic data can be used to support or refute evidence from other studies such as genotoxicity in the overall risk assessment. The in vivo formation of 9-methylanthracene occu rs in rat subcutaneous tissue but neither anthracene nor 9-methylanthracene appear to act as tumour initiators on mouse skin (incontrast to 9,10-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene). This may be due to the favoured route of 9- methylanthracene metabolism being demethylation to anthraquinone rather than hydroxylation and sulphate formation. In ontrast 9-hydroxymethylanthracene cannot be bay-region dihydrodiol-epoxides but potent benzo[ c]phenanthrene by cytochrome P450 enzymes in human liver and l ung. These studies illustrate that for dietary exposure hepatic metabolism may be a more appropriate consideration in risk analysis of benzo[ c]phenanthrene and care is necessary extra polating the results of inhalation studies.A189Fjord region potent ultimate carcinogens whilst benzo[ c]phenanthrene is a weak carcinogen in rodents. The first step is production of two enantiomeric benzo[ c]phenanthrene-3,4-dihydrodiols which are converted to the four epoxide enantiomers. A ll 4 epoxides can form DNA adducts in mouse epidermis after skin application with (-)-a nti-3,4-DH-1,2-epoxide being the most potent. However in rodent specific me tabolism may account for the discrepancy in potency. In rat liver microsomes only small amounts of 3,4-DH are formed. The 3,4-DH results in six-fold higher adduct formation than benzo[ c]phenanthrene in mouse skin in vivo. Thus formation of 3,4-DH is the critical step in fo rmation of the ultimate carcinogen. There are limited data on human metabolism of benzo[ c]phenanthrene. Human mammary carcinoma cells which form predominantly deoxyadenosin e adducts. Using V79 cells genetically engineered to to activate benzo[ c]phenanthrene to the dihydrodiol. The study used microsomes from 18 human liver and 11 human lung tissue samples at doses of 5 and 30 \u00b5M benzo[ c]phenanthrene. Similar metabolic profiles were obtained but levels of metabolites varied 2-10 fold, with benzo[ c]phenanthrene-3,4-dihydrodiol as the main metabolite and benzo[ c]phenanthrene-5,6-dihydrodiol as a minor metabolite in all samples, up to 4 more polar peaks were seen in samples, three of which correlated withdihydrodiol formation and were suggested to be triols and tetraols. To tal P450 levels in the microsomes varied 2-3 fold and specific enzyme activities were determined using specific substrates. These activities were correlated with metabolite formation using a Spearmancorrelation analysis; significant correlations were found for EROD of benzo[ 3A4 activity and benzo[ c]phenanthrene-5,6-dihydrodiol formation. found for involvement of CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP2A6. Rat and pig c]phenanthrene-5,6-dihydrodiol as the main metabolite as a minor metabolite whilst bovine hepatic microsomes form ed both in similar amounts. In human lung microsomes benzo[ c]phenanthrene-5,6-dihydrodiol was the main metabolite and benzo[ c]phenanthrene- 3,4-dihydrodiol was a minor component. Using E coli with recombinant human CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 similar meta bolic profiles were obtained a lthough more of the secondary polar metabolites were formed. The CYP1B1 is widely distributed in extrahepatic tissues and may be of greater importance in these tissues.A190APPENDIX 2 TOXIC EQUIVALENCY FACTORS FOR PAH The application of the concept of response addition has been suggested by the US EPA (1986) to determine the cancer risk from mixtu res containing carcinogenic compounds. The assumption was that such compounds show simple dissimilar action with a complete negative correlation of tolerance. By defin ition, there is a complete negative correlation between the effects of two chemicals if the individuals that are most susceptible to onetoxicant are least susceptible to the other. This is the simplest form of response additivity. The proportion (P) of individuals responding to the mixture is equal to the sum of the responses to each of the components. Howeve r, as pointed out by K\u00f6nemann and Pieters (1996) for compounds with presumed linear dos e-response curves, such as genotoxic and carcinogenic compounds for which it is assumed that a no-effect-level does not exist and for which the mechanism of action may be re garded as similar, response addition and dose addition will provide identical results. Therefore, various authors have applied dose addition and used different terminology in the assessment of PAH, such as relative response factors, relative potency factors or toxicity equivalency factors (TEF). Several attempts have been made to derive relative potency factors, expressed as toxic equivalency factors (TEF) for i ndividual PAH (relative to benzo[ a]pyrene) with the purpose of summarising the contributions from individual PAH in a mixture into a total benzo[ a]pyrene equivalent dose, assuming additivity in their carcinogenic 1989; Larsen and Larsen, 1998). Because there is a total lack of adequate data from oral carcinogenicity studies on PAH others than benzo[ a]pyrene, TEF values for PAH have been suggested based on studies using skin application, pulmonary instillation and subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections. One of the main points to consider when assessing the combined action of chemicals inmixtures is whether there will be either no interaction or interaction in the form of synergism or antagonism. The TEF approach relies on dose addition, in which case there is no interaction between the components of the mixture. The TEF approach is used to normalise exposures to chemicals with the same mechanism of action (common mechanism chemicals) with different potencies to yield a total equivalent exposure (TEQ) to one of the chemicals, the \"index compound\". The TEF approach was initially developed to estimate the potential toxicity of mixtures ofpolychlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofur ans (PCDFs). Use of the TEF approach, and thus dose addition, to the risk assessment of chemical mixtures is only scientifically justifiable when all the chemicals in the mixture act in the same way, by the same mechanism, and thus differ only in their potencies. Application of the dose additionmodel should not be applied to mixtures of chemicals that act by mechanisms for which the additivity assumptions are invalid. It should be realised that with the exception of a few groups of chemicals, such as some orga nophosphorous and carbamate pesticides and someA191polychlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins, - dibenzofurans and - biphenyls, precise mechanistic information on their toxic effects are scarce. There are several problems in using the TEF approach in the risk assessment of PAH infood. The use of the TEF approach requires that the compounds in question excert the toxicological effect by the same mechanis m of action, such as is the case for the polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and - dibenz ofurans, which act through binding to the Ah-receptor. Although a number of PAH bind to th e Ah receptor, this effect is not the only effect that determines the carcinogenic potency of PAH. DNA binding and induction of mutations are other significant effects in the carcinogenesis of PAH, and there is noindication that different PAH ar e activated via the same meta bolic route, binds DNA in the same positions, and induce the same types of mu tations in the same organs or tissues. In fact, the study by Culp et al. (1998) showed that the coal-t ar mixture of PAH also produced tumours in other tissues and organs than those affected by benzo[ a]pyrene alone, and that the additional PAH in the mixture did not significantly contribute to the incidence of stomach tumours observed after benz[ a]pyrene alone. Futhermore, studies on mixtures of individua l PAH have shown that they may interact metabolically in a number of ways resulting in not only additive but also synergistic and/orantagonistic effects (Montizaan et al. , 1989). The limitations in using the TEF approach for the assessment of PAH carcinogenicity following oral administration was illustrated when it was used on the carcinogenicity data and the analytical data on the PAH composition in the coal tars used in the study by Culp et al. (1998). When the TEF values derived by Larsen and Larsen (1998) (Table A.2.1) were used the carcinogenic potency of both co al tar mixtures was predicted to be only approximately 1.5 times that of the benzo[ a]pyrene content. However, the observed potencies of the coal tar mixtures were up to 5 times that accounted for by the benzo[ a]pyrene content. In this case, the use of the TEF approach for PAH carcinogenicity would underestimate it. Schneider et al. (2002) also examined the use of the TEF approach on the data from the Culp et al. (1998) study and from several other studies using dermal or lung application of PAH mixtures of known composition. They used the TEF derived by Brown and Mittelsman (1993) (Table A.2.1) and concluded that the benzo[ a]pyrene equivalency factors do not adequately describe th e potency of PAH mixtures and lead to underestimation of the carcinogenic potencies in most cases.A192Table A.2.1 Estimates of carcinogenic potenc ies of various PAH, relative to benzo[ a]pyrene (BaP) Compound Studies using rat lung installationStudies using mouse skin painting Combined estimates from different types of studies Calc.
