Egg size variation does not affect offspring performance under intraspecic competition in Nasonia vitripennis , a gregarious parasitoid R. G. LALONDE Department of Biology, Okanagan University College, 3333 University Way, Kelowna, BC, Canada V1V 1V7 Summary 1. As with many insects, egg size variation is correlated with body size in the gregarious parasitoid, Nasonia vitripennis . I use this feature to test the hypothesis that egg size differences among parents affects the ability of their larvae to compete for limitedresources within a superparasitized host. 2. I show that egg size asymmetries in parents that oviposit into the same host have no detect- able effect on relative offspring performance, even under conditions of resource limitation. 3. Broods within a host that were initiated earlier attained greater average size than competing broods in the same host that were initiated later. 4. Individuals in the more numerous brood emerged consistently larger than individuals in the less numerous brood. 5. The possibility that siblings cooperate in competing for limited resources within a host and the potential role of sibling cooperation on egg size evolution is discussed.

Journal of Animal Ecology (2005) 74 , 630-635 doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.00958.x Introduction In many systems, parental investment is limited to the materials allocated by a parent to an individual prop-agule (i.e. an egg or a seed) to support its initial growth. Given xed allocation to propagule production, highper-individual allocation levels occur at the cost ofreduced numbers of propagules (Blackburn 1991; Roff 2002). Much theoretical and empirical research has focused on factors influencing propagule size (McGinley, Temme & Geber 1987; Fox 1994a,b; Bernardo 1996), and on the consequences of size variation (Fox 1994a;Fox & Mousseau 1996). Typically, propagule size is considered to be a genetically xed, maternal trait thatmay vary due to environmental constraints operatingon the parent (Perrins & McCleery 1994; Sheader 1996)or due to natural selection operating over et al . 1987; Lalonde 1991; Bernardo 1996; Roff 2002). environ-ments can theoretically favour different optimal prop-agule sizes (Smith & Fretwell 1974), parents often have relatively poor information about the quality of the environment facing their offspring. Thus, in the case ofanimals, we expect selection to produce either an egg of a constant size that shows the highest average tnessacross offspring environments (McGinley et al . 1987), or a range of egg sizes within a brood that match therange of potential offspring environments (Kaplan & Cooper 1984; Poulin & Hamilton 2000). Egg size vari-ation that does not conform to such explanations is more enigmatic. An example of such an enigmatic pattern of egg size variation is the strong positive correlation between body size and egg size: a pattern that occurs in many animaltaxa (reviewed in Bernardo 1996; Roff 2002). Givena tight correlation between egg size and offspring success,suboptimally reduced egg size in small adults imposesa reproductive cost to those adults. A positive correlation between body size and propagule size may evolve when large females' offspring are morelikely to experience food limitation through siblingcompetition. This occurs when large egg size increasesoffspring success and when large females lay more eggsin a given resource patch than small females. This lastcan occur despite large females' expectation of moreoviposition opportunities because of increased lifespan (Ellers & Jervis 2003), because such females will alwayshave more mature eggs at any given time (Blackburn 1991;Mayhew & Heitmans 2000) and thus have a greatertendency to be time, rather than egg-limited when foraging Correspondence: R.

However, when offspring of several females compete for limited resources in a scramble, offspring of all females must deal with resource limitation and theory predicts a constantegg size that is independent of female size (Parker &Begon 1986). In this paper, I address the question of egg size vari- ation and offspring tness (Walk.). wasp famously optimizing the tness of a superparasite (Werren 1980; King 1992) and has been shown to superparasi-tize hosts in the eld (Werren 1983). Thus, N. vitripennis offspring will, at least occasionally, face strong inter- brood competition, which should select for a large eggsize that is invariant with respect to body size. However, N. vitripennis shows a strong positive correlation between female size and egg size (O'Neill & Skinner 1990; resultsbelow). I show here that although competing broodsof N. vitripennis within a single host are resource- limited, small egg size associated with small body sizein N. vitripennis does not measurably impair the ability of offspring to compete for limited resources. I then demonstrate that other factors such as relative age ofcompeting broods and relative number of individualsin a given brood within a host are the strongest deter-minants of the competitive success of offspring. Materials and methods I replicated all experiments described below three times using three different wild-caught strains of N. vitripennis (C9, C15, LBII). My marker was a scarlet-eyed strain obtained from Carolina Biological Supplies. Strains weremaintained in continuous culture on stocks of Phaenicia sericata (Meig.) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) obtained from the Simon Fraser University insectary. In all experiments,wasps were presented with host pupae that had pupated 2-4 days previously, well within the range of suitabilityfor this parasitoid (Rivers & Denlinger 1994). I dissected eggs from a range of females in all strains used, including the marker strain. All wasps were slide-mounted and their hind tibiae measured to the nearest1/100 mm using an ocular micrometer in a compoundmicroscope set at medium (100 \u00d7 ) power. In addition to this, chorionated eggs were removed from the abdomenand egg length was measured in the same manner asfor tibiae. In the majority of cases, the average length of ve randomly selected fully mature eggs was cal-culated. If the abdomen of a dissected female did not contain ve fully mature eggs the average length wascalculated as the average of the total number of fullymature eggs in the abdomen. In all treatment groups, each 2-day-old P. serricata pupa was exposed to one marker wasp (a red-eyed female) and one wild-type wasp simultaneously in anindividual cage over 24 h. These trials were conductedat 24 \u00b0 C in an 18 : 6 light : dark regimen. Immediately after exposure to wasps, pupae were weighed to thenearest 0\u00b71 mg and placed individually in labelled gelatin capsules. All parent wasps were collected afterthe oviposition period, slide-mounted and their hindtibiae and remaining eggs measured in the mannerdescribed above. Progeny were then allowed to emergeand die inside the capsules. Any wasps that failed toemerge and any diapausing larvae were dissected frompupae after emergence was complete. Diapausinglarvae were assumed to be wild-type, because themarker strain never produced diapausing offspringunder the conditions used during the experiment (myunpublished data). I determined the sex of all matureoffspring and measured their hind tibiae using thesame protocol followed for the parents. Over the courseof making my measurements it became obvious thatoffspring in the less numerous brood were smaller thanthe competing brood. Accordingly, I included relativesize of competing broods in my analyses in this and thenext experiment. I exposed the progeny of wild-strain wasps to inter- brood competition with three different time delays,relative to the marker brood. In the rst treatment wild broods competed with conspecic markers laid at thesame time. The second group competed against larvaethat enjoyed a 24-h head start and the third facedconspecics with a 48-h advantage. Wild-type wasps inthe rst treatment group were placed on the hosts at thesame time as the marker strain, the second immediatelyafter the markers were removed and the third wereplaced on hosts 24 h after the markers were removed.Wasps in all three treatment groups were exposed to hosts for 24 h. Hosts were prepared in the same manneras above and parents and progeny were processed asabove, except that eggs were not dissected out of the parents. This last was because the strong correlationbetween parent size and egg size for all strains (marker; r 2 = 0\u00b772; C15, r 2 = 0\u00b778; C9, r 2 = 0\u00b763; LBII, r 2 = 0\u00b760; P < 0\u00b70001 in all cases, Fig. 1) allowed me to use parental tibia length as a surrogate for egg size. I calculated the relative success of wild strain wasps emerging from each host as the difference between Fig. 1. Correlation between egg length and hind tibia length. (a) C15 strain; (b) C9 strain; (c) (d) red-eyedmarker strain. 632 R. G. Lalonde \u00a9 2005 British Ecological Society, Journal of Animal Ecology , 74 , 630-635 average standardized tibia length of wild and marker emergents. I standardized measures of tibia length fortwo reasons. First, to correct for differences betweenlength of male and female tibiae and secondly to adjustfor the effect of varying availability of food for developing larvae in individual hosts. Average tibia length of male emergents was slightly larger than females across broods (paired t -test, 116 d.f., t = 2\u00b7647, P < 0\u00b70043). Because of some variation in sex ratio among hosts and strains, this bias couldhave affected my results. To correct for this, I calculatedaverage difference in tibia length between sexes for a given experiment, and added this difference to eachfemale's tibia length before calculating average tibialength within a brood. I next adjusted tibia lengthestimates to correct for food availability. Mature size ofall offspring was affected by the interaction betweenthe size of the clutch and the mass of the host pupa suchthat the amount of host available to larvae stronglyaffected their average size within a host for both markers( P = 0\u00b70004, r 2 = 0\u00b7158, Fig. 2a) and wild strain larvae ( P = 0\u00b70026, r 2 = 0\u00b711, Fig. 2b). I corrected for this by regressing average sex-corrected tibia length against log-transformed host mass divided by number of com-peting parasitoid larvae. The log transformation wasnecessary in order to normalize these data. I used theresiduals from these regressions as my estimate of standardized tibia length. All results reported beloware for standardized tibia length, but analyses performedon raw data produced qualitatively identical results. Results I analysed the effect of strain, the log-transformed ratio of parental egg length and log-transformed clutch size ratio on the difference in average standardizedoffspring size among broods using an analysis ofcovariance. Log transformations were performed tonormalize data. There was no detectable effect of egglength ratio on the success of offspring under com-petition (Table 1). Furthermore, there was no influenceof strain type on the outcome of competition in thisexperiment (Table 1). Relative numbers of individuals in the two broods had the strongest effect on the out-come of within-host competition (Table 1). Relativeoffspring size showed direct frequency dependence,where the largest offspring in a given host were predict- ably members of the more numerous brood inside that host (Fig. 3). There was no signicant interactionbetween any of the main effects in the model (Table 1). I followed a slightly different procedure for the tem- poral effects experiment when I calculated standardtibia length for the wild strains. Here, I calculated devi-ations from the regression of tibia length against host Fig. 2. Resource availability regressed against and mature size of offspring. Offspring size is indexed as within-brood averagehind tibia length regressed against host mass, measuredimmediately after parental oviposition, divided by the totalnumber of offspring in both competing broods that fed during development.

This was conducted to preserve size differencesdue to treatment that would have disappeared hadseparate within-treatment regressions been employed.I analysed the effect of betweenbrood oviposition, the log-transformed ratio of parentaltibia length ( egg size, Fig. 1) on the difference in average standardized offspring size among broods using ananalysis of covariance. Strain type again had no main effect on brood suc- cess ( , P = 0\u00b77335) and this effect was removed from the model to preserve degrees of freedom in sub-sequent analyses. There was no effect of the loggedratio of tibia size of the ovipositing wild female to the marker female in determining the outcome of intra-specic competition (Table 2). Duration of time elapsedbetween the oviposition of the marker and the wild-type female parents did, however, have a signicanteffect on the relative size of offspring, where a long timepenalty resulted in relatively smaller offspring (Table 2,Fig. 4). As in the preceding experiment, relative numbersof offspring in the two broods within a host had a strongand consistent effect on the outcome of competition. Here,success of a brood, relative to its competing brood, tendedto be greatest when that brood was more numerous(Table 2, Fig. 4). There was no signicant interactionbetween any of the main effects in the model. Discussion One underlying assumption of this study is that off- spring size measures tness adequately in parasitoids.Although I do not test this assumption here a numberof studies of similar systems have demonstrated thatthis is Luck 1995). Furthermore, I assume that eggmortality will be constant across a range of egg sizes.This may not actually be the case as developmentalmortality has been shown to be correlated with egg sizein at least one system (Mayhew & Heitmans 2000).However, in this system it was not possible to evaluate developmental mortality. Given these caveats, I showhere that the success of offspring of N. vitripennis under intraspecic competition can be affected by threefactors: availability of food, relative age of broods andrelative numbers of individuals in each brood. Finally, although there is strong variation in egg size withrespect to body size in this species, I was unable to detect any tness consequences of this variation underintraspecic competition. It is not surprising that wasp offspring do better when they are supplied with abundant food, and when they are competing with younger (and therefore smaller) individuals. Nasonia offspring are gregarious (Whiting 1967) and evidently do not cannibalize (Wylie1971). All other things being equal, older (and thereforelarger) individuals can be expected to do better underconditions of scramble competition, because they are most able to process the limited resources at a rapidrate. These results are similar to those of Wylie (1971), who showed both differential mortality and reported qualitative size differences between rst and secondclutches of N. vitripennis laid into housefly puparia.Table 2.

Lalonde \u00a9 2005 British Ecological Society, Journal of Animal Ecology , 74 , 630-635 Positive propagule size effects signicance of propagule size variationremains obscure in a number of systems (Bernardo 1996). In particular, the relationship between egg sizevariation and competitive ability has been difcult to demonstrate in animals (Azevedo, French & Partridge1997; but see Svensson & Sinervo 2000). However,large propagule size in plants has been shown to confera competitive advantage under strong competition in anumber of systems (Roff 2002). In parasitoids, the role of egg size variation on offspring success is less clear. For example, there issome evidence that larger eggs can increase tness viareduced mortality & small-egged engage inlethal ghting apparently enjoy an intrinsic advantagein interspecic contests, presumably because of shorterdevelopment time (Collier, Kelly & Hunter 2002).Under the kind of scramble competition exhibited by N. vitripennis , an egg size asymmetry may be assumed to confer an advantage to larger individuals if initialfeeding rate determines the victors or towards smallerindividuals if feeding commences sooner becauseof more rapid development. Either scenario shouldtranslate into size asymmetries in the adult stagewhenever resources are limiting. The demonstrated effect of brood age, due presumably to enforced differencesbetween onset of feeding across competing broods,suggests that egg size effects should be evident. How-ever, my data do not demonstrate any effect of egg size variation on offspring success, even though there was demonstrable food limitation and strong variation inoffspring size across broods. Estimating the tness ofeggs whose Hoegh-Guldberg1997; Svensson & Sinervo 2000), instead of employingthe natural variation in egg size, is a denitive way todemonstrate any effect of egg size variation on perform-ance, but is not a pragmatic approach for parasitoidsystems. Wasp larvae did best in competition with offspring of another strain when they and their siblings out-numbered the competition. This frequency-dependence was an unexpected result and suggests that siblings actively cooperate to outcompete unrelated rivals insuperparasitized hosts. Although active intraspeciccompetition between offspring of solitary parasitoidsis well documented (Godfray 1994; &Hongkham 1996), the has beenthat gregarious parasitoids only competed via indi-vidual (Godfray 1987; Rosenheim 1993). Within-brood facilitation in N. vitripennis implies that larvae are able to recognize and either cooperate withkin or become aggressive to non-kin. Kin-recognition has been shown to reduce aggressive interactions betweenrelatives in cannibalistic spadefoot toads (Pfennig, Reeve & Sherman 1993; Collins 1999) and nest-building Polistes wasps (Bura & Gamboa 1994) and is speculated to be a signicant factor innon-social insect interactions (Fellowes 1998). Mostrecently kin recognition has been shown to direct larval aggression in a polyembryinic parasitoid (Giron et al . 2004). I should emphasize, however, that the mechanismunderlying the frequency-dependent effect in thissystem is not known and may not involve any direct kin-recognition among larvae. Finally, it is possible that the frequency-dependent effect may select for the allometric relationshipbetween body size and egg size in Nasonia vitripennis . A female wasp's clutch size decision will probably bebiased towards a higher number than would otherwisebe optimal if relative clutch size determines her off-spring's share of host resources under competition andsuperparasitism is a routine event. This phenomenonhas been demonstrated in Leptopilina heterotoma , a contest-competing solitary parasitoid where eggs areessentially lottery tickets that determine which female'soffspring is most likely to become the sole emergent(Visser, van Alphen & Nell 1990; Rosenheim & Hongkham 1996). This circumstance places a selective premiumon larger egg loads. All other things being equal, selectionfor large egg loads (and therefore smaller eggs) will always be strongest on small females which are themost likely to be egg-limited at the time of oviposition.This may serve as a more general explanation for allo-metric egg size relationships if frequency-dependenceaffects success among competing broods of othergregarious species.
