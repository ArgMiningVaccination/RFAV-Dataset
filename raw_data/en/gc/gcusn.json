Section 5 : Preferred Provider and Out -of-Network Provider Information This plan is a preferred provider organization or \"PPO\" plan. It provides a higher level of coverage when Covered Medical Expenses are received from healthcare providers who are part of the plan's network of Preferred Providers. The plan also provides cov erage when Covered Medical Expenses are obtained from healthcare providers who are not Preferred Providers, known as Out -of-Network Providers. However, a lower level of coverage may be provided when care is received from Out -of-Network Providers and the I nsured Person may be responsible for paying a greater portion of the cost. Preferred Providers in the local school area are: UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus Preferred Provider Hospitals include UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus United Behavioral Health (UBH) fa cilities. The easiest way to locate Preferred Providers is through the plan's website at www.uhcsr.com/tulane . The website will allow the Insured to easily search for providers by specialty and location. The Insured may also call the Customer Service De partment at 1 -866-808-8266 for assistance in finding a Preferred Provider. The Company arranges for health care providers to take part in the Preferred Provider network. Preferred Providers are independent practitioners. They are not employees of the Co mpany. It is the Insured's responsibility to choose a provider. Our credentialing process confirms public information about the providers' licenses and other credentials but does not assure the quality of the services provided. A provider's status may change. Insureds should always confirm that a Preferred Provider is participating at the time services are required by calling Customer Service at 1 -866-808-8266 and/or by asking the provider when making an appointment for services. A directory of provide rs is available on the plan's website at www.uhcsr.com/tulane .

If an Insured is currently receiving treatment for Covered Medical Expenses from a provi der whose network status changes from Preferred Provider to Out -of-Network Provider during such treatment due to termination (non -renewal or expiration) of the provider's contract, the Insured may be eligible to request continued care from their current pr ovider under the same terms and conditions that would have applied prior to termination of the provider's contract for specif ied conditions and timeframes. This provision does not apply to provider contract terminations for failure to meet applicable q uality standards or for fraud.

Section 8: Coordination of Benefits Provision The Coordination of Benefits (COB) provision applies when an Insured Person has health care coverage under more than one Plan. Plan is defined below. The order of benefit determination rules govern the order in which each Plan will pay a claim for benefits. The Plan that pays first is called the Primary Plan. The Primary Plan must pay benefits in accordance with its policy terms without regard to the possibility that another Plan may cover some expenses. The Plan that pays after the Primary Plan is the Secondary Plan. The Secondary Plan may reduce the benefits it pays so that payments from all Plans do not exceed 100% of the total Allowable Expe nse as provided for in \u00a7303A.(a. -e.) of Regulation 32. COL -17-LA (PY2 2) CERT 19 DEFINITIONS A. A Plan is any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical or dental care or treatment. If separate contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for members of a group, the separate contracts are considered parts of the same plan and there is no COB among those separate contracts. 1. Plan includes: group and nongroup insurance contracts, health maintenance organization (HMO) contracts, closed panel plans or other forms of group or group -type coverage (whether insured or uninsured); medical care components of long -term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care; medical benefits under group or individual automobile contracts; and Medicare or any other federal gov ernmental plan, as permitted by law. 2. Plan does not include: hospital indemnity coverage or other fixed indemnity coverage; accident only coverage; specified disease or specified accident coverage; limited benefit health coverage, as defined by state law; s chool accident type coverage except those enumerated in LSA -R.S. 22:1000 A.3C; benefits for non -medical components of long -term care policies; Medicare supplement policies; Medicaid policies; or coverage under other federal governmental plans, unless permi tted by law. Each contract for coverage is a separate Plan. If a Plan has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separate Plan. B. This Plan means, in a COB provision, the part of the contract providing th e health care benefits to which the COB provision applies and which may be reduced because of the benefits of other plans. Any other part of the contract providing health care benefits is separate from this plan. A contract may apply one COB provision to certain benefits, such as dental benefits, coordinating only with similar benefits, and may apply another COB provision to coordinate other benefits. C. The order of benefit determination rules determine whether This Plan is a Primary Plan or Secondary Pl an when the Insured Person has health care coverage under more than one Plan. When This Plan is primary, it determines payment for its benefits first before those of any other Plan without considering any other Plan's benefits. When This Plan is secondary, it determines its benefits after those of another Plan and may reduce the benefits it pays so that all Plan benefits do not exceed 100% of the total Allowable Expense. D. Allowable Expense is a health care service or expense, including Deductibles, Coins urance and Copays, that is covered in full or at least in part by any Plan covering the Insured Person. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered an Allowable Expense and a benefit p aid. An expense or service that is not covered by any Plan covering the Insured Person is not an Allowable Expense. The following are examples of expenses that are and are not Allowable Expenses: 1. The difference between the cost of a semi -private hospital room and a private hospital room is not an Allowable Expense, unless one of the Plans provides coverage for private hospital room expenses. 2. If an Insured Person is covered by 2 or more Plans that compute their benefit payments on the basis of Usual and Customary Charges or relative value schedule reimbursement methodology or other similar reimbursement methodology, any amount in excess of the highest reimbursement amount for a specific benefit is not an Allowable Expense. 3. If an Insured Person is covered by 2 or more Plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, an amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated fees is not an Allowable Expense. 4. If an Insured Person is covered by one Plan that calculates its benefits or service s on the basis of Usual and Customary Charges or relative value schedule reimbursement methodology or other similar reimbursement methodology and another Plan that provides its benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, the Primary plan's paymen t arrangement shall be the Allowable Expense for all Plans. 5. The amount of any benefit reduction by the Primary plan because an Insured Person has failed to comply with the Plan provisions is not an Allowable Expense. Examples of these types of plan provisi ons include second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions, and preferred provider arrangements. E. Closed Panel Plan is a Plan that provides health care benefits to an Insured Person primarily in the form of services through a panel of providers t hat have contracted with or are employed by the Plan, and that excludes coverage for services provided by other providers, except in cases of emergency or referral by a panel member. F. Custodial Parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year excluding any temporary visitation. G. We, Us, Our is the Company named in the Policy. COL -17-LA (PY2 2) CERT 20 ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION RULES When an Insured P erson is covered by two or more Plans, the rules for determining the order of benefit payments are as follows: A. The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits of under any other Plan. 1. Except as provided below, a Plan that does not contain a coordination of benefits provision that is consistent with this regulation is always primary unless the provisions of both Plans state that the complying plan is primary. 2. Coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits and provides that this supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. Examples of these types of situations are major medical coverages that are superimposed over base plan hospital and surgical benefits, and insurance type coverages that are written in connection with a Closed Panel Plan to provide out -of-network benefits. B. A Plan may consider t he benefits paid or provided by another Plan in calculating payment of its benefits only when it is secondary to that other Plan. C. Each Plan determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules that apply: 1. Non-Dependent or Dependent. The Plan that covers the Insured Person other than as a Dependent, for example as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covers the Insured Person as a Dependent is the Secondary Plan. However, if the Insured Person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is secondary to the Plan covering the Insured Person as a Dependent; and primary to the Plan covering the Insured Person as other than a Dependent (e.g. a retired employee) ; then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering the Insured Person as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber or retiree is the Secondary plan and the other Plan is the Primary plan. 2. Dependent Child Covered Un der More Than One Plan. Unless there is a court decree stating otherwise, when a Dependent child is covered by more than one Plan the order of benefits is determined as follows: a. For a Dependent child whose parents are married or are living together, whethe r or not they have ever been married: i. The Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year is the Primary plan; or ii. If both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary plan. b. For a Depe ndent child whose parents are divorced or separated or not living together, whether or not they have ever been married: i. If a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is primary. This rule applies to plan years commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree; ii. If a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the Depende nt child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the provisions of Subparagraph (a) above shall determine the order of benefits; iii. If a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the Dependent child, the provisions of Subparagraph (a) above shall determine the order of benefits; or iv. If there is no court decree allocating responsibility for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows: a) The Plan covering the Custodial Parent; b) The Plan covering the spouse of the Custodial Parent; c) The Plan covering the non -custodial parent; and then d) The Plan covering the spouse of the non -custodial parent. c. For a Dependent child covered under more than one Plan of individuals who are the parents of the child, the provisions of Subparagraph (a) or (b) above shall determine the order of benefits as if those individuals were the parents of the child. d. For a Dependent child covered under spouse's plan i. For a Dependent child who has coverage under either or both parents' plans and also has his or her own coverage as a Dependent under a spouse's plan, the rule in Paragraph (5) appli es. ii. In the event the Dependent child's coverage under the spouse's plan began on the same date as the Dependent child's coverage under either or both parents' plans, the order of benefits shall be determined by applying the birthday rule in Subparagraph (a ) to the Dependent child's parent(s) and the Dependent's spouse. COL -17-LA (PY2 2) CERT 21 3. Active Employee or Retired or Laid -off Employee. The Plan that covers an Insured Person as an active employee, that is, an employee who is neither laid off nor retired, is the Primary Plan. T he Plan covering that same person as a retired or laid -off employee is the Secondary Plan. The same would hold true if an Insured Person is a Dependent of an active employee and that same person is a Dependent of a retired or laid -off employee. If the othe r Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the rule labeled D (1) can determine the order of benefits. 4. COBRA or State Continuation Coverage. If an Insu red Person whose coverage is provided pursuant to COBRA or under a right of continuation provided by state or other federal law is covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the Insured Person as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree or covering th e Insured Person as a Dependent of an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan and the COBRA or state or other federal continuation coverage is the Secondary Plan. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the rule labeled D(1) can determine the order of benefits. 5. Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage. The Plan that covered the Insured Person as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber or retiree longer is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covered the Insured Person the shorter period of time is the Secondary Plan. 6. If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefits, the Allowable expenses shall be sha red equally between the Plans meeting the definition of Plan. In addition, This Plan will not pay more than it would have paid had it been the Primary plan. EFFECT ON THE BENEFITS OF THIS PLAN A. When This Plan is secondary, it may reduce its benefits so that the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans during a plan year are not more than the total Allowable Expenses. In determining the amount to be paid for any claim, the Secondary Plan will calculate the benefits it would have paid in the absence of other health care coverage and apply that calculated amount to any Allowable Expense under its Plan that is unpaid by the Primary Plan. The Secondary Plan may then reduce its payment by the amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the Primary Plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans for the claim do not exceed the total Allowable Expense for that claim. In addition, the Secondary Plan shall credit to its plan Deductible, Coinsurance, Copays and any amounts it would have credited to its Deductible in the absence of other health care coverage. B. If an Insured Person is enrolled in two or more Closed Panel Plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of service by a non -panel provider, benefits are not payable by one Closed P anel Plan, COB shall not apply between that Plan and other Closed Panel Plans. C. Effect on the Benefits of This Plan 1. When This Plan is secondary, it may reduce its benefits so that the total benefits paid or provided by all plans during a plan year or clai m determination period are not more than 100 percent of total Allowable Expenses. The difference between the benefit payments that This Plan would have paid had it been the Primary Plan, and the benefit payments that it actually paid or provided shall be r ecorded as a benefit reserve for the Insured Person and used by This Plan to pay any Allowable Expenses, not otherwise paid during the claim determination period. As each claim is submitted, This Plan will: a. determine its obligation to pay or provide ben efits under its contract; b. determine whether a benefit reserve has been recorded for the Insured Person; and c. determine whether there are any unpaid Allowable Expenses during that claims determination period. 2. If there is a benefit reserve, the Secondary Plan will use the Insured Person's benefit reserve to pay up to 100 percent of total Allowable Expenses incurred during the claim determination period. At the end of the claims determination period, the benefit reserve returns to zero. A new bene fit reserve must be created for each new claim determination period. 3. If an Insured Person is enrolled in two or more Closed Panel Plans, and if for any reason, including the provision of service by a non -panel provider, benefits are not payable by one C losed Panel Plan, COB shall not apply between that plan and other Closed Panel Plans. RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND RELEASE NEEDED INFORMATION Certain facts about health care coverage and services are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benefits paya ble under This Plan and other Plans. The Company may get the facts it needs from or give them to other organizations or persons for the purpose of applying these rules and determining benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans covering the Insured Pe rson claiming benefits. The Company need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each Insured Person claiming benefits under This P lan must give the Company any facts it needs to apply those rules and determine benefits payable. COL -17-LA (PY2 2) CERT 22 FACILITY O F PAYMENT A payment made under another Plan may include an amount that should have been paid under This P lan. If it does, the Company may pay that amount to the organization that made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a bene fit paid under This P lan. The Company will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means the reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. RIGHT OF RECOVERY If the amount of the payments made by the Company is more than it should have paid under this COB provision, it may recover the excess from one or more of the persons it has paid or for whom it has paid; or any other person or organization that may be responsible for the benefits or services provided for the Insured Person. The \"amount of the payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS - IMPORTANT NOTICE This is a summary of only a few of the provisions of the health plan to help the Insured Person understand coordination of benefits, which can be very complicated. This is not a complete description of all of the coordination rules and procedures, and does not change or replace the language contained in the insurance contract, which determines The Insured Person's benefits. Double Coverage It is common for Dependents to be covered by more than one health care plan. This happens, for example, when a husband and wife both work and choose to have family coverage through both employers. When an Insured Person is covered by more than one health plan, state law permits insurers to follow a procedure called \"coordination of benefits\" to determine how muc h each should pay when an Insured Person has a claim. The goal is to make sure that the combined payments of all plans do not add up to more than the Insured Person's covered health care expenses. Coordination of benefits (COB) is complicated and covers a wide variety of circumstances. This is only an outline of some of the most common ones. If the Insured's situation is not described, read the evidence of coverage or contact your state insurance department. Primary or Secondary? The Insured Person will be asked to identify all the plans that cover Dependents. The Company needs this information to determine whether We are the \"primary\" or \"secondary\" benefit payer. The Primary Plan always pays first when the Insured Person has a claim. Any Plan that does not contain the state's COB rules will always be primary. When This Plan is Primary If the Insured Person or a Dependent is covered under another Plan in addition to this one, We will be primary when: The Insured Person's Own Expenses The claim is for t he Insured Person's own health care expenses, unless the Insured Person is covered by Medicare and both the Insured Person and the Insured Person's spouse are retired. The Insured Person's Spouse's Expenses The claim is for the Insured Person's spouse, wh o is covered by Medicare, and neither the Insured Person or the spouse are retired. The Insured Person's Dependent Child's Expenses The claim is for the health care expenses of the Insured Person's child who is a Dependent under This Plan and The Insured Person is married and the Insured Person's birthday is earlier in the year than the Insured Person's spouse's or the Insured Person is living with another individual, regardless of whether or not the Insured Person has ever been married to that individual, and the Insured Person's birthday is earlier than that other individual's birthday. This is known as the \"birthday rule\"; or The Insured Person is separated or divorced and the Company has been informed of a court decree that makes the Insured Person resp onsible for the Dependent child's health care expenses; or COL -17-LA (PY2 2) CERT 23 There is no court decree, but the Insured Person has custody of the Dependent child. Other Situations The Company will be primary when any other provisions of state or federal law require us to be . How the Company Pays Claims When We Are Primary When the Company is the Primary Plan, We will pay the benefits in accordance with the terms of the Insured Person's contract, just as if the Insured Person had no other health care coverage under any other Plan. How the Company Pays Claims When We Are Secondary The Company will be secondary whenever the rules do not require us to be primary. When the Company is the Secondary Plan, We do not pay until after the Primary Plan has paid its benefits. We will t hen pay part or all of the Allowable Expenses left unpaid, as explained below. An Allowable Expense is a health care service or expense covered by one of the Plans, including Copays, Coinsurance and Deductibles. If there is a difference between the amount the Plans allow, We will base Our payment on the higher amount. However, if the Primary Plan has a contract with the provider, Our combined payments will not be more than the contract calls for. Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provide r organizations (PPOs) usually have contracts with their providers. We will determine Our payment by subtracting the amount the Primary Plan paid from the amount We would have paid if we had been primary. We will use any savings to pay the balance of any u npaid Allowable Expenses covered by either Plan. If the Primary Plan covers similar kinds of health care expenses, but allows expenses that We do not cover, We will pay for those items as long as there is a balance in the Insured Person's benefit reserve, as explained below. We will not pay an amount the Primary Plan did not cover because the Insured Person did not follow its rules and procedures. For example, if the Insured Person's Plan has reduced its benefit because the Insured Person did not obtain pre -certification, as required by that Plan, we will not pay the amount of the reduction, because it is not an Allowable Expense. Benefit Reserve When the Company is secondary, We often will pay less than We would have paid if we had been primary. Each time We \"save\" by paying less, We will put that savings into a benefit reserve. Each Dependent covered by This Plan has a separate benefit reserve. We use the benefit reserve to pay Allowable Expenses that are covered only partially by both Plans. To obtain a r eimbursement, the Insured Person must show the Company what the Primary Plan has paid so We can calculate the savings. To make sure the Insured Person receives the full benefit or coordination, the Insured Person should submit all claims to each Plan. Savi ngs can build up in the Insured Person's reserve for one year. At the end of the year any balance is erased, and a fresh benefit reserve begins for each Insured Person the next year as soon as there are savings on their claims.

In the case of a newborn adopted child, coverage begins at the moment of birth if a written agreement to adopt such ch ild has been entered into by the Insured prior to the birth of the child, whether or not the agreement is enforceable. However, coverage will not continue to be provided for an adopted child who is not ultimately placed in the Insured's residence. Benefit s will also be provided for another child placed in court -ordered temporary or other custody of the Insured from the moment of placement or when a child is placed in the Insured's home following an act of voluntary surrender. The Insured will have the rig ht to continue such coverage for the child beyond the first 31 days. To continue the coverage the Insured must, within the 31 days after the child's date of placement: 1) apply to us; and 2) pay the required additional premium, if any, for the continued co verage.

The FEDVIP Dental Plan can be found at: http://archive/opm/gov/insure/health/planinfo/2014/brochures/MetLife.pdf . Section 1: Accessing Pediatric Dental Services Network and Non -Network Benefits Network Benefits - these benefits apply when the Insured Person chooses to obtain Covered Dental Services from a Network Dental Provider. Insured Persons generally are required to pay less to the Network Dental Provider than they would pay for services from a non -Network p rovider. Network Benefits are determined based on the contracted fee for each Covered Dental Service. In no event, will the Insured Person be required to pay a Network Dental Provider an amount for a Covered Dental Service that is greater than the contract ed fee. In order for Covered Dental Services to be paid as Network Benefits, the Insured Person must obtain all Covered Dental Services directly from or through a Network Dental Provider. Insured Persons must always check the participation status of a pr ovider prior to seeking services. From time to time, the participation status of a provider may change. The Insured Person can check the participation status by calling the Company and/or the provider. The Company can help in referring the Insured Person t o Network Dental Provider s. The Company will make a Directory of Network Dental Providers available to the Insured Person. The Insured Person can also call Customer Service at 877-816-3596 to determine which providers participate in the Network. The telep hone number for Customer Service is also on the Insured's ID card. Non-Network Benefits - these benefits apply when the Insured Person decides to obtain Covered Dental Services from non-Network Dental Providers. Insured Persons generally are required to pay more to the provider than for Network Benefits. Non -Network Benefits are determined based on the Usual and Customary Fee for similarly situated Network Dental Providers for each Covered Dental Service. The actual charge made by a non -Network Dental Provider for a Covered Dental Service may exceed the Usual and Customary Fee. Insured Persons may be required to pay a non -Network Dental Provider an amount f or a Covered Dental Service in excess of the Usual and Customary Fee. When the Insured Person obtains Covered Dental Services from non -Network Dental Providers, the Insured Person must file a claim with the Company to be reimbursed for Allowed Dental Amoun ts. What Are Covered Dental Services ? The Insured Person is eligible for benefits for Covered Dental Services listed in this section if such Dental Services are Necessary and are provided by or under the direction of a Network Dental Provider. Benefits ar e available only for Necessary Dental Services. The fact that a Dental Provider has performed or prescribed a procedure or treatment, or the fact that it may be the only available treatment for a dental disease , does not mean that the procedure or treatmen t is a Covered Dental Service under this section . What Is a Pre-Treatment Estimate ? If the charge for a Dental Service is expected to exceed $500 or if a dental exam reveals the need for fixed bridgework, the Insured Person may notify the Company of such treatment before treatment begins and receive a pre -treatment estimate. COL -17-LA (PY2 2) CERT 44 To receive a pre -treatment estimate, the Insured Person or Dental Provider should send a notice to the Company, via claim form, within 20 calendar days of the exam. If requested, the D ental Provider must provide the Company with dental x -rays, study models or other information necessary to evaluate the treatment plan for purposes of benefit determination. The Company will determine if the proposed treatment is a Covered Dental Service and will estimate the amount of payment. The estimate of benefits payable will be sent to the Dental Provider and will be subject to all terms, conditions and provisi ons of the Policy. Clinical situations that can be effectively treated by a less costly, c linically acceptable alternative procedure will be assigned a benefit based on the less costly procedure. A pre -treatment estimate of benefits is not an agreement to pay for expenses. This procedure lets the Insured Person know in advance approximately wh at portion of the expenses will be considered for payment. Does Pre-Authorization Apply? Pre-authorization is required for all orthodontic services. The Insured Person should speak to the Dental Provider about obtaining a pre -authorization before Dental Services are provided . If the Insured Person does not obtain a pre -authorization, the Compa ny has a right to deny the claim for failure to comply with this requirement. Section 2: Benefits for Pediatric Dental Services Benefits are provided for the Dental Services stated in this Section when such services are: A. Necessary. B. Provided by or un der the direction of a Dental Provider. C. Clinical situations that can be effectively treated by a less costly, dental appropriate alternative procedure will be assigned a benefit based on the least costly procedure. D. Not excluded as described in Secti on 3: Pediatric Dental Exclusions of this section . Benefits for Covered Dental Services are subject to satisfaction of the Dental Services Deductible. Network Benefits: Benefits for Allowed Dental Amounts are determined as a percentage of the negotiated contract fee between the Company and the provider rather than a percentage of the provider's billed charge. The Company's negotiated rate with the provider is ordinarily lower than the provider's billed cha rge. A Network provider cannot charge the Insured Person or the Company for any service or supply that is not Necessary as determined by the Company. If the Insured Person agrees to receive a service or supply that is not Necessary the Network provider ma y charge the Insured Person. However, these charges will not be considered Covered Dental Services and benefits will not be payable. Non-Network Benefits: Benefits for Allowed Dental Amounts from non -Network providers are determined as a percentage of th e Usual and Customary Fees. The Insured Person must pay the amount by which the non -Network provider's billed charge exceeds the Allowed Dental Amounts. The Usual and Customary Fee for Covered Dental Services provided by a non -Network provider will not be less than the Allowed Dental Amount for a similarly licensed Network provider for the same service in the same geographic region. Dental Services Deductible Benefits for pediatric Dental Services provided under this section are not subject to the Policy Deductible stated in the Policy Schedule of Benefits .
