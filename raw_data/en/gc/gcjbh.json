In this week's eSkeptic, Norman Levitt reviews John Alan Paulos' book entitled [Irreligion: A Mathematician Explains Why the Arguments for God Just Don't Add Up](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809059193?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0809059193) (Hill and Wang, 2007, ISBN 0809059193). Gimme that Old-Time Irreligion a book review by Norman Levitt The very first thing I did in drafting this review was to Google Chester Alan Arthur. I trust my readers will recall the name, if only after a bit of head-scratching, as that of one of the most obscure and unmemorable of American presidents, a run-of-the-mill New York politician who attained to the highest office in the land by virtue of the assassination of his almost equally obscure predecessor, James A. Garfield, who picked the party wheel-horse Arthur as his running mate for reasons now totally forgotten. What has this to do with John A. Paulos's recent book Irreligion? It is well known, of course, that some our most eminent presidents\u2014Jefferson, Lincoln, Madison\u2014spurned orthodoxy in religious matters, even to the point of\u2014to use Paulos's convenient title\u2014irreligion. This, of course, is sufficiently embarrassing to our fundamentalist ayatollahs that they have been furiously rewriting history, chiseling away at the facts with all the fury of the restored priests of Amun hacking off Nefertiti's heretical nose. What interested me more, however, was the question of whether disdain for religion was purely the province of politicians who where gifted intellectuals as well, or whether it was at one point so widespread and socially acceptable that even routine mediocrities, hacks, and tub-thumpers could espouse such views without being banished from public life and high office. So I picked me a president\u2014the most unmemorable I could find (Millard Fillmore is too memorable for being unmemorable)\u2014and took a peek at what is known or surmised about his religious convictions. Chester Alan Arthur fit the bill admirably. According to The Religious Views of our Presidents, by Franklin Steiner, Arthur finds his place in the list under the heading \"Presidents whose religious views were doubtful.\" In the 19th century, at least, political viability of an aspiring public figure was not unconditionally dependent on a show of religious enthusiasm. That is not to say that affected reverence for faith (as well as open hostility to the \"wrong\" faith) were absent from the political stump. Then, as now, candidates and office holders often made a big show of their ostensible piety. But they did so in a society where it was more or less understood and expected that a broad spectrum of attitudes toward religion, as such, existed, that \"freethinkers\" and \"infidels\" were part of that spectrum, and that the \"village atheist\" was a standard, and even admirable element of the intellectual scene. The celebrity of such writers as Mark Twain (a doubter) and Ambrose Bierce (an atheist outright) attests to this. The phenomenon of the atheist celebrity continued even into the first part of the 20th century, most notably in the person of America's great curmudgeon, H.L Mencken. Somehow that tradition died away by stages in the Cold War era, so much so that by the turn of the new century the Bush administration brought religion back into the White House, and in the run up to the 2008 presidential election, a loony fundamentalist preacher like Mike Huckabee was taken seriously as a presidential candidate, while the others in both parties fell into line, sincerely or otherwise, to demonstrate that their own piety was at least minimally acceptable. In particular, the presumptive Republican standard bearer John McCain, having indiscreetly uttered some home truths about the religious right in the past, had to crawl and snivel (flip-flopping extravagantly) in order to make his peace with that odious crowd before he could seize the party's crown. Paulos's Irreligion Given this religious revival, it is of more than passing interest to note the recrudescence of blatant and aggressive atheism in the past couple of years. All of a sudden, the lonely or isolated non-believer can find a veritable library of god-debunking literature to sustain him merely by taking a brief on-line tour of Amazon and the like. Note that this is no longer the cantankerous low-rent pamphleteering of a few lonely cranks or the screeds of minuscule contrarian sects, as might have been the case a decade ago. Rather, these books come from big-time commercial publishers savvy about the likelihood of finding profit in the denunciation of prophets, and from authors of some prior repute, often with heavy-caliber academic credentials. Now, mathematician John Alan Paulos, best known as the author of Innumeracy, has joined the lists with his newest book, Irreligion. Paulos deserves high praise for turning out a book that is brief, forthright, and amiable. While making the same basic points as, say, Dawkins's The God Delusion, it avoids the often choleric tone of that work, keeping a light, conversational tone where Dawkins hurls flaming rhetorical fireballs of denunciation. This is not meant as a criticism of Dawkins, whose grim disgust with the cruel absurdities of religion echoes what many of us feel in our hearts. But it does point up the fact that an atheist world-view does not necessarily lead to a foul-tempered misanthropy that is forever giving voice to searing disdain for a species that is so nasty and foolish as to delude itself into religious fervor. Paulos's cheery offhandedness, which never declines into mere diffidence, clearly makes the point that to be an atheist, one does not need to be a professional malcontent. The book is organized in a way that readers inclined to skepticism but who have never seriously studied the debate over the viability of theism will find convenient and quite useful in their private debates with friends, relatives, and even clergymen of various persuasions. Paulos lays out, seriatim, most of the classical philosophical arguments for the existence of a deity, and immediately refutes them as they arise. Thus we find the ontological argument, the argument from First Cause, the argument from design, the argument from the seeming existence of moral universals, and so forth, laid out one by one and just as soon demolished. It will be noted that these chapters are as brief as they are easygoing. Some of Paulos's critics, noting this brevity, complain that he is too brisk and thoughtless in giving such cavalier treatment to arguments so ancient and weighty, over which so many sages have wracked their brains in ages past. But this misses Paulos's larger and more important point: The hypothesis that a deity created the universe and somehow still intervenes in it is, on the face of it, an extravagant, inelegant, and superfluous supposition. It lacks any support from our direct experience of the world, nor even from the subtle and indirect inferences of modern science. Therefore, in order to make it plausible, let alone convincing, requires arguments that are clear, direct, and compelling. An enormous burden of proof lies heavy on the proponents of theism; atheism is really the default position. Paulos finds that the classical arguments cited are at best verbally dexterous, and that typically, they head into muddy and confusing ground before they get too far. In large measure, they reduce to arguments from the deployment of pompous but vacuous terminology. Therefore, there is no reason to take them all that seriously, since they flounder early and often, and are riddled with self-contradiction when picked apart by a relentlessly logical mind. Some lapses can be found in Paulos's exposition. The newly-fashionable argument from the \"irreducible complexity\" of biological systems is a mainstay of the crypto-creationist Intelligent Design movement, but Paulos's treatment of this ploy is, for once, too brief and superficial; he ought to have included some specific and concrete example of the consistency of standard evolutionary theory with claimed instances of irreducible complexity, rather than simply tossing the idea into the same pot as the argument from design in general. Likewise, a bit more might have been said about the supposed \"fine tuning\" of physical constants, especially in the light of various new hypotheses concerning the foundations of physics. Finally, I note that Paulos digresses into the famous question posed by Eugene Wigner: Why does the vast corpus of mathematical ideas developed without any applications in mind turn out to be so useful in describing what we can discover of physical reality, to the extent that it is virtually impossible to envision a \"physics\" detached from these mathematical formalisms? This, it seems to me, is a question that bears very remotely, at most, on the arguments pro and con theism, and the book needn't have considered it at all. Nevertheless, I find that Paulos's analysis is superficial and a little flaccid, especially in view of the fact that he is a professional mathematician. Wigner's question remains deep and resists an easy answer. But these minor points don't much detract from the overall value of what Paulos has given us. Irreligion will, I'm confident, take a distinguished place in what one might call the canonical literature of the New Atheism, and I highly recommend it, especially to bright youngsters who will find its occasional use of mathematical ideas pleasant rather than repellent. The New Atheism An important question remains: Why has atheism and skepticism toward religion suddenly emerged as a question of great current interest, at least among the literate, in the past few years? Clearly something has happened to break atheists of their tendency to nurture their disbelief privately and to keep their opinions to themselves. It seems obvious that politics has a lot to do with this, specifically the cultivation of the religious right as a phalanx of conservative storm troopers who are rewarded by conservative politicians by having their singular dogmas incorporated, as much as possible, into public policy. The increasing pressure on women's reproductive rights, the suppression of stem cell research, and, most egregiously, the fresh intrusion of creationism into public schools are primary instances of this. Beyond these concrete horrors, there is no escaping the fact that the miasma of compulsory religiosity has thickened and diffused throughout society. For instance, one notes, rather queasily, the success of the Evangelicals in turning the Air Force Academy into a virtual fundamentalist seminary where cadets from all sorts of backgrounds are relentlessly pressured by officers and upperclassmen into declaring for the Born-Agains. Atheists, who, despite polls, have never been all that rare, have come to mistrust the notion that they can believe as they will, undisturbed, provided they remain discreet about it. The mood fostered by the religious right seems to tend toward the inquisitorial. Scientists, in particular, representing the one vocation in which non-belief is the norm, rather than the outlier, have sensibly concluded that the culture in which they have quietly lived is being attacked at its foundations. It's one thing to send your kids to a public school where \"under god\" is formulaically recited as part of the daily Pledge of Allegiance. It's quite another to have your kid's elementary biology class interrupted by harangues against \"Darwinism\", or to see the Bible, taught as literal truth, surreptitiously introduced into the curriculum. When matters have come to that pass, scientists, among others, see little point in not fighting back openly. Thus one now sees a torrent of books, largely by scientists and sympathetic philosophers, striking back, not only at the enemies of stem-cell research and the proponents of Intelligent Design Theory, but at the very roots of the cultural tic that provides these miscreants such fertile ground: supernatural religion predicated upon a supreme being. Then, too, one must consider the possibility that as the ostensible religious uniformity of the nation begins to dissolve, the sort of person who habitually responds to questionnaires about faith by listing himself as \"unaffiliated, but a believer\" has, at long last become more honest with himself and with the rest of us, frankly acknowledging the deep vein of skepticism underlying his disinclination to become a churchgoer. I suspect that many of the readers of the New Atheists' books fall into this category, and are more willing to let their doubts see the light of day. The Return of the Suppressed The new boldness of atheists and nonbelievers is not so much a novel development as an unconscious return to the mindset of an earlier century. Contrary to the standard myth of progress, America spent many years going backwards in point of publicly-acceptable attitudes toward religion, even as Western Europe eagerly abandoned its historical obedience to Christianity, and turned itself into a society where atheism is pretty much the norm, the persistence of officially-established churches and similar vestigial institutions notwithstanding. I don't expect America to move that far that fast. Religion still has its claws into too many people and communities; one doubts that the airwaves will soon be full of clear-channel radio stations proclaiming the indispensability of skepticism and the savage wrongheadedness of biblical literalism. All the same, our supposedly provincial forebears seem to be on the brink of vindication. One of these days, we may well see a major election where a candidate needn't supply the press with a photo-op of him or herself and family dutifully sitting through an acceptable church service. (Indeed, we may already have witnessed such a miracle in the election of Socialist Bernie Sanders as U.S. Senator from Vermont!) In my search for relevant historical minutia, I discovered that even the much-despised Millard Fillmore ought to be regarded as a secularist hero for our time. It seems that as a New York legislator, Fillmore led the fight to enable citizens unwilling to swear an oath to a Divine Being to give testimony in state courts nonetheless. Politicians with that kind of principle and that kind of guts are still in short supply, certainly on the right. But one might hope that the increasing eagerness of atheists like Paulos to go public with their beliefs will have a positive effect on the yet-unfulfilled struggle to have this country and its social institutions truly respect freedom of opinion. Don't Be Such a Scientist! Over the past several episodes, Skepticality has interviewed some of the notable scientists featured in the new pro-Intelligent Design documentary Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed. This week, the last word on the controversy goes to Dr. Randy Olson, the biologist-turned-filmmaker whose 2006 documentary [Flock of Dodos: The Evolution - Intelligent Design Circus](http://www.flockofdodos.com/) examined the communication breakdown between the science community and the rest of the world on the subject of evolution. Dr. Olson strives to improve the reputation of science in the court of public opinion, where the Religious Right and Intelligent Design movements continue to wedge their way in by \"teaching the controversy.\" On his [Shifting Baselines blog](http://scienceblogs.com/shiftingbaselines/), Dr. Olson was one of the first scientists to express concern that the well-funded Expelled was likely to succeed in selling its message to a tremendous number of people.

Could any creatures appear to be more different? Yet both are large-brained intelligent mammals with complex communication and social interaction. In the first book to study apes and dolphins side by side, Maddalena Bearzi and Craig B. Stanford, a dolphin biologist and a primatologist who have spent their careers studying these animals in the wild, combine their insights with compelling results that teaches us about another large-brained mammal: Homo sapiens. Noting that apes and dolphins have had no common ancestor in nearly 100 million years, Bearzi and Stanford describe the parallel evolution that gave rise to their intelligence. They detail their subjects' ability to develop family bonds, form alliances, and care for their young. They offer an understanding of their culture, politics, social structure, personality, and capacity for emotion. The resulting dual portrait \u2014 with striking overlaps in behavior \u2014 is key to understanding the nature of \"beautiful minds.\" [LA Times.com: Marxist professors or sensitive students?](#dustup) [Expelled Exposed, Part 3: The Expelled Case of Caroline Crocker](#part3) [Expelled Exposed, Part 4: Was Guillermo Gonzalez \"Expelled\"?](#part4) [lecture this Sunday: Dr. Craig Stanford](#lecture) Film Parody Sexpelled: No Intercourse Allowed Anticipating success with their feature film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, Producers Mark Mathis, Logan Craft and Walt Ruloff have already leaked a teaser trailer for the film's sequel. Their \"teach the controversy\" slogan seemed to work well in getting the general public to believe that Intelligent Design is a viable alternative scientific theory to Evolution, so the team has moved on to promoting other theories that they feel are being suppressed by the scientific community. Sexpelled: No Intercourse Allowed tells of how Sex Theory has thrived unchallenged in the ivory towers of academia, as the explanation for how new babies are created. Proponents of Stork Theory claim that \"Big Sex\" has been suppressing their claim that babies are delivered by storks. Furthermore, Stork Theory proponents warn of the serious moral dangers posed by teaching children that sex has a function. They point out that evil dictators such as Hitler, Stalin and Mao all believed in Sex Theory, and they may have even had sex themselves. There is also a late-breaking new development in the controversy, a new theory called Avian Transportation Theory. Unlike the original Stork Theory, the modern, sophisticated \"Avian Transportation Theory\" (ATT) merely points out that there are gaps in the orthodox Sex Theory, and that current sonogram imaging is unreliable. Moreover ATT does not specify that babies are necessarily brought by storks but by \"large birds unspecified\" (although many individual ATT theorists PRIVATELY believe it is a stork). Open Letter to a Victim of Ben Stein's Propaganda Film On Friday April 18 I received a disturbing letter from someone who had just seen Ben Stein's Expelled. I forwarded it to several friends and colleagues, wondering aloud whether this might be an unintended consequence of the film. Richard Dawkins wrote a brilliant reply to my correspondent, posted on his wesite, which is well worth reading. \u2014Michael Shermer An LA Times DUST UP Marxist professors or sensitive students? All last week Michael Shermer and Greg Lukianoff engaged in a daily debate through the Los Angeles Times on academic freedom, tenure, political correctness, speech codes, free speech on college campuses, and the like. The editors encouraged Shermer and Lukianoff to really take the gloves off and take a strong stand. Shermer is well known to readers of eSkeptic. Greg Lukianoff is a constitutional lawyer and the president of the [Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE)](http://www.thefire.org/) which defends the basic rights of students and faculty members on campuses across the country. He is a frequent guest on national TV news programs, radio, and has published articles for The Boston Globe, The Chronicle of Higher Education, Inside Higher Education, as well as many others. He is also a [blogger](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-lukianoff) for the Huffington Post. In this week's eSkeptic, we present Part 3 and 4 of the articles debunking claims made in Ben Stein's new documentary film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed. The first article is by Carrie Sager and Andrea Bottaro. The second article is by Lauri Lebo. Carrie Sager is Project Assistant at the National Center for Science Education in Oakland, California, and editor of the [Expelled Exposed website](http://www.expelledexposed.com). Her book Voices for Evolution, a collection of pro-evolution statements from scientific, educational, religious and civil liberties organizations, will be out this spring. Andrea Bottaro is an immunologist and Associate Professor at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, and in his own opinion he has been involved in the evolution-Creationism controversy for far too long. His works on the matter have appeared in a number of venues, including the group blog [The Panda's Thumb](http://www.pandasthumb.org/). Lauri Lebo is the author of [The Devil in Dover: An Insider's Story of Dogma v. Darwinism in Small-Town America](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595582088?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1595582088) (New Press, May 2008, ISBN 1595582088) The Expelled Case of Caroline Crocker Academic Freedom Martyr or Pseudoscience Hack? by Carrie Sager and Andrea Bottaro \"[My supervisor] said 'nonetheless you have to be disciplined', and I lost my job.\" \u2014 Caroline Crocker, in trailer for Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed Caroline Crocker was a non-tenure track, term contract faculty at both George Mason University and Northern Virginia Community College, with a handful of low-level publications from her graduate student years and no post-doctoral research experience when she was prominently quoted in the prestigious science magazine Nature. [1](#note01) Alas, this was not due to any scientific discovery she had made, but to the fact that she had introduced \"Intelligent Design\" in her cell biology classes at GMU, and following student complaints had been instructed by her department to stop teaching about either ID or evolution. Later, her contract at GMU was not renewed. In Nature, Dr. Crocker piously remarked that she did not mean to start a controversy at GMU, but the record shows that she immediately started wearing her mantle of ID \"martyr\" loudly and proudly, with her name being prominently mentioned by ID advocates on the internet. Within a year, she was the willing and cooperative subject of a long Washington Post article [2](#note02) which, by highlighting the questionable contents of her lectures at Northern Virginia, may have caused her contract there to also expire without renewal. Since then, she has participated in pro-Creationist documentaries sponsored by Coral Ridge Ministries, [3](#note03) and is currently featured in the film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed. As a likely result of her vocal prominence in the ID/Creationist movement, she is now the executive director of the Intelligent Design and Evolution Awareness (IDEA) Center, a national ID group for students, and according to her web site, [4](#note04) she lectures to \"churches and educational institutions\" for fees ranging from $1,000 to $5,000. She is also writing a book about her travails and, under her maiden name, offers tutoring services for students in the Washington, DC area. Although in interviews and trailers for Expelled Dr. Crocker and her documentary host Ben Stein repeatedly claim she \"lost her job,\" the facts show that, less dramatically, her contracts at both GMU and NVCC were allowed to continue through their natural terms and were simply not renewed. Although this indeed must have been disappointing for Dr. Crocker, it is certainly not uncommon: about 70 percent of instructional faculty members at U.S. universities work on term contracts, many as \"visiting\" or \"adjunct\" professors as Dr. Crocker was, without any long-term guarantees. [5](#note05) \"And I said I mentioned Intelligent Design on a couple of slides but I did not teach creationism\" \u2014 Caroline Crocker, in trailer for Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed Because there is no denying that the pro-ID and creationist material Dr. Crocker taught in her classes, together with her reaction to departmental and public criticism about it, played a role in the events that followed, it is worth examining exactly what she actually told her students. Fortunately, Dr. Crocker has voluntarily provided abundant material about the matter in her contacts with the media. For instance, in the Washington Post article Crocker is described as initially telling the reporter she would discuss \"the strengths and weaknesses of evolution,\" then proceeding to unleash on her NCVV students a barrage of Creationist talking points. Finally, following the reporter's remark at the end of the lecture that she did not introduce any existing evidence in favor of evolution, Crocker volunteered that she doesn't believe there is much, and that she doesn't think it is necessary to teach any at all. The actual contents of the lecture described in the Washington Post article \u2014 by her own admission the same material she had previously taught at GMU \u2014 sound like a compendium of discredited arguments from bad Creationist literature. Crocker \"told the students there were two kinds of evolution: microevolution and macroevolution. Microevolution is ... quite different from macroevolution. No one has ever seen a dog turn into a cat in a laboratory.\" Leaving aside the obvious absurdity of dogs turning into cats being evidence for evolution, this statement is both incorrect and misleading. The term \"macroevolution\" is used by biologists to describe change above the species level, for which evidence exists in both laboratories and in nature. Microevolution is also not \"quite different\" from macroevolution: microevolution is a necessary part of macroevolution, and although the extent to which small genetic changes accumulating in a population contribute to the larger changes observed at higher taxonomic levels is a matter of debate among scientists, no one questions that the same type of well-characterized molecular processes (such as DNA mutation and recombination) which cause one to also underlie the other. Most importantly, however, this statement implies that microevolution is the primary evidence for macroevolution, when there is significant and overwhelming independent evidence for the latter in geology, biochemistry, anatomy and genetics. [6](#note06) Crocker is also reported telling her students that the Miller-Urey experiment, which demonstrated that amino acids and other biomolecules could have formed spontaneously from chemicals on early Earth, and the famous studies on the role of natural selection in peppered moth coloration by the British geneticist Bernard Kettlewell were \"irrelevant\" or \"falsified,\" suggesting that scientists are clinging to inaccurate or even fraudulent experiments to prop up a failed theory. The problem is that these reported criticisms, while still popular among Creationists, were debunked long ago by scientists. [7](#note07) Most importantly, recent replication of the Miller-Urey experiment (with updated conditions), as well as of Kettlewell's research on moths, have fully confirmed the initial conclusions of both studies. [8](#note08) Even more damning to Dr. Crocker's claims is a documentary about her case sponsored by Coral Ridge Ministries, [3](#note03) a large Christian fundamentalist outfit headed by televangelist James Kennedy. The documentary includes actual slides provided by Crocker (screen captures of which are available online [9](#note09)), and although it's not known whether she used the same slides while teaching at GMU, the Washington Post article strongly indicates that they were part of her NCVV lectures. Looking at these slides, Crocker shows either a shocking ignorance of evolutionary science, or a rather shameless willingness to distort the truth. The following are just a small sample of her claims: Archeopteryx [sic] is a bird (like an Ostrich), not a reptobird Only one complete fossil, and has been questioned as a fraud Archaeopteryx is indeed classified as a bird by scientists, but this does not preclude it from being a transitional form (it has teeth and a long bony tail, among the large number of reptilian characteristics it possesses that modern birds lack). [10](#note10) Note as well that \"reptobird\" seems to be a term entirely of Crocker's invention. Contrary to what Dr. Crocker's slide suggests, there are several well-preserved Archaeopteryx fossils, and while it is true that a few people (none of them a paleontologist or biologist) claimed in the 1980s that the original fossil was a fraud, the allegation was quickly shown to be baseless (even the pre-eminent Creationist organization Answers in Genesis lists this as an argument against evolution that should not be used, because it is clearly false!) [11](#note11) Eohippus is same as modern-day hyrax Eohippus is an extinct transitional form in the horse family lineage, while the hyrax is a small mammal with some primitive characteristics, part of the larger group of original African mammals (which includes diverse animals such as aardvarks, elephants and manatees). The identity of the hyrax and the eohippus is an old claim from Young Earth Creationists, but simply looking at the two types of skulls makes it obvious that these are two completely different animals. [12](#note12) In another slide, titled \"Scientists are confused\", Crocker following [sic] \"There is no speciation causes significant morphological change.\" Werner [sic] von Braun (rocket scientist): \"It is unscientific to teach evolution only.\" This is an example of the long tradition of Creationists misusing quotations from legitimate scientific sources. [13](#note13) We could not verify the von Braun quote here, but even assuming it is genuine, it is unclear why one should pay particular attention to the opinion of the long-dead German rocket scientist with respect to evolution and the teaching thereof. As for the first quote, the correct, original version is: \"But continuing unhappiness, justified this time, focuses upon claims that speciation causes significant morphological change, for no validation of such a position has emerged.\" [14](#note14) In this case, while Dr. Crocker's slide gives the impression that eminent evolution scientists expressed doubts and confusion about the evolutionary concepts of speciation and morphological change, what Gould and Eldredge were discussing was specifically whether the two evolutionary phenomena (speciation, i.e. the reproductive isolation of two closely related lineages of organisms, and changes in their morphology) should be expected to occur at the same time, as well as whether and how the former was necessarily associated with the latter. After discussing the implications of the various possibilities in light of the fossil record and their own evolutionary model of \"punctuated equilibria\", Gould and Eldredge argue for a successful explanation: We believe that the solution to this dilemma may be provided in a brilliant but neglected suggestion of Futuyma. He holds that morphological change may accumulate anywhere along the geological trajectory of a species. But unless that change be \"locked up\" by acquisition of reproductive isolation (that is, speciation), it cannot persist or accumulate and must be washed out during the complexity of interdigitation through time among varying populations of a species. Thus, species are not special because their origin permits a unique moment for instigating change, but because they provide the only mechanism for protecting change. [14] Hardly the words of \"confused\" scientists! To speak to the larger point, it is simply false to claim that teaching about Intelligent Design and Creationism in higher education institutions is not allowed. In fact, quite ironically, the ID-supporting web site ResearchID.org proudly lists \"100+ universities and colleges\" that officially include \"intelligent design in their lesson plans\" [15](#note15) and probably even more academic institutions discuss other forms of Creationism, such as Young- and Old-Earth Creationism and other creation myths from various cultures. These courses examine ID and Creationism objectively and in their appropriate context, and their instructors do so openly. The problem with Dr. Crocker was that she attempted to sneak ID and Creationism in classes where they did not belong, and to teach obvious scientific falsehoods in order to support them. If Caroline Crocker was unable or unwilling to teach accurate science, George Mason University and Northern Virginia Community College were entirely justified in judging her performance negatively, and in not renewing her contracts. Caroline Crocker is not a victim of scientific persecution, but the students who took her courses are victims of misinformation.

Intelligent Design and Tenure at Iowa State University by Lauri Lebo On December 3, 2007, Casey Luskin and Rob Crowther of the pro-intelligent design Discovery Institute huddled in a small conference room of Iowa's capitol building in Des Moines. Before a group of about 25 people, they were there to discuss astronomer Guillermo Gonzalez's response to Iowa State University over its decision to deny him tenure. Joining them were the assistant professor's attorneys and state Sen. David Hartsuch, a conservative Iowa Republican. The university was risking a lawsuit, they hinted darkly, pending the rejection of an appeal to the Board of Regents. The Discovery Institutute and Gonzalez's assertion is that there were \"secret tenure deliberations\" to oust Gonzalez because of his support of intelligent design. Despite the initial fanfare, no lawsuit has yet been filed. Instead, Gonzalez's tale is featured in the film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, which purports to uncover the fact that university scientists around the country are being persecuted for their pursuit of intelligent design-related research. The problem is that the film makes a rather spurious argument. While Gonzalez's support of intelligent design, as it related to the role it played in his academic performance, appears to have been considered in the review process, a closer examination of the details reveals other factors led to the denial. For instance, filmmakers neglect to bring up the fact that in all his years at Iowa State Gonzalez had only brought in only a tiny amount of grant money when compared to the funding brought in by his colleagues. Nor do they mention the fact that Gonzalez failed to mentor a single one of his students at Iowa State through to their Ph.D. Nor does it tell viewers that while initially his publication record was terrific, during his years at Iowa State, it had significantly dropped. Issues of tenure are complicated. Much is at stake, not only for the professor under review, but the university as well. The decision is whether or not to grant an employee a position for life. During the intense scrutiny of the process, the candidate's performance and accomplishments are carefully reviewed in order to assess future potential and value to the university. Grant funding, the number of scientific papers published, the quality of the research and the prestige of the publications, and the performance of one's graduate students are all considered. Tenure is not automatically granted and it is folly to treat it as if it were so. Of the twelve candidates in the Iowa State physics department in the last decade, four were denied. [1](#ref01) Born in Havana, Cuba, Gonzalez came to the U.S. and received his Ph.D. in astronomy in 1993 from the University of Washington. He has done post-doctoral work at the University of Texas, Austin and at the University of Washington. Working with his colleagues in Washington, he published many papers early in his career and his work was considered initially to be quite promising. In 2001, he joined the faculty in Iowa State's Astronomy and Physics Department as an assistant professor of astronomy. A year earlier, Gonzalez received a Templeton grant to research material for The Privileged Planet (Regnery Publishing), a pro-intelligent design book co-written by Jay W. Richards, which argues for a creator based on the fact that \"the laws of physics are too precisely 'fine-tuned' for the existence of complex life.\" While filmmakers and the Discovery Institute make much of Gonzalez's 68 peer-reviewed papers published throughout his career, a look at the date of the publications reveals that his productivity had begun to drop off dramatically while he was still at University of Washington and before he joined the faculty at Iowa State. [2](#ref02) By the time he had completed The Privileged Planet in 2004, his published work had dropped precipitously. The work he has published in recent years was based on re-evaluations of data he had previously collected or other people's data. [3](#ref03) In addition to his declining publication record, Gonzalez brought in far fewer research grants than his colleagues. The average tenured faculty in Iowa State's physics and astronomy department collected $1.3 million in grants during their first six years. Gonzalez brought in, at most, $200,000 during the same amount of time, $64,000 of which was used to pay a doctoral student at a different university and $58,000 of which was for The Privileged Planet. As his tenure documents were up for review, the Discovery Institute promised him a five-year, $50,000 grant. [4](#ref04) Gonzalez said he did not currently have any grants through NASA or the National Science Foundation, the two agencies that would normally support his research. And even though he had been at Iowa State since 2001, none of his graduate students had completed their doctoral work at the time tenure was denied. It's also important to note that while Templeton Foundation awarded Gonzalez the grant, the money was to be used \"to support scientific research on the dynamical and compositional properties of the sun with respect to other local stars.\" In a June 29 letter to the Chronicle for Higher Learning, Pamela Thompson, a vice president at the John Templeton Foundation wrote, \"Professor Gonzalez made it sound as if in some way the John Templeton Foundation had supported his study of intelligent design. This is not true. The foundation does not support research programs that deny large areas of well-documented scientific knowledge.\" But in Expelled, Gonzalez supporters ignore these points and, instead, argue this is a case of academic bullying. At the December press conference, the Discovery Institute's Luskin and Crowther released university e-mails that purported to reveal a bias against Gonzalez's belief in intelligent design. Dr. Eli Rosenberg, chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, wrote in Gonzalez's tenure dossier, according to the material released by the Discovery Institute, \"The problem here is that Intelligent Design is not a scientific theory. Its premise is beyond the realm of science ... But it is incumbent on a science educator to clearly understand and be able to articulate what science is and what it is not. The fact that Dr. Gonzalez does not understand what constitutes both science and a scientific theory disqualifies him from serving as a science educator.\" [5](#ref05) But that Gonzalez's colleagues had long opposed intelligent design was certainly no secret. In the summer of 2005, 120 Iowa State science professors issued a statement denouncing intelligent design as contrary to science.6 Their position is no different than those of Michael Behe's Lehigh University colleagues, who have posted a similiarly worded declaration on their Department of Biological Science's web page. While personal beliefs should not taken into account in the tenure review process, a proficiency in understanding the basic rules of science stands out as a significant, fair and necessary consideration. The problem with Gonzalez's belief in intelligent design is that, as Judge John E. Jones III ruled in his landmark 2005 decision in Kitzmiller v. Dover, a \"reasonable, objective observer would, after reviewing both the voluminous record in this case, and our narrative, would reach the inescapable conclusion that ID is an interesting theological argument, but that it is not science.\" His words echo the official position of the American Astronomical Society, the major U.S. organization for professional astronomers, which states: In recent years, advocates of \"Intelligent Design,\" have proposed teaching \"Intelligent Design\" as a valid alternative theory for the history of life. Although scientists have vigorous discussions on interpretations for some aspects of evolution, there is widespread agreement on the power of natural selection to shape the emergence of new species. Even if there were no such agreement, \"Intelligent Design\" fails to meet the basic definition of a scientific idea: its proponents do not present testable hypotheses and do not provide evidence for their views that can be verified or duplicated by subsequent researchers. It should be noted that in the interest of academic freedom, Gonzalez may legitimately disagree with the position of his professional society. But when he makes such remarks as, \"The questions that I ask in my Intelligent Design research are perfectly legitimate scientific questions,\" it's hard to ignore the fact that he is saying his work in intelligent design needs to be judged on its own merits. Also, he included The Privileged Planet in his dossier, making it evident that the tenure committee was to consider it as part of his body of work. The message is clear: Gonzalez and his supporters tout his work as it relates to intelligent design. If so, than his record of significant work on the subject should be taken into account as to whether to grant him tenure. As it is, he has produced little beyond The Privileged Planet. However, the Discovery Institute's Luskin and Crowther argued at the press conference that when it comes to judging the scientific validity of Gonzalez's research, it is unfair to take intelligent design into consideration. If that's the case, then shouldn't his colleagues be permitted to consider how much time he was spending on non-scientific pursuits instead of more productive research? The point of Gonzalez's story is that Expelled and the Discovery Institute want to treat those professors embracing scientifically vacuous ideas as martyrs. They're not. And even as they raise an outcry over the legitimate issues of tenure, they ignore the very real mistreatment of professionals who have truly lost jobs over intelligent design. For example, on the same day that Discovery Institute was holding its press conference, the New York Times ran a story about Christine Castillo Comer. The Texas Education Agency's director of science had just been fired for forwarding an e-mail about a talk by Barbara Forrest on the subject of intelligent design's creationist links \u2014 \"a subject on which which we must remain neutral,\" according to Comer's dismissal letters. Comer's firing over an e-mail about a talk by Forrest, who during the Kitzmiller trial provided damning testimony exposing the intelligent design community's creationist connections, comes at a time when the Texas Board of Education is rewriting its state educational standards in an effort, scientists believe, to make them more critical of evolutionary theory. Yet despite the very strong appearance of persecution by anti-evolution officials, Expelled and the Discovery Institute have not said anything on Comer's behalf in the name of academic freedom. Even though intelligent has been thoroughly rejected by the professionals in his field, Gonzalez's defenders say his anti-scientific views and research should not be judged in his tenure decision. Such a notion is as ridiculous as arguing that physicians should ignore a fellow professional's refusal to follow the rules of germ theory. Yet, they remain silent when a veteran educator is fired for political reasons by people who want to use intelligent design and its latest evolved incarnation of \"teaching the controversy\" as a wedge to drive their religious views into science class. The irony, of course, is when colleagues actually do hold intelligent design up to the same standards of scientific scrutiny that its adherents publicly demand, Expelled and the Discovery Institute are the first ones to cry foul.

Ben Stein's Blunder In a new documentary film \u2014 Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed \u2014 the actor, game show host and financial columnist Ben Stein falls for the pseudoscience of Intelligent Design by Michael Shermer In 1974 I matriculated at Pepperdine University as a born-again Christian who rejected Darwinism and evolutionary theory, not because I knew anything about it (I didn't) but because I thought that in order to believe in God and accept the Bible as true that you had to be a creationist. What I knew about evolution came primarily from creationist literature, so when I finally took a course in evolutionary theory in graduate school I realized that I had been hoodwinked. What I discovered is a massive amount of evidence from multiple sciences \u2014 geology, paleontology, biogeography, zoology, botany, comparative anatomy, molecular biology, genetics and embryology \u2014 demonstrating that evolution happened. It was with some irony for me, then, that I saw Ben Stein's anti-evolution documentary film, Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, opens with the actor, game show host and speech writer for Richard Nixon addressing a packed audience of adoring students at Pepperdine University, apparently falling for the same trap I did. Actually they didn't. The biology professors at Pepperdine assure me that their mostly Christian students fully accept the theory of evolution. So who were these people embracing Stein's screed against science? Extras. According to Lee Kats, Associate Provost for Research and Chair of Natural Science at Pepperdine, \"the production company paid for the use of the facility just as all other companies do that film on our campus\" but that \"the company was nervous that they would not have enough people in the audience so they brought in extras. Members of the audience had to sign in and the staff member reports that no more than two to three Pepperdine students were in attendance. Mr. Stein's lecture on that topic was not an event sponsored by the university.\" And this is one of the least dishonest parts of the film. At the Crossroads of Conspiracy Ben Stein came to my office to interview me about what I was told was a film about \"the intersection of science and religion\" called Crossroads (yet another deception). I knew something was afoot with his first question to me was on whether or not I think someone should be fired for expressing dissenting views. I pressed Stein for specifics: Who is being fired for what, when and where? In my experience, people are usually fired for reasons having to do with budgetary constraints, incompetence or not fulfilling the terms of a contract. Stein finally asked my opinion on people being fired for endorsing Intelligent Design. I replied that I know of no instance where such a firing has happened. This seemingly innocent observation was turned into a filmic confession of ignorance when my on-camera interview abruptly ends there, because when I saw Expelled at a preview screening at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention (tellingly, the film is being targeted primarily to religious and conservative groups), I discovered that the central thesis of the film is a conspiracy theory about the systematic attempt to keep Intelligent Design creationism out of American classrooms and culture. Stein's case for conspiracy centers on a journal article written by Stephen Meyer, a senior fellow at the Intelligent Design think tank Discovery Institute and professor at the theologically conservative Christian Palm Beach Atlantic University. Meyer's article, \"The Origin of Biological Information and the Higher Taxonomic Categories,\" was published in the June 2004 Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington, the voice of the Biological Society with a circulation of less than 300 people. In other words, from the get-go this was much ado about nothing. Nevertheless, some members of the organization voiced their displeasure, so the society's governing council released a statement explaining, \"Contrary to typical editorial practices, the paper was published without review by any associate editor; Sternberg handled the entire review process. The Council, which includes officers, elected councilors, and past presidents, and the associate editors would have deemed the paper inappropriate for the pages of the Proceedings.\" So how did it get published? In the words of journal's managing editor at the time, Richard Sternberg, \"it was my prerogative to choose the editor who would work directly on the paper, and as I was best qualified among the editors I chose myself.\" And what qualified Sternberg to choose himself? Perhaps it was his position as a fellow of the International Society for Complexity, Information, and Design, which promotes Intelligent Design, along with being on the editorial board of the Occasional Papers of the Baraminology Study Group, a creationism journal committed to the literal interpretation of Genesis. Or perhaps it was the fact that he is a signatory of the Discovery Institute's \"100 Scientists who Doubt Darwinism\" statement. Meyer's article is the first Intelligent Design paper ever published in a peer-reviewed journal, but it deals less with systematics (or taxonomy, Sternberg's specialty) than it does paleontology, for which many members of the society would have been better qualified than he to peer review the paper (in fact, at least three members were experts on the Cambrian invertebrates discussed in Meyer's paper). Meyer claims that the \"Cambrian explosion\" of complex hard-bodied life forms over 500 million years ago could not have come about through Darwinian gradualism. The fact that geologists call it an \"explosion\" leads creationists to glom onto the word as a synonym for \"sudden creation.\" After four billion years of an empty earth, God reached down from the heavens and willed trilobites into existence ex nihilo. In reality, according to paleontologist Donald Prothero, in his 2007 magisterial book [Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why it Matters](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b127HB) (Columbia University Press), \"The major groups of invertebrate fossils do not all appear suddenly at the base of the Cambrian but are spaced out over strata spanning 80 million years \u2014 hardly an instantaneous 'explosion'! Some groups appear tens of millions of years earlier than others. And preceding the 'Cambrian explosion' was a long slow buildup to the first appearance of typical Cambrian shelled invertebrates.\" If an Intelligent Designer did create the Cambrian life forms, it took 80 million years of gradual evolution to do it. Stein, however, is uninterested in paleontology, or any other science for that matter. His focus is on what happened to Sternberg, who is portrayed in the film as a martyr to the cause of free speech. \"As a result of publishing the Meyer article,\" Stein intones in his inimitably droll voice, \"Dr. Sternberg found himself the object of a massive campaign that smeared his reputation and came close to destroying his career.\" According to Sternberg, \"after the publication of the Meyer article the climate changed from being chilly to being outright hostile. Shunned, yes, and discredited.\" As a result, Sternberg filed a claim against the Smithsonian for being \"targeted for retaliation and harassment\" for his religious beliefs. \"I was viewed as an intellectual terrorist,\" he tells Stein. In August 2005 his claim was rejected. According to Jonathan Coddington, his supervisor at the Smithsonian Institution, Sternberg was not discriminated against, was never dismissed and in fact was not even a paid employee, but just an unpaid research associate who had completed his three-year term! Who Speaks for Science? The rest of the martyrdom stories in Expelled have similar less menacing explanations, detailed at [www.expelledexposed.com](http://www.expelledexposed.com/), where physical anthropologist Eugenie Scott and her tireless crew at the National Center for Science Education have tracked down the specifics of each case. Astronomer Guillermo Gonzales, for example, did not get tenure at Iowa State University and is portrayed in the film as sacrificed on the altar of tenure denial because of his authorship of a pro-Intelligent Design book entitled Privileged Planet (Regnery Publishing, 2004). As Scott told me, \"Tenure is based on the evaluation of academic performance at one's current institution for the previous seven years.\" Although Gonzales was apparently a productive scientist before he moved to Iowa State, Scott says that \"while there, his publication record tanked, he brought in only a couple of grants, one of which was from the Templeton Foundation to write the Privileged Planet, didn't have very many graduate students and those he had never completed their degrees. Lots of people don't get tenure, for the same legitimate reasons that Gonzales didn't get tenure.\" Tenure in any department is serious business because it means, essentially, employment for life. Tenure decisions for astronomers are based on the number and quality of scientific papers published, the prestige of the journal in which they are published, the number of grants funded (universities are ranked, in part, by the grant-productivity of their faculties), the number of graduate students who completed their program, the amount of telescope time allocated and the trends in each of these categories, indicating whether or not the candidate shows potential for continued productivity. In point of fact, according to Gregory Geoffroy, president of Iowa State University, \"Over the past ten years, four of the 12 candidates who came up for review in the physics and astronomy department were not granted tenure.\" Gonzales was one of them, and for good reasons, despite Stein's claim of his \"stellar academic record.\" For her part, Scott is presented in the film as the cultural filter for determining what is and is not science, begging the rhetorical question: just who does she think she is anyway? Her response to me was as poignant as it was instructive: \"Who is Ben Stein to say what is science and not science? None of us speak for science. Scientists vary all over the map in their religious and philosophical views, for example, Francis Collins [the evangelical Christian and Human Genome Project director], so no one can speak for science.\" From Haeckel to Hitler Even more disturbing than these distortions is the film's other thesis that Darwinism inexorably leads to atheism, Communism, Fascism and the Holocaust. Despite the fact that hundreds of millions of religious believers fully accept the theory of evolution, Stein claims that we are in an ideological war between a scientific natural worldview that leads to the gulag archipelago and Nazi gas chambers, and a religious supernatural worldview that leads to freedom, justice and the American way. The film's visual motifs leave no doubt in the viewer's emotional brain that Darwinism is leading America into an immoral quagmire. We're going to hell in a Darwinian hand basket. Cleverly edited interview excerpts from scientists are interspersed with various black-and-white clips for guilt by association with: bullies beating up on a 98-pound weakling, Charlton Heston's character in Planet of the Apes being blasted by a water hose, Nikita Khrushchev pounding his fist on a United Nations desk, East Germans captured trying to scale the Berlin Wall, and Nazi crematoria remains and Holocaust victims being bulldozed into mass graves. This propaganda production would make Joseph Goebbels proud. It is true that the Nazis did occasionally adapt a warped version of social Darwinism proffered by the 19th-century German biologist Ernst Haeckel in a \"survival of the fittest races\" mode. But this rationale was only in the service of justifying the anti-Semitism that had been inculcated into European culture centuries before. Because Stein is Jewish he surely knows that the pogroms against his people began ages before Darwin and that the German people were, in Harvard University political scientist Daniel Goldhagen's apt phrase (and book title), \"Hitler's willing executioners.\" When Stein interviewed me and asked my opinion on the impact of Darwinism on culture, he seemed astonishingly ignorant of the many other ways that Darwinism has been used and abused by political and economic ideologues of all stripes. Because Stein is a well-known economic conservative (and because I had just finished writing my book [The Mind of the Market](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/av182), a chapter of which compares Adam Smith's \"invisible hand\" with Charles Darwin's \"natural selection\"), I pointed out how the captains of industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries justified their beliefs in laissez faire capitalism through the social Darwinism of \"survival of the fittest corporations.\" And, more recently, I noted that Enron's CEO, Jeffrey Skilling, said his favorite book in Harvard Business School was Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene (first published in 1976), a form of Darwinism that Skilling badly misinterpreted. Scientific theorists cannot be held responsible for how their ideas are employed in the service of non-scientific agendas. Questioning Darwinism A final leitmotif running through Expelled is inscribed in chalk by Stein in repetitive lines on a classroom blackboard: \"Do not question Darwinism.\" Anyone who thinks that scientists do not question Darwinism has never been to an evolutionary conference. At the World Summit on Evolution held in the Galapagos Islands during June 2005, for example, I witnessed a scientific theory rich in controversy and disputation. Paleontologist William Schopf of the University of California, Los Angeles, for instance, explained that \"We know the overall sequence of life's origin, that the origin of life was early, microbial and unicellular, and that an RNA world preceded today's DNA-protein world.\" He openly admitted, however, \"We do not know the precise environments of the early earth in which these events occurred; we do not know the exact chemistry of some of the important chemical reactions that led to life; and we do not have any knowledge of life in a pre-RNA world.\" Stanford University biologist Joan Roughgarden declared that Darwin's theory of sexual selection (a specific type of natural selection) is wrong in its claim that females choose mates who are more attractive and well-armed. Calling neo-Darwinians \"bullies,\" the University of Massachusetts biologist Lynn Margulis pronounced that \"neo-Darwinism is dead\" and, echoing Darwin, she said, \"It was like confessing a murder when I discovered I was not a neo-Darwinist.\" Why? Because, Margulis explained, \"Random changes in DNA alone do not lead to speciation. Symbiogenesis \u2014 the appearance of new behaviors, tissues, organs, organ systems, physiologies, or species as a result of symbiont interaction \u2014 is the major source of evolutionary novelty in eukaryotes: animals, plants, and fungi.\" Finally, Cornell University evolutionary theorist William Provine (featured in Expelled) presented 11 problems with evolutionary theory, including: \"Natural selection does not shape an adaptation or cause a gene to spread over a population or really do anything at all. It is instead the result of specific causes: hereditary changes, developmental causes, ecological causes, and demography. Natural Selection is the result of these causes, not a cause that is by itself. It is not a mechanism.\" Despite this public questioning of Darwinism (and neo-Darwinism), which I reported on in Scientific American [\"Rumsfeld's Wisdom,\" Skeptic, by Michael Roughgarden, Margulis and Provine have not been persecuted, shunned, fired or even expelled. Why? Because they are doing science, not religion. It is perfectly okay to question Darwinism (or any other ism in science), as long as there is a way to test your challenge. Intelligent Design creationists, by contrast, have no interest in doing science at all. In the words of mathematician and philosopher William Dembski of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and a key witness in Stein's prosecution of evolution, from a 2000 speech at the National Religious Broadcasters convention in Anaheim, Calif.: \"Intelligent Design opens the whole possibility of us being created in the image of a benevolent God.... And if there's anything that I think has blocked the growth of Christ as the free reign of the Spirit and people accepting the Scripture and Jesus Christ, it is the Darwinian naturalistic view.\" When will people learn that Darwinian naturalism has nothing whatsoever to do with religious supernaturalism? By the very definitions of the words it is not possible for supernatural processes to be understood by a method designed strictly for analyzing natural causes. Unless God reaches into our world through natural and detectable means, He remains wholly outside the realm of science. So, yes Mr. Stein, sometimes walls are bad (Berlin), but other times good walls make good neighbors. Let's build up that wall separating church and state, along with science and religion, and let freedom ring for all people to believe or disbelieve what they will. The Richard Sternberg Affair Intelligent Design at the Smithsonian Institution by Ed Brayton The intelligent design (ID) movement has long labored to inculcate two mutually exclusive falsehoods in the minds of the public: A) that ID is a purely scientific theory that has nothing to do with religion; and B) that any objection to ID is evidence of bias and discrimination against religion. False claims of martyrdom and persecution are among the most useful tools they have in spreading the second falsehood, which explains the message of Expelled, a new documentary purporting to prove that ID advocates are being persecuted and hounded out of jobs and whole careers for the mere sin of bucking the \"Darwinian priesthood.\" This article will examine the film's central claim of persecution, that of Richard Sternberg. Sternberg is a staff scientist with the National Center for Biotechnology Information, a project of the National Institutes of Health. From 2001 to late 2006, he was also a Research Associate in the Department of Invertebrate Zoology at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History (NMNH). He is now a Research Collaborator in that same department. Both of those positions are courtesy appointments, unpaid appointments given to scientists that allows them access to the Smithsonian's collections, but he was not an employee of the Smithsonian. But the crux of this story stems from his position as managing editor of the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington (PBSW), a peer reviewed journal associated with the NMNH. The June 2004 issue of the PBSW, the last issue for which Sternberg acted as managing editor, included a highly controversial article entitled \"The Origin of Biological Information and the Higher Taxonomic Categories,\" written by Stephen Meyer. Meyer, whose Ph.D. is in philosophy, is the director of the Center for Science and Culture at the Discovery Institute, the nation's most influential and well recognized center advocating Intelligent Design. That article proved so embarrassing to the Biological Society of Washington (BSW) and to the Smithsonian itself that the BSW council publicly disavowed it and said that it never should have been published. And that is where this saga begins. Emails began to go back and forth among scientists and administrators at the museum asking obvious questions: how did this article get in there? Who had reviewed it? Were the regular peer review procedures followed? Who was Richard Sternberg? Was he a creationist of some sort? Did he have ties to the ID movement and the author of this paper? The answer to that last question proved most revealing. In November 2004, Sternberg filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), a branch of the Department of Justice empowered to investigate claims of discrimination by government employees. In a letter to Sternberg in August 2005, an OSC attorney named James McVay told Sternberg that they were closing the investigation due to a lack of jurisdiction; since Sternberg was not actually an employee of the Smithsonian they could not exercise any authority over decisions made in his situation. McVay's letter admits that he was \"not able to take statements and receive further paper discovery that would allow for final conclusions,\" yet he still saw fit to go into some detail about his \"preliminary conclusions\" on why he thought Sternberg's allegations had merit and how terribly he thought Sternberg had been treated. This was all quite unusual, of course; if the OSC could not complete the investigation, particularly when they could not take statements or get documents from the accused and had no authority over the situation, they should not have said anything at all about the substance of the allegations made in the complaint. Indeed, McVay's letter was highly polemical, consisting mostly of unsupported rhetoric and boilerplate aimed at those evil scientists who don't like creationism. All of this was highly inappropriate. The ID movement immediately began to hold up Sternberg as a martyr, a man being persecuted not just for being an ID advocate (in fact, they initially \u2014 and falsely \u2014 claimed he was not one) but for merely being open-minded enough to give ID advocates a fair hearing. They even managed to get a sympathetic legislator, Rep. Mark Souder (R-Indiana), to use staff of the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources, which he chaired, to prepare an unofficial report supporting those allegations. That report came out in December of 2006 and it examined all of the allegations made by Sternberg and his supporters against the Smithsonian. It was released along with an appendix consisting of memos and emails sent back and forth between Smithsonian scientists and others in the weeks and months following the publication of the Meyer paper. But a close examination of the report's arguments and conclusions reveal that most of them are flatly contradicted by the evidence in that appendix. Comparing the evidence in the appendix to the conclusions in the report leads one to several conclusions: - What little ill-treatment Sternberg may have gotten was largely self-inflicted, the result not only of his violation of procedures in regard to the Meyer paper, but in regard to several other instances of professional malfeasance and prior examples of poor judgment as PBSW editor (in fact, all of the comments expressing distrust and anger at Sternberg and urging his dismissal were made not to his face, but in private emails that he never saw). - The evidence does not support the conclusion that Sternberg was discriminated against in any material way. At absolute worst, he was greeted with professional mistrust and anger on the part of some of his colleagues, who were upset that his actions in regard to the Meyer paper brought disrepute to the Smithsonian and to them as associates. Disapproval and criticism, of course, are not the same thing as discrimination, nor are they a violation of his civil rights. - Sternberg has grossly exaggerated several alleged instances of \"retaliation\" in the early days of the scandal. In particular, he claimed that he had his keys taken away, his access to the Smithsonian's collections taken away, and lost his office space. In reality, the keys and office space were exchanged as part of larger museum changes and he retains the same access today that all others in his position have. - The accusations, in particular, against the National Center for Science Education \u2014 that they conspired with Smithsonian officials to \"publicly smear and discredit\" Sternberg \u2014 are not only not supported by the evidence in the appendix, they are completely disproven by the emails contained therein. - All of that leads to the only possible conclusion: that this is a trumped-up report orchestrated by political allies of the Discovery Institute, particularly Rep. Mark Souder and former Sen. Rick Santorum. They have put out a report that simply is not supported by the evidence and was designed, intelligently or otherwise, to support the disingenuous PR campaign that includes the attempt to position themselves as victims of discrimination. Before we get to these specific points, let's review what we know about the publication of this article. We know that a few weeks after its publication the council of the Biological Society of Washington published a statement that said: The Council, which includes officers, elected councilors, and past presidents, and the associate editors would have deemed the paper inappropriate for the pages of the Proceedings because the subject matter represents such a significant departure from the nearly purely systematic content for which this journal has been known throughout its 122-year history ... Accordingly, the Meyer paper does not meet the scientific standards of the Proceedings. We also know that Sternberg went outside the normal peer review procedures for the journal. Again, from the council's statement on the matter: Contrary to typical editorial practices, the paper was published without review by any associate editor; Sternberg handled the entire review process. Sternberg claims that he handled the entire review process because none of the associate editors were qualified and because he was the most qualified. On his webpage, he wrote: Since systematics and evolutionary theory are among my primary areas of interest and expertise (as mentioned above, I hold two Ph.D.s in different aspects of evolutionary biology), and there was no associate editor with equivalent qualifications, I took direct editorial responsibility for the paper. This was not true. Systematics (the study of taxonomy) is the subject of the PBSW and it is the subject of Sternberg's expertise, but it is not the subject of Meyer's paper. The primary subject of the paper is the Cambrian explosion and, ostensibly, bioinformatics as it pertains to the origin of the higher phyla. This is not the focus of Sternberg's research, nor does it have much of anything to do with systematics other than an obligatory discussion of how many phyla and sub-phyla originated during the Cambrian. The most appropriate reviewers, then, would be paleontologists. Among the associate editors at the time (and still today) was Gale Bishop, an expert in invertebrate paleontology. There were three other specialists on invertebrates among the associate editors as well, including current PBSW editor Stephen Gardiner, Christopher Boyko and Janet Reid, all specialists in invertebrate zoology (the Cambrian fauna was almost entirely made up of invertebrates). Yet Sternberg felt no need to let any of those people, all more qualified than him on the subject, even look at the paper, or even make them aware of its existence. The reason that this is important is because Sternberg knew that the Meyer paper \u2014 any paper advocating ID, for that matter \u2014 would be highly controversial (indeed, he admits as much on his webpage where he writes that he \"recogniz(ed) the potentially controversial nature of the paper\"). It would be doubly so because of Sternberg's close connections with the ID movement and with Meyer specifically, indeed his close connection to the material in that specific paper. In October 2002, a conference called RAPID (Research and Progress in Intelligent Design) was held at BIOLA University (formerly the Bible Institute of Los Angeles). This was a closed conference \u2014 only ID advocates were allowed to attend. At that conference, not only did Sternberg present a pro-ID paper, but Meyer presented on the exact material that went into the paper that was eventually published. It seems rather obvious that this conference was probably where the scheme was hatched to get this paper published in the Proceedings. Indeed, Meyer has said as much, in an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education: According to the article, Meyer \"said he had chosen the journal because Mr. Sternberg attended a conference where Mr. Meyer gave an oral presentation advancing the same arguments. The two discussed the possibility of publishing the work.\" Sternberg argues that he had the authority to publish Meyer's paper. But having that authority does not excuse the professional and ethical misjudgments. If you know that the publication of a pro-ID paper in a Smithsonian journal is going to cause an outcry, and you have close ties to the ID movement and to the author of this paper specifically, the ethical thing to do would be to excuse yourself from handling that paper and allow someone without those personal and professional ties to the author and subject of the paper to decide whether it should be published. Thus, Sternberg's decision to publish the paper without the normal peer-review process is a flagrant breach of professional ethics that brought disrepute to the Smithsonian. Is it really so surprising or unjustified that he was subject to a few rude comments and treated brusquely by those who were embarrassed by his actions? In addition to that, the emails contained in the investigation provide powerful evidence that Sternberg vastly exaggerated the extent of the alleged retaliation in the aftermath of the controversy. For instance, he claimed that he had his keys, his office and his access to the collections taken away; none of those claims were true. In fact, even before the article was published, Sternberg \u2014 along with many other staff members and researchers \u2014 was informed that he would be moved to different offices because of a reorganization of the vertebrate and invertebrate zoology departments. In an email in July of 2004, Sternberg is informed, along with several others, about this reorganization and told that they would have to move offices. Sternberg was moved twice. First, as a part of the larger reorganization that involved a couple dozen people. In fact, they remodeled a room just to make sure he and another RA still had offices and workspace. Sternberg knew about and agreed to that move in July of 2004, before the paper was even published, so there is simply no way to pretend that it was done in retaliation for anything. The second move, from invertebrate zoology to vertebrate zoology, was at Sternberg's request and he remains there to this day. As far as the keys are concerned, Sternberg had a master key, which would have gotten him into anything, including private offices. As part of a larger crackdown on lax security, master keys were restricted to those who really should have them, and RAs certainly did not qualify. But Sternberg still had access to everything he ever needed access to for his research, which was never limited in any way. The report also makes a big deal out of the fact that there was discussion in the emails of whether Sternberg should be asked to resign and that people raised questions about his religious views. But given that he had just snuck in a paper that argues for a religious rather than scientific explanation into a scientific journal attached to the Smithsonian, those are hardly unreasonable questions. No one ever so much as suggested that his religious views could or should be grounds for anything; in fact, the emails explicitly argue against that. The report seems to think that the mere fact that questions were asked about an obvious aspect of the situation, that this amounts to discrimination even if no actual action was ever taken against Sternberg at all. While there was much discussion of the situation, about what improprieties had taken place and about what they might do about it, including some discussion of whether they should ask Sternberg to resign his position, in the end nothing at all was done to him. The administration ultimately concluded that there was not sufficient cause to take any action toward Sternberg, and none was ever taken. In fact, when his term as Research Associate was up, he was offered the opportunity to continue as a Research Collaborator. The report claims that they demoted him from Research Associate to Research Collaborator in retaliation, but the evidence is firmly against this conclusion. The fact is that his term as a Research Associate ends in 2007 (and would have ended with or without this controversy) and he does not have a sponsor to gain renewal of that position. His sponsor for the original RA position died two weeks after his last appointment began and sponsorship then fell, by default, to the department supervisor. But now that that RA appointment is expiring, he needs a new sponsor to get another such appointment and there is no one willing to be his sponsor. In reality, a large number of RAs were converted to RCs recently, not just him. The difference between an RA and an RC is that an RA works more closely with Smithsonian staff, which is reflected in the fact that they have a staff sponsor. Sternberg no longer has one. This is not discrimination; he is being treated exactly like anyone else who doesn't have a sponsor. They nonetheless offered him the opportunity to continue his work there as a Research Collaborator, a position which still allows him to have an office and full access to the collections he needs to do his research. But there simply is no discrimination there. Richard Sternberg to this day has the same access to the same collections that all people in his position have. Now let's look at another set of false accusations in the report, those made against the National Center for Science Education, a non-governmental non-profit organization. The report claims: NMNH officials conspired with a special interest group on government time and using government emails to publicly smear Dr. Sternberg; the group was also enlisted to monitor Sternberg's outside activities in order to find a way to dismiss him. In cooperation with the pro-evolution National Center for Science Education (NCSE), Museum officials attempted to publicly smear and discredit Dr. Sternberg with false and defamatory information. Not only is this claim not supported by the emails in the appendix, it is flatly contradicted by them. The emails that Eugenie Scott, Executive Director of the NCSE, exchanged were full of admonitions to Smithsonian personnel not to do the things they are now accused of conspiring to do. She urged them not to attack his religious views so as not to make him a martyr. Scott repeatedly tells them to focus solely on the questions of impropriety and see whether they can be proven. She also tells them that Sternberg should not be judged on the basis of his religious views or his creationist views, but solely on the basis of his work as a scientist. She says (p. 32): On the other hand, his creationist views should not be the main focus of the criticism. First, if he can do good standard science, that's all we care about. Newton did pretty good science, and had some pretty nutty additional ideas about reality, too. So if he keeps the nut stuff out of his basically descriptive work, that's fine. His science should stand or fall on its own. And in a follow up email she wrote: I guess the big question is whether he is a good enough scientist to remain there. If his non-creationist work is good, then I think he deserves the job. If not, and if others are let go under the same circumstances, then let the chips fall where they may. But none of us are after this guy's job. That isn't the point of this exercise, in my opinion. It should be noted that some of the content of those emails is disputed by Sternberg, as one would expect. Many of the situations come down to \"he said, she said\" and we have no way of knowing for certain which side is telling the truth. But given that we know that none of the actual instances of retaliation that Sternberg alleged in the beginning (the loss of keys, office space and access to the collections) ever took place, and we have strong evidence that Sternberg did improperly go outside the normal peer review process to sneak a substandard and inappropriate article in the journal on his way out the door, this certainly casts serious doubt on Sternberg's veracity. And given that so many of the claims found in the journal's conclusions are not only not supported by the evidence, but clearly contradicted by it, that certainly casts serious doubt on the objectivity of the staffers who created the report as well. We should also note that the fact that the paper was substandard, poorly reasoned and full of questionable claims has been well-established. A lengthy and detailed critique of the paper was published at the Panda's Thumb web site, written by Alan Gishlick, Nick Matzke and Wesley Elsberry. They were hardly alone in their critique. The paleontologist Ronald Jenner likewise criticized the quality of the paper, saying that it reads \"like a student report\" and calling it \"an inadequate review\" because \"readily available papers that depart significantly from his conclusions are omitted without excuse.\" Here's the bottom line: Richard Sternberg went to great lengths to sneak a substandard and inappropriate paper through the peer review procedures of the journal he was editing. His actions, unsurprisingly, caused a great deal of embarrassment to his colleagues and some of them were quite angry about it and wanted him fired. But despite a few harsh words contained in emails that he never saw prior to filing his OSC complaint, ultimately nothing discriminatory or retaliatory ever happened to Sternberg. To this day, he retains the same access to the collections at the NMNH that he had prior to this incident. The worst thing that happened to Sternberg was that his clearly unethical actions were met with the disapproval and criticism of his colleagues, which is a far cry from violating his civil liberties. The Profit of \"Free\" & the Insight of the Blind This week on Skepticality we talk to two good friends, both skeptics and podcasters making an impact in their areas of expertise. Author Scott Sigler sent a shot across the bow of mainstream publishing when, after first giving away his novel Ancestor for free as a PDF, the printed retail version then broke the Amazon.com top 10. As a result, Scott earned himself a seat at the table and a deal with Crown books. We talk to Scott about his new novel Infected \u2014 released on April 1st and already a bestseller. Slavko Halatyn (known to his many fans as simply \"Slau\") has enjoyed a rich career as both a music producer and award-winning recording artist. Derek talks with Slau about his work with other artists (like skeptical favorite George Hrab), being an early adopter of podsafe music \u2014 and the links between his career, his world view, and his becoming legally blind at the age of 21.

In this week's eSkeptic, Tim Callahan reviews R. D. Gold's book entitled [Bondage of the Mind: How Old Testament Fundamentalism Shackles the Mind and Enslaves the Spirit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0979640601?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0979640601) (Aldus Books, 2008, ISBN13 978-0979640605). Fundamental Truths by Tim Callahan Most of us involved with issues of critical thinking are accustomed to dealing with what we think of as fundamentalism, which implies specifically Christian fundamentalism. Bondage of the Mind deals, specifically, with Jewish fundamentalism. Just as evangelicalism, and particularly evangelical fundamentalism, is a potent force in Christianity, so too is modern Orthodox Judaism a potent force among Jews today. Orthodox Judaism, like fundamentalist Christianity, claims to be the only valid form of Judaism. In the process of evangelizing Jews, particularly Jewish youth, it refers to Jews who switch their allegiance from Reform Judaism to Orthodox Judaism as returnees. For those unacquainted with the three ideological branches of Judaism \u2014 Orthodox, Reform and Conservative \u2014 the origins of the split lie in the Jewish Enlightenment of the 19th century. Until the Jewish Enlightenment, most European thinkers viewed the Jews of Europe as hopelessly backward both intellectually and culturally. The encapsulation of the Jews, their segregation from the surrounding Christian society (resulting from centuries of intermittent persecution) had resulted in their intellectual isolation. While European society at large had been effectively secularized in the 1700s, in part as a reaction to the horrors of the religious wars (particularly the Thirty Years War), Jews had largely remained what they were in the Middle Ages. The spread of democratic ideologies in the 19th century led to a repudiation of anti-Semitism among at least some of the intellectuals of that day, as well as a reduction in legal isolation of the Jews. There was a resulting reaction to these reforms among Jewish intellectuals: the Jewish Enlightenment. Jews began to question the excessive importance laid upon such practices as the dietary laws and the peculiarities of dress affected by the encapsulated Jews. The end result was the repudiation of these peculiarities among those who became reformed Jews. Reformed Jews also engaged and integrated into the greater society around them. The origin of Jewish intellectualism and the impact of Jewish philosophers, mathematicians, scientists, artists, classical musicians and others \u2014 an impact out of all proportion to their numbers \u2014 dates from this 19th century enlightenment. Some Jews among those in the reform movement felt that the degree of assimilation had gone too far and made a point of returning to such practices as maintaining the dietary laws and the study of Hebrew, though they did not return to the traditional peculiarities of dress. They became the Conservative Jews. Those Jews who did not engage the greater society, who in fact resisted all such efforts, hardened their resolve to retain all the outward signs of separation, became the Orthodox Jews. We might compare this movement to the Catholic counter-reformation, which was a reaction to Protestantism. Another apt comparison from the Christian experience would be the reaction of those who became fundamentalists to the wholehearted liberal acceptance of modern scientific views, particularly to the theory of evolution, among American Protestants. For many decades fundamentalist Christians did not engage the general Protestant community and maintained in separation what they saw as the purity of their belief system. However, in the wake of the social upheavals of the 1960s, fundamentalists began to actively proselytize the general population, particularly the young. By the 1980s they had, of course, become a potent force not only in their various denominations \u2014 such the Southern Baptists, where fundamentalists ousted liberals from the leadership \u2014 but in politics as well. Bondage of the Mind deals with the active proselytizing of Orthodox rabbis, who specifically target the youth of Reformed Jewry. In his examination of the thoughts, goals and tactics of resurgent Jewish fundamentalism, Gold focuses on three tracts commonly used by Orthodox proselytizers: On Judaism by Rabbi Emanuel Feldman, Choose Life by Rabbi Ezriel Tauber, and Living Up ... to the Truth by Rabbi David Gottlieb. In the latter two titles one can see the implicit assumption of moral superiority by the Orthodox rabbis: If you accept my hyper-religious view and abandon your secularism, you will be choosing life and truth. If you disagree, you're obviously deliberately choosing lies and death. As in Christian fundamentalism, the Orthodox proselytizers target the youth among secular and Reformed Jews. In his book Misquoting Jesus, Bart Ehrman, speaking of his own involvement in evangelical Christianity in his teenage years, pointed out that those proselytizing youth for Protestant fundamentalism homed in on the insecurities and uncertainties of the young. The Orthodox proselytizers do the same thing. The person fishing for converts seems very positive and very certain of his views. He affects a paternal benevolence toward the potential convert and, lo and behold, he seems to know something about the youth's state of mind, saying, \"You're confused, aren't you?\" The youth thinks, \"How did he know that?\" Ehrman pointed out that, of course, he was confused. He was a teenager, after all. Gold begins his book with a series of chapters detailing the Old Testament's failure to live up to the Orthodox claim that it is the word of God rather than the writings of men. This begins with the failure of biblical claims to match archaeology. There is, despite exhaustive attempts on the part of biblical archaeologists \u2014 many of whom were and are either committed Christians or devout Jews \u2014 no evidence of the presence of large numbers of Hebrews in late Bronze Age Egypt (i.e. the Egyptian captivity), nor is there any evidence of either the Exodus or the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites as detailed in the Book of Joshua. Nor is there any evidence of the united monarchy under David and Solomon. Further, while the Bible claims that the army of Sennacherib, King of Assyria, which was besieging Jerusalem, was miraculously annihilated by the angel of the Lord in a single night and that King Hezekiah triumphed over the Assyrians (2 Kings 19:35-37), history and archaeology instead support the Assyrian version of events, that Sennacherib sacked and devastated every city of Judah but Jerusalem, and that Hezekiah paid a huge tribute to the Assyrians just to hang on to Jerusalem and its environs. Gold also details the failure of the biblical claim of divine retribution and the failure of biblical prophecies. A spectacular example of the good being punished, while the bad obviously get off free is to be found at the end of 2 Kings. Manasseh, the evil king of Judah who worshipped other gods, and consulted soothsayers and wizards, enjoyed a long and peaceful reign (692-639 BCE, 53 years), while King Josiah, the greatest among Judah's reformers was killed in battle when he was only 37. Josiah was only eight when he took the throne. He reigned from 638-609 BCE, a total of 29 years, much of it when he was in his minority. So why did the evil King Manasseh prosper, while the good King Josiah was cut off in his youth? The Bible explains it this way (2 Kings 23:25-26): And like unto him there was no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and all his soul, and all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him. Notwithstanding, the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal. So, there you have it. According to the Bible, God kills the good for the sins of the evil and punishes the people for wrongdoing on the part of their king. It reminds one of the old vaudeville routine: \"The act before me was so bad, the audience was still booing when I got off the stage.\" Apologists, both Christian and Jewish, have wrestled with the passage above, often indulging in bizarre convolutions of logic to explain why it really makes sense and shows that God is good and just in killing Josiah, while not punishing Manasseh. Gold next takes on the Orthodox dogma of the unique survival of the Jewish people, one of their main arguments for the Jews being God's specifically chosen people. The argument goes like this: No people in history has suffered the way the Jews have. By all rights, the Jewish people should be extinct by now. Yet, not only have they miraculously survived the Holocaust, but, against all probability, they have returned to Israel and revived their ancient nation. Gold points out that the Jews aren't the only people with an ancient pedigree to survive into the modern age (p. 91): Nor is the survival of the Jewish people for thousands of years the unique phenomenon the Orthodox like to claim that it is. The Basques, for example, have been around a lot longer than the Jews have. In fact, the Basque presence in the Pyrenees predates recorded history. The most recent genetic evidence suggests that they have survived in place for some forty thousand years, more than ten times the duration of an identifiable Jewish culture. And in (for them) modern times they handily survived violent passages of Carthaginians, Romans, Moors, Franks and Nazis. Gold goes from this example and others into a detailed argument pointing out that, while the survival of the Jews in the face of diasporas and pogroms is remarkable it can be explained without divine intervention. All of this leads up to Chapter 10, titled \"The Fallacy of a Superior Fundamentalist Morality.\" One can consider this to be in many ways the grand climax of the book. I call it the book's killer chapter, and, at 44 pages, it's a bit of a killer to get through, but well worth the effort. Gold begins the chapter by citing numerous passages from Rabbi Feldman's On Judaism, which attack today's society that characterize it as profoundly materialistic, miserable, hedonistic and without meaning. Only by returning to the rock-solid values of Orthodoxy can young Jews find their way out of this secular morass. Gold points out that Feldman uses certain emotionally loaded words to slant his critique of all society not part of Orthodox Judaism. He pinpoints the Orthodox strategy and its logical flaws very nicely on page 128: What Feldman and Gottlieb are doing is pretty obvious. They are attempting to capitalize on the general, vague belief that a loosening of religious standards inevitably leads to a loosening of moral standards. There are two serious defects with this tactic. First, one can make a strong argument \u2014 and shortly I do \u2014 that strict religious standards often involve practices that many would call highly immoral. I am not referring to the devout believer who goes astray. I am talking about beliefs and practices that are embedded in the religious doctrines themselves. After pointing out that Western society, despite its problems is still the one in which men and women enjoy the greatest personal freedom, Gold turns his attention to the problem of what values Orthodox Judaism would replace the secular freedoms we currently enjoy. First, he points out the intolerance of the Orthodox for other forms of Judaism. In 2001 Israel's Supreme Court ruled that Israeli citizens converted to Judaism by non-Orthodox rabbis were to be registered as Jews. This hardly seems a radical move; but the response from the Orthodox was that the decision was scandalous and disastrous. Gold then examines the position of women in Orthodox Judaism. Not only are women excluded from participation in religious services, they aren't likely to be treated as fully human outside that context either. Gold relates (p. 137) the nature of an interview given to Deborah Sontag by Rabbi Menacham Mendel Taub in 2000. Questions and answers were related through a secretary, since the rabbi didn't take questions from women, and assistants placed a barrier between Sontag and the Rabbi, so he wouldn't have to even see her. Orthodox males recite a blessing each morning thanking God \"for not making me a woman.\" One of the great reforms of the Jewish Enlightenment was to give women the right to an education. Gold also points out that Orthodox rabbis don't seem to think they should be accountable to government oversight, or, indeed, accountable to anyone at all (p. 148): Consider what Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of the Shas Party in Israel ... had to say in 2000 about the then minister of education, Yossi Sarid. Apparently the rabbi was upset that Sarid wanted more oversight of Shas schools because of what could politely be called \"irregularities.\" Yosef was also riled because Aryeh Deri, the Shas political leader had been indicted on charges of graft and corruption... [During a television broadcast] From a synagogue in Jerusalem, the rabbi called Sarid \"Satan,\" and said that God \"extirpated Amalek so he may extirpate Sarid... Just as he showed us in killing Haman and the vengeance done on Haman, so will vengeance be done on Sarid.\" He then led his congregation in a chant of: \"Accursed is Haman. Accursed is Sarid.\" Gold goes on to say that, since this incident happened just after the assassination Yitzhak Rabin by a, notably, Orthodox Jew, Israel's Attorney General was prepared to prosecute Yosef for incitement to violence. However, because of his religious and political power, the rabbi was untouchable, and the incident was allowed to fade. Gold goes on to point out other examples of virulent Orthodox rage against any opposition, making an excellent case for the comparison of these rabbis and their followers to Muslim theocrats. Common to both groups is an implicit, and sometimes explicit, hostility towards democracy. It's not too much of a stretch to say that, should their views overwhelm opposing viewpoints in Israel's pluralist society, that nation would, in short order, be converted into a theocratic state, not unlike Iran under the Ayatollah Khomeini. Having earlier mentioned the indictment of Aryeh Deri for graft, Gold describes how, when Deri was, after a protracted process involving many appeals, convicted, crowds of the Orthodox faithful demonstrated against his (p. 158) \"martyrdom at the hands of the secular elite.\" It appears that much of the vaunted moral superiority of religious conservatives is a matter of definition as opposed to action. Definition is involved in another way in the conviction of Jack Abramoff in 2006 for tax evasion and fraud (pp. 159, 160): The intriguing question is how Abramoff, the four Hasidic men convicted of latent fraud, an others could continue to be, for all intents and purposes, observant Orthodox Jews, keeping the Sabbath, keeping kosher, offering all the prescribed blessings, going the whole nine yards of Orthodox belief, while engaging on immoral and criminal behavior. The Orthodox answer? \"[T]hat person by definition is simply not a religious person,\" says Emmanuel Feldman. But isn't that the old rhetorical trick of truth by definition that we've seen before? So, in the case of Aryeh Deri, he's a religious person who couldn't possibly be guilty of what he was guilty of, and in the case of Jack Abramoff, since he's guilty, he wasn't really a religious person anyway. This is a classic unfalsifiable position. Unfalsifiable positions are irrational and dishonest in matters pertaining to science. In matters pertaining to ethics, they are downright reprehensible. Other examples of reprehensible behavior on the part of the Orthodox revealed by Gold involve Orthodox authorities shielding rabbis known to have sexually abused teenagers and children from exposure and prosecution (pp. 160-162). Considering that Roman Catholic authorities did likewise with respect to pedophile priests, one can see that the problem is endemic in religious authority structures forced to confront immoral and unethical behavior on the part of their functionaries. Of course, this is not a problem of religious power structures alone. What it points up, however, is that all power structures need checks and balances and must be accountable for their actions by the authority of the people. The problem with religious power structures is often \u2014 and this seems particularly true, considering what God has to say, of Orthodox Judaism \u2014 that they refuse to submit, often with a certain self-righteousness, to outside oversight. This also points up the utter bankruptcy of Orthodox Judaism's claims to moral superiority. This book is thoroughly researched, well written and easily readable. Bondage of the Mind is R. D.

Further Reading The Doping Dilemma Game theory helps to explain the pervasive abuse of drugs in cycling, baseball and other sports We are pleased to present Michael Shermer's extensive research article on doping in sports, most notably cycling (his own sport) and baseball (as the new season gets underway). I am very proud of this piece for several reasons: (1) my beloved sport of cycling has become so corrupted with drug scandals over the past two decades that there is not much of a sport left worth watching (unless we want to turn it into a reality show \u2014 \"Doping with the Stars\" or \"So you Think You Can Dope\"); (2) baseball, track and field, and other sports are similarly plagued with controversy and so the principles I develop in one sport apply to others; (3) I believe I have come up with a solution by understanding the psychological and behavioral economic underpinnings of both doping in cycling and cheating of all sorts in all sports. To my knowledge no one has applied game theory to the problem of doping in sports, and through that theory emerges both causal understanding and possible solutions. I look forward to reading your comments on this piece, and I must take a moment to thank the good folks at Scientific American for the dazzling artwork, layout and design, and most notably my editor for this piece, Peter Brown, for his brilliant editorial and content improvements that so improved what I originally submitted. \u2014 Michael Shermer new at Shop Skeptic...

In his new book, Physics of the Impossible, the renowned physicist Michio Kaku explores to what extent technologies and devices deemed equally impossible today might become commonplace in the future. From teleportation to the routine use of force fields, Kaku uses the world of science fiction to explore the fundamentals \u2014 and the limits \u2014 of the laws of physics as we know them today. He explains how: The science of optics, electromagnetism, and light may be able to be used to simulate invisibility; Enhancing the sensitivity of MRI devices may someday allow us to read minds; Magnetic fields, superconductors, and nanotechnologies may eventually enable scientists to levitate an elevator in outer space.

America's Most Dangerous Huckster, the Man Who Pursued Him, and the Age of Flimflam](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307339882?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307339882). (New York, 2008, ISBN 978-0307339881) Faith Healing A torrid tale of quackbusting in 1920s America sheds light on modern medical scares by Michael Shermer Human cognition has a problem \u2014 anecdotal thinking comes naturally whereas scientific thinking does not. The recent medical controversy over whether vaccinations cause autism illustrates this barrier. On the one side are scientists who have been unable to find any causal link between the symptoms of autism and the vaccine's ingredients. On the other are parents who noticed that shortly after having their children vaccinated autistic symptoms appeared. Anecdotal associations are so powerful that they cause people to ignore contrary evidence. In the vaccination case the imagined culprit for autism's cause is the preservative thimerosal, yet it breaks down into ethylmercury that is expelled from the body too quickly to have a damaging effect (plus autism continues to be diagnosed in children born after thimerosal was removed from vaccines). The story holds power despite the contrary facts. The reason for our cognitive disconnect is that the brain evolved to be cautious. We favor anecdotes because false positives (believing there is a connection between A and B when there is not) are usually harmless, whereas false negatives (believing there is no connection between A and B when there is) may take you out of the gene pool. Our brains are `belief engines' that seek connections. Even in the age of modern science, our faith in anecdotes can make us easy to exploit. Any medical huckster promising that A will cure B has only to advertise a handful of successful testimonials. Enter John R. Brinkley, one of the most notorious medical quacks of the first half of the twentieth century, and his nemesis Morris Fishbein, the quackbusting editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Their long struggle throughout the 1920s and 1930s, wonderfully retold in a gripping narrative by Pope Brock, brings to life this tension between folk and scientific medicine. As Brock ably demonstrates, Brinkley came of age on the tail end of the freewheeling patent remedy era in which con-men hawked their wares out of the side of wagons: They usually performed at night. A platform was unfolded and torches placed at each corner as the audience gathered, drawn by handbills and word of mouth. First a fiddler or a dancer got the crowd warmed up. A short morality play followed, in which a noble head-of-house or ringleted female died pathetically for lack of a miracle tonic, identified by name. Finally the physician himself (Brinkley) shot onstage in a dinner-plate hat, cutaway coat, and pious pants that buttoned up the sides, theeing and thousing, singing and selling, waving a bottle of Ayer's Cathartic Pills. Or maybe Burdock Blood Bitters or Aunt Fanny's Worm Candy. One thing was for sure, whatever it was cured whatever you had. What many men had, Brinkley discovered as he honed his scam, was a lack of sexual vitality, and he developed a surgical technique that offered the type of firm results that his male clientele so desperately sought: goat testis sewn right into the patient's scrotum, which he likened to \"embedding a marble in an apple.\" Come one, come all. And they did, to the tune of $750 per surgery, advertised widely in newspapers (a study revealed that over half of all newspaper advertising at the time was for patent medicines) and the new fangled technology, radio, which Brinkley took to like an evangelist to television. It made him a rich man, but as his business grew he got careless, performing operations both before and after happy hour, and fobbing off work to assistants whose medical credentials were even shadier than his own (Brinkley graduated from the unaccredited and improbably named Eclectic Medical University of Kansas City). \"As a result dozens of patients died over the years, either in the operating room or shortly after their return home,\" Brock explains. \"Many others were permanently maimed.\" This attracted the attention of the ambitious Morris Fishbein, whose career coincided with the rise of the American Medical Association's attempt to reign in flimflamery through accrediting medical colleges and licensing practitioners. Fishbein made his public mark in 1923 when the Chicago Daily News sent him to investigate the \"Hot Girl of Escanaba\" (Michigan), a woman who suffered from a temperature of 115 degrees for two weeks. Fishbein exposed her as a \"hysterical malingerer\" when he discovered that a flesh colored hot water bottle was employed to elevate rectal thermometer readings. \"Along with making him famous as a fraud buster extraordinaire,\" Brock notes, \"the case fixed him in a role he would revel in for years to come: the face, the popularizer, the lord high priest of the AMA.\" For the next two decades Fishbein pursued the country's \"most daring and dangerous\" swindler, as he called Brinkley, until he finally brought him down in a decisive courtroom confrontation that reads like a Hollywood film script. Stripped of his license to practice medicine and embroiled in lawsuits, Brinkley eventually moved to Mexico where he dispensed pseudo-medical twaddle over the airways through a \"border blasting\" radio station that could be heard all the way to Canada. When the Mexican government shut him down in 1941 \u2014 in part because of his public sympathies for the Nazis \u2014 he was a broken man. \"My health is gone. I am ready for the bed and out...\" he wrote his wife three days before a heart attack terminated his tenure of 56 years. Fishbein's promotion of science-based medicine was heroic in his day, but medical flapdoodle flourishes today on the internet so every medical association and journal needs a quackbusting Fishbein on its staff, for without such eternal vigilance, folk medicine will trump scientific medicine in the minds of patients.

As a doctor of Environmental Toxicology and Zoology, Dr. Snyder has devoted most of his career to studying the evidence of chemical, environmental and pharmaceutical compounds in the water supply \u2014 and what harm, if any, it poses to the organisms that utilize it. In this week's eSkeptic, the SkepDoc herself, Harriet Hall, M.D, reviews R. Barker Bausell's book entitled [Snake Oil Science: The Truth About Complementary and Alternative Medicine](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195313682?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0195313682) (Oxford University Press, 2007 ISBN 9780195313680). Snake Oil Science by Harriet Hall, M.D. I could condense this review into three words: \"read this book!\" The term \"complementary and alternative medicine\" (CAM) is relatively new, but the treatments it encompasses are not. Before we had science, all we had to rely on was testimonials and beliefs. And even today, for most people who believe CAM works, belief is enough. But at some level, the public has now recognized that science matters and people are looking for evidence to support those beliefs. Advocates claim that recent research validates CAM therapies. Does it really? Does the evidence show that any CAM therapy actually works better than placebos? R. Barker Bausell asks that question, does a compellingly thorough investigation, and comes up with a resounding \"NO\" for an answer. Bausell is the ideal person to ask such a question. He is a research methodologist: he designs and analyzes research studies for a living. Not only that: he was intimately involved with acupuncture research for the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). So when he talks about what can go wrong in research and why much of the research on CAM is suspect, he is well worth listening to. He describes his acupuncture research in great detail. It involved patients with pain from dental surgery. Before designing the experiments, he searched the literature and found an article that reviewed 16 previous trials of acupuncture for dental pain and concluded that it was probably effective. But on the Jadad scale, a simple 5-point measure of quality, none of those 16 studies scored higher than 3 (which is considered barely adequate) and 5 of them incredibly scored zero. Bausell's group set out to resolve the question with research of much higher quality. For instance, a low dropout rate is one measure of quality; they only had 3 subjects drop out during the course of the study, and those 3 were people the researchers sent home because of a snow storm! They compared \"true\" acupuncture to the most credible \"sham\" acupuncture they could devise. There was no difference in outcome: both were equally effective in relieving pain. When they looked more closely at their data, they found some surprises. The placebo control was not perfect, and some subjects had been able to guess which group they were in. Knowing you really got acupuncture should have increased the placebo response, and knowing you didn't should have decreased it \u2014 yet even so, there was no difference between the groups. So the results were even more negative than they appeared. Even more fascinating, patients who thought they got real acupuncture reported much more pain relief than those who thought they got the sham, regardless of which they actually got! Bausell points out that penicillin cures pneumonia even if you're in a coma, but alternative medicine only seems to work when you are awake. You have to know (or think) you're being treated. And penicillin works by well-understood scientific principles, while much of alternative medicine is based on \"entire physiologic systems or physical forces that the average high school science teacher already knew didn't exist.\" If any alternative treatment clearly worked as well as penicillin, prior plausibility wouldn't matter: science would adopt it and worry about how it worked later. Under the circumstances, prior plausibility is an important consideration. He tells his mother-in-law's story. She had knee pain from osteoarthritis with fluctuating symptoms. Every time the pain increased, she would try something new she had read about in Prevention magazine and every time it would seem to work as the pain naturally decreased again. And eventually it would seem to stop working as the pain naturally increased again. She would phone every couple of months to tell him about the wonderful new treatment she had discovered. She was not ignorant or stupid, but she underestimated the power of the placebo and didn't realize how the natural fluctuations of her pain led her to false conclusions. She had fallen for the most common human error: the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. The fact that pain relief follows treatment doesn't necessarily mean that the treatment caused the pain relief. This is only one of the many impediments to correct thinking that plague our fallible human brains. Bausell describes some of those other impediments. He shows how patients, doctors, and researchers are all equally likely to fool themselves, and why the most rigorous science is needed to keep us from reaching false conclusions. Bausell's thorough discussion of the placebo phenomenon is illuminating and invaluable. He covers the history of research on placebos and tells some fascinating anecdotes. He argues that placebo response is not just imagination. It is a learned phenomenon, a conditioned response. You respond to a placebo pill because you have previous experience of being helped by pills. Morphine injections in dogs cause a side effect of salivation: after a while, you can inject water and they will respond with salivation. Physiologic effects from placebo are always smaller than with the real thing, but apparently they do occur. The evidence for objective physiologic effects may not be entirely convincing, but it is certain that pain and other subjective symptoms respond to placebos. And there is even research suggesting a mechanism: the release of endogenous opioids, pain-relieving chemicals produced by our own brains. If you counteract those chemicals with a narcotic antagonist like Narcan, you can block the placebo response. He shows that the act of taking a pill may really relieve pain, but that the contents of the pill may be irrelevant. Research shows a hierarchy of placebo response: injections work better than capsules and capsules work better than tablets. The color and size of the pill and the frequency of dosing all make a difference. And intriguingly, patients who have responded to a placebo have distortions of memory: they remember the pain relief as greater than it actually was! Bausell points out that ...just because someone with a PhD or an MD performs a clinical trial doesn't mean that the trial possesses any credibility whatsoever. In fact, the vast majority of these efforts are worse than worthless because they produce misleading results. The book includes valuable lessons on how to tell credible research from the other kind. Even the most experienced researchers will find food for thought here, and for the layman it will be a revelation. Research is full of pitfalls. Negative studies tend not to get published (the file drawer effect). Research done by believers and pharmaceutical companies tends to be more positive than research done by others. Studies from non-English speaking countries are notoriously unreliable for various reasons \u2014 98% of the acupuncture studies from Asia are positive, compared to 30% from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The researcher may delegate the actual research to others, who may make undetected mistakes or deliberately skew results to please their boss. Double blind studies may not be truly blind: subjects may have been able to guess which group they were in. Subjects who are not responding may drop out. People who believe in homeopathy are more likely to volunteer for homeopathy studies. Researchers may put a positive spin on their findings or reach conclusions that are not justified by the data. Even if the research is impeccable, we arbitrarily use p=.05 as the measure of statistical significance, and this means there is a 5% probability that the results will appear falsely positive just by chance. There are more pitfalls, and Bausell covers them all. When you come right down to it, no experiment is beyond criticism, and most published research is wrong. So how can we decide which studies are credible? We now have published guidelines such as the 22 item Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist to assess the quality of randomized controlled trials, but Bausell offers some simpler criteria that can rule out the worst offenders: - Subjects are randomly assigned to a CAM therapy or a credible placebo - At least 50 subjects per group - Less than 25% dropout rate - Publication in a high-quality, prestigious, peer-reviewed journal Using this simple 4-item checklist, he reviewed all the CAM studies published in The New England Journal of Medicine and The Journal of the American Medical Association from 2000-2007. 14 met the criteria, and all were negative. When he expanded his search to include the Annals of Internal Medicine and Archives of Internal Medicine, he ended up with 22 studies, only one of which was positive (exactly what you would expect from the 5% rule if none of them worked). Since different studies have conflicting results, we now use meta-analyses or systematic reviews to try to reach a reliable conclusion. In fact, we even have systematic reviews of systematic reviews! After explaining why systematic reviews are subject to several pitfalls of their own, Bausell goes on to examine the high-quality systematic reviews from the Cochrane collection. Cochrane's independent reviewers take the quality of studies into account and try to evaluate all the published evidence without bias. Of 98 CAM reviews in the Cochrane database, 21 were positive. When he subtracted those that lacked confirmation by studies in English-speaking countries, those with suspect controls, and those that were subsequently trumped by more definitive high-quality studies, the percentage of positive studies dropped to that familiar 5%. A highly touted non-Cochrane review of homeopathy concluded that the clinical effects of homeopathy were not just due to placebo. But strangely they also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to show that any single homeopathic treatment was clearly effective in any one clinical condition. A re-analysis of the studies they had reviewed showed that when only the highest quality studies were considered, the alleged positive effect for homeopathy disappeared. What all this amounts to is that advocates can point to plenty of \"snake oil\" science that apparently supports various CAM treatments; but when examined critically, the entire body of evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that no CAM method works any better than placebo. True believers will never give up their favorite treatment because of negative evidence; they will always want to try one more study in the hope that it will vindicate their belief. They see science as a method they can take advantage of to convince others that their treatment works. They don't see it as a method of finding out whether their treatment works. Bausell says CAM therapists simply do not value (and most, in my experience, do not understand) the scientific process. He doesn't aim to dissuade anyone from using CAM. He just doesn't want anyone to choose it for the wrong reasons, to be fooled into thinking there is credible evidence where there isn't. He emphasizes that CAM nourishes hope, and its placebos work, if only for symptoms that would eventually resolve on their own anyway. The comfort CAM brings can be valuable, as long as it is not used in place of effective treatments for serious conditions \u2014 and most of the time it isn't, despite the occasional horror story of a patient who refuses effective cancer treatment and dies using a useless remedy. He even has some advice on how to choose a placebo therapy that works for you. He encourages you to believe because otherwise it won't work. Bausell writes in an entertaining, accessible style: the book reads almost like a detective story. It should appeal equally to the general reader and to the scientist. The book isn't perfect, but its minor flaws don't detract from its message. It is destined to be a classic on the order of Robert Park's Voodoo Science and Michael Shermer's [Why People Believe Weird Things](https://michaelshermer.com/weird-things/). If you want to understand how medical research works, if you want to know what can lead patients and scientists to false conclusions, if you have ever used complementary or alternative medicine or have wondered why others do, if you value evidence over belief, if you care about the truth, read this book. the next lecture in our Spring season...

Is it worth the energy? Friedemann is a systems architect for a large international transportation company, has a B.S. in biology with a chemistry/physics minor from the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, and is a free-lance science writer and member of the Northern California Science Writers Association. The Hydrogen Economy Savior of Humanity or an Economic Black Hole? by Alice Friedemann Skeptics scoff at perpetual motion, free energy, and cold fusion, but what about energy from hydrogen? Before we invest trillions of dollars in a hydrogen economy, we should examine the science and pseudoscience behind the hydrogen hype. Let's begin by taking a hydrogen car out for a spin. Although the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) in your car can burn hydrogen, the hope is that someday fuel cells, which are based on electrochemical processes rather than combustion (which converts heat to mechanical work), will become more efficient and less polluting than ICEs. [1](#note01) Fuel cells were invented before combustion engines in 1839 by William Grove. But the ICE won the race by using abundant and inexpensive gasoline, which is easy to transport and pour, and very high in energy content. [2](#note02) Production Unlike gasoline, hydrogen isn't an energy source \u2014 it's an energy carrier, like a battery. You have to make hydrogen and put energy into it, both of which take energy. Hydrogen has been used commercially for decades, so we already know how to do this. There are two main ways to make hydrogen: using natural gas as both the source and the energy to split hydrogen from the carbon in natural gas (CH4), or using water as the source and renewable energy to split the hydrogen from the oxygen in water (H2O). 1) Making Hydrogen from Fossil Fuels. Currently, 96 percent of hydrogen is made from fossil fuels, mainly for oil refining and partially hydrogenated oil. [3](#note03) In the United States, 90 percent is made from natural gas, with an efficiency of 72 percent, [4](#note04) which means you lose 28 percent of the energy contained in the natural gas to make it (and that doesn't count the energy it took to extract and deliver the natural gas to the hydrogen plant). One of the main arguments made for switching to a \"hydrogen economy\" is to prevent global warming that has been attributed to the burning of fossil fuels. When hydrogen is made from natural gas, however, nitrogen oxides are released, which are 58 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide. [5](#note05) Coal releases large amounts of CO2 and mercury. Oil is too powerful and useful to waste on hydrogen \u2014 it is concentrated sunshine brewed over hundreds of millions of years. A gallon of gas represents about 196,000 pounds of fossil plants, the amount in 40 acres of wheat. [6](#note06) Natural gas as a source for hydrogen is too valuable. It is used to create fertilizer (as both feedstock and energy source). This has led to a many-fold increase in crop production, allowing billions more people to be fed who otherwise wouldn't be. [7,](#note07) [8](#note08) We also don't have enough natural gas left to make a hydrogen economy happen from this source. Extraction of natural gas is declining in North America. [9](#note09) It will take at least a decade to even begin replacing natural gas with imported liquid natural gas (LNG). Making LNG is so energy intensive that it would be economically and environmentally insane to use it as a source of hydrogen. [10](#note10) 2) Making Hydrogen from Water. Only four percent of hydrogen is made from water via electrolysis. It is done when the hydrogen must be extremely pure. Since most electricity comes from fossil fuels in plants that are 30 percent efficient, and electrolysis is 70 percent efficient, you end up using four units of energy to create one unit of hydrogen energy: 70% * 30% = 21% efficiency. [11](#note11) Producing hydrogen by using fossil fuels as a feedstock or an energy source defeats the purpose, since the whole point is to get away from fossil fuels. The goal is to use renewable energy to make hydrogen from water via electrolysis. When the wind is blowing, current wind turbines can perform at 30-40 percent efficiency, producing hydrogen at an overall rate of 25 percent efficiency \u2014 3 units of wind energy to get 1 unit of hydrogen energy. The best solar cells available on a large scale have an efficiency of ten percent, or 9 units of energy to get 1 hydrogen unit of energy. If you use algae making hydrogen as a byproduct, the efficiency is about .1 percent. [12](#note12) No matter how you look at it, producing hydrogen from water is an energy sink. If you want a more dramatic demonstration, please mail me ten dollars and I'll send you back a dollar. Hydrogen can be made from biomass, but there are numerous problems: - it's very seasonal; - it contains a lot of moisture, requiring energy to store and dry it before gasification; - there are limited supplies; - the quantities are not large or consistent enough for large-scale hydrogen production; - a huge amount of land is required because even cultivated biomass in good soil has a low yield \u2014 10 tons per 2.4 acres; - the soil will be degraded from erosion and loss of fertility if stripped of biomass; - any energy put into the land to grow the biomass, such as fertilizer and planting and harvesting, will add to the energy costs; - the delivery costs to the central power plant must be added; and - it is not suitable for pure hydrogen production. [13](#note13) Putting Energy into Hydrogen No matter how it's been made, hydrogen has no energy in it. It is the lowest energy dense fuel on earth. [14](#note14) At room temperature and pressure, hydrogen takes up three thousand times more space than gasoline containing an equivalent amount of energy. [15](#note15) To put energy into hydrogen, it must be compressed or liquefied. To compress hydrogen to the necessary 10,000 psi is a multi-stage process that costs an additional 15 percent of the energy contained in the hydrogen. If you liquefy it, you will be able to get more hydrogen energy into a smaller container, but you will lose 30-40 percent of the energy in the process. Handling it requires extreme precautions because it is so cold \u2014 minus 423 F. Fueling is typically done mechanically with a robot arm. [16](#note16) Storage For the storage and transportation of liquid hydrogen, you need a heavy cryogenic support system. The tank is cold enough to cause plugged valves and other problems. If you add insulation to prevent this, you will increase the weight of an already very heavy storage tank, adding additional costs to the system. [17](#note17) Let's assume that a hydrogen car can go 55 miles per kg. [18](#note18) A tank that can hold 3 kg of compressed gas will go 165 miles and weigh 400 kg (882 lbs). [19](#note19) Compare that with a Honda Accord fuel tank that weighs 11 kg (25 lbs), costs $100, and holds 17 gallons of gas. The overall weight is 73 kg (161 lbs, or 8 lbs per gallon). The driving range is 493 miles at 29 mpg. Here is how a hydrogen tank stacks up against a gas tank in a Honda Accord: |Amount of miles |[21](#note21) to the National Highway Safety Traffic Administration (NHTSA), \"Vehicle weight reduction is probably the most powerful technique for improving fuel economy. Each 10 percent reduction in weight improves the fuel economy of a new vehicle design by approximately eight percent.\" The more you compress hydrogen, the smaller the tank can be. But as you increase the pressure, you also have to increase the thickness of the steel wall, and hence the weight of the tank. Cost increases with pressure. At 2000 psi, it is $400 per kg. At 8000 psi, it is $2100 per kg. [20](#note20) And the tank will be huge \u2014 at 5000 psi, the tank could take up ten times the volume of a gasoline tank containing the same energy content. Fuel cells are heavy. According to Rosa Young, a physicist and vice president of advanced materials development at Energy Conversion Devices in Troy, Michigan: \"A metal hydride storage system that can hold 5 kg of hydrogen, including the alloy, container, and heat exchangers, would weigh approximately 300 kg (661 lbs), which would lower the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\" [21](#note21) Fuel cells are also expensive. In 2003, they cost $1 million or more. At this stage, they have low reliability, need a much less expensive catalyst than platinum, can clog and lose power if there are impurities in the hydrogen, don't last more than 1000 hours, have yet to achieve a driving range of more than 100 miles, and can't compete with electric hybrids like the Toyota Prius, which is already more energy efficient and low in CO2 generation than projected fuel cells. [22](#note22) Hydrogen is the Houdini of elements. As soon as you've gotten it into a container, it wants to get out, and since it is the lightest of all gases, it takes a lot of effort to keep it from escaping. Storage devices need a complex set of seals, gaskets, and valves. Liquid hydrogen tanks for vehicles boil off at 3-4 percent per day. [23](#note23) Hydrogen also tends to make metal brittle. [24](#note24) Embrittled metal can create leaks. In a pipeline, it can cause cracking or fissuring, which can result in potentially catastrophic failure. [25](#note25) Making metal strong enough to withstand hydrogen adds weight and cost. Leaks also become more likely as the pressure grows higher. It can leak from un-welded connections, fuel lines, and non-metal seals such as gaskets, O-rings, pipe thread compounds, and packings. A heavy-duty fuel cell engine may have thousands of seals. [26](#note26) Hydrogen has the lowest ignition point of any fuel, 20 times less than gasoline. So if there's a leak, it can be ignited by any number of sources. [27](#note27) Worse, leaks are invisible \u2014 sometimes the only way to know there's a leak is poor performance. Transport Canister trucks ($250,000 each) can carry enough fuel for 60 cars. [28](#note28) These trucks weigh 40,000 kg, but deliver only 400 kg of hydrogen. For a delivery distance of 150 miles, the delivery energy used is nearly 20 percent of the usable energy in the hydrogen delivered. At 300 miles, that is 40 percent. The same size truck carrying gasoline delivers 10,000 gallons of fuel, enough to fill about 800 cars. [29](#note29) Another alternative is pipelines. The average cost of a natural gas pipeline is one million dollars per mile, and we have 200,000 miles of natural gas pipeline, which we can't re-use because they are composed of metal that would become brittle and leak, as well as the incorrect diameter to maximize hydrogen throughput. If we were to build a similar infrastructure to deliver hydrogen it would cost $200 billion. The major operating cost of hydrogen pipelines is compressor power and maintenance. [30](#note30) Compressors in the pipeline keep the gas moving, using hydrogen energy to push the gas forward. After 620 miles, 8 percent of the hydrogen has been used to move it through the pipeline. [31](#note31) Conclusion At some point along the chain of making, putting energy in, storing, and delivering the hydrogen, we will have used more energy than we can get back, and this doesn't count the energy used to make fuel cells, storage tanks, delivery systems, and vehicles. [32](#note32) When fusion can make cheap hydrogen, when reliable long-lasting nanotube fuel cells exist, and when light-weight leak-proof carbon-fiber polymer-lined storage tanks and pipelines can be made inexpensively, then we can consider building the hydrogen economy infrastructure. Until then, it's vaporware. All of these technical obstacles must be overcome for any of this to happen. [33](#note33) Meanwhile, the United States government should stop funding the Freedom CAR program, which gives millions of tax dollars to the big three automakers to work on hydrogen fuel cells. Instead, automakers ought to be required to raise the average overall mileage their vehicles get \u2014 the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard. [34](#note34) At some time in the future the price of oil and natural gas will increase significantly due to geological depletion and political crises in extracting countries. Since the hydrogen infrastructure will be built using the existing oil-based infrastructure (i.e. internal combustion engine vehicles, power plants and factories, plastics, etc.), the price of hydrogen will go up as well \u2014 it will never be cheaper than fossil fuels. As depletion continues, factories will be driven out of business by high fuel costs [35,](#note35) [36,](#note36) [37](#note37) and the parts necessary to build the extremely complex storage tanks and fuel cells might become unavailable. The laws of physics mean the hydrogen economy will always be an energy sink. Hydrogen's properties require you to spend more energy than you can earn, because in order to do so you must overcome waters' hydrogen-oxygen bond, move heavy cars, prevent leaks and brittle metals, and transport hydrogen to the destination. It doesn't matter if all of these problems are solved, or how much money is spent. You will use more energy to create, store, and transport hydrogen than you will ever get out of it. Any diversion of declining fossil fuels to a hydrogen economy subtracts that energy from other possible uses, such as planting, harvesting, delivering, and cooking food, heating homes, and other essential activities. According to Joseph Romm, a Department of Energy official who oversaw research on hydrogen and transportation fuel cell research during the Clinton Administration: \"The energy and environmental problems facing the nation and the world, especially global warming, are far too serious to risk making major policy mistakes that misallocate scarce resources.

Can a kids' science and critical thinking television program be both entertaining and informative? The award-winning Mystery Hunters, beginning its fourth season, is proving that it can. On this week's Skepticality, Swoopy talks with David Acer \u2014 known to fans of Mystery Hunters as \"Doubting Dave,\" the skeptical scientist who helps the junior members of his team (Araya Mengesha and Christina Broccolini) investigate paranormal mysteries. David is a close up magician, comedian, and actor and writer for children's educational programs including Popular Mechanics for Kids and Prank Patrol. David shares his thoughts about how to make debunking myths entertaining, and explains why it's difficult to get quality kids' science programs on TV in today's climate. Items of Interest In this week's eSkeptic, we present Michael Shermer's [Los Angeles Times opinion editorial](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-oe-shermer18feb18,0,5952670.story) on Scientology, followed by several [Letters to the Editor](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/letters/la-le-tuesday26feb26,0,4723523.story) that ran in response. And then, we present, in part, Jean E. Rosenfeld's [Los Angeles Times op-ed rebuttal to Michael's piece](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oew-rosenfeld22feb22,0,2442274.story). Scientology, Anonymous an LA Times op-ed by Michael Shermer Imagine reading the following press release: Hello, Jews. We are anonymous. Over the years, we have been watching you. Your campaigns of misinformation; suppression of dissent; your litigious nature, all of these things have caught our eye ... Anonymous has therefore decided that your organization should be destroyed. For the good of your followers, for the good of mankind \u2014 for the laughs \u2014 we shall expel you ... and systematically dismantle Judaism in its present form... The rantings of crazed neo-Nazis, right? No. \"Scientologists\" and \"Church of Scientology\" and you are reading from a statement issued by a group of anti-Scientologists calling themselves \"Anonymous.\" This statement was released Jan. 21 (read in a YouTube video by a Stephen Hawking-like computerized voice). It was followed by another on Sunday Feb. 10 that coincided with demonstrations at Scientology centers around the world at which protesters donned masks (the Guy Fawkes variety from the movie \"V for Vendetta\") and waved posters that read, among other things, \"Honk if you hate Scientology.\" Again, imagine if that sign read \"Honk if you hate Jews.\" How innocuous would such a protest be in that case? And yet this latest turn against the organization founded in 1954 by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard has an air of farcical comedy to it. Why? Why aren't civil-rights organizations and antihate-speech activists pouncing on these protesters? The reason, I suspect, is that most of us do not consider Scientology a religion, at least not a religion that resembles in the slightest the world's major faiths. One clue to this interpretation can be seen in other protesters' signs: \"Religion is Free, Scientology is Not\" and \"Trade Secrets are for Business, Not Religion.\" I'm a scientist who studies belief systems for a living, so take it from me: Scientology is unlike any other religion in history. Although the Church of Scientology is recognized by the IRS as a tax-exempt religion (despite years of litigation by the IRS to collect taxes on its income), no other religion I know of considers theological doctrines and core religious tenets to be intellectual property accessible only for a fee. Envision converting to Judaism but having to pay to learn the story of Abraham and Isaac, Noah and the flood, or Moses and the Ten Commandments. Or imagine joining the Catholic Church but not being told about the crucifixion and the resurrection until you have reached Operating Theological Level III, which takes many years and many tens of thousands of dollars. That is, in essence, how the Church of Scientology dispenses its theology, leading ex-members, critics and journalists to divulge Scientology's sacred myth all over the internet, and in such national publications as the New York Times and Rolling Stone magazine, and even on the animated TV series \"South Park.\" The story centers on Xenu the galactic warlord, who 75 million years ago was in charge of 76 overpopulated planets. Xenu brought trillions of these alien beings to Earth (called Teegeeack) on spaceships that resembled DC-9 planes, and placed them in select volcanoes. He then vaporized them with hydrogen bombs, scattering to the winds their souls, called thetans, which were then rounded up in electronic traps and implanted with false ideas. These corrupted thetans attach themselves to people today, leading to drug and alcohol abuse, addiction, depression and other psychological and social ailments that only Scientology classes and \"auditing\" employing \"e-meters\" can cure. Paying customers, by the way, do not get to hear this story until they reach Operating Thetan Level III. This peculiar story helps explain, in part, the often inexplicable Tom Cruise, whom we've all seen renouncing the evils of psychiatry and the drug industry on the \"Today\" show and more recently in a viral YouTube video. There's nothing wrong with being skeptical of psychiatry \u2014 I publish Skeptic magazine, which recently included an article by a psychiatrist who took his colleagues to task for overmedication and for overlabeling as diseases what may just be unusual behavior. As well, self-help gurus such as Anthony Robbins have developed techniques that may very well surpass psychiatry in helping people. But psychiatrists, drug companies and motivational speakers pay taxes on their products and services; they do not masquerade as religious leaders. This is yet another aspect of Scientology that provokes the type of animosity we are seeing in these recent attacks. Humans are by nature tribal and xenophobic. We evolved a natural tendency to look askance at those who are different from us, and especially to be suspicious of activities beyond our purview. Transparency and fairness are the key to trust, and trust is the social glue that binds a diverse society such as ours. This is why we insist on so many checks and balances in government, so many rules and regulations in markets, and equal treatment under the law. The reason people are suspicious of Scientology is because of its cult-like secrecy, its overly aggressive response to and legal attacks against critics, and especially the hypocrisy of comporting itself as a faux religion in a society willing to reward corporate success but not religious greed. Letters to the Editor When I was 17, I left the Church of Scientology. When I was 22, my parents and all members of my immediate family were pressured by the church to \"disconnect\" from me. When I heard of the protests by Anonymous on behalf of all those who have lost their families, homes and savings accounts to Scientology, I thanked God that someone was finally willing to listen. Reading Michael Shermer's op-ed article, I was surprised to find myself frustrated and misty-eyed. Why is it that journalists repeatedly and insistently focus on the sensationalist aspect of the Xenu story when reporting about Scientology, ignoring child labor, physical assault, psychological abuse and other travesties that go on every day behind those walls? Shermer says that the recent protest of Scientology by the group calling itself Anonymous had the air of a comical farce. He's dead on there, but other than that, his reasoning is dead wrong. How can a man of science who studies belief systems for a living make evaluations about a religion he hasn't studied? The basic books and lectures on which the religion is based are available to anyone who cares to read and listen to them. These books and lectures can be purchased not only in Scientology churches but in bookstores and over the Web, and they are available for borrowing in libraries all over the world. I highly recommend that he take the time to read up on his subject before he makes a farce of himself again. I appreciated Shermer's article. It provided an objective view on the criticism of the Church of Scientology. As an avid fan of science fiction, I have to admit that I enjoyed L. Ron Hubbard's novel, Battlefield Earth. Nevertheless, I consider the church to fall into the same category \u2014 space opera. Many countries do not consider the church a tax-exempt religious organization. Furthermore, some in the German government consider this faux religion an example of evil totalitarianism. I trust their judgment when it comes to determining that. Criticism and hatred of the church is nothing new. But if it will voluntarily start to treat itself as a financially transparent (and legally responsible) for-profit organization, then it nevertheless deserves the right to exist. Shermer argues that because Scientology is a new religion, its members are not entitled to the rights afforded other religions, and that different beliefs justify the hate crimes of the cyber-terrorist group Anonymous. Every new religion has had to fight ignorance and intolerance, and Scientology is no exception. The allegations raised by Shermer have long since been disproved and the church vindicated. In the U.S., documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act showed these charges to be false, leading the Internal Revenue Service to recognize all churches of Scientology as tax-exempt. After years of discrimination in Australia, the Charity Commission uses Scientology as the benchmark for the definition of religion. Italy's Supreme Court found that Scientology's fundraising system is fairer than that of the Catholic Church. In little more than half a century, Scientology has been acknowledged as a religion by courts, government agencies and religious scholars the world over. No matter one's personal beliefs, hate crimes should never be condoned against any religion. Scientology Stands a Chance an LA Times op-ed rebuttal by Jean E. Rosenfeld Skeptic [Michael Shermer exposes](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-oe-shermer18feb18,0,5952670.story) hate speech against the Church of Scientology and strangely concludes that its \"cult-like secrecy\" and \"hypocrisy\" merit suspicion. He also calls it a \"faux religion.\" Speaking as a scholar who has analyzed new religions for over 20 years, I deplore critics who pose as experts. Scientology is a new religion, and unlike most, it may become an established religion whether the rest of us like it or not. All religions have origin myths, and all religions keep secrets from the uninitiated. If a nonbeliever were to tell the origin myth of Christianity, it would sound no less fantastic than the Thetan myth of L. Ron Hubbard: A spirit present as God before the creation of the universe splits off from Godhead after billions of years of Earth time and is born again as a flesh-and-blood person to a Jewish woman. The son gathers adherents, casts out demons from afflicted people, works miracles and finally confronts the evil king in the Jewish capital city. The evil empire's soldiers try, convict and kill him in a public execution. He then is resurrected before his disciples and tells them to spread his kingdom throughout the world. He promises to appear again and save those who believe in his message and condemn to eternal punishment those who do not. All of his followers will be resurrected after our Earth is destroyed by seven years of heaven-sent catastrophes that kill off most of the human race... the next lecture in our Spring season...

Schlinger's revised version of an invited talk presented at our annual conference, \"Brain, Mind and Consciousness,\" at Caltech in May 2005. This article is also available in Skeptic magazine Volume 13, Number 4. Dr. Schlinger received his Ph.D. in psychology from Western Michigan University where he also completed a post-doctoral fellowship in behavioral pharmacology. He was a professor of psychology at Western New England College in Massachusetts before moving to Los Angeles in 1999. He is now Assistant Professor of Psychology and Director of the M.S. Program in Applied Behavior Analysis at California State University, Los Angeles. Dr. Schlinger has authored (or co-authored) three books \u2014 Psychology: A Behavioral Overview (1990), A Behavior-Analytic View of Child Development (1995), and Introduction to Scientific Psychology (1998) \u2014 and more than forty scientific articles. Consciousness is Nothing but a Word by Henry D. Schlinger In 1991, Daniel Dennett published his tome, Consciousness Explained. [1](#note01) Yet, ten years later he penned an article titled \"Are We Explaining Consciousness Yet?\" [2](#note02) If he had to ask the question, the answer seems obvious. English-speaking philosophers and psychologists have been trying to understand consciousness at least since John Locke introduced the word into the English language in the 17th century. But despite the best efforts of those who've thrown their hats into the ring, we haven't made much progress. Obviously, a different approach is needed. Why We Aren't Explaining Consciousness Yet In my view, we aren't explaining consciousness for at least two reasons. First, we are trying to reduce the problem to brain processes. For the past decade or so, many have argued that the brain gives rise to consciousness. Some have set their sights on finding its so-called neural correlates, trying to explain consciousness, as the late Sir Francis Crick described it, in terms of the \"interactions of nerve cells ... and the molecules associated with them.\" Referring to consciousness as \"the major unsolved problem in biology,\" Crick famously observed: \"'You,' your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules.\" [3](#note03) \"No more than\"? Your joys, sorrows, memories, ambitions and sense of personal identity and free will are more than the behavior of your nerve cells, just as a Seurat painting is more than the thousands of points of paint on the canvas. They are also your behavior and the activity of your peripheral nervous system all in a rich and fluid context with a long and immensely complex personal history. Crick is obviously not alone in believing that reductionism will solve the problem of consciousness. Philosopher David Chalmers wrote, \"The search for neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) is arguably the cornerstone in the recent resurgence of the science of consciousness.\" [4](#note04) And sophisticated technologies seem to offer hope for such beliefs. I, for one, am skeptical. Here's why. Before we search for the neural correlates of consciousness we need to know what consciousness is, including how and why we become conscious. Even then consciousness won't be found in the brain \u2014 no behavior will be. We need to be cautious about searching for the location of behavioral traits in the brain, what psychologist William Uttal has called \"the new phrenology.\" [5](#note05) In the quest to understand consciousness, the work of neuroscientists will be important, but it will be only a piece of the larger scientific puzzle. Neuroreductionism alone is not the answer to the problem of consciousness, or any behavioral phenomenon. To put it bluntly, we can understand consciousness at its most important level \u2014 that of behavior \u2014 without any knowledge of neural correlates. That's not to say that such knowledge won't clarify the brain's role in mediating the behaviors. But the ultimate explanations are to be found in the evolutionary and individual learning histories that shaped the behaviors \u2014 not in the brain. The Consciousness Muddle A second reason we aren't explaining consciousness is that we continue to reify it and operate in the absence of any scientific definition. Consider the following summary of a recent book on consciousness: Through this analysis, the first and most obvious observation is that consciousness appears as a volumetric spatial void, containing colored objects and surfaces. This reveals that the representation in the brain takes the form of an explicit volumetric spatial model of external reality. Therefore, the world we see around us is not the real world itself, but merely a miniature virtual-reality replica of that world in an internal representation. [6] No wonder Daniel Dennett said, \"With consciousness ... we are still in a terrible muddle.\" [7](#note07) As the title of my article suggests, consciousness is not a thing, a place, or a cognitive process (whatever that is); it's only a word that we use in a variety of ways. For example, we can say that an organism is \"conscious\" if it is awake and/or alert (versus asleep or in a coma). We can then study the behaviors associated with wakefulness and the underlying neural structures that mediate them. Or, like Francis Crick and Christoph Koch, we can use \"consciousness\" to refer to visual perception, which is acceptable as long as it points to actual behaviors involved in perceiving and their ultimate evolutionary and learned causes. [8](#note08) But wakefulness and visual perception are not what most scholars are referring to with the word \"consciousness.\" What most consciousness scholars are concerned with is subjective experience or so-called qualia, such as \"the redness of red.\" [9](#note09) But what does \"the redness of red\" mean? Newborns come equipped with specialized receptors that respond to the wavelength of light corresponding to red, but they don't yet respond differently to red than to other colors and, thus, don't experience the redness of red. Humans alone learn the concept of red because we alone learn one response to all things that reflect that particular wavelength even if they differ in all other respects (e.g., size, shape, texture, etc.). That one response is the word \"red.\" As children we're taught to say \"red\" by parents who reinforce that response only in the presence of red things. Physicists can explain the nature of the wavelengths corresponding to red and neurophysiologists can explain the biochemical changes that occur when those wavelengths strike photoreceptors and are transmitted along visual pathways in the brain. But we need behavior analysts to tell us how someone learns to respond to and, thus, be conscious of redness. Discussions of qualia are muddled because the definition is vague and subjective. \"Qualia,\" like \"consciousness,\" is just a word. As psychologist Noel Smith has noted, the concept of consciousness is a construct: \"an invention, an abstraction, a contrivance.\" But it's an unsatisfactory construct in that it has no specifiable referents. There are no real events that comprise it and, thus, no agreement about what it is and how it operates. According to Smith, it's only a tangle of words because it consists of no more than words. [10](#note10) Thus, those searching for consciousness (or qualia) may as well be hunting for Lewis Carroll's Snark. Will we ever be able to solve what David Chalmers says is \"the largest outstanding obstacle in our quest for a scientific understanding of the universe\"? Chalmers believes that even though we do not have \"many detailed theories of cognition,\" the ultimate solution will nevertheless come from the science of the mind, or cognitive neuroscience. [11](#note11) However, there can be no science of the mind because science deals with real events and the mind is not a real event. [12](#note12) That is why there are no \"detailed theories of cognition.\" To solve the two problems I've just outlined \u2014 the disproportionate emphasis on neuroreductionism and our non-scientific descriptions of consciousness \u2014 a fresh approach is required. The solution calls for an account that draws upon the natural sciences of evolutionary biology, behavioral psychology, and neuroscience \u2014 in that order. Since \"consciousness\" is \"the name of a nonentity,\" as William James put it, [13](#note13) and \"has no location except an imaginary one,\" according to Julian Jaynes, [14](#note14) we need to take a different tack. We need to cease the endless speculation about vague, unobserved mental constructs and stop looking for the Snark we call \"consciousness\" in the recesses of a nonexistent mind or in the neural architecture of the brain. We need to take a more parsimonious approach, which is to identify the behaviors that occur when we use the word \"consciousness\" so we can get on with the business of explaining those behaviors. Understanding What We Mean by the Word \"Consciousness\" When you drive to work or school and arrive not being able to remember anything that happened along the way, then according to the present account, you weren't conscious of the drive (though you were almost certainly conscious of other things). If you weren't conscious of the drive, then what exactly were you doing? There is a simple answer: you were talking (and maybe imagining) to yourself about something other than the stimuli related to driving the car \u2014 perhaps what you did the night before or a conversation you had with a friend. Being conscious of the drive would be evidenced by your ability to talk about it both during and after. This is what I think most of us mean by being conscious, or, as Chalmers describes it, the \"conscious inner life.\" When we say that we're conscious, then, we're doing something: we're talking (or signing or writing) and/or imagining to ourselves about both our external and internal environments, and our own public and private behavior. Daniel Dennett recently came around more fully to this position when he wrote that, \"acquiring a human language (an oral or sign language) is a necessary precondition for consciousness.\" [15](#note15) To paraphrase Descartes, \"I talk (to myself) therefore I know that I exist.\" Helen Keller knew the importance of learning to describe oneself when she wrote: \"Before my teacher came to me, I did not know that I am. I lived in a world that was no world. I cannot hope to describe adequately that unconscious, yet conscious time of nothingness ... Since I had no power of thought, I did not compare one mental state with another.\" [16](#note16) Keller seems to have understood implicitly what behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner stated explicitly: Being conscious is reacting to one's own behavior verbally, and is, thus, ironically a social product taught to us by others. [17](#note17) So, to philosopher Thomas Nagels' famous question about qualia \u2014 \"What is it like to be a bat?\" [18](#note18) \u2014 I answer: nothing. There is no conscious experience; there are no qualia. For the bat there will never be any qualia because there is no language to describe experience. For obvious reasons there are also no qualia for the human newborn, although as I describe later, after exposure to an environment in which the child learns to describe her private events, that is, report subjective experience (qualia), we say that she is conscious. To understand how others teach us to report private experience, we need to look to the learning history that establishes that repertoire, in particular, the past or present consequences of the verbal behaviors. This strategy can provide an ultimate explanation of how and why we become conscious, it can supply neuroscientists with the roadmap they need to search for the neural correlates and, thus, can demonstrate how, as Chalmers puts it, an understanding of consciousness \"fits ... easily into the natural order.\" Learning to be Conscious of the Environment Becoming conscious begins simply enough with being taught how to label objects. Language-learning children are taught to label everything through modeling and discrimination learning. The parent points to a dog and asks, \"What's that?\" Before the child knows the answer, the parent models it by saying, \"That's a doggie. Can you say 'doggie?'\" If the child can imitate, she says \"doggie.\" Of course, she doesn't yet know it's a dog; she's simply imitating. But after several trials especially interspersed with trials regarding other objects, such as books, cups and balls, the child can quickly say \"doggie\" when the parent points to the dog and poses the question. Later, simply the sight of a dog is sufficient to get the child to say \"doggie.\" In teaching this, the attentive parent reinforces the child's correct response by repeating, \"Yes, that's a doggie.\" This is how the child comes to know or be conscious of her environment in the sense that she can talk about it. Progressing from simple names to saying more about things increases the child's consciousness of her environment. For example, being able to say only \"doggie\" reflects little consciousness compared with being able to say, \"It is a small, brown Dachshund with a long tail and a loud bark.\" But single labels are acquired first, and contrary to claims that parents don't teach their children language, there is considerable scientific evidence that this linguistic competence is indeed learned from parents and others comprising the child's verbal community. [19](#note19) Parents can very successfully teach children to describe and, hence, be conscious of the external environment because they can check the answers for accuracy. If the parent asks what color a red object is and the child says \"blue,\" the parent can see that the answer is wrong and correct it. Thus, the reliability of teaching consciousness of the external environment is exceptionally high. Learning to be Self-Conscious: Overt Behavior Parents also begin asking their children other questions, such as, \"What are you doing?\" In the beginning, before the child knows the answer, the parent must provide it just as the parent did when teaching about the environment. And because the parent can see what the child is doing, the answer is always correct. So, when a child is banging a cup on the table and the parent asks, \"What are you doing? Are you banging the cup?\" and the child imitatively answers, \"banging cup,\" the parent reinforces the response by saying, \"Right, you're banging the cup.\" Clearly we would not yet say that the child is conscious that she is banging a cup, but she's on her way. After considerable experience with the parents discriminating different actions by the child and teaching the child to describe them, we can now say that the child has at least the beginnings of self-consciousness in the sense that she can talk about or describe what she's doing. The more words she can use to describe her actions, the greater we say her consciousness of herself is. When we say that someone is totally unconscious of her actions what we usually mean is that she cannot describe (either to herself or to others) what she does. Sometimes we go to therapists who can help us become conscious of our own actions. A therapist does this, like the parent of the language-learning child, by observing our behavior and teaching us to make the same observations as well as how to talk more accurately about them. Once we can do that and say the same things to ourselves, we are said to have \"become more self-conscious\" of our actions. Learning to Be Self-Conscious: Private Events Parents don't stop with teaching children to describe their publicly observable behavior; they try to teach children to describe their private world. They use the same methods, but without the same level of success. Consider how a parent might teach a child to say that a cut on his leg \"hurts.\" The pain is a stimulus generated by the cut. But unlike the child banging a cup, the parent doesn't have access to the child's pain. So how does the parent teach the child to say, \"It hurts\"? The parent must rely on other sources of information. There are at least two ways parents can teach children to label or describe a private stimulus. [20](#note20) First, the parents can look for some public event that reliably accompanies the private one. In this example, the sight of the cut is the publicly accompanying event. A second way parents can teach children about their private events is to look for overt responses that correspond to the private stimulus. With the cut, the child may hold his leg or rub it, or may moan or cry. Based on these corresponding responses generated by the same painful stimulus, the parent teaches the child to report, \"It hurts.\" Usually, both public events and corresponding responses accompany private events, thus, helping the parent teach the description of the private event. The same process occurs when we're taught to describe our overt and covert behavior and private stimuli with such expressions as \"I'm depressed,\" \"I'm scared,\" \"I'm anxious,\" or \"I'm sad.\" Even then, others need more information to teach a reasonably correct description. For example, simply observing a child crying gives us little to go on to accurately teach him how he's feeling. Is he sad, hurt, or extremely happy? In such cases we need to observe the precipitating environmental conditions or context (e.g., breaking a toy, banging his knee, etc.). Nevertheless, all we can rely on to teach self-consciousness is observable behavior, publicly accompanying events, corresponding responses, and the stimulating environment. There is no direct access to someone else's private world. It's no wonder, then, that when asked how we feel, we often don't know or can't put it into words. Private Self-Talk In addition to learning to respond verbally to private stimuli, something else happens that complicates the problem in manifold ways: Our overt, public verbal descriptions recede to a covert or private level that only we can observe. How does this happen? No one really knows, but it's a good guess that, once again, parents are largely responsible. As parents can attest, once language-learning children learn a lot of names they go around labeling everything out loud. \"Look Daddy, car, doggie, man, ball...\" Convinced that we've done our job of teaching the correct names of things, we urge our children to \"Say it to yourself quietly,\" reinforcing quieter and quieter talking while ignoring or mildly discouraging louder outbursts. What happens next is that the child's verbal behavior continues, but at a level unobserved by others. The child still says \"car, doggie, man, ball...\" but to herself. Call it thinking or cognitive if you want, but except for its observability, the behavior is the same. And neurological evidence shows that the same areas of the brain that are active while speaking out loud are also active while speaking to one's self although at a lesser magnitude, [21,](#note21) [22,](#note22) [23](#note23) thus, preserving the continuity of behavior and obviating the need to invent cognitive ghosts. Consciousness & Brain Damage If by \"consciousness\" we mean talking, either overtly or covertly, about the environment, our own overt and covert behavior, and the stimuli that cause it, then we already know a lot about the brain's role in accomplishing it. As psychologists Neil Carlson and William Buskist note, the physiological basis of consciousness \"is the activity of language mechanisms in the brain.\" [24](#note24) Although the actual verbal descriptions are acquired according to fairly well understood principles of learning, that learning changes the brain, which then mediates between the stimulating environment and the verbal behavior of the conscious person. Evidence of consciousness as a verbal description of the environment in general and of our own behavior in particular, comes from numerous examples of brain damage. One example is anterograde amnesia. Patients with this disorder, which usually involves damage to the hippocampus, can learn new behaviors but cannot talk about what they've learned. In the parlance of memory researchers, we can say that the damage has disrupted their explicit remembering or verbal descriptions while leaving their implicit remembering, or nonverbal skills, intact. They can also remember (that is, talk about) things they learned before the brain damage but cannot remember things that have just happened. Following from the present thesis that consciousness is tantamount to talking (usually covertly) about the environment and our own behavior and private events, people with anterograde amnesia can only talk about and are, thus, only conscious of what they knew before the brain damage and, of course, of immediate events in their lives. In another disorder resulting from brain damage, called visual agnosia, individuals cannot recognize objects by sight. By \"recognize,\" we mean the patient cannot say the name, and, thus, is not conscious of the object when seeing it. In a more specific form, called prosopagnosia, or face blindness, a person cannot recognize certain faces by sight. Again, by \"recognize,\" we mean the individual cannot say the person's name when seeing her face; in other words, the individual is not conscious of who the person is. Interestingly, the individual can say the person's name when hearing her voice and is then conscious of her. This most likely happens because as children we often learn to recognize (i.e., name) objects when seeing and hearing them, and less often by feeling and smelling them. Each of these discriminations establishes separate neural pathways in the brain, so that if, for example, the visual pathway is damaged, the others remain intact. Because patients with visual agnosia are not blind, have no difficulty navigating visually through their environment, and can actually mime the behaviors related to objects shown to them, their disorder can be described as a \"disconnection between perception and awareness.\" [25](#note25) The Conscious Inner Life So what is the so-called conscious inner life we find so mysterious and elusive? It's a good bet that the only things inside us are anatomical and physiological structures \u2014 the central and peripheral nervous systems \u2014 the latter of which includes sensory receptors for pain, temperature, pressure, and proprioception. The primary difference between these interoceptive receptors and the exteroceptive ones in the eyes and ears and on the surface of the skin is their location. Since scientists have already discovered many of the ways that public stimuli influence behavior, then because private stimuli differ only in their location (not in their type) we can parsimoniously assume they have the same functions. If, for example, we learn to describe painful stimulation on the surface of the skin, then we can probably describe painful stimulation inside the body. But without having learned to report on those events, there is no consciousness in the present sense of the word. This is indeed an inner life, but not the one that so mystifies and intrigues many. In addition, behaviors may recede to a covert, or private, level. For example, the pianist may covertly practice finger placements, the golfer covert golf swings or hand placements on the club, the fluent ASL user covert signing, and, of course, hearing individuals constantly talk to themselves covertly. Behavior, as caused proximately by the firing of neurons in the motor areas of the cortex, exists on a continuum of intensity. If I start screaming, I can gradually reduce the intensity of my vocal output to normal talking, then whispering, and then covert talking until I'm the only one who can \"hear\" me. At that point I'm behaving privately, covertly, but behaving nonetheless. However, the behavior is not taking place in my mind or in my consciousness because there are no such places. Is this the \"conscious inner life\" that intrigues consciousness scholars? Just as evolutionary biologists assume continuity of species, behavioral scientists assume a continuity of behavior and the physical events that cause it. The good news is that such an account is parsimonious and can suggest an elegant solution to the problem of the nature and origin of consciousness and other so-called cognitive processes. The bad news is that many people won't find the analysis as sexy or mysterious as speculating about consciousness neurons or qualia. One reason is simply that they are not familiar with the science behind the theory. It is a complicated and still-growing experimental natural science. A more important reason, however, is that we've all been reared in a culture where ordinary, commonsense terms have been used to describe and explain human behavior for millennia. We simply cannot imagine that we don't have minds or free will, or that our inner life is nothing more than private stimuli and learned or unlearned covert behavior. What is Consciousness Then? \"Consciousness\" is only a word we use to refer to sometimes quite different behavioral phenomena. In this article I have suggested that most of the time what people mean by the word is our ongoing, though mostly covert, self-talk about our own public and private stimulation and behaviors. This account may or may not be correct, but it is parsimonious because it makes very few assumptions and appeals to observable or potentially observable relationships that are consistent with experimentally established scientific principles. We skeptics find it all too easy to fault obvious pseudosciences, but when it comes to our own messy, unscientific thinking about ourselves, we're a lot less critical. Thus, it will probably take a lot longer to realize that the conscious inner life that so fascinates us may be nothing more than a learned repertoire of verbal (and/or imaginal) behavior than it did to realize that the earth is not flat, that it is not the center of the universe, and that life on earth was not designed by a Creator.

Comments Off Irrepressible Dr. Karl This week on Skepticality, science educator and skeptic Michael McRae interviews one of Australia's most recognizable scientists, Dr. Karl Kruszelnicki, who is known to most Aussies simply as \"Dr. Karl.\" Dr. Karl is the Julius Sumner Miller Fellow at the University of Sydney, as well as a proud recipient of the Ig Nobel prize. He is also a popular science commentator on radio and television, and a bestselling author of 26 books \u2014 including his most recent, Please Explain, which gives the facts on everything from why we yawn, to the history of near death experiences.

I've always thought the more information, the better; but there are exceptions. I'm going to explain something that is very counterintuitive and grates against every fiber of our truth-seeking skeptical brains. The ad shouts, \"Tests That Can Save Your Life ... Stroke is America's third leading killer ... Half of all stroke victims have no warning signs before a stroke occurs.\" Life Line Screening comes to your community, sets up their ultrasound machines in a church or community center, and offers screening for stroke (carotid artery), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and osteoporosis for $129. The Healthscreens company adds gallbladder, kidney, liver, thyroid, and heart screens for a total of nine screenings for $215. They say \"Don't Wait ... Until it's too late!\" A skeptic asks: if these tests save lives, why doesn't my doctor order them, and why doesn't my insurance company pay for them? The ultrasound peddlers answer that doctors don't care about prevention and insurance companies are stingy. That's nonsense. Doctors do care very much about prevention, and insurance companies would save money in the long run by diagnosing things early. Doctors do use these tests to screen patients at high risk and to aid in diagnosis (and when used that way, they are covered by insurance). They just don't use them to screen the entire population of mostly healthy people. What could be wrong with checking all these areas of your body for potential problems? Wouldn't you like to know if your neck arteries are clogged? Wouldn't you like to know you had an aneurysm that was about to explode? Wouldn't you like to know if there was a lump lurking somewhere in your anatomy? Like everyone else, I would like to know those things, but my critical thinking skills have overcome that desire. I wouldn't take those ultrasound tests even if they were free. Obviously we're not going to do every possible test on every possible person. You could test all 5-year olds for gonorrhea, but you probably wouldn't. What makes a good screening test? The answer depends on the four possible outcomes of any test: - True positive (the test is positive and you have the disease) - False positive (the test is positive but you don't have the disease) - True negative (the test is negative and you don't have the disease) - False negative (the test is negative but you really do have the disease) A good screening test has a low rate of false positives and negatives. It makes a big difference how common the disease is in the population being screened. The rarer the disease, the more likely a positive test will be a false alarm. Only 10% of positive mammograms actually turn out to be cancer. Assuming you find a true positive result, you want it to make a difference. Does early diagnosis prolong your life span, or does it just prolong the time you carry the \"sick\" label? Is there an effective treatment that will prevent death or improve well-being? Are there risks to the treatment that must be weighed against the benefits? We no longer do routine screening urinalysis. It wasn't productive. If patients had no symptoms, a urinalysis rarely found anything that mattered, and we wasted a lot of time and effort trying to explain minor transient findings. We no longer do annual chest x-rays. Why? Because they did more harm than good. There was a small risk from the radiation itself. When a lung cancer was big enough to see on x-ray, it was usually too late for treatment to prolong survival; and we found too many questionable shadows that required further investigation. My father-in-law was a case in point. A routine chest x-ray showed a mass. They operated and found something benign and insignificant, but he had complications from the surgery and died. His screening test killed him. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force wrestles with these issues, studies risk/benefit ratios, examines the latest and best research, and makes recommendations for screening the general asymptomatic population. They recommend one-time ultrasound screening for AAA in men between the ages of 65 and 75 who have ever smoked; they recommend against screening in women. They recommend against screening for PAD, because if we find PAD the recommendations are the same ones we make for everyone: smoking cessation and exercise. They recommend osteoporosis screening for women over age 65 (or 60 if they have risk factors). When ultrasound is used for osteoporosis screening, about a third of patients have a positive result that must then be confirmed by a DEXA test; it makes more sense to use DEXA in the first place. When tests fall under the USPSTF recommendations, Medicare and insurance companies usually pay. Carotid artery testing can lead to life-saving treatment for patients who have symptoms, but if you have no symptoms, you may not need treatment. Even if the artery is 60-99% blocked, surgery may only reduce risk of stroke by 1% per year, and the surgical risks may outweigh the benefits. Indiscriminate ultrasound screening is a blunt instrument: it sees a lot of suspicious findings that are due to benign conditions that don't require treatment. Diagnosing the benign conditions requires more tests, which may be expensive, invasive, and possibly even lead to complications and death. When ultrasound finds something important, it is often something that would have been found later when symptoms developed, and usually finding it sooner makes no difference in survival. And think of all the needless worry! These direct-to-consumer peddlers of ultrasound fail to divulge crucial information; so their customers can't really give informed consent to a procedure that, while harmless in itself, can lead to various kinds of indirect harm. They play on people's fears and their desire to take control of their own medical care. They imply a promise of far more than they can deliver. They may not do as much harm as the peddlers of whole body screening CT scans (which involve substantial radiation exposure), but in my opinion, they are just as wrong-headed. Fish Oil - Better Left in the Fish? Everybody knows fish oil is good for you. It's one of the most popular diet supplements, and even the FDA allows claims that it can help prevent heart attacks. It has been claimed to help everything from schizophrenia to psoriasis. Here are the only claims that are supported by good quality evidence: - In patients who have had a heart attack, fish oil improves survival. - It reduces triglycerides. - In patients with high cholesterol levels it reduces the risk of coronary events but does not decrease mortality. - It reduces blood pressure slightly. There are some concerns. In the DART 2 trial of men with chronic coronary disease (stable angina), it apparently increased the risk of death. In a study of patients who had an implanted cardioverter defibrillator, it increased the risk of arrhythmias. With higher doses, it can worsen control of diabetes and it can increase bleeding tendency. Side effects include burping, heartburn, and an unpleasant aftertaste. People see that fish oil improves survival after a heart attack so they assume it should also help prevent heart disease in people who don't yet have it. That does not necessarily follow: insulin improves survival of diabetics, but that doesn't mean healthy people should take insulin to prevent diabetes. A 2006 review article in The Medical Letter concluded, \"Eating fatty fish may be beneficial for healthy people, but there is no evidence from prospective trials that fish oil supplements prevent cardiovascular disease in the general population.\" Ear Candles - Smaller Than Your Elbow Remember the old rule about not putting anything in your ear that is smaller than your elbow? It's a pretty good rule, and it applies to ear candles, too. Candling is supposed to cleanse the ear canal and do a lot of other wonderful things, like relieving earache, curing Meniere's syndrome, purifying the mind, strengthening the brain, opening and aligning the chakras, and stabilizing the emotions. Imagination knows no bounds. When ear candles first became popular, skeptics rushed to debunk them. A simple test was all it took: lighting a candle outside the ear produced a residue that looked exactly like the \"wax\" that was allegedly drawn out of the ear. Debunking did no good. People are still buying them (there are two spas in my neighborhood that sell them). According to a 2007 article in the journal American Family Physician: \"Ear candling is a practice in which a hollow candle is inserted into the external auditory canal and lit, with the patient lying on the opposite ear. In theory, the combination of heat and suction is supposed to remove earwax. However, in one trial, ear candles neither created suction nor removed wax and actually led to occlusion with candle wax in persons who previously had clean ear canals. Primary care physicians may see complications from ear candling including candle wax occlusion, local burns, and tympanic membrane perforation.\" It's more likely to clog a clean ear than to clean a clogged ear; it does nothing useful and it can be dangerous. Try telling that to the spa folks. I did. Here's the answer I got: \"Hello, thank you for your input \u2014 is [sic] something else that I can help you with?\" In one ear and out the other...

Paul Zak & Michael Shermer \u2014 Moral Markets & the Mind of the Market In this unusual tag-team lecture Zak and Shermer debunk two myths: (1) Homo economicus: that \"economic man\" is rational, free and selfish and (2) that evolution and economics are based almost entirely on cutthroat competition and self-maximizing greed. In Zak's Moral Markets and Shermer's The Mind of the Market, the authors demonstrate that people are as irrational with money as they are in all other aspects of life, and that Alfred Tennyson's characterization of competition in nature \u2014 \"red in tooth and claw\"\u2014 and the Gordon Gekko \"greed is good\" characterization of capitalism are woefully incomplete in understanding how evolution and economics works.

How broadcast journalism is flawed in such a fundamental way that its utility as a tool for informing viewers is almost nil. by Steve Salerno It is the measure of the media's obsession with its \"pedophiles run amok!\" story line that so many of us are on a first-name basis with the victims: Polly, Amber, JonBenet, Danielle, Elizabeth, Samantha. And now there is Madeleine. Clearly these crimes were and are horrific, and nothing here is intended to diminish the parents' loss. But something else has been lost in the bargain as journalists tirelessly stoke fear of strangers, segueing from nightly-news segments about cyber-stalkers and \"the rapist in your neighborhood\" to prime-time reality like Dateline's \"To Catch a Predator.\" That \"something else\" is reality. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, in a given year there are about 88,000 documented cases of sexual abuse among juveniles. In the roughly 17,500 cases involving children between ages 6 and 11, strangers are the perpetrators just 5 percent of the time \u2014 and just 3 percentof the time when the victim is under age 6. (Further, more than a third of such molesters are themselves juveniles, who may not be true \"predators\" so much as confused or unruly teens.) Overall, the odds that one of America's 48 million children under age 12 will encounter an adult pedophile at the local park are startlingly remote. The Child Molestation Research & Prevention Institute puts it like so: \"Right now, 90 percent of our efforts go toward protecting our children from strangers, when what we need to do is to focus 90 percent of our efforts toward protecting children from the abusers who are not strangers.\" That's a diplomatic way of phrasing the uncomfortable but factually supported truth: that if your child is not molested in your own home \u2014 by you, your significant other, or someone else you invited in \u2014 chances are your child will never be molested anywhere. Media coverage has precisely inverted both the reality and the risk of child sexual assault. Along the way, it has also inverted the gender of the most tragic victims: Despite the unending parade of young female faces on TV, boys are more likely than girls to be killed in the course of such abuse. We think we know Big Journalism's faults by its much ballyhooed lapses \u2014 its scandals, gaffes, and breakdowns \u2014 as well as by a recent spate of insider tell-alls. When Dan Rather goes public with a sensational expose based on bogus documents; when the Atlanta Journal Constitution wrongly labels Richard Jewell the Olympic Park bomber; when Dateline resorts to rigging explosive charges to the gas tanks of \"unsafe\" trucks that, in Dateline's prior tests, stubbornly refused to explode on their own; when the New York Times' Jayson Blair scoops other reporters working the same story by quoting sources who don't exist ... We see these incidents as atypical, the exceptions that prove the rule. Sadly, we're mistaken. To argue that a decided sloppiness has crept into journalism or that the media have been \"hijacked by [insert least favorite political agenda]\" badly misses the real point; it suggests that all we need to do to fix things is filter out the gratuitous political spin or rig the ship to run a bit tighter. In truth, today's system of news delivery is an enterprise whose procedures, protocols, and underlying assumptions all but guarantee that it cannot succeed at its self described mission. Broadcast journalism in particular is flawed in such a fundamental way that its utility as a tool for illuminating life, let alone interpreting it, is almost nil. \"You give us 22 minutes, and we'll give you ... what, exactly?\" We watch the news to \"see what's going on in the world.\" But there's a hitch right off the bat. In its classic conception, newsworthiness is built on a foundation of anomaly: man-bites-dog, to use the hackneyed j school example. The significance of this cannot be overstated. It means that, by definition, journalism in its most basic form deals with what life is not. Today's star journalist, however, goes to great lengths to distance himself from his trade's man bites dog heritage. To admit that what he's presenting is largely marginalia (or at best \"background music\") deflates the journalist's relevance in an environment where members of Major Media have come to regard themselves as latter day shamans and oracles. In a memorable 2002 piece, \"The Weight of the Anchor,\" columnist Frank Rich put it this way, regarding the then-Big 3 of Brokaw, Jennings, and Rather: \"Not quite movie stars, not quite officialdom, they are more famous than most movie stars and more powerful than most politicians.\" Thus, journalism as currently practiced delivers two contradictory messages: that what it puts before you (a) is newsworthy (under the old man bites dog standard), but also (b) captures the zeitgeist. (\"You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world,\" gloat all news radio stations across the country.) The news media cannot simultaneously deliver both. In practice, they fail at both. By painting life in terms of its oddities, journalism yields not a snapshot of your world, but something closer to a photographic negative. Even when journalism isn't plainly capsizing reality, it's furnishing information that varies between immaterial and misleading. For all its cinema-verit\u00e9 panache, embedded reporting, as exemplified in Iraq and in Nightline's recent series on \"the forgotten war\" in Afghanistan, shows only what's going on in the immediate vicinity of the embedded journalist. It's not all that useful for yielding an overarching sense of the progress of a war, and might easily be counterproductive: To interpret such field reporting as a valid microcosm is the equivalent of standing in a spot where it's raining and assuming it's raining everywhere. Journalism's paradoxes and problems come to a head in the concept of newsmagazination, pioneered on 60 Minutes and later the staple tactic of such popular clones as Dateline, 48 Hours, and 20/20. One of the more intellectually dishonest phenomena of recent vintage, newsmagazination presents the viewer with a circumstantial stew whipped up from: - a handful of compelling sound-bites culled from anecdotal sources, - public-opinion polls (which tell us nothing except what people think is true), - statistics that have no real evidentiary weight and/or scant relevance to the point they're being used to \"prove,\" - crushing logical flaws such as post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning, - faulty or, at best, unproven \"expert\" assumptions, or other \"conventional wisdom\" that has never been seriously examined, - a proprietary knowledge of people's inner thoughts or motives (as when a White House correspondent discounts a president's actual statements in order to reveal to us that president's \"true agenda\"), etc. Case in point: On Nov. 5, 2004, NBC's Dateline built a show around the dangers of gastric bypass surgery. The topic was a natural for Dateline, inasmuch as The Today Show's own Al Roker, who did much of the reporting, had undergone the surgery and achieved a stunning weight loss. In setting the scene, anchor Stone Phillips noted that the expected mortality rate for gastric bypass is 1 in 200. (Translation: The survival rate is 199 in 200, or 99.5 percent.) Phillips then handed off to Roker; the affable weatherman spent a few cheery moments on his own success, then found his somber face in segueing to the tragic saga of Mike Butler, who died following surgery. The Butler story consumed the next 30 minutes of the hour long broadcast, punctuated by the obligatory wistful soliloquy from Butler's young widow. So, in covering a procedure that helps (or at least doesn't kill) roughly 99.5 percent of patients, Dateline elects to tell the story in terms of the .5 percent with tragic outcomes. Had NBC sought to equitably represent the upside and downside of gastric bypass, it would've devoted 1/200th of the show \u2014 a mere 18 seconds \u2014 to Butler. Further, wouldn't it have been journalistically responsible for Dateline to devote a good portion of the broadcast to the risks of morbid obesity itself, which far outweigh the risks of surgical bypass? Do the math ... please One underlying factor here is that journalists either don't understand the difference between random data and genuine statistical proof, or they find that distinction inconvenient for their larger purpose: to make news dramatic and accessible. The media need a story line \u2014 a coherent narrative, ideally with an identifiable hero and villain. As Tom Brokaw once put it, perhaps revealing more than he intended, \"It's all storytelling, you know. That's what journalism is about.\" The mainstream news business is so unaccustomed to dealing with issues at any level of complexity and nuance that they're wont to oversimplify their story to the point of caricature. The best contemporary example is the Red State/Blue State dichotomy, invoked as an easy metaphor to express the philosophical schism that supposedly divides \"the two Americas.\" Watching CNN's Bill Schneider hover over his maps on Election Night 2004, drawing stark lines between colors, one would've thought there were no Republicans in California, or that a Democrat arriving at the Texas border would be turned back at gunpoint. Well, guess what: The dichotomy doesn't exist \u2014 certainly not in the way journalists use the term. It's just a handy, sexy media fiction. Although California did wind up in the Kerry column in 2004, some 5.5 million Californians voted for George W. Bush. They represented about 45 percent of the state's total electorate and a much larger constituency in raw numbers than Bush enjoyed in any state he won, including Texas. Speaking of Texas: That unreconstituted Yankee, John Kerry, collected 2.8 million votes there. Two-point-eight million. Yet to hear the media tell it, California is deep, cool Blue, while Texas is a glaring, monolithic Red. Such fabrications aren't just silly. They become institutionalized in the culture, and they color \u2014 in this case literally \u2014 the way Americans view the nation in which they live. The mythical Red State/Blue State paradigm is just one of the more telling indications of a general disability the media exhibit in working with data. A cluster of random events does not a \"disturbing new trend!\" make \u2014 but that doesn't stop journalists from finding patterns in happenstance. Take lightning. It kills with an eerie predictability: about 66 Americans every year. Now, lightning could kill those 66 people more or less evenly all spring and summer, or it could, in theory, kill the lot of them on one really scary Sunday in May. But the scary Sunday in May wouldn't necessarily mean we're going to have a year in which lightning kills 79,000 people. (No more than if it killed a half-dozen people named Johanssen on that Sunday would it mean that lightning is suddenly targeting Swedes.) Yet you can bet that if any half-dozen people are killed by lightning one Sunday, you'll soon see a special report along the lines of, LIGHTNING: IS IT OUT TO GET US? We've seen this propensity on display with shark attacks, meningitis, last year's rash of amusement-park fatalities, and any number of other \"random event clusters\" that occur for no reason anyone can explain. Journalists overreact to events that fall well within the laws of probability. They treat the fact that something happened as if we never before had any reason to think it could happen \u2014 as if it were a brand-new risk with previously unforeseen causation. Did America become more vulnerable on 9/11? Or had it been vulnerable all along? Indeed, it could be argued that America today is far less vulnerable, precisely because of the added vigilance inspired by 9/11. Is that how the media play it? Similarly, a bridge collapse is no reason for journalists to assume in knee-jerk fashion that bridges overall are any less safe than they've been for decades. Certainly it's no reason to jump to the conclusion that the nation's infrastructure is crumbling, which is how several major news outlets framed the collapse of the Interstate 35W Bridge this past summer. As Freud might put it, sometimes a bridge collapse is just a bridge collapse. Alas, journalism needs its story line. For a textbook example of the intellectual barrenness of so much of what's presented even as \"headline\" news, consider the Consumer Confidence Index and media coverage of same. For decades, such indices have been telling America how it feels about its economic prospects. The best known index has been compiled each month since 1967 by the Conference Board, a nonprofit organization dating to 1916. The Board's index is an arbitrary composite of indicators rooted in five equally arbitrary questions mailed to 5000 households. (\"Do you see jobs as being easier or harder to get next year?\") On Tuesday, October 30, 2007, the Board reported that its latest CCI had dipped to a two-year low. The media jumped on the story, as is ever the case when the CCI dips. (CCI upticks are seldom reported with the same fervor.) Like many of its counterparts nationally, no doubt, a Philadelphia network affiliate sent its consumer affairs reporter trudging out to find consumers who lacked confidence. She succeeded. Few reporters bother to mention that, customarily, there has been only a tenuous connection between CCI numbers and actual consumer spending or the overall health of the economy as objectively measured. In fact, just days after the release of the downbeat CCI, the Labor Department reported that the economy had generated 166,000 new jobs in October \u2014 twice the forecast. That statistic, which measures reality, got nowhere near the same play as the CCI, which measures perception. So let's recap. We have a fanciful metric that's just a compilation of opinion, which is layered with further opinion from passersby, and then subjected to in-studio analysis (still more opinion). All of which is presented to viewers as ... news. The problem for society is that giving headline prominence to meaningless or marginal events exalts those events to the status of conventional wisdom. \"Reporting confers legitimacy and relevance,\" writes Russell Frank, Professor of Journalism Ethics at Penn State University. \"When a newspaper puts a certain story on page one or a newscast puts it at or near the top of a 22 minute program, it is saying to its audience, in no uncertain terms, that 'this story is important.'\" The self-fulfilling nature of all this should be clear: News organizations decide what's important, spin it to their liking, cover it ad nauseam, then describe it \u2014 without irony \u2014 as \"the 800-pound gorilla\" or \"the issue that just won't go away.\" This is not unlike network commercials promoting sit-coms and dramas that \"everyone is talking about\" in the hopes of getting people to watch shows that apparently no one is talking about. Tonight at 11 ... the Apocalypse! Far worse than hyping a story that represents just .5 percent reality, is covering \"news\" that's zero percent reality: There literally is no story. Even so, if the non-story satisfies other requirements, it will be reported anyway. This truism was not lost on the late David Brinkley, who, towards the end of his life, observed, \"The one function that TV news performs very well is that when there is no news, we give it to you with the same emphasis as if there were.\" On June 9, 2005, as part of its ongoing series of \"Security Updates,\" CNN airs a special report titled \"Keeping Milk Safe.\" Over shots of adorable first-graders sipping from their pint cartons, CNN tells viewers that the farm-to-shelf supply chain is vulnerable at every point, beginning with the cow; with great drama, the report emphasizes the terrifying consequences such tampering could have. Nowhere does CNN mention that in the history of the milk industry, no incident of supply-chain tampering has ever been confirmed, due to terrorism or anything else. Similarly, after the Asian tsunamis struck over Christmas 2004, Dateline wasted no time casting about for an alarmist who could bring the tragedy closer to home: the familiar Could It Happen Here? motif. The show's producers found Stephen Ward, Ph.D., of the University of California at Santa Cruz. In January, Dateline's East Coast viewers heard Ward foretell a geological anomaly in their very own ocean that could generate the equivalent of \"all the bombs on earth\" detonating at once. The event Ward prophesied would unleash on New York City a wave containing \"15 or 20 times the energy\" of the Asian tsunamis. As a helpful backdrop, Dateline treated its viewers to spectacular visuals from The Day After Tomorrow, showing Manhattan's heralded landmarks disappearing beneath an onrushing, foamy sea. But for sheer overwrought absurdity, it's hard to beat what took place in mid-September 1999. For six full days, journalists behaved as if there was one story and one story only: Hurricane Floyd. The TV tempest commenced as the actual tempest still lolled hundreds of miles offshore, with no one certain how much of a threat Floyd posed, or whether it might fizzle before it hit land (as so often happens \u2014 Katrina has changed the way we think about hurricanes, but Katrina was a once-in-a-generation event). This was Saturday. By Tuesday the hurricane-in-absentia had engulfed the nightly news. While residents of areas in Floyd's projected path evacuated, the other side of the highway was clotted with news crews on their way in. By Wednesday all of the networks had their parka clad correspondents standing on some coastal beach, each correspondent bent on looking wetter and more windblown than the next. Sprinkled among all this were the requisite interviews with men (and women) on the street \u2014 as well as in insurance companies, emergency-services offices, local restaurants, and the like. Bereft of an actual hurricane to show during this feverish build-up, The Today Show aired old footage of Hurricane Hugo's plunder of Charleston, in sledgehammer foreshadowing of the disaster to come. Floyd caused a fair amount of damage when it finally hit on Thursday: 57 deaths and an estimated $6 billion in property loss. But here's where things get curious. By the time Floyd blew in, media interest clearly had ebbed. On television at least, coverage of the aftermath was dispatched in a day or so, with occasional backward glances occupying a few moments of air time in subsequent newscasts. Bottom line, the coverage of Floyd before it was a real story dwarfed the coverage given the storm once it became a story. Evidently the conjured image of tidal waves crashing on shore was more titillating to news producers than film of real life homeowners swabbing brownish muck out of their basements. Today's newspeople have substantially improved on one of the timeless axioms of their craft: \"If it bleeds, it leads.\" They prefer the mere prospect of bad news to most other kinds of news that did occur. The result is journalism as Stephen King might do it: the dogged selling of the cataclysm 'round the corner, complete with stage lighting and scenes fictionalized for dramatic purposes. Sure, the camera loves suspense. But ... is suspense news? Is it really news that someone thinks a hurricane might kill thousands? It might kill no one, either, which is historically closer to the truth. Honest journalism would wait to see what the storm does, then report it. Granted, Floyd blew in during a slow week. Following, though, is a sampling of the events that were largely ignored while the assembled media were waiting for Floyd: - The House of Representatives took a hard stand on soft money, approving limits on campaign spending. - The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission launched an investigation of corporate America's fondness for cash balance pension plans, an issue that affected millions of workers, and stood to affect millions more. - The 17 member Joint Security Commission released a chilling report on America's handling of security clearance applications. This, let us remember, was two years before the terror attacks of 9/11. - Also covered with the media equivalent of a yawn that week were the terrorist bombings in Russia and the gruesome, continuing holocaust in East Timor. The advance billing given to Floyd bespeaks a gloomy trend in broadcast news' continuing slide toward theater. We witnessed this same phenomenon during the run-up to Desert Storm, Y2K, and the Clinton impeachment, among others. The Crusades \u2014 postmodern style Nowhere are these foibles more noticeable \u2014 or more of a threat to journalistic integrity \u2014 than when they coalesce into a cause: so-called \"advocacy\" or \"social\" journalism. To begin with, there are legitimate questions about whether journalism should even have causes. Does the journalist alone know what's objectively, abstractly good or evil? What deserves supporting or reforming? The moment journalists claim license to cover events sympathetically or cynically, we confront the problem of what to cover sympathetically or cynically, where to draw such lines and \u2014 above all \u2014 who gets to draw them. There are very few issues that unite the whole of mankind. Regardless, as Tom Rosenstiel of the Project for Excellence in Journalism told USA Today, \"News outlets have found they can create more ... identity by creating franchise brands around issues or around a point of view.\" Worse, for our purposes, the data on which journalists premise their crusades are drawn from the same marginalia discussed above. When Francisco Serrano was discovered to be living in the Minnesota high school he once attended, the media covered the 2005 story as if every American high school had a half-dozen homeless people living in it. The actual episode, though exceedingly rare if not one-of-a-kind, became a window to the nation's social failings. In his thinking and methodology, today's journalist resembles the homicide cop who, having settled on a suspect, begins collecting evidence specifically against that suspect, dismissing information that counters his newfound theory of the crime. Too many journalists think in terms of buttressing a preconceived argument or fleshing out a sense of narrative gained very early in their research. This mindset is formalized in journalism's highest award: the Pulitzer Prize. Traditionally, stories deemed worthy of Pulitzer consideration have revealed the dark (and, often as not, statistically insignificant) underbelly of American life. In 2007 the Pulitzer for \"public-service journalism\" went to The Wall Street Journal, for its \"creative and comprehensive probe into backdated stock options for business executives...\" The Journal reported on \"possible\" violations then under investigation at 120 companies. There are 2764 listed companies on the New York Stock Exchange; NASDAQ adds another 3200. Not to dismiss the sincerity and diligence of the Journal's work, but what's the final takeaway here? That 120 companies (0.02) \"possibly\" cheated? Or that \u2014 so far as anyone knows \u2014 at least 5844 others didn't? Food for thought: Every time I fly, I'm amazed that these huge, winged machines get off the ground, stay off the ground, and don't return to ground until they're supposed to. Think about the failure rate of commonplace products: Light bulbs burn out. Fan belts snap. Refrigerators stop refrigerating. But planes don't crash. Actuarially speaking, they simply don't. The entire process of commercial flight and the systems that support it is remarkable. Do you fully understand it? I don't. I'm sure lots of people don't. Still, you won't win a Pulitzer for a piece that sheds light on the myriad \"little miracles\" that conspire to produce aviation's normalcy, stability and success. You'd be laughed out of today's newsrooms for even proposing such a piece (unless you were doing it as the kind of feel-good feature that editors like to give audiences as gifts for the holidays). Have a flight go down, however \u2014 one flight, one time \u2014 and have a reporter find some overworked ATC operator or other aberration that may have caused the disaster, and voila! You're in Pulitzer territory for writing about something that \u2014 essentially \u2014 never happens. Just as journalists who run out of news may create it, journalists who run out of real causes may invent them. It's not hard to do. All you need is a fact or two, which you then \"contextualize\" with more so-called expert opinion. December 10, 2004 was a banner night for exposing those well-known dens of iniquity that masquerade as Amish settlements. Stories about rape and incest among the Amish appeared on both Dateline and 20/20. The Dateline story even made reference to the principal character in the story that aired an hour later on 20/20 \u2014 which gives you some idea how common the abuse may be, if seasoned journalists must choreograph their expos\u00e9s around the same incident. That brings us to Elizabeth Vargas and her question for 20/20's expert on Amish affairs: Just how widespread is this abuse? Amid stock footage of adorable children strolling down a dusky road in suspenders and bonnets, the expert tells America that it's \"not a gross exception.\" What kind of reporting is that? Does it indicate that 1 percent of Amish children are abused? Ten percent? Forty percent? Who knows? This is what passes for investigative journalism nowadays. Their world ... and they're welcome to it The world we're \"given\" has an indisputable impact on how Americans see and live their lives. (How many other events are set in motion by the \"truths\" people infer from the news?) Here we enter the realm of iatrogenic reporting: provable harms that didn't exist until journalism itself got involved. In science journalism in particular, the use of anecdotal information can have results that would be comical, were it not for the public alarm that often results in response. Pop quiz: How many Americans have died of Mad Cow Disease? Before you answer, let's look to Britain, where the scare began in earnest around 1995 after a few herd of cattle were found to be infected. First of all, in the cows themselves, what we call \"Mad Cow\" is technically bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE. When BSE species-jumps to humans, it manifests itself as something called variant Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease, or vCJD. (\"Non-variant\" CJD occurs independently of cows and can even be inherited.) A link between BSE and vCJD was established in 1996. British reporters went scurrying to find epidemiologists who were alarmed by the discovery, some of whom obligingly put the death toll in the coming years above 500,000. By late 2006, the end of Mad Cow's first documented decade, the U.K. had confirmed a total of 162 human deaths \u2014 nothing to be glib about. But that's a long way from 500,000. (Undaunted, enterprising British reporters have begun talking about \"mad sheep.\" No joke.) And here in the U.S.? The CDC describes two confirmed deaths, both involving people born and raised abroad. A third case involves a man from Saudi Arabia who remains alive at this writing. Not what you might've expected, eh? Nevertheless, when a New Jersey woman, Janet Skarbek, became convinced that an outbreak had killed off her neighbors, she found a warm welcome in newsrooms. Her dire pronouncements touched off a mini hysteria. Even after the CDC eliminated vCJD as a factor, the media kept fanning the fires of public concern, typically by quoting Dr. Michael Greger, a part time chef and full-time alarmist who labels Mad Cow \"the plague of the 21st Century.\" When journalists want a fatalistic sound bite on the disease, they dial Greger's number. However history may remember Mad Cow as an actual pathology, this much is sure: The media inflamed scare has been fatal to jobs \u2014 most directly in the meat packing industry, but in related enterprises as well. It has soured consumers on beef. It has caused volatile swings in livestock prices. It has mandated new protocols that add hundreds of thousands of dollars to the average cattle rancher's cost of doing business. It has caused us to cut ourselves off from key beef suppliers, fomenting minor crises in diplomacy and commerce. A 2005 survey reckoned the total cost of Mad Cow to U.S. agricultural interests at between $3.2 billion and $4.7 billion. This, for something that has killed far fewer Americans in 10 years than the 200 who die each month from choking on food or food substances. To hear the media tell it, we're under perpetual siege from some Terrifying New Disease That Threatens to End Life as We Know It. It's too soon to render verdicts on the ultimate impact of avian flu, but that pathogen would have to wipe out many millions in order to justify the hype. Lyme Disease? The Cleveland Clinic has this to say: \"Although rarely fatal and seldom a serious illness, Lyme Disease has been widely publicized, frequently overdramatized, and sometimes linked to unproven conditions.\" Is it coincidence that visits to national parks began tracking downward in 1999, amid media coverage that made it sound as if deer ticks and the rest of Mother Nature's foot-soldiers had declared war on humankind? Maybe. Maybe not. In science reporting and everywhere else, there's no minimizing the psychic effects of regularly consuming a world-view rooted in peculiarity, much of which is pessimistic. In a 2003 Gallup poll, just 11 percent of respondents rated crime in their own neighborhoods as \"very serious\" or \"extremely serious,\" yet 54 percent of those same respondents deemed crime in America as a whole \"very serious\" or \"extremely serious.\" The catch-22 should be apparent: If crime were that pervasive, it would have to be occurring in a lot more than 11 percent of the respondents' \"own neighborhoods.\" Such an enigmatic skew can only be explained in terms of the difference between what people personally experience \u2014 what they know firsthand \u2014 and the wider impressions they get from the news. Figuratively speaking, we end up drowning in the tides of a hurricane that never makes shore. I give you, herewith, a capsule summary your world, and in far less than 22 minutes: - The current employment rate is 95.3 percent. - Out of 300 million Americans, roughly 299.999954 million were not murdered today. - Day after day, some 35,000 commercial flights traverse our skies without incident. - The vast majority of college students who got drunk last weekend did not rape anyone, or kill themselves or anyone else in a DUI or hazing incident. On Monday, they got up and went to class, bleary-eyed but otherwise okay. It is not being a Pollyanna to state such facts, because they are facts. Next time you watch the news, keep in mind that what you're most often seeing is trivia framed as Truth. Or as British humorist/philosopher G.K. Chesteron whimsically put it some decades ago, \"Journalism consists in saying 'Lord Jones is dead' to people who never knew Lord Jones was alive.\" lecture reminder...

He played to disentangle his brain and clarify the question at hand. Mozart especially did the trick. Einstein loved Mozart's highly organized, intensely patterned sonatas. He felt, as many before him, that music and the reasoning intellect were linked. Music and his scientific work, he said, were \"born of the same source.\" It was with this same belief that Dr. Gordon Shaw, a University of California (Irvine) psychologist, corralled 36 undergraduates for a research experiment in February 1993. The students were given three spatial-reasoning tasks from the Stanford-Binet intelligence tests. Before each task, they listened to ten minutes of either silence, a relaxation tape, or Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major. According to a paper published later that year in Nature, listening to Mozart boosted the students' IQ by an average of eight to nine points. The improvement, researchers said, lasted between ten and fifteen minutes. The results were widely reported as evidence of what the press dubbed \"the Mozart Effect.\" The International Herald Tribune, for example, proclaimed \"Mozart's Notes Make Good Brain Food.\" Don Campbell, a classical musician and former music critic, was the first to recognize the research's commercial potential. Campbell expanded the definition of the Mozart Effect to include all music's influence on intelligence, health, emotions, and creativity. In 1996, he trademarked it. Today, the Mozart Effect boasts the lateral spread typical of any successful brand. Campbell has authored 18 books, a series of spoken tapes, and 16 albums incorporating Mozart's music. The small commercial empire includes the recently published Mozart Effect for Children, which explains, in a chapter entitled \"Twinkle Twinkle, Little Neuron,\" that Mozart's music enhances the network of connections forming in the infant brain. His recordings, one of which features Don Giovanni for the developing fetus, have sold over two million copies. Since the U.C. Irvine study, the Mozart Effect has become fixed in the public consciousness. Zell Miller, while governor of Georgia, earmarked $105,000 of the state's annual budget to supply every newborn with a cassette or CD of classical music. \"No one doubts that listening to music, especially at a very early age, affects the spatial-temporal reasoning that underlies math, engineering and chess,\" he explained to the Georgia legislature. In Florida, a bill was passed requiring all state-funded education and child-care programs to give a daily dose of classical music to children under five years old. Recently, the coach of the New York Jets, Eric Mangini, began playing classical music to help his football players concentrate at training camp study sessions. It remains to be seen whether Mozart's melodies will affect this season's record. What the Science Really Says While the Mozart Effect flourishes commercially, the U.C. Irvine study that launched the phenomenon has been widely criticized. The startling results announced by the initial paper were misleading. First, the researchers claimed that the undergraduates improved on all three spatial-reasoning tests. But, as Shaw later clarified, the only enhancement came from one task \u2014 paper folding and cutting. Further, the researchers presented the data in the form of Stanford-Binet IQ scores; yet the study only measured spatial-reasoning, one-third of a complete IQ test. To arrive at the full scores, the students' partial results were inflated by a factor of three. The methodology of the study has also come under fire. According to some critics, the test group of 36 psychology undergraduates may not have been large or varied enough to produce credible results. Even Don Campbell has criticized the experiment's lack of controls. In the endnotes to his 1997 bestseller, The Mozart Effect, Campbell observes that the U.C. Irvine researchers \"did not administer listening tests before testing, as many researchers in the field recommend. Nor did they examine how posture, food intake, or the time of day modified their listening.\" Naturally, Campbell believes that had these controls been in place, the Mozart Effect would have been more dramatically evident. Many scientists have proposed alternative explanations for the study's results. Who's to say that Mozart's sonata caused the difference in scores? Maybe listening to an annoying relaxation tape or ten minutes of dead silence impaired the students' performance. Or perhaps the students experienced a change in mood and arousal rather than a fluctuation in intelligence. One study found that listening to a Stephen King short story had a comparable effect on spatial-reasoning scores, but only for those who enjoyed what they heard. Is it possible that Mozart's sonata had simply stimulated or uplifted the subjects in the U.C. Irvine study? After all, Shaw selected that particular sonata not just for its organized, cerebral quality, but because it is \"riveting\" and \"never boring.\" But the most damaging blow to the Mozart Effect has been the failure of other researchers to reproduce the Irvine results. Psychologist Kenneth Steele and his colleagues replicated the experiment in 1999 and found no trace of the Mozart Effect. \"A requiem may therefore be in order,\" Steele wrote in Nature. Dr. Frances Rauscher, co-author of the Irvine study, countered that the Mozart Effect cannot be found under all laboratory conditions. \"Because some people cannot get bread to rise,\" she wrote, \"does not negate the existence of a 'yeast effect.'\" But that same year, a Harvard psychologist analyzed 16 studies on the Mozart Effect, including the original experiment and concluded that any cognitive enhancement was small and within the average variation of a single person's IQ-test performance. In 2007, the German Ministry of Education and Research conducted a similar meta-analysis. Their findings were unambiguous: passively listening to any kind of music, whether by Mozart or Madonna, does not increase intelligence. The German report did, however, propose a link between musical training and IQ development. According to recent studies, the motor and auditory skills developed for musical performance may have a long-term influence on intelligence. In fact, brain mapping has revealed that professional musicians have more grey matter in their right auditory cortex than nonmusicians, as if practicing an instrument flexed a muscle in the brain. It seems increasingly likely that the long-term practice of playing music, rather than merely listening, can have the kind of impact suggested by the Mozart Effect. Einstein, after all, organized his mind by playing the violin, not listening to a recording. Ironically, the U.C. Irvine researchers had initially planned to test whether music training for young children would increase higher brain function. When Shaw, a particle physicist, developed an interest in neuroscience later in his career, U.C. Irvine gave him the freedom to research what he wanted. But, according to his book Keeping Mozart in Mind, he had to make do with \"extremely limited resources.\" So Shaw scaled down his ambition. He thought, \"if music training might yield a long-term enhancement of spatial-temporal reasoning, then perhaps even listening to music might produce a short-term enhancement!\" Fourteen years and dozens of studies later, it is clear this analogy was off the mark. Magic Mozart What can explain the Mozart Effect's persistent hold on the public consciousness despite the lack of solid scientific evidence? No art-lover expects to absorb a better memory by staring at a Renaissance painting. No reader hopes to pluck IQ points from a classic novel. So why are Mozart Effect products snatched up by the millions? Perhaps it's unsurprising that Mozart, a historical figure enveloped in myths, should be at the center of yet another. According to the most recent spate of biographies, the real Mozart was an incessant reviser addicted to his work. Yet the details of the Mozart legend \u2014 his astonishing prowess as a child prodigy, his immaculate first drafts \u2014 have bolstered the popular belief that the composer was a fine-tuned antenna picking up snatches of celestial song. Einstein didn't help matters. He described Mozart's music as \"so pure that it seemed to have been ever-present in the universe, waiting to be discovered by the master.\" The creators of the Mozart Effect have eagerly traded on the composer's lingering mystique. Campbell traces the source of Mozart's talent to his time in the womb: his father's violin playing \"almost certainly enhanced his neurological development and awakened the cosmic rhythms in utero.\" Shaw also portrays Mozart as supernaturally gifted. Keeping Mozart in Mind is packaged with a CD of the Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major. \"Before you read further,\" Shaw writes in the Preface, \"I suggest that you slip the CD out of the book, make yourself comfortable, and listen to the magic genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\" To Shaw, Mozart is not a musical genius; he's a magic genius whose music rains down brief moments of enhanced brainpower. But Mozart is not the only magic genius. The transformation of a dubious psychology study into a multi-million dollar industry also has a touch of the miraculous. In The Mozart Effect, Don Campbell summarizes Shaw and Rauscher's conclusions \u2014 the scientific backbone of his brand \u2014 when he writes: \"Listening to music, they concluded, acts as 'an exercise' for facilitating symmetry operations associated with higher brain function. In plain English, it can improve your concentration, enhance your ability to make intuitive leaps, and, not incidentally, shave a few strokes off your golf game!\" Campbell's translation of the U.C. Irvine study into \"plain English\" is inaccurate and insincere \u2014 an abracadabra that replaces questionable research with fantasy. The Mozart Effect has carried on long after the initial study has been discarded because it was never about science to begin with. If the Mozart Effect teaches us anything, it's that the results of a flawed study are always at risk of becoming a common expression, a copyrighted product, a popular belief infused with a magic that is difficult to dispel.

Ever since Skeptic magazine published an investigative article on the 9/11 \"Truth Movement\" and analyzed their claims, which were found wanting, I have been hounded by the so-called 9/11 \"truthers\" because I am the editor of the magazine and therefore am suppose to be a \"skeptic\" of the official explanation for 9/11. In fact, throughout January, I have been on a book tour for The Mind of the Market, my book on behavioral economics and evolutionary economics, and at every event during the Q&A one of these \"truthers\" pretends to ask a question about economics but then quickly shifts to a rant about what \"really happened\" on September 11, 2001... The 2008 Annual Edge Question: What Have You Changed Your Mind About? The Nature of Human Nature by Michael Shermer When I was a graduate student in experimental psychology, I cut my teeth in a Skinnerian behavioral laboratory. As a behaviorist I believed that human nature was largely a blank slate on which we could impose positive and negative reinforcements (and punishments if necessary) to shape people and society into almost anything we want. As a young college professor I taught psychology from this perspective and even created a new course on the history and psychology of war, in which I argued that people are by nature peaceful and nonviolent, and that wars were thus a byproduct of corrupt governments and misguided societies. The data from evolutionary psychology has now convinced me that we evolved a dual set of moral sentiments: within groups we tend to be pro-social and cooperative, but between groups we are tribal and xenophobic. Archaeological evidence indicates that Paleolithic humans were anything but noble savages, and that civilization has gradually but ineluctably reduced the amount of within-group aggression and between-group violence. And behavior genetics has erased the tabula rasa and replaced it with a highly constrained biological template upon which the environment can act. I have thus changed my mind about this theory of human nature in its extreme form. Human nature is more evolutionarily determined, more cognitively irrational, and more morally complex than I thought.

How do we parse these messages, and how do our choices affect the world economy? This week on Skepticality, Derek & Swoopy discuss how economic and evolutionary theory speak the same language, and how our hardwired human biology affects modern economics, with Skeptic Society founder Dr. Michael Shermer (author of The Mind of the Market: Compassionate Apes, Competitive Humans and Other Tales from Evolutionary Economics). As a tie-in to this week's Skepticality we present Michael Shermer's recent LA Times opinion editorial entitled Why People Believe Weird Things About Money based on concepts from his new book [The Mind of the Market](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b126HB). Why People Believe Weird Things About Money an LA Times op-ed by Michael Shermer Would you rather earn $50,000 a year while other people make $25,000, or would you rather earn $100,000 a year while other people get $250,000? Assume for the moment that prices of goods and services will stay the same. Surprisingly \u2014 stunningly, in fact \u2014 research shows that the majority of people select the first option; they would rather make twice as much as others even if that meant earning half as much as they could otherwise have. How irrational is that? In this week's eSkeptic feature, Norman Levitt responds to Steve Fuller's response to Norman Levitt's review of [Science vs. Religion?: Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0745641229?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0745641229) (Polity Press, 2007, ISBN 0745641229). Norman Levitt Responds to Steve Fuller Professor Fuller's protest of my review obviously invites a rejoinder. I tag each of my responses with the last line or so of the passage containing Fuller's specific objection, though the full passage should be consulted to see what the central point is: \"That the universe is intelligently designed need not imply that God micromanages it from moment to moment.\" There is a point here, but it badly misfires when conscripted to Fuller's intended argument. One might assert that some supernatural entity intervenes in the processes that produce the array of life forms that we see (including ourselves) or in the shaping of the course of the universe in general, but that this \"divine intelligence\" operates in ways which our lamentably limited mentalilties cannot distinguish from mere randomness. Logically, this is possible. But it constitutes an extremely weak argument for the actual existence of a divinity \u2014 a last ditch attempt to rescue an hypothesis for which there is no real evidence. More to the point, however, is that this argument, or anything like it, is thoroughly repellent to Intelligent Design creationists. The chief ID dogma incorporates the insistence is that \"design\" is not only a biological reality, but that it can be indisputably discerned and identified, even to the point of absolutely invalidating a Darwinian alternative. This point, by the way, was insisted upon by no less an authority than Phillip Johnson in an e-mail exchange with me; he was clearly horrified by the idea of a Creator who did not ostentatiously sign his handiwork. \"Darwin's botched understanding of heredity should count against methodological naturalism (which Levitt misnames 'materialism').\" Fuller here attempts to draw a parallel between two vastly incomparable situations. Newton's attempt to find some room in his cosmology for an activist, interventionist Deity was clearly a fudge, something which his own incomparable insight into the logical structure of \"Newtonian mechanics\" should have proscribed. Darwin, on the other hand, can hardly be said to have had a \"botched\" understanding of heredity simply because there was no body of knowledge on the subject, due to Darwin or anyone else, which he can be said to have misunderstood, willfully or otherwise. He made the best guesses he could, as did any contemporary concerned with the matter. \"I count these people as ID theorists just as much as Dembski and Behe.\" This is so confused one hardly knows where to begin refuting it. First of all, Newton was in no sense an adherent of the deus abscondatus, a notion that had begun to creep into the philosophical literature through Spinoza and other bold materialists. That was precisely the dragon he was trying to slay in his desperate attempt to find room in his system for an activist, interventionist deity directing the courses of planets and comets in occasional defiance of Newton's own \"laws.\" Furthermore, Newton's anti-Trinitarianism was extremely well-disguised, and very far from being a matter of common knowledge in his day. It is only rather recent historical scholarship that has made it well-known. Thus it can hardly have been a significant influence on scientific thought or methodology in the century or so following his death. But, in fact, in the early 18th century the term \"Newtonian\" did have a well-known and precise theological meaning. Specifically, it was embraced by the most Establishmentarian of the Anglican Establishment as part of its rather complacent creed. Briefly, \"Newtonianism\" in this very unscientific context meant the view that, just as the Deity had established laws that governed the movement of celestial bodies so as to exhibit exquisite orderliness and intellectual perfection, He had also created a civil, political, and ecclesiastical earthly polity that was likewise perfect in its orderliness and rationality. Of course, this state was England itself, under its divinely-ordained class system, its constitutional equilibrium, its unyielding Protestantism in the face of Papist pretensions, and, most of all, its acceptance of high-Anglican orthodoxy (including its unquestioning Trinitarianism!) as the one true and proper theology. Needless to say, this conscription of the term \"Newtonian\" is extremely ironic, given Newton's actual, though hidden, opinions. But it perfectly illustrates the pointlessness of trying to explain the development of any aspect of science in terms of Newton's hermetic religious views. \"No, I simply deny that there is a principled difference between rhetoric and science.\" This is a ploy \u2014 one might say a rhetorical ploy \u2014 to which postmodernists endlessly and incorrigibly recur. There is no evidence for it and it is more than faintly ridiculous \u2014 try sitting through a lecture on Ricci flows on Riemannian structures on 3-manifolds and decide for yourself whether the difference that Fuller scorns is real. But as a war-cry to rouse the ignorant and impressionable, his slogan is ever so useful. Enough said. \"After all, Darwin's own theory was kept afloat for its first half-century largely by an unholy alliance of capitalists, eugenicists, free-floating racists, and wishful theologians.\" The ideological situation of Darwinism in the late 19th century is much more complicated than Fuller lets on; he merely repeats cliches that have become de rigueur within the postmodern left. In fact, however, Darwin had an enthusiastic following amongst the radical left as well as a portion of the devil-take-the-hindmost right. The fact that it was inextricable from a materialist, monist, anti-teleological view of the world made Darwinism, per se, a radical challenge to standard bourgeois worldviews. To put it another way, who was the true \"radical\" at the Scopes trial?; Bryan or Darrow? But in any case, Darwinism prevailed, not because it was serviceable to the winners of some hypothetical ideological struggle, but because of its ever-amazing parsimony and its singular consistency with observed fact, a solid body of evidence that over the years grew far beyond what was available to Darwin in the 1840's. \"Why Levitt should fear this prospect to such an extent that it compromises his critical judgment remains a mystery to me.\" ID, in full battle array, with its ample funding by right-wing billionaires and its frenetic tactics of political log-rolling amongst right-wing Republicans, has been on the scene for about a dozen years, not quite enough to lay down a complete historical record, but sufficient to justify some more-than-tentative inferences. The most important of these is that there have been virtually no \"converts\" to ID theory amongst scientists in any discipline. The best that the ID dog-and-pony-show can offer is a couple of pathetic cases with real but unprepossessing scientific credentials who were hard-case creationists to begin with and were motivated to become \"scientists\" in order to make that cause more convincing to laymen. In any case, it remains glaringly obvious that Fuller's misreading of the politics that generated and sustains the ID movement is so complete as to constitute a peculiar pathology all its own. One devoutly hopes that sociologists as a whole are resistant to this contagion.
