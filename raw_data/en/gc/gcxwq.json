CooneyETHICS Dr. Carpenter is a racetrack practitioner in Southern California and a member of the AAEP's Professional Conduct and Ethics Committee.AAEP News February 2018 III continued on page IVWhen a second opinion does more harm than good By Ryan Carpenter, DVM, MS, DACVS Equine practitioners are fortunate to know their clients well\u2014often on a personal level. Because of this daily inter-action, owners and trainers feel comfortable reaching out for advice from a number of sources within their personal and professional circle. For any given case, communication most frequently occurs between the veterinarian and trainer, who then relays this information to the client. Unfortunately, and despite the trainer's best efforts, important information is often lost during this communication. No one would argue that the best form of communica- tion is when all three parties directly communicate with each other. However, this is rarely the case, particularly with the instant access of the digital world where radio-graphs, ultrasound and nuclear scintigraphy images are often sent by text or email. Clients have become accustomed to and expect immediate responses, sometimes even going so far as seeking an informal second opinion by sharing diagnostic images with other veterinarians with whom they have an established rapport. In situations such as these, there exists a need for an additional, vital layer of communication between the consulting and attending veterinarians, not only as a pro-fessional courtesy but also to negate any unforeseen issues of ethical and professional liability. When two veterinari-ans can discuss the case details, the client will get better advice and the horse will benefit. This should be the goal. When this communication does not occur, important details are often overlooked and the horse suffers. Unfortunately, it is not a common practice for both veter-inarians to have this important conversation. To illustrate, let's take a 3-year-old Thoroughbred racehorse that developed a right front lameness with moderate fetlock joint effusion following a work. The lameness was localized to the fetlock joint with diagnostic anesthesia. Radiographically, a rounded fragment was noted on the proximal dorsal aspect of the sagittal ridge. The trainer reports that he has had trouble training this filly for the past several weeks, and she has come out of her works sore so he wants to give her time off. Based on the joint effusion, diagnostic arthroscopy would be useful, allowing removal of the fragment and evaluation of the articular surface for any potential cause of the increased joint effusion. So the trainer calls the owner and says, \"There is a chip in the ankle. We need to do surgery and give her 60 days off.\" He follows up with a text message picture of the radiograph. Although this statement is perfectly clear in the trainer's mind, from a veterinary standpoint there are several inac-curacies that need to be addressed. The client then sends the radiograph off to their veterinarian who says, \"That's an old OCD fragment so it does not need to come out. I would medicate the fetlock joint and continue training.\" By failing to speak to the attending veterinarian directly, the consulting veterinarian fails to take into consideration several important factors that should not and cannot be overlooked. First, the horse is lame, the lameness has persisted after the last couple works and, most recently, was localized to the fetlock joint. Second, the joint effusion is new and has increased over the past couple of weeks. Finally, without knowing the trainer and his style, the consulting veterinarian doesn't realize that this trainer often trains his horses on NSAIDs. As a result, by the time horses in this stable are coming out of their works sore, they are much further down the road to injury compared to horses conditioned by a trainer with a different training philosophy. The client instructs the trainer that \"their\" vet wants them to medicate the joint because he or she doesn't think the chip is causing the problem and keep training the horse because it is just \"a few works away from a race.\" The trainer does not want to lose the client so he elects to try this option. The attending veterinarian does not medicate the joint out of fear of potential injury, but the trainer continues to train the horse without the attending veterinarian's knowledge. Unfortunately the filly sustains a lateral condylar fracture two works later.This may be an extreme case, but it highlights an important point that exists in all types of equine practice. Dr. Ryan Carpenter ETHICS HIGHLIGHTS: Informal second opinions require collegiality between the attending and consulting veterinarians for best outcome. Complete and accurate information is essential to providing clients with best possible recommendations.The AAEP has elevated its Performance Horse Task Force into a standalone committee. The move will help AAEP effectively address issues pertaining to English sport horse and Western performance horse disciplines and facilitate the care of equine participants in these fields. The Performance Horse Committee is chaired by Dr. Mark Baus, founding owner of Grand Prix Equine in Bridgewater, Conn., and composed of 16 members whose practices revolve around performance horses. The charge of the committee is to: r\u0001proactively identify and address issues of importance to equine veterinarians and horse show entities; r\u0001 QSPWJEF\u0001MFBEFSTIJQ\u0001BOE\u0001FYQFSUJTF\u0001PO\u0001BMM\u0001BTQFDUT\u0001PG\u0001UIF\u0001 performance horse that affect the health and welfare of the horse and the integrity of the competition; r\u0001 DPNNVOJDBUF\u0001UP\u0001\"\"&1\u0001NFNCFST\u0001BOE\u0001PUIFS\u0001TUBLFIPME - ers AAEP positions and recommendations on those issues; and r\u0001 FEVDB te AAEP members and stakeholders on best practices and ethical care of the performance horse.For more information, including a list of committee members, visit the \"Committees and Councils\" section of the website under the \"About\" tab at aaep.org. AAEP establishes Performance Horse Committee Committee to provide leadership on performance horse health, industry issuesASSOCIATION When a second opinion does more harm than good, continued Veterinarians are called to be advocates for the horse; as such, we strive to provide clients with the best information and recommendations possible. This can only be offered when complete and accurate infor-mation is considered. Nothing is lost by a simple conversation. Unfortu-nately, given the competitive nature of the equine industry, this collegial interaction often does not occur. In the previously described case, if some type of communication between the two veterinarians would have occurred, they would ultimately have agreed that the chip actually was an old OCD lesion and not the cause of lameness. However, the new joint effusion combined with the training style of the trainer would indicate that further diagnostics and time off would be the best course of action despite the horse being so close to a race. Diagnostic arthrosco-py should be considered as a reasonable recommendation if further diagnostics like nuclear scintigraphy were not an option in order to more fully investigate the cause of the increased fetlock effusion and persistent lameness. Counterintu-itively, diagnostic arthroscopy might even creep higher on the recommen-dation list if the lameness could not be directly tied to an obvious radio-graphic abnormality. Additionally, the rest period following surgery would allow for bone remodeling to occur, which would mitigate the risk of fracture and significantly reduce the amount of time off following injury. As veterinarians, we owe it to our patients to pick up the phone and have a simple conversation. Even if we \"agree to disagree,\" we owe it to the horse. IV AAEP News February 2018 ETHICS Dr. Joe LymanThe AAEP has published on its website updated biosecu- rity guidelines to help minimize the occurrence and mitigate the spread of potential disease outbreaks, which can inflict significant economic hardship due to loss of horses, loss of use and shutdown of industry activity. The guidelines document is published as a PDF file and incorporates comprehensive information and step-by-step protocols and recommendations in three distinct areas: identification of key personnel, important contacts and reference materials; routine biosecurity protocol; and outbreak response. \"Our goal was to provide AAEP members with a com- prehensive document that serves as a one-stop resource for equine biosecurity topics,\" said Dr. Stephanie Brault, chair of the Biosecurity Subcommittee of the AAEP's Infectious Disease Committee. In addition to the updated guidelines, a companion worksheet in the late stages of development will serve as a practical resource to help practitioners work with clients to reduce risk by planning for an outbreak. The worksheet\u2014a fillable PDF\u2014is expected to be available in March.Visit aaep.org/guidelines/infectious-disease-control and select \"AAEP Biosecurity Guidelines\" to view the updated guidelines or to save them to your phone or tablet for future reference. Additional biosecurity information specific to common situations and locations such as breeding operations, events and travel are available from the Equine Disease Communication Center through the \"Biosecurity\" link at equinediseasecc.org. Updated biosecurity guidelines now available Companion worksheet to assist clients with risk reduction Dr. Nat White Touch Point: 'Difficult Conversations' video series helps you discuss tough topics with clients The AAEP Touch Program's Difficult Conversations video series delivers advice from veteran practitioners about topics that often can create challenging communication situations in daily practice. The titles in the series are \"Ending a Client Relationship\"; \"Euthanasia\"; \"Discussing Service Fees\"; and \"Introducing a New Veterinarian to Clients.\" According to market research with horse owners and trainers, the No. 1 reason why a client fires a veterinarian is because the client did not like the veterinarian's commu-nication style or demeanor. In addition, when asked to rank the attributes most valued in a veterinarian, owners and trainers placed high importance on a veterinarian showing compassion towards the horse and listening to the client's opinion. The Difficult Conversations series will help you navigate the sensitive topics that so strongly affect your relation-ships with your clients.To access the videos and all other Touch resources, visit touch.aaep.org. You will log in using the same username and password as you use for the AAEP's main website, aaep.org. Look for the \"Difficult Conversations\" icon at the bottom of the website's home page.

The total reflects a $170,911,689 gain from 2016 and marks the third consecutive year of increased wagering. Wagering gains were achieved despite a 2.1% decline in the number of race days and a 1.7% decline in the number of races. Purse money dipped 0.4% to $1,079,739,805. Nearly half of the wagering increase was achieved in the final two months of the year as new, bettor-friendly regulations exempted large numbers of bets from triggering the imposition of a 20% withholding on winnings.Meanwhile, total wagering on U.S. harness racing in 2017 fell 4.4% to $1,383,189,222, a decline of $63,579,485 from 2016. The number of race days dipped 1.8%; however, purses increased 2.4% to $432,995,289.U.S. Thoroughbred INDUSTRY Being an AAEP Educational Partner is just one of the ways IDEXX Laboratories supports equine care and the practitioners who provide it.

Proceedings paper sheds additional light on client preferencesINDUSTRY XII AAEP News February 2018 Organizations hosting Operation Gelding clinics in 2018 can apply for microchips to be inserted at the time gelding services are performed. The Unwanted Horse Coalition has partnered with MicrochipID Equine to provide the microchips for its new \"Operation Chip\" service. Each chip comes with a chip syringe and prepaid registration card, and the veterinarian performing the gelding procedure is responsible for inserting the chip. The UHC covers the cost to register each implanted chip and offers each participating 501(c)(3) rescue organization the opportunity to apply for a deeply discounted microchip scanner. The UHC hopes to expand the program by enabling rescue organi- zations to apply only for chips to be inserted in horses under their care, which would further facilitate tracking of horses as they transition through life and help reunite horse and owner in the event of a natural disaster.

Data from 250 horses castrated over a 5-year period were analysed in order to determine the prevalence of complications in the 30-day post-operative period. Sixty percent of horses (n =150) experienced complications, which is up to three times higher than previously reported. Of these complications, 56.7% (n =85) were classi ed as mild (e.g. seroma formation, mild infection, mild colic), 38% (n=57) were classi ed as moderate (e.g. seroma formation requiring digital opening of the wound, funiculitis, loosefaeces or moderately painful colic) and 5.3% (n =8) were classi ed as severe (e.g. pyrexia, excessive and prolonged haemorrhage, peritonitis). There was a signi cant difference between complication severity and time to return togalloping and racing. Despite variations in technique such as ligating the testicular vessels, performing scrotal ablation etc., post-operative carewas reportedly within standard practices and the veterinariansperforming the procedures were experienced clinicians. Therewas also no association between rate of complication andmonth or season. From these ndings it appears that open standing castration may have a far higher complication ratethan previously thought. Septic peritonitis treatment In this knowledge summary Sarah Scott Smith examines the published evidence to answer the question 'in adult horses with septic peritonitis, does peritoneal lavage combined with antibiotic therapy compared to antibiotic therapy alone improve survival rates? '. A small quantity of evidence is available and the quality of the evidence is low, with comparison of the two treatmentmodalities in equids only performed in case series. One studyperformed the most robust analysis possible of a retrospectivecase series by using multivariate analysis to examine theeffect of multiple variables on survival. Inherent to case seriesis the risk that case selection will have introduced signi cant bias into the results; peritoneal lavage may be used morecommonly in more severely affected cases or where theabdomen has been contaminated with intestinal or uterinecontents. There have been no randomised trials to comparethe ef cacy of the treatment options discussed. When examining the method of peritoneal lavage chosen there is a single experimental, randomised control trialcomparing the use of sterile forabdominal lavage in horses. The quality of evidence describingtypes of antibiotics used is low (case series) and there is nodirect comparison of antibiotics used. The conclusion of this summary was that there is no evidence in equids that there is a difference in survival whenthe use of antibiotics is compared to the use of antibioticscombined with peritoneal lavage. However, the quality ofdata available is insuf cient to direct clinical practice apart from two areas; in peritonitis caused by Actinobacillus equuli , treatment with antibiotics alone is suf cient, and the use of antiseptic solutions such as povidone iodine to lavage the abdomen causes in flammation and is detrimental to the patient. More de nitive conclusions cannot be drawn until higher quality evidence on this topic is available. Duration of action of local anaesthetics The aim of this trial by Mona Hoerdemann and colleagues in Australia was to establish and compare the onset and duration of action of mepivacaine and lidocaine in equine palmar digital perineural blocks in an experimental lameness model. Reversible forelimb lameness was induced in eight horses and a palmar digital nerve block (PDNB) was applied with mepivacaine or lidocaine (both 2%). Quantitative lameness and skin sensitivity data were collected with an inertial sensor system and a force gauge, respectively. The times to lameness resolution/skin desensitisation (T1), consistent lameness detection/partial return of (T2), and complete return of lameness/skin sensitivity (T3) were determined and compared between treatments and assessment methods. Mepivacaine blocks resolved lameness in 8/8 horses, compared to 3/8 horses with lidocaine blocks. Both agents led to skin desensitisation in 8/8 horses. Skin desensitisation occurred sooner than lameness resolution after mepivacaine. Duration of action was longer with mepivacaine than lidocaine T3_lameness mepivacaine T3_skin mepivacaine 195 min, lidocaine 63 min). Skin sensitivity returned sooner than lameness after lidocaine block at T3. The authors concluded that the use of lidocaine in PDNBs for the diagnosis of lameness should be reassessed, as it may not resolve lameness despite loss of skin sensation. Mepivacaine is superior, with a reliable onset and longer duration of action. Skin desensitisation as an indicator for the onset of action or effectiveness of PDNBs for mepivacaine and lidocaine, or as a measure of the duration of action oflidocaine PDNBs should be interpreted with caution. PRP and corneal healing This prospective cohort study by James Rushton andcolleagues in Austria aimed to evaluate the potential use of platelet rich plasma (PRP) and plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) for the treatment of corneal disease in horses. Whole blood was collected from 35 healthy horses and processed to yield serum, PRGF (using the Endoret /C226PRGF system) and PRP (using the E-PETTMsystem). The corneas from six horses deemed to have no corneal abnormalities were removed within 1 h of euthanasia and processed to allow for culture of corneal limbal and stromal cells. Cells were then treated with a medium containing 20% of one of the three blood-derived products. Cell proliferation and migration were then compared amongst treatment groups in both single cell and co-culture systems. After 48 h of the treatment protocol, cell proliferation was seen to increase in the PRP group, remain relatively constant in the PRGF group, and decrease upon serum treatment. \u00a92017 10.1111/eve.12883However, overall, there was no signi cant difference between the groups in relation to cell proliferation. Cell migration was signi cantly higher in the serum and PRP groups, and closure of a cell-free area was signi cantly faster in the PRP group. This study indicates that PRP shows promiseas an aid to corneal healing in horses. Guided injection of the DDFT using MRI In this experimental study Lauren Groom and colleagues inthe USA investigated the accuracy of open magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for guiding injection of the equine deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) within the hoof. The authors hypothesised that injection of the distal DDFT within the hoof could be accurately guided using open low- eld MRI to target either the lateral or medial lobe at a speci c location. This technique could be performed in standingpatients. Ten cadaver limbs were positioned in an open, low-eld MRI unit. Each distal DDFT lobe was assigned to have a proximal (adjacent to the proximal aspect of the navicularbursa) or distal (adjacent to the navicular bone) injection. Atitanium needle was inserted into each tendon lobe, guided byT1-weighted transverse images acquired simultaneously duringinjection. Coloured dye was injected as a marker and post-injection MRI and gross sections were assessed. The success ofinjection as evaluated on gross section was 85% (70% proximal,100% distal). The success of was65% (60% proximal, 70% distal). There was no signi cant between the success of injecting the medial versuslateral lobe. The major limitation of this study was the use ofcadaver limbs with normal tendons. The authors concluded thatinjection of the distal DDFT within the hoof is possible using MRIguidance. Safety of 1% atropine sulfate ophthalmic solution The objective of this study by Rita Wehrman and colleagues in the USA was to determine the safety of topical administration of 1% atropine ophthalmic solution in healthy horses by objectively measuring gastrointestinal transit time. The six horses in this study were randomly assigned (3 per group) to rst receive topical treatment of the left eye with 1% atropine or arti cial tears solution; the right eye was left untreated. After 24 h of treatment every 6 h, 200 nontoxicbeads were administered to each horse via nasogastricintubation and treatment frequency was decreased to every12 h for four more days. Pupillary light re flexes (PLRs), mydriasis, heart rate, faecal abdominal girthmeasurements, auscultable gut sounds, faecal weight, andclinical signs of abdominal pain were monitored. Following a4-week washout period, horses received the oppositetreatment in the left eye and measurements were repeated.Serum atropine concentration (re flecting systemic absorption) was measured with an ELISA at various points after initialatropine administration.No horse had subjective or objective evidence of colic or ileus at any monitoring point. Complete mydriasis of the left eye with absence of the PLR was identi ed in ve horses within 6 h and in all six horses within 12 h after initial atropine administration. One horse had mydriasis with an absent PLR in the untreated eye by Day 5 of atropine treatment. At no point was atropine detected in serum samples of any horse. Topical atropine application at clinically appropriate doses induced no evidence of ileus in healthy horses. Peritoneal fluid lactate levels in horses with small intestinal disease In this retrospective study Tara Shearer and colleagues in the USA reported the peritoneal fluid lactate (PFL) levels in horses diagnosed with nonstrangulating small intestinal (NSSI) lesions and compared those values to horses diagnosed with strangulating small intestinal (SSI) lesions. Subject details, presenting clinical ndings, and disease category (strangulating/NSSI lesion) were obtained from a review of medical records between 2005 and 2016. Comparison of SSI lesions to NSSI lesions revealed no signi cant difference in PFL values. However, horses with SSI lesions had signi cantly higher peritoneal fluid lactate:blood lactate ratios and were more likely to have serosanguinous peritoneal fluid colour than those with NSSI lesions.

Mart /C19n-Cuervo Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, School of Veterinary Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid; andDepartment of Animal Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, Universidad intestine strangulation by pedunculated lipomas is a common cause of acute colic in horses. However, diagnosis of this condition prior to surgery may be dif cult due to the poor speci city of the clinical signs. We describe the ultrasonographic ndings of 2 horses presented for acute colic with a diagnosis of strangulating lipoma con rmed in surgery. Lipomas rounded and well- dened, homogeneous hyperechoic structures, surrounded by distended small intestine loops and peritoneal fluid. Ultrasonographic identi cation of lipomas should be attempted during an abdominal scan, especially in horseswith evidence of small intestinal ileus and/or obstruction. Introduction Lipomas are benign hyperplastic growths of well-differentiated adipocytes. Abdominal lipomas originate from mesenteric adipose tissue and can be solitary or multiple, broad-based or pedunculated (Blikslager et al. 1992; Mair and Edwards 2003; Garc /C19a-Seco et al. 2005). Although most lipomas originate from the small intestine mesentery, lipomas associated with the mesentery of the descending colon, rectum and caecum have also been described (Mason 1978; Blikslager et al. 1992; Dart et al. 1992; Edwards and Proudman 1994; Prange et al. 2010). Lipomas may be incidental intraoperative ndings; however, these masses can cause a strangulating or nonstrangulating obstruction when they wrap around the intestine and mesentery (Edwards and Proudman 1994; Freeman and Schaeffer 2001). Strangulation by pedunculated lipomas is one of the most common causes of strangulating obstruction of the small intestine in horses, with castrated male Saddlebred and Arabian geldings older than 14 years being overrepresented (Garc /C19a-Seco et al. 2005). Outside of the abdomen, lipomas have been described histopathologically in the myocardium, pericardium, meninges 1987; Anderson and King et al. 1994; Hammer et al. 2002; Rebsamen et al. 2010; Owens et al. 2017). In addition, ultrasonographic description of lipomas of tendon sheaths are available in the literature, consisting of well-de ned heterogeneous and echogenic masses (Hammer et al. 2002; Owens et al. 2017). Conversely, inltrating lipomas of the lumbar musculature present poorly dened borders on ultrasound examination (Rebsamen et al. 2010). To the author 's knowledge this is the rst description of the ultrasonographic appearance of con rmed mesenteric pedunculated lipomas in horses.Case descriptions Case 1 History and clinical ndings A 16-year-old, 480 kg Arabian mare was evaluated because of acute signs of abdominal pain that had lasted for 2 h. The referring veterinarian administered xylazine, butorphanol and flunixin meglumine prior to the referral. On clinical assessment, heart rate was 48 beats/min, respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min, temperature was 37.3 \u00b0C and capillary re ll <2 s. The mucous membranes were cyanotic. Borborygmi were decreased on both sides. No re flux was present on nasogastric intubation, and on rectal examination distended small intestinal loops were noted. The haematology values were within the physiological limits. Biochemical abnormalities included slight hypocalcaemia (9.76 mg/dL), an hyperlactataemia (3 mmol/ L) and hyper brinogenaemia (0.6 g/dL). The rest of the biochemical pro le was normal. The peritoneal fluid analysis revealed high lactate concentration (4 mmol/L), increasedprotein concentration (2.3 g/dL) Abdominal ultrasonography 5.0 MHz curvilinear array transducer (MyLab301), showing distended loops of small intestine in the ventral and caudal portion of the abdomen. The diameter of the distended loops of small intestine was >6 cm and no appreciable increase in thickness of the walls was observed. A moderate amount of anechoic peritoneal fluid was present in the cranial and ventral abdominal cavity. A rounded and well-de ned mass was also identi ed in the caudoventral aspect of the right side of the abdomen, measuring approximately 16 917 cm ( Fig 1a ). The mass had an overall hyperechoic appearance, showing a focal heterogeneous hypoechoic area. On the basis of the ultrasonographic ndings a diagnosis of small intestine strangulation secondary to a possible pedunculated lipoma was established. Treatment and outcome An exploratory laparotomy under general anaesthesia was performed. A 20 cm diameter, yellowish and smooth with a bright surface pedunculated lipoma was identi ed in the ventral and caudal part of the abdomen. The pedicle was 10 cm long and it was wrapped around the small intestine (middle of the jejunum) causing ischaemic necrosis of about 60 cm in the middle jejunum. The appearance of the bowel did not improve after reduction and decompression and \u00a92016 EVJ 2005) was performed, after the resection of approximately 90 cm of the jejunum. The abdomen was closed routinely and the horse recovered from anaesthesia uneventfully. Post-operative care included the administration of prokinetics (erythromycin, 2.2 mg/kg bwt diluted in 1 L of saline and administered over 1 h, q.i.d., i.v.), lidocaine (loading dose 1.3 mg/kg bwt for 15 min followed by a maintenance dose of 0.05 mg/kg bwt/min), antibiotics (sodium (ranitidine 1.5 mg/kg bwt, t.i.d., The mare was discharged 2 weeks later. Diagnosis Macroscopically, the mass was round and had a brightsurface. The surface was smooth and uniform and it wasdivided into two different lobes ( Fig 1b ). The histopathological study con diagnosis of lipoma. Case 2 A 23-year-old, 607 kg Andalusian mare was referred for evaluation of acute signs of abdominal pain with a duration of approximately 5 h. Prior to presentation, the horse was administered i.v. flunixin meglumine and xylazine hydrochloride by the referring veterinarian. Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 70 beats/ min, respiratory rate was 32 breaths/min, the temperature was 37.4 \u00b0C and the capillary re ll time was <2 s. Mucous membranes were slightly dry and cyanotic. Borborygmi were absent in all quadrants on abdominal auscultation. Multiple loops of distended small intestine were palpated during rectal examination. Nasogastric intubation yielded 5 L of foul smelling reflux. The haematology values were within the physiological limits. The serum biochemistry was normal with the exception of hyperglycaemia (10.11 mmol/l) and hyperlactataemia (8.3 mmol/L). The peritoneal fluid analysis revealed high lactate concentration (6.6 mmol/L). Abdominal ultrasonography Transcutaneous 5 Expert2) of distended small intestine localised in the caudoventral abdomen, with the thickest loop 's wall measuring 1.45 cm. A large amount of anechoic peritoneal fluid was identi ed within the dependent aspect of the abdominal cavity surrounding the small intestine. In addition, a well-circumscribed, oval-shaped, hyperechoic mass was observed within the ventral aspect of the abdomen, surrounded by thickened small intestine loops and measuring approximately 7 94c m ( Fig 2a ). Small intestinal mesentery was visible as thin linear hyperechoic bands due to surrounding peritoneal effusion ( Fig 2a ). Based on the ultrasonographic ndings, a diagnosis of small intestine strangulation secondary to a possible pedunculated lipoma was established. Treatment and outcome An exploratory laparotomy under general anaesthesia revealed several loops of distended small intestine. A red - black coloured segment of nonmotile and severely oedematous small intestine along with its haemorrhagic mesentery was strangulated by a pedunculated, yellowish and spherical mass that measured approximately 8 cm in diameter. The root of the pedicle was located on the mesentery away from the intestine. Additionally, there were three smaller nonpedunculated and similar in appearance masses attached to the small intestine mesentery. A total of 3 m of small intestine comprising the aboral portion of the jejunum and approximately 50% of ileum were severely damaged. The strangulation was resolved and the appearance of the intestine did not improve after decompression. Due to the guarded prognosis for recovery and nancial constraints, the horse was subjected to euthanasia during surgery upon owner consent. Diagnosis Macroscopically, the pedunculated mass was spherical, the surface was smooth and uniform and measured 8 99 cm. a) b)* Fig 1: a) Ultrasonographic image of the caudoventral abdomen of Case 1.

Discussion Transcutaneous abdominal ultrasound is a complementarydiagnostic procedure that has become an important part of the acute abdomen diagnostic work-up. It allows a thorough noninvasive evaluation of most abdominal organs and gastrointestinal viscera; however, this technique is limited by the size of the equine abdomen, the depth provided by the ultrasound transducers and the intraluminal gas within the gastrointestinal tract in horses with and without colic. Ultrasonographic features of small intestine strangulating obstruction consist of markedly distended, amotile loops of small intestine with or without thickened walls and ventral sedimentation Bain 2014).However, this ultrasonographic pattern can be caused by obstructive or partially obstructive lesions including lipomas have been described to appear as avascular, well-de ned hyperechoic masses within the abdomen (D 'Anjou and Carmel 2015). Ultrasonographic characteristics of the lipomas described in this article are similar to what it is reported in small animals. In Case 1, a focal heterogeneous hypoechoic centre was identi ed within the mass, which corresponded histopathologically to a necrotic centre. This appearance has been described in the small animal literature in some abdominal lipomas (Mayhew and Brockman 2002). Ultrasonographic identi cation of intra-abdominal lipomas is complicated because they are often located deep within the abdomen and can be obscured by overlying gas- lled viscera. Transrectal ultrasonography was not performed in the cases presented in this article. However, it may be useful for further characterisation if lipomas were identi ed in the caudal abdomen on transcutaneous examination as it allows the evaluation of the most axial abdominal structures from the caudal abdomen and pelvic cavity (Schmidt 1989; Edens et al. 1996; Freeman et al. 2001; Navas de Solis et al. 2015). Furthermore, identi cation of a lipoma during an abdominal ultrasonographic examination in a horse does not necessarily mean that it is the cause of the clinical signs. This is illustrated in Case 2, where several lipomas were found during surgical examination of the small intestine. The mass identi ed on ultrasound may have represented either the pedunculated lipoma wrapped around the small intestine or one of the small masses observed attached to the mesentery. However, the size of the mass correlated with the size of the strangulating lipoma, suggesting that it was most likely to be the mass visualised on transcutaneous ultrasound examination. In both horses, the presence of peritoneal fluid improved the identi cation of the mass. Tumour types are dif cult to predict ultrasonographically and other differential diagnoses should also be considered such as other abdominal neoplasms (Hillyer 1994; Freeman 2003; Knottenbelt 2014). In most cases, a de nitive diagnosis of this condition is often achieved in surgery or post-mortem examination due to the nonspeci c clinical signs; however, it is a common cause of small intestine strangulating obstruction as reported in the literature (Garc /C19a-Seco et al. 2005). In conclusion, abdominal ultrasonography offers a useful diagnostic approach to identify intra-abdominal lipomas before performing an exploratory celiotomy in horses with colic. Lipoma should be a differential diagnosis for masses identi ed ultrasonographically within the abdominal cavity in the horse.

Dixonand J. Del-Pozo Easter Bush Pathology; andEquine Hospital, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies and Roslin Institute, The University of Edinburgh, cross gelding presented with abnormal respiratory noise and exercise intolerance. Upper airway endoscopy, ultrasonography, radiography and computed tomography revealed a large mass within the leftguttural pouch causing marked left dorsal nasopharyngeal collapse and displacement and compression of the right guttural pouch. The horse was subjected to euthanasia and a post-mortem examination con rmed the above ndings. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations of the mass con rmed a diagnosis of guttural pouch leiomyosarcoma, a lesion previously unreported at this site. Introduction Abnormal respiratory noise and exercise intolerance is arelatively common clinical presentation in the horse and can be associated with structural, functional, in flammatory, infectious and neoplastic disorders of the nasal passages, sinuses, hard and soft palate, larynx and nasopharynx. The close anatomical proximity between the ventral floor of the guttural pouches and the dorsal nasopharyngeal roof means that guttural pouch distension can cause dorsal nasopharyngeal compression and is a differential diagnosis in such cases. Neoplasia of the guttural pouch is 1996; Caswell and Williams 2007; Freeman 2015). This report describes the clinical, ancillary diagnostic and pathological ndings in a case of primary guttural pouch leiomyosarcoma, a lesion that does not appear to have been previously described in horses. Case history and clinical ndings A 14-year-old Connemara cross gelding, used for pleasure and low level competition, was presented for abnormal, harsh respiratory noise during ridden work and exercise intolerance which had become progressively worse over the preceding 2 weeks. It was reported that the horse had demonstrated episodes of coughing 4 months previously, which had improved with medical management and had been attributed to lower airway disease. On presentation, the gelding was bright and alert, with mild swelling of the parotid region bilaterally and a mild bilateral (but predominantly left sided) seromucoid nasal discharge. The submandibular lymph nodes were not enlarged. No abnormal respiratory noise was audible at rest, but inspiratory stridor was appreciated during light in-hand exercise.Investigation In view of the above presenting signs, the horse wasisolated pending further investigation of potential infectious causes, particularly Streptococcus equi subsp. equi infection. Upper airway endoscopy revealed marked dorsal nasopharyngeal collapse, greater on the left side, with marked reduction in the diameter of the nasopharynx rostral to, and overlying, the rima glottidis . Mucoid discharge was seen to emanate from the left guttural pouch ostium, accumulating on the floor of the nasopharynx. Endoscopy of the right guttural pouch revealed marked compression of its medial compartment. lavage was negative and to the left guttural pouch was dif cult as the ostium was collapsed and displaced medioventrally. Once access was gained, it showed loss of the normal air lled guttural pouch lumen that was replaced by a wall of soft tissue which prevented further endoscopic evaluation. Diagnostic imaging A laterolateral radiograph of the pharyngeal region ( Fig 1a ) identi ed a large, well de ned, soft tissue opacity within the region of the guttural pouches, which extended caudally to the midpoint of C2 and ventrally to a level 1 cm dorsal to the soft palate that was causing marked dorsal nasopharyngeal compression. There was a narrow margin of gas dorsal to the mass, believed to be air within the guttural pouches. Transcutaneous ultrasonography of the left parotid region caudal to the left temporomandibular joint revealed an ovoid, soft tissue mass approximately 3 cm below the skin surface ( Fig 1b ). This mass was of soft tissue echogenicity, well encapsulated and contained multiple, small, ovoid, hypoechoic regions resulting in a heterogeneous honeycomb appearance. Surgical biopsy The horse was ml). A modi ed Whitehouse approach was made to gain access to the left guttural pouch. Following incision into the pouch the base of a rounded, rm, soft tissue mass in the lateral compartment was palpable. An excisional biopsy was taken from the directly visualised ventral \u00a92016 with granulation tissue, brinoid vasculitis and thrombosis. However, it was deemed possible that these reactive andinflammatory microscopic changes may have been present towards the periphery of the mass and may not have been representative of the mass as a whole. Advanced diagnostic imaging Computed tomographic (CT) examination of the head(Fig 2a -d) was performed under standing sedation (as detailed including contrast CT using left lateralised, multilobular soft tissue mass with multiple, small, well de ned, ovoid, central, hypoattenuating regions and variable contrast enhancement was seen within the region of the left guttural pouch. The mass compressed the left guttural pouch and medial aspect of the right guttural pouch and caused marked ventral displacement of the nasopharyngeal roof, resulting in signi cant narrowing of the nasopharynx consistent with that seen endoscopically. The left stylohyoid bone which was enveloped by the mass was mildly thickened and had well de ned, smoothly irregular, periosteal new bone formation along its length. The administration of contrast medium clearly demonstrated the borders of the mass, which was surrounded by noncontrast enhancing, soft tissue attenuating material. The biopsy site was identi ed caudal to the mass lesion and gas was seen tracking from the incision into the peripheral soft tissue attenuating material; however, it did not breach the border of the mass. Following visualisation of the full extent of the mass on contrast CT no repeat attempts at surgical biopsy were made. Differential diagnoses based on the imaging ndings included soft tissue neoplasia, such as haemangiosarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma or other neoplastic lesion and granuloma formation originating from pharyngeal or lymphoid tissue. Abscessation of the left retropharyngeal lymph nodes was considered unlikely due to the pattern of contrast enhancement. Outcome Owing to the extensive nature of the mass and the dif culty of surgical access, combined with worsening stertor, the owner elected for euthanasia and the horse was submitted for post-mortem examination. Post-mortem gross and histological examinations Grossly, a 14 913.599.5 cm, bilobed, heterogeneous mass (Fig 3 ) was present on the caudal wall of the left guttural pouch. The lateral portion of the mass that surrounded the left stylohyoid bone was mottled pink to yellow in colour, rm and brous. In contrast, the medial portion was variegated dark red to yellow in colour and contained multiple, variably sized cysts. Histology of the mass ( Fig 4 ) revealed an encapsulated, well demarcated, multilobulated, densely cellular, proliferation of cells. This was composed of broad interlacing fascicles of medium sized, spindle-shaped cells within a very ne vascular stroma. The cells had indistinct cytoplasmic borders, moderate amounts of vacuolated or brillar eosinophilic cytoplasm and a blunt ended oval nucleus with nely granular chromatin and a single eosinophilic nucleolus. They labelling Fig 5a -d). There was mild anisocytosis and anisokaryosis, with very rare karyomegaly, multinucleated cells and less than one mitotic gure in 10 high power elds (9400). Within the mass there were also large areas of coagulative necrosis and haemorrhage. Local capsular invasion by neoplastic cells was visible following alpha smooth muscle actin immunohistochemistry. There was no visible evidence of vascular or lymphatic invasion.

Discussion This report represents an addition to our limited existing knowledge of guttural pouch neoplasia in the horse and alsohighlights the important contribution of advanced imaging modalities to the investigation of such cases. Computed tomography (CT) is an established modality for diagnosing diseases of the equine head and standing CT examination is becoming more widely available. In particular, CT is increasingly used in the assessment of dental disorders, head tumours and sinonasal problems (Perrier et al. 2010; Puchalski 2012). The use of intravenous contrast material in the standing horse has previously been described (Dakin et al. 2014); however, this appears to be the rst report indicating its a) b) c) d) Fig 2: Transverse computed tomographic images (a & b) sagittal (c) and dorsal (d) 3D reconstructions.

Contrast administration allowed visualisation of the cystic nature of the mass and differentiation of the true margins of the mass from the surrounding soft tissues. The ability to visualise the true margins of the mass and the biopsy site provided an explanation for the nonrepresentative biopsy. Although there was a mild imaging artefact from the surgical site this did not impact signi cantly on the diagnostic usefulness of this technique. Surgical artefact can of course be avoided by undertaking advanced diagnostic imaging prior to biopsy; however, in this case, the impetus to progress to more advanced imaging was in part, prompted by the nonrepresentative biopsy result. Although ultrasound and/or endoscopy are also usefuladjuncts to the attainment of targeted surgical biopsies, their usefulness was precluded in this case by limited access restricting the tissue available for biopsy to the periphery of the ventral aspect of the mass which could already bedirectly visualised. The CT appearances of an invasive temporomandibular joint, guttural pouch and tumour (Perrier et al. 2010) and sinonasal tumours (Cissell et al. 2012) have been described previously; however, this appears to be the rst report of a primary guttural pouch neoplasm identi ed using antemortem standard and contrast CT. In this case, contrast CT provided superior de nition of the margins of the mass when compared with endoscopy, radiography and ultrasonography integral in the decision to subject the horse to euthanasia due to the extent of the mass and its surgically inaccessible location. Equine tumours are uncommon, with an overall incidence of 2-3% in the general population (Hance and Bertone 1993). Neoplasia of the guttural pouch is particularly rare and in the few reported cases, affected horses tended to be older than 10 years (Baptiste et al. 1996; Scarratt and Crisman 1998). Possibly due to their rarity, no breed or sex predilection has been identi ed. Tumours reported include: haemangioma (Greene and 2013), broma 1972) and squamous cell carcinoma (Trigo and Nickels 1981; Perrier et al. 2010). The majority of these reports described malignant neoplasms, which were often a result of metastasis, especially those involving melanoma (Baptiste et al. 1996; Scarratt and Crisman 1998; Metcalfe et al. 2013). The presence of invasive metastatic disease, restricted surgical access, multiple adjacent major neurovascular structures andlimited medical options warrants a grave prognosis and most horses are eventually subjected to euthanasia (Hance and Bertone 1993) as occurred here. Given the rarity of these tumours, the usefulness of alternative treatments such as radiotherapy is unknown. It may be speculated that they would be of most use early in the course of disease when tumours are small and invasion is minimal but complete excision is still prevented by limited surgical access and the multiple nerves and vasculature in this area. However, as in this particular case, signi cant clinical signs may not be detectable until late in the course of disease when the mass is already well developed. There are several reports of leiomyosarcoma in the horse within the digestive (Livesey et al. 1986; Clem et al. 1987; Mair et al. 1990; Boy et al. 1992; Laugier et al. 2004) and 1987; Allison and Moeller 1999; Hurcombe et al. 2008), most likely because these organ systems contain a signi cant smooth muscle component. Other reported leiomyosarcoma locations include pulmonary (Rossdale et al. 2004; Davis and Rush 2013), sinonasal (Veraa et al. 2009) and multicentric sites (MacGillivray et al. 2003). Leiomyosarcomas are frequently invasive and may undergo visceral metastasis (Cooper and Valentine 2002) warranting a poor prognosis, although no preferential sites of metastasis have been identi ed. Histologically, they may be well differentiated and relatively well demarcated, retaining many features of normal smooth muscle and resembling benign leiomyoma, or less so, with marked cellular pleomorphism, including multinucleate forms and smaller, less well organised, fascicles. As in this case, areas of tumour necrosis are common (in contrast to leiomyoma), resulting in a cystic appearance often accompanied by haemorrhage, oedema and in flammation (Cooper and Valentine 2002). Despite a relatively low mitotic index, thepresence of marked tumour necrosis and multinucleate forms combined with the locally invasive behaviour (visible after Fig 3: Guttural pouch mass, dorsal view, showing a smooth surfaced, bilobed appearance with rmbrous lateral portion (lateral is to the right) and cystic medial portion. Fig 4: Histological section showinginterlacing staining for alpha-smooth muscle actin) were deemed consistent with a well differentiated, malignant mesenchymal (likely smooth muscle) tumour. Suspected malignant smooth muscle neoplasia in previously unrecognised anatomical locations and the presence of poorly differentiated forms can make distinction from other mesenchymal tumours such as brosarcoma, malignant nerve sheath vimentinstaining combined with negative for cytokeratin cancon rm the presence of mesenchymal neoplasia, whilst excluding the presence of poorly differentiated epithelialtumours. Concurrent positive staining for desmin andalpha-smooth muscle actin is strongly suggestive though striated muscle frequently expressespositive desmin staining, it is rarely positive for alpha smoothmuscle actin (Cooper and Valentine 2002). Conclusions Despite their relative infrequency, neoplasms including leiomyosarcoma should be considered a differential diagnosis in cases of guttural pouch disease. The use of CT can play an important role in the assessment of guttural pouch masses where endoscopic access is limited. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Haggett Rossdale Head trauma is a common injury in young horses. This case report describes a 10-week-old Thoroughbred foal with an open wound following trauma to the poll region, showing abnormal head carriage and depression. A computed tomography (CT) study was performed under general anaesthetic (GA). This identi ed a complete avulsion of the nuchal ligament (NL) and partial avulsions of the left and right semispinalis capitis (SS) tendons. Following diagnosis and conservative treatment the foal made a good recovery and 18 months later the lly had no detectable neurological or physical abnormalities. Computed tomography enabled an accurate and rapid diagnosis of a novel injury. Introduction The NL is a bilobed, elastic structure on the dorsal midline extending from the occipital bone to continuous with the supraspinous ligament (Sisson 1914a). The NL consists of two parts, the funicular and lamella and is surrounded by muscle, with the rectus capitis ventralis ventrally and the side (Sisson 1914a; Dyson 2011b). The SS is a large, structurally complex, pyramidal muscle that originates from the second, third and fourth thoracic spines, the transverse processes of the rst six or seven thoracic vertebrae and the articular processes of the cervical vertebrae (Sisson 1914b; Gellman et al. 2002; Dyson 2011b). Cranially, there a strong, focal tendon which spreads into awide aponeurosis inserting on the occipital bone just ventralto the nuchal crest. The tendon extends two-thirds the lengthof the muscle. Traumatic injuries to the head and poll are common in horses (Ramirez et al. 1998; Feary et al. 2007), especially in foals and younger individuals (Little et al. 1985; Ragle et al. 1988; Ragle 1993; Feary et al. 2007). Trauma to this area can result in diverse pathologies (Ramirez et al. 1998) including fractures, haemorrhage, neurological signs and vestibular syndromes caused (TBI) (Ragle 1993; MacKay 2004; Feary et al. 2007). The anatomy of the head and poll region is complicated and presents a diagnostic challenge (Ragle 1993; Ramirez et al. 1998; Gollob et al. 2002). Radiography has been shown to have limited use in the assessment of traumatic injuries of the equine head (Ramirez et al. 1998; Feary et al. 2007; Kinns and Pease 2009). In a retrospective study of head traumawith accompanying neurological signs the most common pathology was fracture of the basilar and temporal bones, which were identi ed in 15 of 34 horses (44%) (Feary et al. 2007). These fractures are commonly associated with poll impact injuries (MacKay 2004). The diagnostic limitations of radiography are confounded in younger animals due to copious open or incompletely fused sutures (Ramirez et al. 1998). CT facilitates the study of bony structures in highly detailed, cross-sectional images without superimposition, as well as providing superior contrast for soft tissues compared with radiography and affords CT signi cant advantages in equine head trauma cases (Kinns and Pease 2009). There are relatively few publications concerning pathology of the NL or the SS and no reports of damage to these structures in foals. This report describes the clinical presentation, CT ndings, treatment and outcome of a foal that presented with neurological signs and altered head carriage following head trauma. Case history A 10-week-old Thoroughbred lly foal weighing 141 kg was referred to Rossdales Equine Hospital after sustaining trauma to the poll. The foal had reared over backwards and its poll and cranial neck had collided with a concrete manger. The referring veterinary surgeon reported that the foal had initially been in lateral recumbency but could stand with encouragement. The further investigation and treatment. Clinical ndings The foal was admitted approximately 2 h after the injury. On admission the foal was standing but depressed with a right- sided head tilt and a low head carriage. No additional abnormalities were detected on a full neurological examination. There was a small, full thickness skin wound just behind the wings of the atlas in the dorsal midline. There were no signi cant haematological or blood biochemical abnormalities. A 16 gauge polyurethane over-the-wire catheter was placed and i.v. fluid therapy with Lactate Ringers solution at a rate of 400 mL/h was initiated. The foal received flunixin (Cronyxin)1i.v. induced with i.v. (Diazepam injection BP)4at a of 0.05 mg/kg bwt and in dorsal with the cranium in the centre of the CT gantry and a CT examination of the head and proximal neck carried out. A Siemens SOMATOM Volume Zoom M 4 slice helical computed tomography scanner6was used to acquire helical images collimated to an acquisition slice thickness of 2 mm from the articulation between the rst and second cervical vertebra to the third most caudal cheek tooth. The total scan length was 26.8 cm and scan direction was caudo-cranial. The pitch was 1.75 with exposure at 120 V and 180 mA. The images were exported into a DICOM workstation and manipulated using Osirix version 3.9.3 64 bit7. The data was reconstructed using both soft tissue and bone algorithms. CT imaging ndings The ndings were interpreted by one author with experience of equine computed tomography. At the level of the second cervical vertebra there were multiple, coalescing hypoattenuating areas subcutaneously and dorsal to the right SS tendon with minimum Houns eld units of -950, consistent with air ( Fig 1 ). Caudally, the NL and the tendons of the left and right SS muscles were well de ned. Within the body of the NL 4 cm caudal to the occipital bone were multiple hyperattenuating zones with maximum Houns eld units of 700, consistent with avulsed bony fragments ( Figs 2 and 3and Supplementary Item 1 ). Cranial to this there was complete loss of the NL architecture. Present instead wasamorphous soft tissue containing multiple coalescing zones ofair, measuring -950 HU and hyperattenuating regions representing bony fragments.The borders of the SS tendons were dif cult to discern 3 cm caudal from the occipital bone to their insertion due to the presence of coalescing round hypoattenuating zones, again representing air and 1.5 cm of the left SS tendon remained at its insertion. CT imaging diagnosis Computed was NL from its insertion on the occipital bone and partial avulsions of the tendons of the right and left SS muscles. It was assumed due to the time between injury and imaging that the pockets of air were present due to the open skin wound rather than from infection. Treatment and clinical course The foal recovered well from anaesthesia. It was closely monitored and received ongoing treatment with flunixin, cefquinome, butorphanol and vitamin E. The skin wound was not closed, a dressing was applied and the area kept clean. Over the following 12 h the demeanour of the foal gradually improved. Butorphanol was withdrawn 36 h after admission. The head tilt and low head position did not change, but the foal generally coped well, ambulating freely and nursed from the mare without assistance. An ultrasonographic examination of the poll region was carried out under standing sedation two days following injury. Images were acquired using a GE LOGIQ e portable ultrasound machine8. Linear array (5 -13 MHz) and micro- convex (4 -10 MHz) probes8were used. The NL appeared normal to a point 5 cm caudal to the poll after which its bre pattern alignment was not appreciable. The tissue present in this region had a mixed echogenicity including multiple hyperechoic areas, some of which caused acoustic shadowing artefact thus hindering the examination of structures deep to them. These hyperechoic zones were likely a mixture of air and bonyfragments. The tendons of the SS muscles were relatively normal to a point 5 cm caudal from the occipital bone. Cranially from this was an anechoic area extending into the axial border of SS SS NL Fig 1: Multiplanar reformatted transverse CT image at the level of the second cervical vertebra. Left is to the right of the image. TheSS and NL are well de ned. There is a pocket of air beneath the skin (red arrow).

These were likely avulsed fragments of bone within the body of the tendons. The longitudinal bre pattern of both SS tendons was disrupted ventrally though the changes of the right SS tendonwere more severe. The ultrasound examination was hindered by the presence of air within the soft tissues. However, identi cation of complete avulsion of the NL and partial avulsions of the tendons of the SS muscles was possible ( Fig 4 ). Following a gradual improvement in all clinical signs except for the head carriage, the foal was discharged from the hospital three days after admission. The skin wound was healing well without intervention and was not a concern. Following discharge the foal received oral doxycycline (10 mg/kg (GastroGard)10(4 bwt once a day) for a further 7 days.Follow-up examination The foal was re-examined 34 days after initial injury and was bright and in good body condition. The lly had normal head carriage and was ambulating normally. There was marked asymmetry of the musculature at the poll. Ultrasonography revealed an improvement in the denition of the borders of the NL but it was nondiscernable near its insertion on the occipital bone. Cranial to the avulsed fragments the ligament was more hyperechoic and organised compared with the initial ultrasound scan. The SS tendons also showed improvement to their architecture andbre pattern. Outcome Six months after initial injury the foal was making good progress with a normal head carriage and signs of improved musculature over the poll region. The lly was sold at sales as a yearling 16 months after initial injury and was reported by 12 4 3 56 78 Fig 3: Eight sequential reformatted transverse CT images.

Discussion Nuchal ligament and semispinalis capitis injury There have been no previous reports of acute injury to the NL or SS in foals. There is one previous description of chronic avulsion of the tendon of the right SS muscle in a textbook description of CT images (Saunders et al. 2011). Laceration and avulsion fractures of the nuchal crest are common when horses flip over backwards (Ragle 1993). In a previous case series of two horses with nuchal crest avulsion fractures, both horses had sustained trauma to the poll region (Voigt et al. 2009). It is likely that the mechanism for injury in the case described was blunt trauma when the foal 's poll collided with a manger. Imaging The decision to perform a CT as a primary diagnostic step in this case was well justi ed. It allowed for a rapid and accurate assessment of a young potentially neurologically compromised foal. A radiograph may have allowed visualisation of some of the changes seen on CT and ultrasound, such as air within the soft tissues and fragments of bone. Whilst radiography is useful in assessment of traumatic injuries of the equine head it does have limitations. It cannot allow evaluation of intracranial structures and in one study by Feary et al. (2007) radiographs failed to identify 50% of fractures of the calvarium, including basilar bone fractures (Ramirez et al. 1998; Feary al. Kinns and Pease 2009). The bene ts of CT for assessment of trauma patients are well acknowledged in human medicine (Chan 2009) where there is great emphasis on recognising and treating injuries within the 'golden hour '(Saltzherr et al. 2013) and it is becoming routine to install CT machines in the emergencyroom of hospitals (Weninger et al. 2007). Studies have found that the use of CT as a primary investigation of trauma patients reduces both missed injury rates and delays to denitive management (Hilbert et al . 2007; Wurmb et al. 2009; Lawson et al. 2011; Sierink et al. 2012). Before the invention of standing CT in horses, the risk and cost of a GA was a major disadvantage of CT in horses. These risks are justi ed when speci c treatment can be advised (MacKay 2004; Jose-Cunilleras and Piercy 2007), but greatly reduced now that the technology permits scanning the standing horse. Unfortunately, this is not practical in young foals due to their size, or in neurologically compromised individuals due to safety. Findings of the ultrasound study performed two days after presentation correlated well with those of the CT. An ultrasound examination at presentation may have provided an accurate diagnosis. However, ultrasonographic examination and interpretation in this area is dif cult (Dyson 2011a). Furthermore, a thorough investigation would have been hindered in this case by subcutaneous air, haemorrhage, soft tissue disruption and the demeanour of the foal. Ultrasonography lacks sensitivity for the detection of many other types of lesions that CT may have detected and both Nowak (2001) and Dyson (2011a) have previously suggested that CT is the most sensitive modality to recognise lesions of either the NL or border of insertion of SS. Neurological ndings The CT failed to identify a lesion of the central nervous system (CNS). The head tilt and altered head carriage were likely a result of the trauma to the soft tissues supporting the head, pain or a combination of both. Treatment with hypertonic saline was initiated immediately after injury due to concerns about potential brain injury. This was discontinued following CT. Compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT is less sensitive for the detection of lesions of the CNS and may have failed to identify a lesion in our case (Gilman 1998). In human medicine MRI is the preferred modality for most neurological diseases except for abnormal calci cation, disorders of bones and joints and acute subarachnoid haemorrhage (Gilman 1998; Sogaro-Robinson et artefact in the caudal fossa between the temporal bones can limit assessment of the brain parenchyma (Sogaro-Robinson et al. 2009; Hecht 2011). Magnetic resonance imaging is limited in its availability for most of the horse population, suffers from much longer scan times and is not as effective as CT for detecting acute 2009). medium can be used to enhance vascular mass lesions and to aid detection of inflammation and diseases that disrupt the blood-brain barrier on CT images (Kraft and Gavin 2001; MacKay 2004) and mayhave helped identify a lesion. However, in one study of 57 horses affected by neurological disorders, the use of contrast identi ed lesions in only one horse for which a lesion had not been diagnosed or suspected on plain CT (Sogaro-Robinson et al. 2009). At the time of CT diagnosis we thought that the prognosis was fair. A previous report describes a series of two cases of Thoroughbred horses developing head-shaking as a result of nuchal crest avulsion fractures, both of which were assumed to be caused by trauma to the poll region (Voigt et al. 2009). GELe Vet Fig 4: Longitudinal ultrasonograph of the left SS tendon near its insertion. Cranial is to the left. The normal longitudinal bre pattern of the tendon is reduced cranially and absent cranial EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2018The descriptions of the ultrasound examinations of the cases in this report were very similar to the described case. Both horses in the previously described series responded well to conservative treatment. This lly appeared to cope well with the injury sustained, made steady progress over the rst 48 h and subsequently went on to make a good recovery and was reported by an attending veterinarian to appear healthy at 18 months. Antimicrobial use Cefquinome (Cobactan)2is a fourth generation cephalosporin and is listed under the WHO List of Critically Important Antimicrobials (CIA) (World Health Organisation 2012). The authors feel that the use of this CIA was justi ed by the desire to use an antimicrobial able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. This was important in this case due to the presence of a severe head trauma in conjunction with an open skin wound. Cefquinome has been shown to penetratethe blood-brain barrier in other species (Pellegrini-Masini and Livesey 2006). Furthermore, in an abstract presented at the 2011 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Forum, cefquinome was found in the cerebrospinal fluid of normal horses 1 and 4 h after i.v. administration (Hollis et al. 2011). Since there are few drugs available with this property, the use of cefquinome was justi ed in this speci c case. Conclusion In the described case, CT enabled a rapid accurate diagnosis with information on which to base management and possibly predict prognosis. Computed tomography should always be considered for cases of trauma involving the head or neck. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Treatment included serial lavages and local infusion of antibiotics into the guttural pouches along with a 6-week course of oral trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole and rifampicin. Overall, no additional sites of infection were identi ed and the mare responded well to treatment, delivering a healthy, full-term foal. This case emphasises that C. pseudotuberculosis , although uncommon, should be considered as a differential for guttural pouch empyema. Introduction Corynebacterium positive, facultative anaerobic intracellular bacterium known for causing abscesses in ruminants and horses worldwide (Aleman et al. 1996). This bacterium can be further classi ed into two different biovars based on nitrate reducing capabilities with the nitrate reducing biovar equi causing abscesses in horses (Biberstein et al. 1971). The classic presentation in horses, known as 'pigeon fever 'or'dryland distemper, 'is midline, mammary or (Aleman et al. 1996). Internal abscesses and ulcerative lymphangitis are less common manifestations ofinfection (Aleman et al. 1996; Pratt et al. 2005, 2006; Nogradi et al. 2012). The disease is typically diagnosed from November to January with external abscesses precedinginternal abscesses by an average of 1 -2 months (Pratt et al. 2005). C. pseudotuberculosis has a worldwide distribution and is considered endemic to the western and south-western USAwith 5 -10% prevalence (Spier 2008). Over the past decade, the occurrence of C. pseudotuberculosis infection in horses has increased throughout the country with rising numbers ofcases in the eastern USA from 2010 to 2013, including stateswhere the disease is not considered endemic (Foley et al. 2004; Spier 2008; House 2012; Kilcoyne et al. 2014). The bacterium survives in the soil while insect vectors and regional climate changes probably play a role in disease transmission and seasonal occurrence (Spier et al. 2004; Spier 2008; Barba et al. 2015).External abscesses commonly present as deep intramuscular or subcutaneous abscesses that resolve with localised drainage and supportive care (Aleman et al. 1996). In contrast, internal abscesses represent <10% of total diagnosed C. pseudotuberculosis infections, with abscesses forming in multiple organ systems including the lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys or causing conditions such as infectious pericarditis, pleuritis and meningitis (Aleman et al. 1996; Perkins et al. 2004; Pratt et al. 2005, 2006; Rand et al. 2012). This form of infection carries a guarded prognosis with mortality rates ranging from 29 to 40% (Aleman et al. 1996; Pratt et al. 2005). Clinical signs of internal infection are often nonspeci c, including anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, mild colic or signs associated with respiratory disease (Pratt et al. 2005). Initial diagnosis is based on clinical pathology and diagnostic imaging, such as transabdominal ultrasound, to identify internal abscesses. De nitive diagnosis can be con rmed with culture of C. or synergistic haemolysis titres 1:512 (Knight 1978; Pratt et al. 2005). While guttural pouch empyema secondary to other pathogens is not uncommon, C. pseudotuberculosis infection in the guttural pouches appears to be a rare occurrence, with only two other cases described prior to this report (Aleman et al. 1996). Frequently, guttural pouch empyema or chondroids develop secondary to the rupture retropharyngeal lymph with sterile fluids to remove debris along with local and systemic antimicrobial therapy are necessary to resolve infection (Judy et al. 1999). Case history In December 2013, a 12-year-old Quarter Horse mare at 7 months 'gestation presented for mild colic. The owner noted lethargy, decreased appetite and intermittent, serous, nasal discharge from the right nostril of 48 h duration. The mare had two prior pregnancies but aborted the previous year after undergoing surgical correction of a right dorsal large colon displacement. The mare was arti cially inseminated with cooled semen in May 2013 and pregnancy was con rmed at 90 days 'gestation. The mare was kept on the owner 's farm in South Carolina with two other apparently healthy horses. Nine months prior to presentation, one of these horses developed a pectoral abscess that was lanced and drained without further complication; culture results were negative for C. pseudotuberculosis 10.1111/eve.12684Clinical ndings On presentation, the mare had normal vital parameters, a body condition score of 7/9 (ideal 5/9), and a mild, bilateral serous nasal discharge. Rectal palpation revealed a viable fetus and mild gas distention of the caecum with normal faeces in the rectum. No net re flux was found on nasogastric intubation. Oral examination was normal. Diagnosis Complete blood cell count was within normal limits; however, hyper brinogenaemia was evident (21.5 lmol/L, reference range -11.76 lmol/L). Serum biochemistry -146 mmol/ L). Brief transabdominal ultrasound con rmed a viable fetus with a heart rate of 114 beats/min while combined thickness of the uterine -placental unit (CTUP) measured normal for the gestational stage (7 -8 mm) with no speci c abnormalities noted. Empirical treatment included flunixin meglumine (Banamine11.1 mg/kg bwt, i.v., oil administered via nasogastric intubation, and feed restriction. The mare remained comfortable, continued to pass normal faeces and the hyponatraemia resolved the next day without further treatment; however, a purulent nasal discharge from the right nostril was noted. Physical examination remained otherwise normal with no signs ofsubmandibular lymphadenopathy, while percussion of the paranasal sinuses and rebreathing examination were normal. Upper airway endoscopy revealed empyema in the medial compartment of the right guttural pouch with an apparently intact, mildly enlarged, retropharyngeal lymph node. In the left guttural pouch, a moderate amount of clear mucus was evident with no signs of retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy. A sample of the purulent exudate was collected for aerobic culture and sensitivity and S. equi ssp. equi PCR testing 2. Transthoracic and transabdominal ultrasound examination ndings were within normal limits and did not show evidence of disseminated infection. Treatment Primary differentials for guttural pouch empyema includedrupture of an abscessed retropharyngeal lymph subsequently treated with serial lavages using lactated Ringer 's solution (1 L once a day for 3 days) followed by infusion of potassium penicillin (5 million iu) into the right guttural pouch. Ceftiofur q. 24 h) and an oral probiotic (Equiotic4) were also administered. Due to risk of placentitis secondary to ongoing guttural pouch infection, the mare was maintained on oral altrenogest (ReguMate50.044 mg/ kg bwt, q. 12 h). Pending culture results, the mare was isolated from other horses. No further signs of colic were noted as both hay and grain were reintroduced. Four days later, nasal discharge had resolved and all other physical examination parameters remained normal. The mare was discharged from the clinic to continue treatment with ceftiofur crystalline free acid (Excede36.6 mg/kg bwt i.m., q. farm.Streptococcus equi ssp. equi PCR testing and aerobic culture of the guttural pouch exudate yielded growth of C. pseudotuberculosis. Subsequently, a SHI titre6was submitted and returned markedly increased, indicating C. pseudotuberculosis infection (1024) (Aleman et al. 1996). Based on culture and sensitivity results, antimicrobial therapy was changed from ceftiofur crystalline free acid to trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole (TMS-SMZ7 rifampicin8(10 mg/kg bwt per os, q. 12 h). One week later, physical examination, fetal heart rate and CTUP measurements remained normal. Hyper brinogenaemia resolved, while the mare 's total white blood cell count and blood chemistry remained normal. Repeat upper airway endoscopy revealed pinpoint, white plaques on the walls of both guttural pouches and persistent, mild retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy in the right pouch. Repeat cultures from both guttural pouches were submitted for aerobic culture and yielded no growth9, however due to the presence of the plaques, both pouches were infused with potassium penicillin as previously described. After 6 weeks of oral TMS-SMZ treatment, endoscopic examination of the guttural pouches showed no signs of infection or lymphadenopathy and cultures collected via endoscopy remained negative. The mare continued to show no clinical signs of placentitis but altrenogest therapy was continued empirically until Day 330 of gestation, at which point this treatment was gradually tapered by 0.004 mg/kg bwt every day and discontinued 7 days later. Outcome The mare delivered a lly at Day 344 of gestation with a normal parturition aside from a retained placenta of 10 h duration. Routine treatment for placental retention included oxytocin10administration (0.04 USP units/kg bwt, i.m. q. 6 h), uterine lavage (5 L lactated Ringer 's solution), systemic antimicrobial therapy (procaine penicillin G, Penject7 22,000 iu/kg kg bwt, i.v., q. 12 h). The placenta appeared normal and intact once passed but the mare developed transient, mild pyrexia for the next 24 h (38.5 \u00b0C). Systemic antibiotics and flunixin meglumine were continued for 48 h followed by a 7-day course of TMS-SMZ (as previously prescribed). The mare was also treated once with intrauterine antibiotic infusion (gentamicin 6.6 mg/kg bwt i.u.). The foal was apparently healthy and passive transfer was veri ed (immunoglobulin G >8 g/L 2). Blood samples collected at this time were submitted for aerobic and anaerobic culture, which yielded no growth. One year later, both the mare and lly were reportedly healthy. Discussion The case reported here represents a unique presentation ofC. pseudotuberculosis infection manifested as guttural pouch empyema in a pregnant mare from the south-eastern USA. In a retrospective study classifying 538 cases of C. pseudotuberculosis infection in horses, only two cases of guttural pouch infection were identi ed and both were classi ed as external abscesses (Aleman et al. 1996). Although undetermined in this mare, guttural pouch infection \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd77 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / FEBRUARY 2018could have resulted from bacterial inoculation secondary to oropharyngeal trauma, lymphatic spread, or haematogenous dissemination. Detection of SHI titres 512 have been used as a benchmark for identifying internal C. pseudotuberculosis infection; particularly in the absence of concurrent external abscesses (Knight 1978; Aleman et al. 1996; Pratt et al. 2005; Jeske et al. 2013). Internal abscesses carry a worse prognosis compared to external abscesses as mortality rates can reach 40% with treatment and 100% without treatment (Aleman et al. 1996; Pratt et al. 2005). Disseminated C. pseudotuberculosis infection may involve multiple organs including the lungs, liver, kidneys and spleen or, in pregnantmares, spread to the uterus may result in abortion(Poonacha and Donahue 1995; Pratt et al. 2005). Life- threatening, secondary complications of internal infection include purpura haemorrhagica, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and colitis from prolonged antibiotic therapy (Pusterla et al. 2003; Pratt et al. 2005; Rand et al. 2012). Both moderate hyper brinogenaemia and a markedly increased SHI titre were reported in this case. During serial transthoracic and transabdominal ultrasound examinations, internal infection was not identi ed and the mare 's high SHI titre probably resulted from guttural pouch infection. Periodic monitoring of fetal heart rate and trans-abdominal CTUP measurements showed no indications of placentitis or fetal compromise. Similar to internal C. pseudotuberculosis infection , establishing drainage of abscessed retropharyngeal lymph nodes S. more of guttural pouch empyema, often requires systemic antimicrobial therapy along with serial guttural pouch lavage to resolve infection. Furthermore, systemic antimicrobial therapy may hasten resolution of upper airway lymphadenopathy, limiting complications including dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia (Judy et al. 1999; Borges and Watanabe 2011). The initial course of therapy administered in this case was similar to one frequently followed for guttural pouch empyema secondary to Streptococcus spp.infections. The mare treated with ceftiofur as S. equi ssp. zooepidemicu s and ssp. equi are commonly third generation cephalosporins, (Verheyen et al. 2000; McClure et al. 2011). Following aerobic culture and antimicrobial sensitivity results, antimicrobial therapy waschanged to TMS-SMZ and rifampicin as ceftiofur formulationsat labelled dosages do not maintain suf cient plasma concentrations to meet the mean inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for C. pseudotuberculosis (Rhodes et al. 2015; N. Pusterla, personal correspondence). Based on sensitivity results, the ease of oral administration, and permeability of the placental -fetal unit, the combination of oral TMS and rifampicin was chosen to treat this mare (Rebello et al. 2006). Rifampicin was administered as TMS-SMZ alone may have reduced activity in purulent environments or well- encapsulated abscesses (Rhodes et al. 2015). Systemic antimicrobial therapy remains controversial in cases of external abscesses; however, long-term TMS-SMZ therapy was continued to limit possible complications associated with guttural pouch infection, reduce the risk of placentitis and abortion, and, in light of the mare 's increased SHI titre, internal C. pseudotuberculosis infection could not be completely ruled out. MICs against this isolate were notdetermined on initial culture but could have better guided long-term antimicrobial therapy for this case; particularly as the MIC for potentiated sulfonamides can vary between C. pseudotuberculosis isolates (Rhodes et al. 2015). Based on sensitivity results, oral chloramphenicol or injectable penicillin would have also been appropriate choices. Follow up re- evaluations showed favourable response to TMS-SMZ and rifampicin therapy in this case. Unlike the south-western USA, cases of equine C. pseudotuberculosis infection are rarely reported in the south-east. This particular case was one of 21 reports of equine C. pseudotuberculosis infection documented in South Carolina during the years 2013 -2014; prior to 2013 the disease had not been reported by the State Veterinarian 'sO f ce (A. Eichelberger, personal correspondence). Similarly in 2012, Florida reported an unusually high number of equine cases while a marked rise in the total number of C. pseudotuberculosis cases was reported in horses throughout the USA between 2011 and 2012 (House 2012; Kilcoyne et al. 2014). During this 2-year period, the greatest number of cases occurred in Texas but numerous cases were reported in states outside of the western USA, many of which had not reported C. pseudotuberculosis infection prior to 2010 (Kilcoyne et al. 2014). C. pseudotuberculosis can survive in soil for over 8 months and environmental factors such as increased rainfall and manure content in soil may facilitate the endemic status in some areas (Spier et al. 2004; Spier 2008; Kilcoyne et al. 2014). Although the route of infection is not completely understood, C. pseudotuberculosis is probably inoculated through mucosal abrasions, direct soil contamination of wounds, or transmission from insect vectors that damage the skin barrier or contaminate existing wounds (Aleman et al. 1996; Spier 2008). The horn fly(Haematobia irritans) calcitrans) domestica ), which feed along the ventrum of the horse or contaminate wounds, have been identi ed as potential vectors while experimental transmission of C. pseudotuberculosis to ponies from the house fly vector has been documented (Spier et al. 2004; Kilcoyne et al. 2014; Barba et al. 2015). Climate changes favouring vector survival and breeding could conceivably propagate the overall numbers and distribution of cases across the USA, including regions outside traditional endemic areas (Spier et al. 2004; Spier 2008). Rainfall in 2013 were almost twice those recorded in 2012 for this area of South Carolina, particularly during the summer months. Dry conditions in 2012 followed by a relatively rainy 2013 summer may have contributed to the unprecedented number of C. pseudotuberculosis cases recorded in the state that year (South Carolina State Climatology Of ce, personal correspondence). Although blood cultures collected within 18 h of birth yielded no bacterial growth, a SHI titre was not measured in the mare 's foal. In endemic areas, infection is uncommon in foals younger than 6 months, indicating a role of protective immunity from maternal antibodies against C. pseudotuberculosis (Aleman et al. 1996). Passive transfer was con rmed in this foal and no signs of illness were detected at birth or throughout the rst month of life. Complete evaluation for internal abscess formation in thismare should have included cytological analysis of peritonealfluid; however, abdominocentesis was not pursued in light of the mare 's favourable response to therapy and due to \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd78 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2018potential risks the procedure carries for pregnant mares (such as amniocentesis). This case report represents an uncommon presentation for C. pseudotuberculosis infection in a pregnant mare. Although rare, C. pseudotuberculosis should be considered a differential for guttural pouch empyema or retropharyngeal lymph node abscessation. As recent reports have con rmed cases outside of traditionally endemic areas, veterinarians should consider C. pseudotuberculosis as a differential for external abscesses, guttural pouch infection or insidious signs associated with internal abscesses in horses from areas of the country outside the western and south-western USA.

James Division of Veterinary Clinical Studies, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, The University of Edinburgh and The Roslin Institute, as the presence of purulent exudate or chondroids within one or both pouches(Freeman and Hardy 2012). The article by DeLoache et al. (2018) in this issue highlights the need to broaden our horizonswhen considering the aetiology of guttural pouch causative agent of 'pigeon fever ', a common disease in certain areas of the USA. Aetiopathogenesis of guttural pouch empyema The guttural pouches are lined by the common respiratory mucosa and are thus affected by all generalised viral respiratory infections. Endoscopy of horses with such viral respiratory infections frequently shows mucopurulent exudate draining bilaterally from the guttural pouches. Similar exudate is also commonly seen draining from the sinonasal ostia ( 'sinus drainage angles ') in such infections because the sinuses are also lined by the common respiratory mucosa and are similarly affected by these acute infections. Most such infections are self-limiting and no treatment, other than rest, is usually required. A more chronic and purulent guttural pouch infection may occur with upper respiratory infections caused by bacteria, most commonly a primary nasopharyngeal and guttural pouch infection with Streptococcus equi var equi (strangles) and less commonly by other bacteria including Streptococcus zooepidemicus (Judy et al. 1999), that may be primary infections or secondary to viral respiratory infections.As shown by DeLoache et al. (2018), guttural pouch infection with C. pseudotuberculosis also needs to be considered in some geographical areas. With strangles infection, abscessed retropharyngeal lymph nodes on the floor of the medial guttural pouch compartment can rupture and drain into the guttural pouchlumen (Fintl et al. 2000) and initiate the empyema ( Fig 1 ). It is unclear if empyema of the guttural pouches by other types of bacteria are caused by direct pyogenic infection of the guttural pouch mucosa, or occur following rupture of abscessed retropharyngeal lymph nodes into the guttural pouch lumen. Most acute cases of guttural pouch empyema resolve spontaneously and resolution is aided by postural drainage from the pouches that occurs when the head is lowered, in conjunction with the normal opening of the ostia during swallowing. However, such postural drainage, that is encouraged by feeding at ground level, does not necessarily completely empty the guttural pouches of exudate by gravity, because areas lateral to the guttural pouch pharyngeal ostium are ventral to its internal ostium when the head is lowered. The presence of normal guttural pouch mucociliary clearance is also required for complete drainage of exudate. Continuing mucosal in flammation with loss of ciliainhibits normal movement of exudate that has increased quantity due to the local mucosal in flammation and is also of a more viscous nature than normal guttural pouch mucus secretions due to the leucocyte breakdown contains. In flammation of the guttural pouch ostia may also impede drainage at this stage. If guttural pouch empyema does not fully drain for the above reasons, the exudate can gradually become viscous (Fig 2 ) and may eventually dehydrate further and form rm chondroids, that become spherical or ovoid from kneading type movements on the floor of the pouch during head movements and eventually become solid ( Fig 2 ). The presence of chondroids, that are essentially infected, porous foreign bodies, will cause ongoing mucosal in flammation and thus make the guttural pouch empyema permanent until they are removed. A similar situation occurs with chronic paranasal sinus empyema, if the more dependent and rostral maxillary sinuses) develop inspissated pus that, in turn, makes the sinus empyema permanent. It is unclear if equine pus is more prone to become inspissated than exudate of other species, or whether this predisposition to inspissation is anatomical, due to species-related poor drainage of their guttural pouches and sinuses. Fig 1: Drainage of pus from a ruptured lymph node on the floor of the medial compartment into the for guttural pouch empyema to become chronic include persistent drainage of the retropharyngeal lymph nodes that usually heal over afterthey rupture into the guttural pouches ( Fig 3 ) guttural pouch Foals with guttural pouch tympany, frequently have concurrent empyema related to poor and anatomical distension of affected pouches. Guttural pouch neoplasia can affect drainage predisposing to infection (Drew et al. 2016). Restricted guttural pouch drainage can also cause ongoing empyema for different reasons. If extreme distension of a guttural pouch with exudate occurs ( Fig 5 ) this can put pressure on the at the in flamed pharyngeal ostium that occludes drainage. Less commonly, a permanent anatomical stenosis of the ostium can occur with, or without, any history of prior upper airway infection. Ostial stenosis can lead to the accumulation of viscous mucoid (indicating possible developmental origin or acquired stenosis of noninfectious cause) or more commonly purulent exudate (possibly indicating prior guttural pouch infection), usually involving one pouch. Occasionally, such guttural pouches with restricted drainage may spontaneously stulate into the nasopharynx, but if they contain chondroids larger than the acquired ostium, they cannot drain fully ( Fig 5 ) and the guttural pouch empyema will remain.

Fig 4: An ingested metallic foreign body (broken hairclip) has penetrated the guttural pouch causing chronic empyema \u00a92016 EDUCATION / AE of diagnosis Cases of guttural pouch empyema may have a history of contact with strangles-infected horses and such cases may initially have a bilateral purulent nasal discharge, which later becomes unilateral, if empyema develops in just one guttural pouch. Initially, affected horses may have painful swelling of the submandibular and parotid area lymph nodes, abnormal head and neck carriage. Stertor and dysphagia can develop if gross distension of pouches occur due to empyema ( Fig 6 ), or to swollen retropharyngeal lymph nodes in acute cases.Nasal culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serological blood tests for strangles infection are often initially used to diagnose strangles and clinicians are often reluctant to perform upper airway endoscopy at this stage, because of the expense of dealing with the inevitable contamination of equipment and clothing and knowing that most cases will resolve without such intervention. Molecular analysis (e.g. PCR) and/or bacterial culture of nasal swabs may con rm strangles, or indicate an alternative pathogen such as found in the accompanying case report (DeLoache et al. 2018). In cases of more persistent nasal discharge, endoscopy of the upper airway is required, initially to assess if other causes of unilateral nasal disease are present, such as sinusitis, nasal conchal bulla infection or infection of the rostral teeth with nasal drainage. Endoscopy of the guttural pouch area may show exudate draining from one or both ostia and/or compression of the nasopharyngeal roof, that often appears bilateral even in cases of unilateral guttural pouch distension ( Fig 7 ). Passage of into the guttural pouch via the nasopharyngeal ostium may show purulent exudate or chondroids (or both) lying on the guttural pouch floor. Samples of exudate can be collected for culture and/or PCR analysis for evidence of strangles. Standing, lateral radiographs can also be used to assess for fluid lines or chondroids within the guttural pouches, but it is not always possible to radiographically ascertain whether unilateral or bilateral GP disease is present ( Fig 6 ). Treatment Lower grade guttural pouch empyema can be treated conservatively by postural drainage, including isolation of such cases if infectious disease is suspected. Nonresponding cases can have guttural pouch lavage as described by DeLoache et al. (2018) and this can be performed using an indwelling commercially available guttural pouch catheter, a Foley or custom-made catheter, or transendoscopically. Lukewarm saline is the treatment of choice as added antiseptics will cause in flammation of the guttural pouch mucosa which may hinder drainage. If persistent infection remains following saline Fig 6: Marked guttural pouch the caudal nasopharynx and larynx showing collapse (arrows) of the nasopharyngeal roof and some laryngeal obstruction. b) This lateral radiograph shows extreme distension of the guttural pouch(arrows) with a fluid line dorsally (single arrow, blue outline), great compression on and narrowing of the nasopharyngeal lumen ventrally (single arrow) and caudal distension of the GP towards the neck (horizontal arrows).

Excessive pressure should not be used during lavage as this can tear the guttural pouch lining and cause cellulitis of the head and neck, that may even progress down the fascial planes of the neck resulting in thoracic empyema. As noted above, gross distension of guttural exudate can be self-perpetuating due to ostium compressionand such cases may be treated by catheterisation (with difculty) and drainage of the affected pouch(es) that, in turn will allow greatly improved drainage. If stenosis of the guttural pouch ostium is present, it is not usually possible to catheterise the distended pouch and creation of a large drainage ostium by transendoscopic laser surgery on the thin-walled, rostrodorsal aspect of the affected pouch is indicated. Fenestration of the cartilaginous ostium is much more dif cult and may later granulate over and become occluded. Unlike in cases with guttural pouch empyema/ chondroids, although success with this technique has been reported (Hawkins et al. 2001). Although earlier descriptions exist of surgical drainage of guttural pouch empyema via Viborg 's triangle, this technique is dif cult unless gross distension is present and should be avoided. If small numbers of rm chondroids are present, they can be removed transendoscopically ( Fig 8 ). Larger numbers of chondroids require surgical removal. Surgery on the standing horse has many anatomical and practical advantages over surgery Fig 9: a) Standing surgical removal of left-sided guttural pouch approach: note left-sided nasal discharge in affected horse. b) A loop curette can be endoscopically seen amongst semi-solidchondroids in the affected pouch during this surgery. c) The long-handled spoon shown in the kidney dish with extracted chondroids isalso useful in removing chondroids.

A. G. Raftery Weipers Centre Equine Hospital, University of Glasgow, Bearsden Road, Glasgow, Scotland. Corresponding author email: alexandra.raftery@googlemail.com Summary Clinical question In horses (population) does measurement of cardiac troponin I (intervention) improve ability to diagnose myocardial disease (outcome) with respect to: (1) presence and (2) severity when compared with clinical evaluation and ECG? Introduction and history Cardiac troponin I (CTnI) is part of the troponin complexintegral to myocardial contraction. During myocyte necrosis or membrane damage CTnI leaks into the circulation and isdetectable in the serum (gold standard to detect myocardial injury in man [Anon 2014], correlated to severity and prognosis in dogs and man [Fonfara et al. 2010]), but provides no information on the mechanism of injury. Genetic sequencing of equine CTnI con rms that use of commercial human immunoassays is appropriate (Rishniw and Simpson 2005). Search method The search terms 'horse 'or'equine 'and 'cardiac troponin I ' were entered into Pubmed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ pubmed). Search outcome (1) Quantity of evidence: A total of 54 papers were retrieved; 31 provided useful information and 23 werediscarded as irrelevant to the question (16), provided alow level of evidence (six case reports) or a secondarysource (one review article). (2) Quality of evidence: There were eight case -control studies, seven cross-sectional studies, 11 case series andsix experimental studies providing moderate evidence forthe conclusions. How has CTnI been validated for use in the horse? Normal values in healthy animals Multiple studies have generated reference ranges for CTnI from clinically healthy horses (Phillips et al. 2003; Van Der Vekens et al. 2015a,b). In the majority of these studies a clinical examination and ECG were not performed and therefore cardiac disease could have been overlooked. Importantly, there were signi cant differences between values obtained from different assays in different laboratoriesthat precludes quanti able comparison between published studies (Serra et al. 2010; Van Der Vekens et al. 2015a). Mild and transient increases (up to 14 h) in CTnI are documented after intense exercise (Begg et al. 2006; Holbrook et al. 2006; Nostell \u20acaggstr \u20acom 2008; Slack et al. 2012; Fleth\u00f8j et al. 2016) and fetal reference range is higher (Herman et al. 2014), but with no other age-effect noted. General anaesthesia (Slack et al. 2011) and polysaccharidestorage myopathy (PSSM) (Naylor et al. 2012) do The half-life of CTnI (0.47 h) (Kraus et al. 2013) is short, therefore effect of unknown variables can easily be assessed by their removal. Evaluation in horses presenting with myocardial disease A diagnostic test should undergo an independent, blind comparison with a reference standard (for CTnI, clinical evaluation and an ECG). These four studies of horsespresenting for cardiac disease separately to healthy animals (case -control studies) may overestimate the accuracy of the test (due to bias, Table 1 ). The ndings of these studies are consistent and conclude an increase in CTnI with primary active myocardial disease, but not necessarily with secondary disease where myocyte injury may not always occur. Diagnosis of myocardial damage for horses presenting with other pathologies A wide of range of pathologies have been evaluated for evidence of myocardial injury providing a population with less bias as these horses may have not presented with symptoms of cardiac disease. (1) Haemorrhage : One small case series concluded myocardial injury associated with the presence of dysrhythmias occurs during acute haemorrhage (Navas de Solis et al. 2015). (2) Colic and/or endotoxaemia : Two case -control, one case series and an experimental study (Nath et al. 2012b; Nostell et al. 2012; Radcliffe et al. 2012; D /C19azet al. 2014) examined horses with colic and/or endotoxaemia. Cardiac troponin I values were increased in the horses likely to be hypovolaemic and/or endotoxaemic(associated with requirement for surgery, negative prognosis, infusion of endotoxin). Increased values were associated with development of ventricular dysrhythmias and decreased cardiac function. (3) Cardiotoxicity : Seven studies ( ve experimental, one case series, one case -control) evaluated serum concentrations of CTnI following administration of toxins known to result in cardiac muscle damage (fumosin B1 [Smith et al. 2002]), monensin (Divers Kraus (Gilliam (Decloedt et al. and rayless goldenrod (Davis et al. 2013). Increased CTnI concentrations are documented alongside decreased cardiac function and presence of dysrhythmias with decreasing frequency ofall these markers associated with recovery. (4) Cardiomyopathy : A case series of horses with atypical myopathy demonstrates concurrent increase in CTnI with abnormal clinical ndings and presence of dysrhythmias (Verheyen al. doi: 10.1111/eve.12715Conclusion There is a clear and well documented relationship between myocardial injury and increased CTnI in horses. There may be a correlation between both the degree and duration of this increase and severity of injury/prognosis but further work is required to de ne this relationship. CTnI should be measured in all horses presenting with myocardial disease and in anypathology where myocardial injury can occur.

Gray*, P. Randleff-Rasmussenand O. M. Lepage Drakenstein Cape, South Africa; VetAgro varus; surgery Summary This study reports on the effective use of a single transphyseal screw for the treatment of moderate to severe angular limb deformities (ALDs) of the fetlocks and carpi of 28 young Thoroughbred foals. The objective was to evaluatethe surgical management of foals with moderate to severe ALDs treated with single transphyseal screws. Evaluation of medical records of 28 Thoroughbred foals treated with single transphyseal screws placed across the distal radial, metacarpal and metatarsal physes was undertaken. The angle of joint deviation was measured prior to implantation and at removal of the implants, and the degree of improvement was calculated. A total of 39 screws were placed: 24 in the distal metacarpus or metatarsus and the Varus or valgus deformities in the fetlock improved by 4 -5\u00b0over a period of 15 -30 days. Varus or valgus deformities in the carpi improved by 8 -11\u00b0in 11 - 56 days. One case failed to improve adequately due to implant infection. Single transphyseal screws were effective in treating moderate to severe varus and valgus ALD of the fetlocks and carpi in young Thoroughbred foals. Further investigation into their use in the distal radius in young foals is needed. While single transphyseal screws are almost exclusively used by some clinics in the distal metatarsal and metacarpal physes, many clinicians do not use them in the distal radial physis of young foals due to fear of over- correction, physitis and metaphyseal collapse. This was not observed in any of our cases. Introduction Congenital angular limb deformity (ALD) observed as an axialdeviation in a frontal plane is relatively common in foals and strategies for management thereof, including surgical techniques, are well established (Auer 2012). Foals with ALD can present with either a varus deformity (medial deviation distal to the affected joint/physis) or a valgus (lateral deviation). These deviations are often associated with axial rotation of the distal limb and are mainly observed in the fetlocks, tarsal or carpal regions (Auer 2012). Diagnosis is mainly based on inspection, manipulation and radiography. To ensure optimal outcomes, early recognition and monitoring are important. The need for early diagnosis is essential, especially if incomplete ossi cation is suspected, and the clinician always needs to evaluate the entire limb during weight bearing and locomotion. Radiography is used as a complementary examination to allow exact determination of the location and degree of thedeformity and is essential for assessment of cuboidal bone ossication (Bramlage and Embertson 1990). Angular limb deformity conditions require corrective management and one needs to decide on the most appropriate treatment. Most ALDs are self-correcting andonly require conservative management, including restricted exercise, splints, corrective hoof trimming and, in some cases, shoeing with extensions placed on the medial or lateral aspect (Ruggles and McIlwraith 2008). In cases of severe deformities ( >10\u00b0valgus or 3 \u00b0varus of the varus of the fetlock) (Munroe and Weese 2011) or those that fail to respond adequately to conservative approaches, other treatments focused on growth acceleration or retardation of the bones involved in the ALD, need to be considered. These techniques depend on the growth potential at the physis of the developing foal. Growth acceleration is performed on the concave aspect of the limb and growth retardation on the convex aspect. Periosteal transection and elevation is the original method (Auer and Martens 1982) of growth acceleration but modi cations of the technique to minimise the surgical approach have been described, such as hemicircumferential periosteal transection through a stab incision (Auer 2012) and physeal stimulation (Colles 2008). There is currently a debate about the ef cacy of these growth accelerating techniques: a recent study by Baker et al. (2015) indicated that periosteal elevation has no effect on carpal angulation. Conversely, work on lambs has shown that periosteal transection and elevation have a direct effect on parthyroid hormone and related peptide, all of which are involved in bone growth (Von Rechenberg et al. 2010). Growth retardation is achieved by means of a temporary transphyseal bridge that acts to retard growth on the convex aspect of the limb. The original transphyseal stapling methods (Heinze 1963) are used less frequently for routine bridging except in very young foals, age <3 weeks, and have mostly been replaced by screws and cerclage wire (Fretz and Donecker 1983), the latter material sometimes replaced by asmall bone plate (Auer 2012). A nonsurgical approach to local growth retardation has also been described, using radial shockwave therapy (Bussy et al. 2013). More recently, implantation of a single transphyseal screw has been described as an effective method for retarding growth of distal metacarpal and metatarsal bones in young horses with mild to moderate ALDs (Kay et al. 2005; Roberts et al. 2009). In this case series we report the results of foals with moderate to severe ALDs in the fetlock or the carpi, treated with only a single transphyseal \u00a92017 doi: 10.1111/eve.12742Materials and methods Animals and study design All animals that underwent evaluation/surgery for ALD between August 2010 and April 2015 were identi ed. Each foal underwent a preoperative examination which consisted of clinical and dynamic locomotor examination as well as radiographic examination. Thoroughbred foals that showed deviations of 4 \u00b0or greater at the fetlocks or carpal valgus of 10\u00b0or greater or varus of 2 \u00b0or greater were selected for inclusion in this study. Single transphyseal screws were placed in most foals after more conservative approaches failed to correct the deviation adequately. Medical records were reviewed for age in days at time of screw placement and removal, the joint affected and direction of deviation, the number of screws placed and degree of angulation of the deviation before placement and after removal of screws. Cosmetic blemishes and post-operative complications were also noted. Dorsopalmar and dorsoplantar radiographs taken prior to screw placement and at or after time of removal were evaluated for each case. Prior to surgical intervention, all foals were examined standing and walking in a straight line on a rm surface to and from the examiner. Limbs were evaluated perpendicular to the frontal plane of the outward-rotated limb (Auer 2012). Theaffected limbs were subsequently radiographed using digital radiograph equipment with dorsoplantar and dorsopalmar views taken with the x-ray beam at a right angle to the frontal plane of the limb with a minimum of 10 cm of the long bones above and below the affected joint included in the projection. Shape and degree of ossi cation of the cuboidal bones was noted. For the carpus, angle of deviation was calculated after drawing two lines, one through the middle of the distal radius and one through the middle of the McIII/MtIII diaphysis. For deviations of the fetlocks, lines through McIII/ MtIII and P1 were drawn. The angle of deviation was calculated where these lines intersected. Radiographs were all evaluated by two authors and the degree of angulation measured independently. A standard premedication and anaesthetic protocol was used for surgery. Surgery Single transphyseal screws were placed under generalanaesthetic using the same technique as described by Kayand Hunt (2009). Hooves were balanced, and extensions placed as necessary. Post-operative follow-up A standard controlled exercise regime was followed post-operatively. Foals were re-evaluated every week to assess limb angle and decide on time of screw removal. Once the limb appeared clinically straight, radiographs were taken to assess bone alignment, to ascertain whether correction of the angular deviation was complete. Some screws were removed while a 1 -2\u00b0deviation remained as there is some further correction of the deformity after implant removal. Radiographs of the affected limb were evaluated either at the time of screw removal or later, and angles of deviation measured as described above. Screws were then removed, either under standing sedation with local anaesthesia or under a short general anaesthetic. Results There were 157 foals with ALD of the fetlocks or carpus region that were operated on over a 4-year period, from August 2010 to April 2015 at the rst author 's clinic. Of these, 28 foals with placement of 39 cortex screws met the inclusion criteria. These are detailed in Table 1 . All individuals were assessed clinically before and after surgery by the same clinician. Sixteen screws were placed into 10 foals for front fetlock varus. All screws were removed when a radiographic angle of 0 -2\u00b0varus was achieved and the clinician was satis ed upon subjective clinical evaluation. One foal had an unrelated lameness of the left forelimb and one foal had a large wound on the operated leg due to a bandage rub, leading to white hairs and a cosmetic blemish. Six foals received screws in the hind fetlock for unilateral varus. All screws were removed when the radiographic degree of angulation was 0 -1\u00b0. One foal had a persistent periosteal reaction at the site of screw placement, which waslater surgically removed prior to yearling sales. Two foals had valgus deviations of the fetlocks. One foal with a hindlimb valgus of the fetlock had a concurrent valgus deformation of MtIII, which was addressed with growth acceleration along the lateral aspect of the bone. Ten foals were treated with 12 screws for carpal valgus deformities. Two foals had bilateral carpal valgus ( Figs 1 and 2 ), TABLE 1: Details of the 28 Thoroughbred foals with severe angular limb deformities treated with the transphyseal screw technique Number varus RF LF 8 85.5 32 1 bandage rub resultant defect,1 poor response Hind fetlock varus RH 2, LH 4 68 27 4.8 0.3 4.5 1 persistent periosteal reaction Front fetlock valgus LF 1 105 24 4 2 2 hind fetlock valgus LH 1 14 27 7 2 5 Carpal varus RF 1, LF 2 35 30 5 3 8Carpal valgus RF 8, LF 4 47 35 15 4 11 1 implant infection LF, left frontlimb; foals had valgus of the right carpus, two foals had valgus of the left carpus, one foal that had a right carpal valgus had a contralateral left carpal varus. All screws were removed when the carpus reached an angle of between 1 \u00b0 and 5 \u00b0. There was one case of implant failure due to implant infection with Staphylococcus aureus . This particular foal had poor patient compliance with bandaging. There was one complication during surgery when a drill bit tip broke withinthe radius of the foal; the tip was left in place and did not affect the foal. The broken drill bit may have affected the sales value of the horse; however, this particular horse was not destined for sales so no attempt at retrieval was made. Two foals were treated for carpal varus deformities. One had bilateral carpal varus (2 \u00b0on the left and 3 \u00b0on the right). This foal also had concurrent fetlock varus deformities. Long-term follow-up was achieved through personal owner or farm manager communication. Except for one foal with white hairs, and one with a persistent periosteal reaction, all cases were reported to have excellent cosmetic outcomes. Discussion Most ALDs in foals are self-limiting or self-correcting, or responsive to conservative approaches and management changes. Some researchers are of the opinion that all angular deformities will correct with conservative management alone (Read et al. 2002); however, one study evaluating a large number of horses through the rst year of life showed that up to 14% of carpal valgus deformities did not self-correct to what was considered a desirable conformation (Santschi et al. 2006). It is imperative to recognise severe deformities or those that are not improving, or are deteriorating, in order for timeous surgical intervention. Early surgical intervention at the level of the distal metacarpus and metatarsus is essential, as rapid growth reduces at approximately 10 weeks of age (Auer 2012), and failure to utilise this window of growth potential leads to poor response to treatment. Intervention at the distal radius and distal tibia is possible up to the age of 15 months (Auer 2012); however, valgus deviation in the carpi at an angle of >10\u00b0may potentially lead to lateral physeal collapse and should be approached more aggressively (Ruggles and McIlwraith 2008). Fetlock varus or toe-in conformation is a highly undesirable trait leading to severe penalty at time of sales as well as potential degenerative changes in the fetlock joint during athletic career (Marks 2000; Ross 2003). There have been large retrospective studies on the effectiveness of a single transphyseal screw for correction of both forelimb and hindlimb fetlock varus (Kay et al. 2005; Roberts et al. 2009). Some authors exclusively use single transphyseal screws in the fetlock region, even in animals younger than 4 weeks (Roberts et al. 2009). The majority of cases in these large studies had mild to moderate varusdeformities ( <4\u00b0), whereas our inclusion criteria selected for those foals with more severe deviations ( 4\u00b0). The mean age at time of implant placement and duration of time the implants remained in place in this case series was comparable to other reported studies. There are also reports that single transphyseal screws are not effective in younger foals, due to poor holding potential of the soft epiphyseal bone (Auer 2011; Russell 2013). Transphyseal screws were placed in the distal metatarsal physes of two foals younger than 14 days (one hind fetlock varus, 6 \u00b0, one hind fetlock valgus, 7 \u00b0); in both cases, holding potential of the epiphysis was suf cient and no over-correction occurred with the use of 4.5 mm standard cortex screws. In both of these cases, great care was taken to remove the implants prior to complete correction of the deviation due to the potential for further correction after removal of the implants. Neither foal developed excessive callus reaction. Two foals were treated LR L Ra) b) Fig 1: a) Dorsopalmar radiographs of the carpi of a 31-day-old colt with bilateral carpal valgus (left carpus 17 \u00b0, right carpus 14 \u00b0) and physeal dysplasia (arrow) prior to surgery. b) Dorsopalmarradiographs of the carpi of the same colt prior to removal of theright screw 35 days later, \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd90 EQUINE / AE / FEBRUARY 2018for bilateral fetlock varus after 140 days of age and some improvement of the deformity still occurred, with one foal achieving acceptable conformation of 0 \u00b0from a left forelimb varus of 6 \u00b0and a right forelimb varus of 4 \u00b0. The other foal failed to respond adequately on one of the limbs; however, in this particular case, the foal was con ned to a stall for the duration of implantation due to a concurrent, unrelated lameness. Interestingly, the load-bearing limb corrected to an acceptable angle (from a 7 \u00b0varus to 1 \u00b0varus), while the nonweightbearing limb did not (radiographs shown in Fig 3 ). This is potentially due to a lack of dynamic compressive forces across the physis, which are believed to stimulate physeal growth (Jansson and Ducharme 2005). Many of the foals had a small periosteal reaction at the screw placement site at the time of screw removal; however, in all but one case, this resolved by yearling age. A persistent periosteal reaction remained in one horse and a second surgery to remove the blemish was performed prior to sale at the age of 14 months. A change in technique has been described (Kay and Hunt 2009), which reduces this periosteal reaction. Case series have been reported on the placement of single transphyseal screws in the distal radius; however, the majority of these focus on correction of carpal varus and offset limbs in older foals and yearling groups (Baker et al. 2011; Carlson et al. 2012). We report on the use of single transphyseal screws placed in the distal radius of foals younger than 2 months. Most authors do not utilise single transphyseal screws in foals younger than one month andalternatively use screw and wire transphyseal bridging or a transphyseal staple. It was previously believed that a single transphyseal screw may cause over-correction of a deviation due to a 'spot-weld 'of the physis and the rapid growth potential in younger foals (Roberts et al. 2009). The effect of premature closure of the growth plate of the distal radius in young foals would be catastrophic as the distal radius is responsible for 75% of the longitudinal growth of the distal limb (Fretz et al. 1984). In contrast to a transphyseal screw causing a 'spot-weld ', Kay et al. (2005) report that any transphyseal growth-retarding implant can potentially lead toover-correction of the ALD as a result of over-compression ofthe physis, leading to physeal dysplasia and cessationof growth, resulting in continued deviation due to collapse ofthe growth plate. Over-correction of the deformity mayrequire intervention on the opposite side of the limb.Although an uncommon complication, there have also beenreported cases of physitis of the distolateral radius afterremoval of transphyseal screws in older horses, leading tometaphyseal collapse and an angular limb deformity in theopposite direction (Carlson et al. 2012). Levet and Martens (2011) report on two cases of transphyseal screws in the distalradius failing to adequately correct a carpal valgus deformitydue to the transphyseal screw pulling out of the epiphysis dueto rapid growth at this location, screw sepsis or stripping ofthe threads; however, we had only one case of screw sepsisin our study. Long-term follow-up after screw removal by personal owner or farm manager communication revealed no over-correction occurring after removal of the screw and excellentcosmetic results in all cases at the time of yearling sales. One foal with bilateral carpal valgus deviations had Fig 1b ). Described treatment for cases such as this is a small transphyseal bone plate and screws a) b) Fig 2: Photographs of colt in Figure 1 at time of screw (a) placement and (b) removal. (Note the periosteal and soft tissue reaction at the site of previous hemicircumferential periostealtransection laterally on both limbs, as well as the medial toeextension. This was done by the referring veterinarian prior topresentation, with minimal response). \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd91 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2018(Auer 2012); however, in this case, the foal was treated with single transphyseal screws across the medial physes of the distal radii. The angle of deviation corrected to an acceptable angle and the physeal dysplasia resolved. One foal in our series failed to respond adequately to the single transphyseal screw due to implant infection. The screw was removed and a transphyseal bridge with two screws and wire was placed as an alternative in order to avoid the original, infected transphyseal screw tract. The angular limb deviation was corrected; however, there was a noticeable cosmetic blemish at the site of the screw and wire implant at the time of removal. Angular limb deformities occur in all breeds and types of horses; however, tolerance of deviations from the ideal conformation is greater in some disciplines than in others. In the Thoroughbred breeding industry, there is greater pressure on breeders to produce horses with the perceived 'ideal ' conformation, as some conformations have been shown to affect the athletic performance of a racehorse adversely (Anderson et al. 2004). This in turn has major implications on the value of individuals with less desirable conformational traits. While there is some debate about the ethical consideration of manipulating the horses 'natural conformation, the described techniques are widely used, accepted and, ultimately, correcting undesirable conformational traits is in the best interest of the individual animal (Bramlage 1999). The procedures are also performed in cases as described above where severe deformity due toinappropriate development has and will occur if intervention is not performed (Auer 2011). Few complications were observed in our series and no over-correction of deformities occurred. The use of the single transphyseal screw was effective in treating severe cases of angular limb deformities in both the fetlocks and the carpi. While single screws are widely used in treating fetlock deviations even in young foals (Adkins 2008; Roberts et al. 2009), many surgeons are still reluctant to place single screws into younger foals 'carpi. Although favourable results were achieved in this case series, the effect of single transphyseal cortex screws in the distal radius of young foals needs to be further investigated in a greater number of cases.

Bezdekova* and P. less frequently reported in equine veterinary practice in comparison with other alimentary pathologies. This paper describes the prevalence, age, breed and sex distribution, the duration of clinical presentation before admission, the diagnosis, aetiology, treatment course, complications, length of hospitalisation, and the short-term and long-term survival of 39 cases with equine oesophageal disorders at a referral clinic. Prevalence of oesophageal disorders was signi cantly higher in the group of horses up to 4 years of age in comparison with other age groups. The most common oesophageal disorder was simple obstruction represented by 22/39 cases (56.41%). The common complications of the oesophageal disorder oesophagitis(16/39, 41.02%) and aspiration pneumonia (11/39, 28.20%); 31/39 (79.49%) of all oesophageal cases survived up to clinical discharge. Long-term survival was 65.78% in this group of cases. Introduction Various disorders can develop in the equine oesophagus. Oesophageal obstruction is the most common condition (Craig et al. 1989; Feige et al. 2000; Duncanson 2006). The other various oesophageal disorders are less focused in published studies but clinically signi cant. Obstruction can be represented by a simple oesophageal obstruction, where the prognosis is better than in oesophageal obstructions due to functional or morphological abnormalities (Craig et al. 1989; Stick 2006; Breuer et al. 2011). Previous retrospective studies described clinical features and complications of a population of horses presented to a referral institution as well as a nonreferred group of equids with oesophageal diseases (Craig 2000; Duncanson 2006; Chiavaccini and Hassel 2010). The goal of our study was to describe the prevalence, breed, sex and age distribution, the duration of clinical presentation before admission, the diagnosis, aetiology, treatment course (surgical, medical), complications, length of hospitalisation, and the short-term and long-term survival of patients with equine oesophageal disorders at a referral clinic in the Czech Republic. This is therst study of equine oesophageal diseases in our region and it provides an overview of referred oesophageal disorders among the equine population. Materials and methods Patients presented to a university referral clinic in the CzechRepublic in 2004 -2009 were included in the retrospective study. Records of horses diagnosed with oesophageal disorders were analysed. Horses referred with simpleoesophageal obstruction without development of complications such as stricture or oesophagitis, which resolved prior to admission to the clinic, were excluded from the study. Variables included breed, sex and age, the duration of clinical presentation before admission, the diagnosis, aetiology, treatment course (surgical, nonsurgical), complications attributable to the primary oesophageal condition, average length of hospitalisation in treated individuals, and short-term and long-term survival. Full history was taken. Diagnostics included results of physical examination at the time of admission in all cases. Physical examination was performed according to a standard protocol. Additional diagnostic procedures, surgicaland post-mortem examination in selected cases were analysed. Additional diagnostic procedures included passage of a naso-oesophageal tube, upper airway and oesophageal endoscopy, gastroscopy, native and contrast x-ray of the neck and thorax, and ultrasound examination of the neck and thoracic cavity. Short-term survival was de ned as survival to the time of discharge from the clinic. Long-term survival was obtained by telephone interview at least 6 months after discharge. Individual long-term survival length was not evaluated. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and are reported as median and range. Risk factors were tested using Fisher exact test. All levels of signi cance were set to P <0.05. The number of cases, breed and age distribution were compared to the general referral population. The different age groups were analysed in the group of all oesophageal disorders. The other variables have been analysed within the group of simple oesophageal obstruction cases only because of the low number of cases in the other groups of oesophageal disorders. Results The number of cases admitted to the clinic in the monitored period was 6917. This included 39 cases of oesophageal disorders in 38 patients (one horse was presented twice with simple oesophageal obstruction in an 8-month period). This represents 0.56% of all admissions. The group included 14 mares (37%), 13 intact males (34%) and 11 geldings (29%). Eighteen breeds were presented (Fig 1 ). The age ranged from 4 months to 30 years (median 4.5 years). This breed and age distribution did not differ signi cantly from the hospital population over the same time period. For statistical purposes, the group of cases was divided into six subgroups by age (0 -4 years; 5 -8 years; 9 - 12 years; 13 -16 years; 17 -20 years; >20 years). The age group distribution is shown in Fig 2 . Prevalence of oesophageal \u00a92016 was signi cantly higher in the group of horses aged 4 years in comparison with other age groups (all P <0.005). Types of conditions identi ed were divided into nine diagnosis subgroups: simple oesophageal obstruction (intraluminal obstruction with pelleted oesophagitis (primary oesophageal mucosal inflammation/ulceration visible during oesophagoscopy in all cases and caused by the trauma or secondary oesophageal mucosal in flammation/ulceration caused by gastric re flux); oesophageal stricture type 1 (mural lesions, which may involve only the adventicia and muscular layers); type 2 (oesophageal rings or webs that involve only the mucosa and submucosa); type 3 (annular rings, which involve all the layers the guttural pouch. Oesophagitis was listed into the group ofoesophageal disorders when it was con rmed as a cause of the presenting clinical signs at the time of admission. Oesophagitis was listed into the group of oesophageal disorder complications when it followed a primary oesophageal disorder, and was included as a complication that developed during hospitalisation following primary oesophageal disorders diagnosed at admission. The most common oesophageal disorder was simple obstruction (22 cases), which represented 0.32% of all horses presented to the clinic during the study period. This was followed by oesophagitis in 5 cases, oesophageal stricture in 3, oesophageal rupture 3 in 2. Oesophageal oesophagus pouchwere identi ed in one case each ( Fig 3 ).

Re flux oesophagitis occurred squamous mucosa ulceration. In two cases (40.00%), circular single lesions in proximal oesophagus were seen and we suspected previous intraluminal feed impaction and ischaemic necrosis of oesophageal mucosa to be the cause of oesophagitis. Stricture formation was a result of kick injury by another horse in two cases (2/3, 66.67%, type 1, distal third of cervical oesophagus). The other oesophageal stricture happened after long-term intraluminal obstruction (type 3, proximal third of cervical oesophagus). Two cases of oesophageal rupture (2/3, 66.67%) were caused by external blunt trauma and the third case followed long-term intraluminal obstruction and oesophageal wall necrosis. All ruptures affected the cervical oesophagus. The cyst was of embryonic origin, located in the proximal oesophagus and was the only congenital disorder in our group. The intramural pouch had unknown aetiologies. The range of duration of clinical signs prior to admission at the clinic varied between 1 and 728 days. The longest duration was with oesophageal diverticulum, oesophagitis and communication between the oesophagus and simple oesophageal obstructions, oesophagitis were treated medically. All oesophageal strictures, two ruptures and communication between the oesophagus and the guttural pouch were treated medically and surgically. The response to individualtreatment was not evaluated. Medical management varied according to the disorder but included sedatives, broad spectrum antibiotics, spasmolytics, oxytocin, nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs, naso-oesophageal bouginage in and lavage of the spontaneously opened mural cyst and abscess. Surgical methods included oesophagomyotomy with esophagopexy in a stricture type 1, partial anastomosis with distal oesophagostomy in stricture type 3,cervical exploration of the ventral neck area with extensive debridement of devitalised tissue and distal oesophagostomy in oesophageal rupture and closure of communication between the oesophagus and the guttural pouch with distal oesophagostomy in the other case. The horse with an oesophageal rupture after long-term oesophageal obstruction and the other individual with an oesophageal diverticulum were subjected to euthanasia before the treatment was attempted due to the poor prognosis. Complications developed in 28 (71.79%) of all cases with oesophageal disorders. One complication was presented in 11 cases (28.21%), and two or more were seen in 17 (43.58%) of cases. Complications included oesophagitis (16, 41.02%), aspiration pneumonia (11, 28.20%), aspiration of food and saliva into the trachea (7, (1, 2.56%) and re-stricture (one, 2.56%). Aspiration of food and saliva into the trachea was diagnosed during oesophagoscopy. Aspiration pneumonia was de ned as the respiratory compromise together with ventral -cranial lung consolidation found during thoracic ultrasonography and/or patchy pattern or irregular soft tissue opacity on the lung elds ventral-cranially found during thoracic radiography. In the group of simple oesophageal obstruction there was no statistically signi cant correlation between the length of clinical signs before the admission and the development of aspiration pneumonia. Survival to discharge in all oesophageal cases was 79.49% (n=31/39) with 20.51% (n =8/39) that died or were subjected to euthanasia (two of them before the treatment). Short-term survival was excellent in simple oesophagealobstruction (1/2) and rupture 33.33% (1/3). The case with the diagnosis of oesophageal diverticulum was subjected to euthanasia before treatment. The patients with oesophageal cyst, abscess and communication between the oesophagus and the guttural pouch survived short term. Long-term survival data were obtained in 27 of the 31 discharged cases (range 6 -47 months, average 16.3 months). Twenty-three horses were without problems (85.19%).

Two horses (7.41%; simple intraluminal obstruction and re flux oesophagitis) were subjected to euthanasia as a consequence of the diagnoseddisorder. Long-term survival within a group of all oesophagealcases was 65.78%. Discussion The prevalence of equine oesophageal disorders in ourretrospective study was 0.56% of all cases admitted by referral to the clinic during the 5-year period. Breuer et al. (2011) published a 2.4% prevalence of equine simple oesophageal obstruction in the retrospective study of referred cases.Although simple oesophageal obstruction represented >50% of all oesophageal cases in our study, the other disorders (other than simple obstruction) constitute the greater part of the studied group in comparison with previously published results from referral clinics (Feige et al. 2000; Breuer et al. 2011). This difference could be because of a higher number of oesophageal obstructions treated in the eld, because owners could have nancial constraints and the referral horse population could vary between different countries. The breed and age distribution was similar to the general hospital population in our study. There are some oesophagealdisorders with suspected or proven breed predisposition.Duncanson (2006) and Breuer et al. (2011) suggest that pony breeds are more prone to primary oesophageal obstruction.The pony was represented by only one individual in our group,but ponies are infrequently presented to our clinic. Friesianhorses are predisposed to idiopathic megaoesophagus andthey appear to oesophagus Oosterbaan group of horses included one with idiopathic megaoesophagus and the other withpost-obstructive oesophageal stricture. Common aetiological factors were identi ed in all groups except for idiopathic megaoesophagus, oesophagealdiverticulum and communication between the oesophagusand the guttural pouch. Unfortunately, those results are lesssigni cant due to the low number of representative cases within each group other than oesophageal obstruction. Thesimple oesophageal obstruction was limited to food orshavings impaction, which is frequently described (Craiget al. 1989; Feige et al. 2000; Duncanson 2006). Interestingly, foreign bodies or inappropriate feed items were not found inour study. This differs from the study of Craig et al. (1989) and it is the reason for the absence of surgical treatment ofoesophageal obstruction in our group. Dental abnormalitieshave been shown to be important in simple oesophagealobstruction aetiology because of inadequate chewing (Craiget al. 1989; Duncanson 2006). Dental pathology data were missing in our study possibly because of a lack ofstomatological examination or incomplete medical records. Nonsurgical treatment has been attempted in all simple oesophageal obstruction cases and, apart from one, wassuccessful. General anaesthesia was considered to be helpfulin some refractory cases of oesophageal obstruction (Craiget al. 1989). The only simple obstruction nonsurvivor in our group was flushed under general anaesthesia and did not recover from it, because of cardiac arrest. The poor prognosisdue to post-anaesthetic respiratory complication was referredto by Duncanson (2006). Current recommendations are thatlavage is not attempted under general anaesthesia due to risk of signi cant complications (Duncanson 2006; Bezdekova 2012). A common human oesophageal disorder is gastro- oesophageal re flux disease with or without oesophageal inflammation. Its prevalence varies between 9 and 42% (Delaney 2004). There is some suggestion that highly prevalent equine gastric squamous ulceration is comparable to human gastro-oesophageal re flux disease due to the anatomical similarity of location of lesions dorsal to the margo plicatus , but the equine oesophagus is not always co-affected. The differences between horses and people (apart from theunique stomach anatomy) are equine physiology, different diet and lack of evidence of convincing Helicobacter infection in horses (Collier and Stoneham 1997). Although oesophagitis was the second most common condition in our study, its prevalence is low and only three out of ve presented cases had re flux aetiology. Equine re flux oesophagitis is a rare condition and it follows pyloric or duodenal stenosis and delayed gastric emptying (Rebhun et al. 1982). Oesophageal stricture occurs more often in foals (Craig et al. 1989; Chiavaccini and Hassel 2010). The number of strictures was low in our study, but two of the three cases were yearlings. Concerning the external blunt trauma in the aetiology, it could be suggested that there is a higher probability of kicks by another individual in the herd of yearlings than in mature performance horses kept separately. An excellent prognosis was recorded in surgical treatment ofmural type 1 stricture, which contains external oesophageal layers in our study. Both affected horses were treated by oesophagomyotomy with oesophagopexy described by Lillich et al. (2001) and survived long term. The anular ring case (type 3) was complicated by a re-stricture which failed to respond to balloon dilation as well as to bouginage despite treatment attempts being applied over a long period. The poor prognosis in similar cases was also reported by Craig et al. (1989). Oesophageal rupture can follow long-term obstruction, internal or external trauma (Fubini 2002; Stick 2006). In contrast to the study by Craig et al. (1989) we did not nd any nasogastric tube trauma as a cause of oesophageal rupture. That study was performed 30 years ago and the tube material and/or method of tube insertion could be different nowadays, or the rupture could happen after long-term obstruction with ischaemic necrosis of the oesophageal wall. Two of our cases were preceded by blunt neck trauma, which was also a suspected reason in a case study of Kruger and Davis (2013). One of our rupture cases survived, but it represented the longest time of hospitalisation of all our cases. Oesophageal perforation was the only condition complicated by cellulitis and/or mediastinitis because of perioesophageal tissue contamination by food, water, air and saliva, which may migrate to the mediastinum and pleural space through fascial planes (Freeman 1989). False oesophageal diverticulum was identi ed only once in our study and it was located in the neck. In this case, the mucosal damage was thought to be due to chronic food impaction in the diverticulum lumen was found, similar to other published cases (Craig et al. 1989; Breuer et al. 2011). Feige et al. (2000) and Breuer et al. (2011) described poor prognosis in three oesophageal diverticulum cases, but Craiget al. (1989) found better follow-up in surgically as well as nonsurgically managed diverticula. The horse in our study \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd97 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2018presented its clinical signs for 2 years and it was subjected to euthanasia because of uncertain prognosis. The earlier the surgical intervention is applied, the better prognosis could be expected because of numerous soft tissue adhesions (Craig et al. 1989). Oesophageal mural abscess was con rmed to be caused by Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus and we suspected that it could be a result of metastaticstreptococcal infection. The abscess responded to nonsurgical treatment because it opened spontaneously. The communication between the oesophagus and the guttural pouch was an exceptional case of an acquired condition in a mature horse, which has not been described before. Clinical signs of nonpainful parotid region swelling due to the dilated guttural pouch were noted for 10 months. The abnormal guttural pouch contents caused nasopharyngeal arch deviation that precluded endoscopic examination. To obtain full visualisation of the guttural pouch and its communication with the oesophagus, an external surgical opening of the guttural pouch was required and the food was removed from the affected structures ( Figs 4 and 5). Previous studies on oesophageal disorders reported that aspiration pneumonia is the most frequent complication after oesophageal obstruction and the most frequent cause of patient mortality (Craig et al. 1989; Chiavaccini and Hassel 2010). Aspiration pneumonia was the second most common complication in our study. Its prevalence is lower compared with previous published results (Craig et al. 1989). All except one case in the group of aspiration pneumonias sufferedfrom a simple oesophageal obstruction. A positive correlationbetween the duration of oesophageal obstruction beforetreatment and development of aspiration pneumonia waspreviously reported (Feige et al. 2000), but these data were not available in our group of patients. Aspiration pneumonia was distinguished from aspiration of food and saliva into the trachea without the development of ventral -cranial lung lobe opacity seen on thoracic radiograph and/or lung tissueconsolidation seen on thoracic ultrasound and the alterationof respiratory pattern. Feige et al. (2000) found that the extent of tracheal contamination is not associated with subsequent development of aspiration pneumonia. The duration of oesophageal obstruction before admission was a signi cant risk factor for aspiration pneumonia, because thelonger the duration of the obstruction, the longer the dysphagia and consequently the risk of tracheal con- tamination (Feige et al. 2000; Chiavaccini and Hassel 2010). Some of the oesophageal disorders in our group lasted for a long period without the development of aspiration pneumonia. The most common complication found in our study was oesophagitis and it typically followed intraluminal obstruction. The degree of oesophageal damage has been strongly associated with the development of other complications, particularly oesophageal stricture, and an endoscopic examination of the oesophagus after a chronic oesophageal obstruction is strongly recommended (Chiavaccini and Hassel 2010). In conclusion, the most common equine oesophageal disorder with excellent prognosis was simple oesophageal obstruction which represented half of the cases in our study. The rest of the cases included different conditions with relatively low numbers of cases. Morphological abnormalities showed a good outcome when treated surgically. Our study represents the rst descriptive analysis of oesophageal disorders in horses at a referral clinic in the Czech Republic, but because of the high number of different disorders, further study on more cases could be helpful in the future.

Barr Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital, in the neonatal and suckling foal. In certain circumstances supplemental nutrition is necessary depending on the age of foal, severity of diarrhoea and presence of other systemic manifestations. Nutritional supplementation can be provided either enterally or parenterally. Enteral nutrition is superior to parenteral nutrition because it is the most natural and physiologically sound means to provide nutritional support. Parenteral nutrition may be warranted if the foal is unable to receive or tolerate enteral nutrition. Dextrose alone or with amino acids and lipids can provide appropriate nutrition when enteral feeding is not tolerated. As soon as the foal stabilises enteral feeding can be reintroduced. Introduction Diarrhoea is a common problem in the foal. Importantaspects of treatment included maintaining hydration, proper electrolyte balance and other supportive measures. In certain circumstances nutritional supplementation is necessary. A neonatal foal with diarrhoea that has stopped nursing or has secondary gastrointestinal problems such as ileus or abdominal distension will require nutritional supplementation. Suckling foals may not require supplementation as soon as the neonate. Nutritional supplementation can be provided by the enteral or parenteral route. Enteral nutrition is superior to parenteral nutrition because it is the most natural and physiologically sound means to provide nutritional support. Parenteral nutrition may be warranted if the foal is unable to receive or tolerate enteral nutrition. Carbohydrate solutions administered continuously or as an addition to bolus fluids is the simplest means of providing extra calories to a foal withdiarrhoea. Amino acids and lipids can be added to providea source of protein and additional calories. Mixtures ofdextrose, amino acids and lipids must be administered at aconstant rate infusion. The blood glucose must be closelymonitored because many foals with diarrhoea are septic andintolerant of dextrose supplementation. As soon as the foalstabilises enteral feeding can be reintroduced. Mare 's milk is the preferred source of enteral nutrition because it is highlydigestible and provides the correct balance of nutrients. Foal diarrhoea Diarrhoea is a common problem in the foal and a largemajority of foals will have at least one episode of diarrhoea in the rst 6 months of life (Urquhart 1981). There are numerous infectious and noninfectious causes of diarrhoea in the foal. Infectious causes include bacterial, viral, most commonly associated with infectious diarrhoea in the foal. Other less common spp., Cryptosporidium parvum and Frederick et al. (2009) reported that foals less than 1 month of age are more likely to have diarrhoea due to Clostridium perfringens or undetermined aetiology, whereas foals greater than 1 month of age are more likely to have rotavirus, Salmonella sp. or parasites as causative agents (Frederick et al. 2009). Coinfection between infectious agents has recently been documented as being more prevalent than initially thought and may contribute to the severity of the gastrointestinal disorder. These observations were based on molecular-basedtesting comparing foals with diarrhoea to healthy foals. Coinfections with viral and protazoal organisms were more frequently identi ed in foals with diarrhea (Slovis et al. 2014). Possible noninfectious causes of diarrhoea include foal heat diarrhoea, dietary intolerance, ingestion of sand, asphyxia- associated gastroenteropathies and gastroduodenal ulceration. In the majority of cases diarrhoea is mild and medical treatment may not be necessary. In other cases, the diarrhoea is severe with accompanying clinical signs of sepsis, septic shock and other systemic manifestations. The most important factor in the treatment of a foal with diarrhoea is maintaining hydration and electrolyte balance. In mild cases of diarrhoea, hydration may be maintained by nursing or administration of oral fluids. Severely affected foals and neonatal foals will often require administration of intravenous (i.v.) fluids and have severe electrolyte derangements which require additional i.v. or oral supplementation of bicarbonate, sodium or potassium. Plasma or synthetic colloids are useful for increasing oncotic pressure and maintaining circulatory volume in foals with hypoproteinaemia. Antimicrobial therapy is necessary in neonatal foals and foals with diarrhoea accompanied by signs of septicaemia. Commonly used antimicrobials include a combination of a beta-lactam and an aminoglycoside or a third generation cephalosporin. Any foal receiving an aminoglycoside should have its renal status closely monitored. If a Clostridial organism is suspected, metronidazole can be added to the treatment. There are many gastrointestinal protectants and absorbents that can be administered to a foal with diarrhoea. Activated charcoal and di-tri-octahedral smectite are absorbants that can bind endotoxin and reduce its absorption. Studies have shown that di-tri-octahedral smectite can foals with severe diarrhoea prophylactic use of antiulcer medications may be warranted. result in lactase de ciency secondary to the loss of small intestinal brush border, supplementation with lactase enzymemay be bene cial in these patients et 1999). Probiotic administration in foals with diarrhoea has becomepopular although documentation supporting ef cacy is lacking. Nutritional support Nutritional needs of the foal with diarrhoea depend onseveral factors including the severity of the diarrhoea, age of the foal, causative agent of the diarrhoea and if there are other systemic factors involved. Foals with mild transientdiarrhoea will continue to nurse and be able to maintain proper caloric intake. A neonatal foal with diarrhoea that stops nursing may require nutritional intervention sooner than a suckling foal due to the limitation of body reserves. The presence of other gastrointestinal abnormalities such as ileus or abdominal distention may warrant extra nutrition because the foal is unable to nurse. Foals with profuse watery diarrhoea due to osmotic diarrhoea often suffer from gas accumulation and abdominal distension. In the neonatal foal diarrhoea can be secondary to asphyxia-related gut injuries resulting in mucosal injury and milk intolerance. Failure to provide adequate nutritional support may also have substantial negative in fluence on the immune response. Nutritional management of the foal with diarrhoea varies from clinic to clinic. Some practices will completely restrict milk intake of a foal hospitalised with diarrhoea whereas others will allow the foal to continue to nurse. Management of the foal with diarrhoea on the farm often does not allow for restriction of nursing. The effects of these different management practices on morbidity and mortality and long- term outcome are unknown. Prior to developing a nutritional plan the foal must be triaged and stabilised. Gastrointestinal motility is usually poor if the foal is clinically dehydrated or in shock. Every effort must be made to correct electrolyte, acid-base and hydration status of the case then a nutritional plan can be developed. Fluids containing dextrose should not be used for initial fluid resuscitation because excessive amounts of dextrose can result in profound hyperglycaemia, although in foals with longstanding diarrhoea or secondary septicaemia, hypoglycaemia is common and some dextrose is required in the initial resuscitation fluid. In these cases 0.25 -0.5 ml/kg bwt of a 50% dextrose solution added to the resuscitation fluids is bene cial. Once the foal has been stabilised attention can be given to determining if there is a need for nutritional support and the best way to go about providing the nutritional support. Neonatal foals that stop nursing or have secondary gastrointestinal problems should be supplemented because of limited energy reserves in the form of glycogen and fat. Profound hypoglycaemia can occur in the neonatal foal if deprived of energy intake even for a few hours (McKenzie and Geor 2009). Suckling foals that stop nursing and are in good body condition may not require supplementation as soon as the neonate, but even after 24 -36 h of inappetence bene t from extra calories. The nutritional requirements of a foal with diarrhoea have not been determined. Recommendations are generally based on data from healthy foals. It has been estimated that a healthy neonatal foal 's energy requirement is about 120 -150 kcal/kg bwt/day (502 -628 kJ/kg bwt/day)(Martin et al. 1992). In a recent report the resting energy requirements in critically ill neonatal foals was documented to be approximately 50 kcal/kg bwt/day (210 kJ/kg bwt/day), which is about one-third the energy requirements for growing, active normal foals (Jose-Cunilleras et al. 2012). Interestingly, this study also noted that surviving critically ill neonatal foals resting energy requirements normalised to healthy neonatal foal values prior to discharge from the hospital. The energy requirements of a healthy suckling foal are estimated to be 120 kcal/kg bwt/day (502 kJ/kg bwt/day) at 3 weeks -100 kcal/kg bwt/day (335 -418 kJ/kg bwt/day) at 1 weaning (Ousey et al. 1996, 1997). Nutritional supplementation can be provided either enterally or parenterally. The best and most natural is the enteral route, although certain circumstances warrant the parenteral route. Parenteral nutrition Parenteral nutrition is indicated for foals with poor gastrointestinal function and intolerance to enteral feeding. The goal of parenteral nutrition is to provide enough nutritional support to avoid energy depletion during a phase of the disease in which enteral nutrition is not an option or provide supplemental nutrition when full enteral nutrition cannot be tolerated. Carbohydrates and lipids are the primary sources of energy used in parenteral nutrition solutions, whereas amino acids are added to meet protein requirements. Carbohydrate-containing fluids solutions represent the simplest means of providing i.v. nutrition to foals. Supplying energy in the form of dextrose decreases the need for catabolism, which allows the foal 's metabolic energy to be focused on recovery and not on support. The caloric content of a 50% dextrose solution is 1.7 kcal/g (7.1 kJ/g). Carbohydrate-containing solutions can be administered for a short period in the younger foal (24 -48 h) and longer in the older foal (3 days) because dextrose-containing fluids are an incomplete nutritional source. The most common solution is a product containing 5% dextrose, which is available in several options including 5% dextrose in water, lactated Ringer 5% dextrose. Alternatively, one can compound a dextrose solution by adding 50% dextrose (500 mg of dextrose/ml) to an isotonic polyionic fluid used for routine fluid support. Although the solution is hypertonic, it can be tolerated for a short termadministered at a constant rate infusion. Dextrose in 5% water is not a good choice as a maintenance solution because of the absence of electrolytes and is primarily useful in providing free water to patients suffering from hyperosmolar conditions. A total of 50% dextrose solution can be administered without dilution using an infusion pump, as long as additional isotonic fluids are being administered concurrently to meet the hydration needs of the case and to avoid endothelial injury caused by the hypertonic nature of this solution. The primary fluid needs of the case can be met with the isotonic fluids and it will be easier to adjust the fluid rate in response to hydration needs without affecting their nutritional needs. At birth the stimulated fetal liver produces 4 -8 mg/kg bwt/min of glucose, thus this is the appropriate rate of the dextrose containing fluids for the neonate, although the really septic neonate may require more (Silver and Comline 1976). The rate similar to an adult, 0.5 -2 mg/kg bwt/min, is appropriate for the VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2018(see Table 1 for an example calculation of dextrose supplementation). After 24 -48 h of dextrose-containing fluids, the nutritional plan should be revisited to determine whether the foal can tolerate enteral nutrition. In addition to vital parameters and hydration status the presence or absence of gastrointestinal motility, frequency of faecal output and consistency of faeces should be taken into consideration in the assessment. If continued parenteral nutrition is required a more complete solution that contains amino acids and possible lipids should be administered. Since the metabolic response to injury and sepsis is the increased protein degradation in muscle tissue, the addition of a protein source reduces this catabolic response. Protein supplementation provides essential and nonessential amino acids. The most commonly used protein solutions provide approximately 4.0 kcal/g (16.7 kJ/g) of protein. A commercially premixed standardised combination of a 50% dextrose solution and 8.5% amino acid solution is available and has been utilised in the author 's practice. Another option is to purchase the solutions separately and aseptically mix in a sterile parenteral nutrition bag. The following formula is well tolerated by the foal: 1500 ml 50% dextrose and 1500 ml 8.5% amino acids. The caloric density of this solution is 1.02 kcal/ml (4.27 kJ/ml). Because the combination of dextrose and amino acids is hypertonic and potentially harsh on the vein, the solution should be diluted in an isotonic solution or sterile water for administration. The greatest bene t to the addition of lipids is providing more calories than just dextrose or dextrose and amino acids. Lipid emulsions contain primarily long-chain triglycerides and provide a concentrated source of calories at 9 -11 kcal/g (38-46 kJ/g). Another bene t is that lipid emulsions are isotonic and help reduce total osmolarity when added to glucose and amino acid mixtures. Critical illness may result in protein catabolism and muscle wasting as a result of the release of cytokines and catabolic hormones. Thus it is important to provide at least 100 -200 nonprotein calories (carbohydrate and lipids) per gram of nitrogen in the parenteral nutrition formula to avoid the use of amino acids for energy (Hansen 1990). Solutions composed of 10 g/kg bwt/day of dextrose, 2 g/ kg bwt/day of amino acids and 1 g/kg bwt/day of lipids are well tolerated by the foal. The volume of each nutrient is calculated based on the proportion of energy derived from dextrose and lipids as well as the grams of protein that the foal requires. Once the nal volume is determined, an hourly infusion rate is calculated by dividing the total volume in millilitres by 24 h. Several basic formulas have been described for use in the foal and can easily be prepared using aseptic technique ( Table 2 ). Premade mixtures of i.v. multivitamins can be added to parenteral nutrition. These products contain the fat soluble vitamins A, D and E, which are solubilised in anaqueous medium, permitting i.v. administration. The B complex vitamins including thiamine, folic acid, pantothenic acid and niacin are also found in these commercial vitamin products. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a component of thiamine pyrophosphate and is an essential cofactor in carbohydrate metabolism. Vitamin B complex can be added directly to the parenteral nutrition solution. Supplemental electrolytes can be added the maintenance crystalloid fluids. Parenteral nutrition can safely be administered by an i.v. catheter placed aseptically in the jugular vein although proper catheter management is extremely important. The solutions used for parenteral nutrition are hypertonic and can cause injury to the vascular endothelium resulting in phlebitis or thrombosis. Multi-lumen catheters allow for one lumen to be dedicated to infusion of the solution thus minimising the risks of contamination. Parenteral nutrition should be delivered at a constant rate using an infusion pump to avoid fluctuations in glucose delivery and metabolic complications and the actual volume of parenteral nutrition delivered to the case should be carefully monitored and recorded. Parenteral nutrition administration should be started at one quarter of the target rate. This is to allow for insulin and other physiological parameters to adapt to the solution. The rate should then be gradually increased every 4 -6 h, depending on the blood glucose values, until the target rate is reached (see Table 3 for example calculation of TPN). In the early stage of parenteral nutritional therapy the foal must be frequently monitored. In addition to the physical examinationand vital signs, blood glucose concentrations should be monitored. Initially the blood glucose concentration should be monitored every 2 -4 h until the patient is at the target rate of parenteral nutrition then the frequency can be decreased. Blood glucose should be maintained between 5.0-10.0 mmol/l. The frequency of monitoring blood glucose concentration depends on the age and stability of the patient with the very critically ill neonatal foal often requiring more frequent monitoring. Urine output should be monitored constantly with intermittent monitoring of urine glucose. In some cases glucosuria and diuresis are observed when blood glucose levels exceed 10 mmol/l indicating the administration rate should be adjusted. Some critically ill foals, usually TABLE 1: Example calculaton of dextrose supplementation total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for the foal Composition Caloric density 900 ml of 50% dextrose 1400 ml 8.5% amino acids 1.19 kcal/ml (4.98 kJ/ml)900 20% lipids 1500 ml 50% amino acids 1.08 kcal/ml (4.52 kJ/ml)500 ml 20% lipids TABLE 3: Example calculation total FEBRUARY 2018neonatal foals, are intolerant of even a conservative rate of dextrose because of insulin resistance. Foals with persistently increased values, above 10 -11 mmol/l for greater than 4 -6h , may bene t from exogenous insulin therapy. It has been described that hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia are common in critically ill foals and oftentimes are associated with poor outcome thus signi cant variations in blood glucose should be avoided (Krause and McKenzie 2007; Hollis et al. 2008a,b). Sepsis has been documented in 50% of foals less than 30 days of age with diarrhoea (Hollis et al. 2008a,b). Since clearance of lipids can be impaired with Gram-negative sepsis monitoring the serum triglyceride value is important. Triglyceride concentrations of >2.3 mmol/l were associated with nonsurvival in both man and foals receiving i.v. nutrition (Heyland et al. 1998; Myers et al. 2009). Thus lipid administration should be discontinued if the triglyceride value is persistently elevated. Since electrolyte abnormalities are a common occurrence in patients with diarrhoea, frequent monitoring of electrolytes should be performed. Hypokalaemia is common in foals receiving i.v. nutrition because glucose and insulin administration reduce extracellular potassium concen trations. Metabolic acidosis can occur due to gastrointestinal loss of bicarbonate ions. In certain instances a constant rate of infusion of fluids and parenteral nutrition is not feasible and fluids will need to be bolused. Depending on the foal and severity of the diarrhoea the fluids can be administered every 2 -6 h over a period of 30 min. Once the foal has been stabilised, the amount of fluids to administer at each bolus can be calculated by estimating the total volume the foal would receive in a 24 h period and dividing by the frequency of administration. Fluid therapy for a foal with diarrhoea typically consists of maintenance rate combined with an estimate of ongoing losses. The volume will need to be changed daily as the foal 's condition improves or worsens. In this instance to provide extra calories, dextrose can be added to the fluids. In order to prevent signi cant hyperglycaemia, a 1 -2.5% dextrose solution in isotonic polyionic fluids can be administered slowly over a period of 20 -30 min. Based on this author 's experience, this amount of dextrose will not result in signi cant hyperglycaemia. Enteral nutrition Results from numerous animal and human studies support that enteral nutrition is superior to parenteral nutrition. Food in the gastrointestinal tract has an important role in preserving normal physiology, especially related to immune function and systemic in flammation. Animal models have demonstrated that enteral nutrition lowers the risk of infection by preserving the gastrointestinal tract integrity and enhancing its ability to provide an immunocompetent barrier to prevent invasion by pathogenic microorganisms. Rats fed enterally demonstrated better lymphocyte function and better survival when subjected to bacterial challenge than those receiving only total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (Birkhahn and Renk 1984). The intestinal barrier is maintained by the enterocytes which play a major role in digestion and immunological protection. Enterocytes are responsible for brush border digestion and absorption of nutrients. Virtually all nutrients enter the body by crossing the enterocytes by active transport or diffusion. Amino acids, speci cally glutamine, are the enterocytes mainsource of fuel, but glucose and fatty acids can also be utilised by enterocytes. Enterocytes, which are joined together by tight junctions, also provide a barrier against microbial translocation across the bowel wall into the systemic circulation (Alverdy 1994). Enterocytes constitute more than a physical barrier against foreign substances from the gut as they are capable of reacting to the heavy antigenic load of the gastrointestinal tract. Through their direct receptors, antimicrobial peptides and regulatory cytokines enterocytes are true immune competent cells (Alverdy 1994). Enterocytes can take up and process antigens which are then presented directly to T cells (Snoeck et al. 2005). Production of secretory IgA, the principle immunoglobulin in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, is influenced by enterocytes (Miron and Cristea 2012). Rats fed enterally maintained secretory IgG levels better than rats fed the same nutrients i.v. (Alverdy et al. 1985). Studies have shown that after just a few days of complete bowel rest, progressive atrophy of the intestinal tract occurs. There is loss of villi, decreased disaccharide activity, malabsorption of sugars, decreased absorption and disruption of barrier protective functions (Johnson 1988; Mainous and Deitch 1994). The lack of food produces a state of'luminal starvation 'that adversely affects the enterocytes (Strodtbeck 2003). The consequences of enterocyte starvation are characterised by intestinal mucosal atrophy, decreased absorption of nutrients, loss of tight junctions between enterocytes and impaired immune functions(Johnson 1988; Mainous and Deitch 1994). The risk for translocation of bacteria is increased due to loss of gut integrity. Rats fed only parenteral nutrition for 2 weeks had a 66% incidence of positive cultures in mesenteric lymph nodes whereas those fed enterally had no evidence of bacterial translocation (Alverdy et al. 1988). Translocation of bacteria across the gastrointestinal mucosa has been documented during periods of bowel rest in intensive care patients. Enteral nutrition helps to maintain the functional integrity of the bowel, prevent translocation of bacteria and subsequent sepsis. Therefore, even if the gastrointestinal tract cannot be used to meet complete needs, small amounts of enteral feeding may be helpful. Numerous studies with preterm human infants have documented the bene cial outcomes of minimal enteral feedings. These studies noted decreased hospitalisation, faster transition to complete oral feedings, fewer infants with feeding intolerance and a reduction in sepsis (Berseth 1992; Dallas et al. 1998; Shulman et al. 1998). In mice an experimental study noted that small amounts of enteral nutrition paired with parenteral nutrition prevented and reversed some of the changes in the gastrointestinal mucosa that are typically noted with lack of enteral nutrition (Ikezawa et al. 2008). It has been well documented that fresh mare 's milk is the preferred source of enteral nutrition in the neonatal foal. Advantages of this source of enteral feeding include physiological stimulation leading to normal metabolic regulation, preservation of gastrointestinal mucosa integrity and important trophic substances (including epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factors) which stimulate normal growth and development. If fresh mare 's milk is not available, frozen mare 's milk is the next best alternative followed by milk replacer. Milk from another species can beused if there are no other options. Goat 's milk is higher in fat, total solids and gross energy than mare 's milk and easier to \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd103 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2018digest than cow 's milk. Most foals will accept a goat milk diet and exhibit satisfactory growth. A normal, healthy neonatal foal consumes roughly 15% of bodyweight as milk in the rst 24 h. By 5 weeks of age foals spend more than 20% of their time grazing or eating nonmilk foods (McKenzie and Geor 2009). As the foal matures the capacity for bre digestion increases and by 6 months of age the foal is receiving less than 30% of the total nutritional requirement in the form of milk. Foals are born without bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, but colonisation begins rapidly with a mature microbial community present by the sixth week of life (Earing et al. 2012). Overall, the timeline of the microbial establishment of the gastrointestinal tract is consistent with the time at which plant-based feeds become important in the diet of the foal. As hindgut function increases a shift in the primary energy substrate also occurs from ingested carbohydrates absorbed in the small intestine to volatile fatty acids produced by fermentation that are absorbed from the large intestines. Physiologically the best route for providing milk is by normal suckling. Other methods utilised to provide milk include bottle or bowl feeding or feeding through a nasogastric tube. Placement of a small diameter indwelling nasogastric tube is well tolerated by foals. Small volumes of milk should be started and if tolerated, the volume gradually increased over several days. Ideally, the foal should be fed at least every 2 h. A good starting point is 5% of bodyweight for the rst 24 h. If this volume is well tolerated then the volume can be increased until thefoal is able or willing to nurse. In any case care must be taken to provide enough calories and protein so parenteral supplementation will be needed to make up the difference between what can be given by the enteral route and what is required. Suckling foals might prefer to eat hay instead of nurse. The addition of forage to the diet provides energy in the form of volatile fatty acids, maintains colonocyte health by the generation of butyric acid and may decrease faecal water volume (Lawrence and Lawrence 2009). In a majority of the cases preference for hay over milk is only temporary and the foal will resume nursing within 24 h. If a foal completely refuses to nurse or eat and has no additional gastrointestinal problems that would prevent the foal from nursing or eating, an indwelling nasogastric tube can be placed for supplementation. Milk can be administered in the younger foal (less than 1 month of age) and a slurry of pelleted balanced creep/foal feed to the older suckling foal. This pelleted feed would need to be ground with the addition of water, a balanced electrolyte solution or milk to form a slurry in a consistency that will go down a tube. The amount of foal feed to supplement per day is generally one pound (0.45 kg) of feed per month of age or as listed on the feed bag. This should be divided into several feeds and the foal closely monitored for complications. Possible complications include overfeeding resulting in gastric distension and colic, worsening of diarrhoea, oesophageal irritation or aspiration pneumonia. Additional fluids i.v. or orally may need to be administered based on the foal 's hydration status and severity of diarrhoea. It is unlikely that supplementation by nasogastric tube will be needed because most foals will continue to consume some type of enteral nutrition on their own. Based on the above information, foals with diarrhoea and no additional gastrointestinal abnormalities should be allowedto continue to nurse or eat hay with supplemental i.v. fluids if needed. Foals with severe abdominal distention, ileus, septicshock or colic will bene t from a brief period of feed restriction. The addition of parenteral nutrition will depend on the age of the foal and length of time it will be restricted from enteral nutrition. As soon as the foal 's gastrointestinal function stabilises enteral feeding should be reintroduced. This introduction can be intermittent allowance to nurse or, in the case of an older foal, the addition of handfuls of hay. The introduction period should be short, for instance every 2-4 h provide an enteral form of nutrition with the nal goal of return to full feed/milk in 24 -36 h. If the foal is receiving parenteral nutrition the rate can be decreased by half then discontinued once the foal is back to full enteral nutrition. It is important to assess the response to nutritional support. The ideal way would be daily weight on a walk-on scale, but this is impractical because of the expense of a walk-on scaleand risk of contamination of the scale with an infectious agent. Similar to adults the body scoring system established by Henneke and others (1983) can be used to give a general idea if body condition is being lost or maintained. This system is based on visual appraisal and body palpation of 6 areas including along the neck, withers, topline, tailhead, ribs and behind the shoulder (Henneke et al. 1983). The foal 's ideal body condition score is between 5 and 7. Daily monitoring of these parameters will serve as a guide to determine if the nutritional plan is appropriate. Trends in either direction, but most importantly evidence of body condition loss, can help one determine if a modi cation of the nutritional plan is required.

Austin Department of Veterinary Clinical Medicine, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, USA. Corresponding author email: smaustin@illinois.edu Keywords: horse; neonatal; foal; treatment Summary The ambulatory practitioner is usually the rst to evaluate the equine neonate and must assess the foal and determine its health status. If one or more abnormalities are identi ed, the practitioner must initiate appropriate treatment and determine whether the foal can be managed successfully on the farm or referred to a specialty centre. This article describes the basic requirements that should be met and the limitations involved in treating compromised neonates on the farm. Treatments for common foal disorders are discussed. Introduction Clinical assessment of neonatal foals is a routine task of the ambulatory equine practitioner. If one or more abnormalities are detected during the initial examination, then the practitioner must decide if the foal should be treated on the farm or referred to a hospital for more intensive care. Factors involved in this decision include severity of the illness, value ofthe foal, resources of the owner, and availability of specialty services in the area. If the foal remains on the farm for treatment, the practitioner must evaluate the environment, determine the personnel needed to administer care, address the nutritional and fluid needs of the foal, collect appropriate laboratory samples, and then administer therapy to address the speci c abnormalities that are present. Regardless of whether a foal is to remain on the farm or be referred, the examining practitioner needs to decide what immediate treatment is necessary. General nursing care Environment If referral of the foal is not necessary or not available, the practitioner must make recommendations regarding the proper treatment environment. Housing should be clean, dry, draught-free, warm, and provide a nonslippery footing with adequate padding. The newborn foal is wet, has a large surface to mass ratio, and limited energy reserves so it can become chilled at low environmental temperatures. Also, sick foals have impaired thermoregulation and do better if environmental temperatures are not cold (Ousey et al. 1992; Morresey 2014). Foals should be dried-off as soon as possible and supplemental heating should be provided. In unheated barns, space-heaters or heat lamps may improve thetreatment environment. Care should be taken to avoid re hazards because of the flammable nature of bedding and other environmental objects. The heat lamp should be at least ve feet above the foal as the foal 's skin is thin andsusceptible to thermal injury. Air blankets (Bair Hugger) 1 provide an effective way to warm hypothermic foals safely, but care should be used to keep the warming unit away from flammable materials. Recumbent foals need clean bedding and good insulation from the ground. Large bean bags are relatively inexpensive and can be used to create a foal bed. Pillows can be used to prop the foal into a sternal position which aids respiratory function. Recumbent foals need to be turned side-to-side at least every 2 h. Disposable incontinence pads can be used to collect urine and should be changed frequently. All wet skin should be dried and zinc oxide ointment may be used to protect vulnerable areas. Down foals are at increased risk for corneal ulcers and arti cial tears may be applied every 6 -12 h. Fluorescein staining of the cornea should be performed at least once daily. Many sick foals will require a constant attendant to protect the foal and facilitate treatment. The lack of trained personnel is one of the greatest challenges to managing sick neonates in the eld. Instructions to attendants should be in writing and cover speci c parameters requiring further evaluation by the veterinarian. The veterinarian and owner should discuss the limitations of monitoring imposed by continuing care on the farm and agree upon the frequency of veterinary evaluation of the patient. Point-of-care devicescan provide stall side information about lactate, serum amyloid A and glucose levels that aid treatment decisions, but haematology, blood gas analysis and biochemistry proles will not be immediately available (Austin 2013). Ongoing laboratory evaluation will need to be performed frequently until the foal is stable, but treatment decisions must either occur without the bene t of immediate laboratory support or be delayed until laboratory work is available. Venous access is an essential component of on-the-farm care. Te flon and polyurethane catheters are commonly used in veterinary practice. Te flon catheters tend to be more rigid and easier to insert but pose an increased risk of thrombophlebitis and sepsis compared with polyurethane catheters (Hunter 1989; Smith 1996). Polyurethane catheters are flexible and are recommended for use in foals. Over-the- needle catheters are less expensive and easier to insert, but over-the-wire catheters last longer, are easier to maintain, and have fewer complications than other types of catheters. Flow rate is inversely proportional to catheter length, so shorter catheters should be chosen if a rapid bolus of fluids is the treatment objective. For longer-term venous access, the longest catheter suited for the insertion site is recommended especially if medications are potentially irritating to the vein (Tan et al. 2003). \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd106 10.1111/eve.12584Nutrition Neonates are born with limited energy reserves and rely on the ingestion of colostrum both for energy and the passive transfer of antibodies. Failure to nurse can lead to hypoglycaemia, dehydration, declining body temperature and depression that can contribute to the lack of suckle response and udder seeking behaviour. The normal foal nurses 5 -7 times per hour, in bouts of about 2 min each. If this activity is interrupted or does not occur, the foal can rapidly become weak and fail to nurse in as little as 2 -4 h after birth. Mare behaviour can be a contributing factor, as nervous or maiden mares may not allow nursing. The practitioner 'srst goal is to determine if the foal can achieve adequate nutritional intake and, if not, what can be done to address the lack of nutritional intake. Foals with weak suckle response may require nutritional supplementation of milk or milk replacer. To ensure that the correct amounts of milk are delivered, an in-dwelling naso-oesophageal tube can be used. The correct positioning of the tube in the oesophagus must be con rmed prior to the administration of milk. Endoscopy and radiography have been recommended, but the author has found the palpation of the tube above the trachea to be a reliable method of determining correct placement of the tube. Small-bore tubes can remain in the stomach or be retracted into the distal oesophagus. The advantage to leaving the tube in the stomach is the tube can be used to check for re flux before each feeding without the need to reposition the tube. The disadvantage of leaving the tube in the stomach is the risk of milk tracking out of the stomach. The small diameter, commercially available tubes (Nasogastric feeding tube with stylet)2minimise the risk of reflux if left in the stomach (Buechner-Maxwell 2012). The position of the tube at the nostril should be marked, and thetube securely attached to the nostril. To prevent kinking, the tube may either be taped to a tongue depressor or inserted through the provided nose piece and taped to the muzzle of the foal as an effective method to secure the tube. Care must be taken to ensure the foal can open its mouth sufciently to nurse. In ambulatory practice, small feeding tubes have proven invaluable for foals that need supplemental nutrition and are easy to use by farm personnel with minimal training. A laminated instruction sheet with explicit feeding directions should be provided ( Table 1 ). Cleanliness should be emphasised to personnel so as not to overburden the foal 's gastrointestinal tract with bacteria. The mare should be milked every 2 -4 h, and the milk should be ltered through gauze prior to being administered. Excess milk should be refrigerated or discarded if production exceeds needs of the foal. Refrigerated milk will need to be warmed before administration, and all supplies should be thoroughly cleanedbetween feedings. Reduced milk production or letdown is common in mares hospitalised with sick foals and can be managed with domperidone (1.1 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h) or oxytocin (1 -3 iu/450 kg bwt i.v.), respectively. Normal foals usually consume up to 25% of their bodyweight as milk; however, recent studies would suggest that requirements for sick neonates may be reduced by 50% (Paradis 2001). Overfeeding increases the risk of hyperglycaemia, hypercapnia and azotaemia (Klein et al. 1998). Enteral nutrition is the preferred method of nutritional support, and the enterocytes require local nutrition for normal development even in foals that do not toleratesigni cant amounts of enteral feeding (Rothman et al. 1985). If nutritional supplementation is necessary, it is best to start by giving about 5 -7% of bodyweight the rst day divided into 12 equal feedings. Once the foal is more stable, theamount of milk or milk replacer may be gradually increased. Current estimates suggest that administration of 10% of bodyweight as milk or milk replacer is suf cient to meet the energy need of the sick neonate (Buechner- Maxwell 2012). Because gastric motility can be reduced or absent in ill foals, the caregiver and clinician must monitor for ileus and bloating. Abdominal distention can be monitored by repeated measurement at a marked location, and ultrasonography can be used to assess intestinal motility. If bloating is accompanied by abdominal pain or re flux, the foal should be assessed by the veterinarian, and the indwelling tube should be removed and replaced by a tube of suf cient diameter to remove accumulated re flux. Feeding should be discontinued until bloating resolves. Faecal consistency of foals receiving milk replacer should be carefully monitored as constipation or diarrhoea may occur. If constipation is evident, hydration status should be reassessed and increased fluid administration considered. Foal attendants should be instructed to record frequency of urination, in addition to catching periodic samples to assess hydration status. Urine speci c gravity <1.012 is evidence of adequate hydration, which can be checked by the veterinarian using a refractometer. Diarrhoea may point to sepsis, concurrent bacterial or viral disease, increased bacterial contamination during feeding, or too concentrated milk replacer formulation and should prompt careful evaluation of the foal. Most foals that require nutritional support in the eld show a positive response after 1 -2 days and resume suckling or learn to bucket feed. Foals that are not taking in adequate nutrition are at risk of developing dehydration and hypoglycaemia. These factors must be addressed withintravenous fluid therapy. Foals that are ill enough to require more prolonged nutritional support frequently are intolerant of enteral feeding and require more intensive care than can easily be delivered in the eld.TABLE 1: Instructions for maintaining indwelling feeding tube 1 The foal must be standing or in sternal position with the head at a level above the stomach before feeding. 2 Measure the size of the abdomen. If abdomen is enlarging over 3 consecutive feeding without signs of abdominaldiscomfort, give half of indicated feeding and recheck in2h . 3 Check tube position. A mark was made on the tube adjacent to the nostril. If the mark has moved away from the nostril,do not administer anything through the tube and call yourveterinarian. 4 Wipe off the end of the tube with alcohol, uncap tube, clear tube with a small amount of air, and apply gentle suctionwith syringe. If >40 ml of re flux is obtained, delay next feeding for 1 -2h . 5 Flush tube with 20 ml of water. If tube is patent and patient is comfortable proceed to feeding. 6 All milk must be given by gravity flow. 7 After feeding, flush tube with 20 -30 ml of water. 8 Use 20 ml of air to remove fluid from tube, clean and dry tube end, and cap tube. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd107 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2018Fluid therapy Fluid therapy may be required to treat both hypovolaemia and dehydration. Hypovolaemic foals demonstrate tacky mucous membranes, tenting, prolonged capillary re ll time, decreased mentation, and cool extremities. Decreased frequency of urination is present, but may be missed by inexperienced personnel. Correction of hypovolaemia is best accomplished by boluses of fluids at 20 mg/kg bwt. The foal is assessed after fluid administration, and bolus fluids should be repeated every 20 min until the signs of hypovolaemia or a total of four boluses have been administered. If fluids alone do not correct hypovolaemia, more intensive therapy is likely to be needed, and the foal should be referred (Palmer 2004). Many sick foals are hypoglycaemic when rst examined by the ambulatory practitioner because of limited energy reserves and decreased nursing. Correction of hypoglycaemia can be life- saving. If bolus fluids are needed, they should contain very small amounts so as not to cause hyperglycaemia. Supplemental glucose in resuscitation fluids should not exceed 6.6 mg dextrose/kg bwt/min (Speir and Meagher 1989). Once hypovolaemia is corrected, fluids for the rst 24 h are administered to maintain blood glucose concentrationsand to meet fluid requirements. Initially, foals may be started on 5% glucose to provide 4 mg glucose/kg bwt/min, andthen glucose concentration may be increased to 8 mgglucose/kg bwt/min provided the foal maintains glucosetolerance (Palmer 2004). A point-of-care glucometer shouldbe used to monitor blood glucose and adjust glucoseadministration to maintain blood glucose levels between 4.0and 5.5 mmol/l (Austin 2013). It is not possible to meet caloricneeds by glucose infusion alone, but total parental nutritionwould rarely be undertaken in the eld. After stabilisation, fluid rates can either be given at a basic 2 -4 ml/kg bwt or use the Holiday-Segar formula (Table 2 ) to calculate a 'dry 'rate based upon the basal metabolic rate of the neonate (Axon and Wilkins 2015). Estimated ongoing losses are then added to the calculated fluid needs. Resuscitation fluids should be any fluid with strong ion difference such as Normosol or lactated Ringer 's solution. These fluids help restore normal anion gap and correct metabolic acidosis, but long-term use of replacement fluids to supply maintenance requirements in foals will result in water retention and a 'jelly belly 'appearance because of the foal 's limited ability to excrete sodium. Therefore, with the exception of foals with diarrhoea, maintenance fluids should have restricted sodium. Restricted sodium-containing fluids include Normosol-M, 5% dextrose, and a combination of 5% dextrose and lactated Ringer 's solution (Axon and Wilkins 2015). Fluids with a high chloride concentration, such as normal saline, can have a signi cant acidifying effects andare not appropriate for routine resuscitation. Electrolytes should be evaluated with a biochemistry panel after resuscitation, and electrolyte abnormalities should be addressed slowly over time to prevent adverse neurological events. Potassium supplementation should be considered in any foal that is not being fed and has no predisposing factors that trigger hyperkalaemia such as ruptured bladder; however, intravenous supplementation is challenging and potentially dangerous without a fluid pump or experienced personnel to monitor the rate of fluid administration. If the foal will tolerate even small amounts of enteral fluids, oral supplementation would be safer. After the basic needs of the equine neonate have been addressed, the clinician will need to provide speci c therapy for medical problems that are evident on clinical examination or identi ed on initial laboratory assessment. Therapy of speci c diseases Diseases of the immune system One of the most common problems treated in the eld is failure of passive transfer (FPT). Multiple tests are available and many can be performed stall-side to assess the adequacy of passive transfer of antibodies once the foal is aged 8 -24 h. If FPT is identi ed when a foal is aged <18 h, colostrum supplementation can be utilised. After age 18 h, gut closure has occurred, and plasma must be administered to elevate serum immunoglobulin levels. Failure of passive transfer may be identi ed in otherwise normal foals, and treatment is dependent on antibody levels, experience of the clinician, farm history, and wishes of the owners. All foals with complete FPT ( <4 g/l) should receive additional antibodies. Foals that are determined to be at increased risk for disease should receive supplemental IgG if measured values are <8 g/l. If the foal is to be insured, the veterinarian and owner should check insurance company requirements to ensure stipulations for binding of the insurance are met. A single litre of plasma is expected to increase serum IgG levels in a 50 kg foal by 2 -3 g/l. Plasma products should always be thawed in a water bath to prevent destruction of essential proteins prior to administration. After treatment, all foals should have IgG levels checked again in 12 -24 h to ensure adequate antibody levels. Reactions are rare with the administration of most commercial plasma products provided a blood administration set is used for administration. Initial fluid rates should be 0.5 ml/kg bwt and gradually increased to 40 ml/kg bwt/h once the clinician is comfortable that adverse effects are not occurring (Sellon 2006). Plasma administration should be slowed or stopped if reactions such as muscle trembling, piloerection, increased heart and respiratory rates, colic, or blanching of mucous membranes are observed. Plasma must be stopped if signs recur when administration is resumed (Sellon 2006). Neonatal isoerythrolysis is an immune disease that is much less commonly encountered, and is the most common cause of icterus in foals. Neonatal isoerythrolysis occurs primarily in multiparous mares that are A or Q negative and have become sensitised to A or Q antigens during previous pregnancies. Anti- A or Q antibodies are then secreted into the colostrum and cause lysis of the foal 's red blood cells if the foal has inherited either A or Q antigens. Clinical signs include depression,tachypnoea, tachycardia, icterus and occasionallyTABLE 2: Holliday-Segar formula for maintenance fluid calculations Bodyweight (kg)Fluid requirement (ml/kg bwt/day)Cumulative total for 50 kg foal (ml) 1-10 100 1000 11-20 50 EDUCATION / FEBRUARY 2018haematuria. The diagnosis can be con rmed by a declining packed cell volume. Serum chemistry should be tested to evaluate for common complications such as kernicterus, hepatic failure or acute kidney injury. An affected foal should be muzzled or separated from the mare for 24 h, kept in a quiet environment, and carefully monitored. It is essential to maintain adequate hydration and to limit stress to the foal. The mare should be milked, and the milk discarded. Most foals will recover if stress is kept to a minimum. Foals with more severe anaemia (packed cell volume <12%, haemoglobin <50 mg/l) may require transfusion which can be dif cult in the eld. The mare is the best source of red blood cells, but attempts to wash red blood cells without a centrifuge can be challenging and time-consuming. If no other option is available, a blood transfusion from an unrelated gelding may be life-saving. Between 1 and 2 l of blood is collected into acid citrate dextrose anticoagulant and administered over 2 -4h . Antibiotic coverage is usually indicated as the foal is at risk for sepsis due to systemic compromise. Prevention is much more effective than treatment. At-risk mares may be screened during the last month of gestation for presence of red cell alloantibodies. Colostrum from positive mares should be discarded, and the foal should be provided with an alternative source of colostrum (Sellon 2006). Sepsis Signs of sepsis are nonspeci c and include decreased nursing, depression progressing to recumbency, injected mucousmembranes, and petechia on mucous membranes and insideof the ears; these signs represent the development of thesystemic in flammatory response syndrome. The syndrome in neonates has been de ned as alterations in at least three of the following parameters (one of which must be abnormal temperature or leucocyte count): body temperature >39.2 respiratory function peripheral white counts (white blood cell count 910 (Fielding and Magdesian 2015; Wong and Wilkins 2015). Historical factors such placentitis, premature lactation, mare vulvar discharge, prematurity and FPT contribute to a suspicion of sepsis. Early recognition and treatment of sepsis isassociated with a better outcome and has led to the development of scoring systems as an aid to identi cation of infected foals. Examples of sepsis score worksheets are published in various places (Brewer and Koterba 1988; Brewer 1990; Corley and Furr 2003; Weber et al. 2015). Foals with suspected sepsis should be referred to a hospital, but if this is not possible, then cardiovascular support, good nursing care and antibiotics should be instituted ( Table 3 ). The distribution and metabolism of drugs is expected to be different in foals as compared to mature horses because of a higher percentage of body water, decreased protein binding of drugs, and immature metabolism and excretion of drugs by the liver and kidney (Magdesian 2003). Prior to initiating antibiotic therapy, a sterile blood culture should be obtained to direct antibiotic selection. In lieu of culture and sensitivity information, empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should be employed. The initial treatment of a suspected septic foal with normal renal function should include a b-lactam drug and an aminoglycoside. Aminoglycosides carry the potential for nephrotoxicity; however, it is unlikely that peak and trough aminoglycoside levels can be measured in the eld. Without therapeutic drug monitoring, efforts to maintain hydration, monitor urinalysis and determine serum creatinine concentration at least weekly are recommended to prevent adverse effects on the kidneys (Vaala et al. 2009). If renal function is abnormal or suspect, then antibiotic choices should be high-dose ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfonamides, ticarcillin/clavulanic acidor a third-generation cephalosporin. Clinical experience may dictate antimicrobials that are more likely to be effective in a given area (Sanchez 2005; Russell et al. 2008). The intravenous route is ideal in foals aged <7 days, but the intramuscular route may be used in a eld setting. Bacteraemic foals without localising signs should be treated for at least 10 -14 days. If antibiotics are used prophylactically, treatment for 3 -5 days is recommended (Axon and Wilkins 2015). When localising signs are present, treatment should continue until all signs of infection are resolved, and temperature, complete blood cell count, brinogen, and serum amyloid A are returned to normal values for 72 h. A follow-up complete blood cell count and brinogen are recommended 1 week after therapy is discontinued to TABLE 3: Common antibiotics used in foals Antimicrobial Dose Notes Amikacin 20 -30 mg/kg bwt i.v. or i.m. q. 24 h May cause renal damage, Gram -ve coverage only Ampicillin Na 20 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 6 h Usually used with aminoglycosideCefotaxime 40 mg/kg i.v. q. 6 h Used only when resistance to commonly used antibiotics is identi ed Ceftazidime 40 -50 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 6 h Used only when resistance to commonly used antibiotics is identi ed Ceftiofur 5 -10 mg/kg bwt i.v. or i.m. q. 6 -12 h Used alone or in combination with aminoglycoside Chloramphenicol* 40 mg/kg bwt/per os q. 6 h Wear gloves as there is a human health riskGentamicin 8 -15 mg/kg i.v. or i.m. q. 24 h May cause renal damage, Gram -ve coverage only Metronidazole 10 mg/kg bwt per os, i.v., or per rectum q. 12 hUsed most commonly for suspected clostridial infections Oxytetracycline 2 g/50 kg foal For treatment of contracted tendons.

When long-term therapy is necessary, oral therapy with drugs selected based on culture and sensitivity can be used once the patient is stable. Septic foals should be monitored for signs of localised infections. Periodic ultrasonographic evaluation of the chest and umbilicus should be performed. In any foal with fever and lameness, septic arthritis should be considered. Prompt treatment of septic arthritis is essential to recovery and ensuring athletic potential. Radiographs, ultrasound, joint fluid analysis and synovial fluid culture can direct therapy. Elevated synovial fluid cell count ( >209109/l), a predominance concentration ( >40 g/l) all support a diagnosis of septic arthritis. Even with radiographs, early osseous infection can be difcult to identify, but lameness, oedema, heat and pain upon palpation should increase suspicion (Lester et al. 2009). Joint lavage and/or regional limb perfusion are recommended to treat septic arthritis. Neonatal encephalopathy After sepsis, neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is one of the most common abnormalities of the foal. Clinical signs may be present immediately after birth or may be delayed 24 -48 h. Signs of NE include loss of af nity for the dam, loss of suckle, increased sleepiness, abnormal vocalisation, and declining response to external stimulation. Increased stiffness, intermittent nystagmus, and forelimb marching may precede seizure activity (Axon and Wilkins 2015). Causes of this condition are multifactorial and were recently discussed in an in-depth review by Gold (2017). Proposed causes include hypoxic-ischaemic damage, reperfusion injury, dysregulation or persistence of neuropregnanes, and increased inflammatory mediators in the brain. NE is most easily treated in a hospital with suf cient personnel, rapid access to laboratory support including blood gas analysis, and the ability to provide supplemental oxygen. If referral is not possible, then treatment goals include control of seizures, supportive care, antioxidants and prophylactic antibiotic therapy ( Table 4 ). Seizures can be controlled with either diazepam or midazolam. If seizures persist, then midazolam constant rate infusion or phenobarbital may be used. Caffeine is an effective respiratory stimulant in foals that develop hypercapnia and can be used in a eld setting when ventilator support is not possible. Dimethyl sulfoxide has been advocated to decrease brain swelling, but its use is controversial as there are few data on its ef cacy. Magnesium sulfate is another therapy thought to attenuate brain injury by inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor- mediated neuronal injury (Axon and Wilkins 2015); however, recent analysis of outcome for low and high dose magnesium sulfate treatment of traumatic brain injury in man has been associated with worse outcomes (Tempkin et al. 2007). Allopurinol, thiamine, vitamin C and vitamin E have been advocated as neuroprotectants and antioxidants. There is limited data comparing outcomes with any of these neuroprotectants, and appropriate supportive therapy remains the primary determinate of outcome. There is increasing evidence that therapeutic hypothermia increases survival in human infants with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (Jacobs et al. 2013); however, there is not sufcient evidence on hypothermia in foals to warrant speci c recommendations for treatment of NE other than toavoid overzealous warming of foals that are hypotensive and may have cerebral injury. Effects of this condition are not limited to brain injury but also include multisystemic effects with renal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems frequently involved. Good nursing care is essential to monitor and address any changes in systemic function, and clients should be made aware that athletic function appears good for foals that survive (Gold 2017). Evaluation for FPT is important since many affected foals may not have nursed effectively enough to ingest sufcient amounts of colostrum. Meconium impaction Signs of meconium impaction may include restlessness, stretching of limbs, frequent attempts to defaecate or urinate, twisting of head and neck, and rolling onto the back. Foals attempting to defaecate will 'tail flag'with an arched back and hind legs camped under, in contrast to the flat back with hind legs stretched backward seen in foals attempting to urinate. Nursing is frequently disrupted, and the mare may begin to stream milk as the foal 's discomfort intensi es. Over time, abdominal distention will be evident, and urine may be seen dripping from the urachus. Appropriate antiseptic care of the umbilicus should be maintained; however, if the urachus becomes patent, prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be maintained until the urachus closes and frequent ultrasonographic monitoring should be performed to detect complications. Many farms administer enemas prophylactically to prevent constipation. Enemas with either a human sodium phosphate product or warm, soapy water (2 -3 ml of liquid detergent to 500 ml water, given by gravity flow) may be used. If straining continues after the initial enema, the foal should be examined by a veterinarian before another enema is given. Repeated enemas may cause mucosal irritation and produce signs of straining even after the constipation has resolved and commercial phosphate enemas may causephosphate toxicity with repeated use. A diagnosis of meconium impaction can often be con rmed with either a digital rectal examination, careful abdominal palpation, or abdominal ultrasonography to identify meconium.

Pain can be managed with flunixin meglumine (100 -200 ml) may be given by nasogastric tube for its lubricating effect. Acetylcysteine enemas have been used by the author with success in resistant impactions. A 30 French Foley catheter is inserted 2.5 -5 cm into the rectum, and the bulb is slowly in flated. Two hundred millilitres of 4% acetylcysteine solution are infused by gravity flow and retained by clamping the catheter for 20 min. The acetylcysteine may be repeated in 12 h if the impaction is not resolved. The University of California reported a 93% success rate with medical management of meconium impactions with 40% requiring more than one enema (Pusterla et al. 2004). Musculoskeletal problems Angular limb abnormalities are frequent but most will spontaneously improve over the rst 30 days. A surgical consultation should be sought for fetlock deformities that persist for >10-14 days or carpal/tarsal abnormalities that are not correcting or getting worse over the rst 60 days. Radiographs should be taken of all premature foals to evaluate the degree of ossi cation of cuboidal bones in the carpus and tarsus. Foals with incomplete ossi cation should be stall con ned until mineralisation has been completed. Flexure laxity may occasionally be seen, but rarely causes a long-term problem. Initially, exercise is restricted. If the laxity is not improving after a few days, glue-on shoes with heel extensions may be required. A light bandage can be applied to protect the heels, but heavy bandages should be avoided as they will increase tendon laxity. Contracted tendons are a frequent occurrence and can occur at the carpus, fetlock, pastern, distal interphalangeal joint and tarsus. If the foal is able to stand and nurse, then therapy may not be necessary. If limb contracture is not improving then a combination of limb bandaging, analgesia (flunixin meglumine, 0.5 foal, i.v.) may be used to facilitaterelaxation. Oxytetracycline may be repeated every 24 -48 h until desired tendon relaxation is observed (Trumble 2005)(Table 3 ). This drug may cause renal damage if used in the face of dehydration, so caution must be exercised whentreating foals that require assistance to stand and may notbe nursing effectively. More severe cases of limb contracturemay require heavy bandages with polyvinyl chloride splints.With a little time and perseverance, most mild to moderatecontracture will resolve satisfactorily. Conclusions As the rst on the scene, the ambulatory veterinarian must not only assess the neonate, but must determine prognosis and treatment strategies for any abnormalities discovered during the examination. Many minor problems can easily be treated on the farm, but care for more severely sick foals may be compromised by the level of care that can be offered under the circumstances. The client must be fully informed as to treatment options and limitations of on-the- farm care vs. referral to a specialty hospital. If the foal is tobe treated on the farm, a discussion about personnel needs for successful management and treatment of a sick neonate is essential, as well as a candid discussion about the costs of multiple farm trips to re-evaluate the patient. Instructions for foal care in the absence of the veterinarian should be concise, clear and in writing. Author 's declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.
