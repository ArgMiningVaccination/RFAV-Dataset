Page 5 By Tracie White Rather than focusing on his many scientific suc- cesses, Peter Kim, PhD, a biochemist known for his in- novative work in developing and shepherding drugs to market, chose instead to tell the School of Medicine's graduating class of 2016 about one of his key failures. \"The greatest scientific failure in my career was when I had to stop a clinical trial of a vaccine for HIV/AIDS. And it came just as we thought we were on the thresh - old of success,\" said Kim, the Virginia and D.K. Lud-wig Professor of Biochemistry, addressing the graduates and their families and friends seated under a giant white tent on Alumni Green on June 11. \"When we ended the clinical trial, the hopes of literally millions of people around the world were dashed.\" The key is not to despair in the face of failure, said Kim, the keynote speaker at the diploma ceremony. \"As you know, science is, at its core, the pursuit of truth. ... That is what science is all about: discovering the truth and following it wherever it leads,\" he said. Lilies, roses, babies, cameras The ceremony began with the sounds of the Golden Gate Brass Ensemble playing as the robed graduates marched up on stage, led by Lloyd Minor, MD, dean of the School of Medicine. In the audience, mothers held lilies and roses for the graduates; dads held babies; everyone, it seemed, held a camera. It was a sunny af- ternoon filled with selfies and videos and group shots, a day of tears and celebration, and a day to pause and reflect on the years of hard work and the road ahead. Following words of congratulations and encourage- ment from the two student speakers, Lauren Popov, who was receiving a PhD in microbiology and im-munology, and Muthu Alagappan, who was receiving a medical degree, Minor introduced Kim. The dean encouraged graduates, each of whom he said faced \"re- markable futures,\" to \"always remain true to yourself and your values.\" Kim, who earned a PhD in biochemistry at Stanford in 1985, joined the faculty of the School of Medicine in 2014 as a professor of biochemistry. He is member of ChEM-H, an interdisciplinary effort focused on the chemistry of human health. 'Up a blind alley' Previously, Kim was president of Merck Research Laboratories, where he helped launch a vaccine target- ing the human papilloma virus, the causative agent of cervical cancer, among many other products. He re- turned to Stanford to relaunch a career as a research sci- entist, he said. His research at Stanford includes efforts to create an HIV vaccine.In 2003, as the newly installed head of Merck Re- search Labs, Kim believed that Merck scientists were close to finding a vaccine for HIV/AIDS. \"This would not have been the ultimate HIV vaccine, but it would have been an enormous step forward,\" he said. \"And much of the scientific community, as well as the HIV/ AIDS advocacy community, shared our optimism \u2014 and our hope.\" Under his leadership, Merck partnered with the National In -Don't despair in face of failure, Kim tells grads nOrbert v On der gr Oeben Dina Wang-Kraus walks across the stage with Amber, a 7-year-old psychiatric assistance animal, at the medical school diploma ceremony. By Sarah C.P. Williams Studies have long shown that when faced with a problem that must be solved by cooperating with others, males and fe- males approach the task differently. Now, researchers at the School of Medicine have discovered how those differences are reflected in brain activity. When the researchers asked people to cooperate with a partner and then tracked the brain activity of both partici-pants, they found that males and females had different patterns of brain activity. The new findings, published online June 8 in Scientific Reports, could offer some clues into how cooperative behav- ior may have evolved differently between males and females, and could eventually help researchers develop new ways to en- hance cooperative behavior. \"It's not that either males or females are better at cooperating or can't cooper- ate with each other,\" said the study's se- nior author, Allan Reiss, MD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and of radiology. \"Rather, there's just a differ- ence in how they're cooperating.\" Women vs. men Cooperation \u2014 between family mem- bers, friends, coworkers and even govern-ments around the world \u2014 is viewed as a cornerstone of human society. But not everyone cooperates equally, as anyone who's worked on a group project knows. And one factor shaping a person's ap- proach to cooperation: sex. Previous be- havioral studies have found that women By Ruthann Richter Millions of people in the develop- ing world could be spared from lifelong disability \u2014 or possible death \u2014 from parasitic worm disease under a vastly ex- panded treatment program that is cost- effective, according to a new analysis led by School of Medicine researchers. The modeling analysis suggests that current World Health Organization guidelines may need to be revised to more effectively combat parasitic worm disease, which afflicts some 1.5 million people across the globe. It points the way to a sweeping new program in which more than 1 billion doses of two low- cost drugs \u2014 often donated \u2014 could be dispensed in sub-Saharan Africa to largely knock out these infections. Using prevalence and cost-effective- ness models, the researchers found it would be economically worthwhile to make these drugs available to schoolchil- dren every year in communities where as few as 5 percent are infected with schistosomiasis, as opposed to the 50 percent threshold now recommended by WHO. It would also be feasible to ex- pand treatment to adults and preschool- aged children, who often aren't included in WHO guidelines, and to combine treatment in areas heavily afflicted by the two most common types of worm infec - tions, which are caused by schistosomes and the soil-transmitted helminths, said Nathan Lo, a Stanford MD-PhD student and lead author of the study. \"If we incorporate this new evidence, Male, female brain activity differs during cooperative task, study findsResearchers: Ramping up treatment of worm disease would be cost-effective Schistosoma worms are among the parasitic worms that cause diseases in millions of people in the developing world each year.

This year's conference is being dubbed Medicine X Week because the offerings have expanded and will take place over seven days, Sept. 12-18, instead of three days. Most events will take place at the Li Ka Shing Center for Learning and Knowledge on the School of Medicine campus. Medicine X Week will focus on how to realize moonshot ideas for improving health care. \"We're taking the moonshot thinking and the inspirational talks that Med X is known for and tying it to how to imple - ment these ideas out in the world,\" said Lawrence Chu, MD, associate profes - sor of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine at Stanford and executive director of the conference. \"The whole idea is that change is something each of us can be responsible for and create.\" 'Everyone Included' Geared toward researchers, patients, providers, designers, technologists and policy leaders, Medicine X aims to provide a framework for health-care innovation, implementation and trans - formation based on principles of mutual respect and inclusivity, Chu said. This framework, known as \"Everyone In - cluded,\" a trademark of Stanford Medi - cine X, was co-developed with a diverse group of health-care stakeholders over the past six years at Medicine X. \"What we have learned over the years is that what people value most from this conference is its inclusivity,\" Chu said. \"We bring together researchers, patients and policy leaders to work on problems that matter in health care, to look at emerging technologies from a patient-fo - cused viewpoint, and to create new ideas to solve problems. \"Three days is just not enough to do all this,\" he added. \"We've expanded to a week to create more opportunities for collaborations, for co-creations and par - ticipatory design.\" Keynote speakers will be Susannah Fox, chief technology officer for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser -vices, who will discuss building a nation of innovators; Lindred Green, PhD, as- sistant professor of organizational be- havior at Stanford, who will talk about flattening the hierarchy in health-care systems; Jonathan Bush, CEO and presi- dent of Athenahealth, who will discuss bringing the \"network effect\" to health care; and LaVerne Council, chief infor- mation officer at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, who will discuss technological innovation at the VA. The following events will take place during Medicine X Week: MedXMakers Community Event: a free event open to the public that brings community members to join Medicine X in the movement to revolutionize health care. Health Care Safety Design Chal - lenge: a daylong event that focuses on the question, \"How should we respond when medicine hurts instead of heals?\" This will bring together a diverse group of stakeholders, including those who have experienced medical error, to work on developing solutions by redesigning the system.

The study also found that older people were more likely than younger people to believe it is OK to allow physicians to prescribe life-ending drugs to terminally ill patients who request them, and that the most reli- gious or spiritual people were the least supportive of this idea. But even among those who declared that religion or spirituality was very important to them, a majority still supported the practice. The study was published online June 9 in the Journal of Palliative Medicine to coincide with the date that Cal-ifornia's End of Life Option Act took effect. The act was signed into law Oct. 9, 2015. Physician-assisted death is illegal in Hawaii. \"It is remarkable that in both states, even participants who were deeply spiritual (52 percent) were still in support of physician-assisted death,\" said the study. \"Both genders and all racial/ethnic groups in both states were equally in support of PAD.\" 'Surprisingly positive' \"The response was surprisingly positive across all ethnic groups,\" said VJ Periyakoil, MD, clinical associ-ate professor of medicine, who is the lead and senior au- thor of the study. Those taking the survey marked their ethnicities as African American, Latino, white, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander or Asian. \"I was surprised that people who were deeply spiri- tual were still positive overall,\" she added. To conduct the study, researchers developed an on- line survey that asked participants to respond, true or false, to whether they believed it is acceptable to allow a physician to prescribe medication, at the request of a terminally-ill patient, in order to end that person's life. \"We wanted a broad question that didn't specify what kind of medication, that didn't say oral pills or self-administered, none of that,\" Periyakoil said. Par- ticipants were \"How important is your faith/ religion/spirituality to you? (Unimportant, somewhat important, important and very important.)\" Participants responded to the online survey, which was housed and stored on a secure Stanford server. Data was collected from July through October 2015. Among the 1,095 responses from California and 819 from Hawaii, the majority \u2014 both in California (72.5 percent) and Hawaii (76.5 percent) \u2014 were supportive of PAD. \"Older participants were more supportive of PAD compared with their younger counterparts in both states,\" the study said. \"Persons who reported that spiri-tuality was less important to them were more likely to support PAD in both states.\" For those who said religion/faith/spirituality was very important to them, about 52 percent were in favor of PAD, the study found. \"The act of deliberately hastening death is not sup- ported by most religions. ... Thus it is not surprising that in our study participants who reported faith to be most important to them were least in support of PAD,\" the study said. Need for cultural sensitivity Periyakoil, an expert on end-of-life care and director of the Stanford Pal- liative Care Education and T raining Program, stressed that it's important for physicians in California to prepare for the new law. In addition to training in end-of-life conversations and being aware of cultural differences, physicians need to be honest with their patients, Periyakoil said. \"Just be upfront,\" she said. \"Tell patients, 'Listen, this is a very hard topic for all of us.'\" In particular, primary care physicians will inevitably be faced with questions from patients, she said. \"It takes a tremendous amount of courage on the patient's part to ask these questions,\" Periyakoil said. \"How the doctor responds initially to the patient's question is very important and will set the tone for the rest of the interaction about this sensitive issue.\" The study provides evidence that pa- tients of various ethnicities and religious backgrounds will be seeking information from their physicians on the issue, many of them at what may be the most vulnerable time in their lives, she said. \"We stress that requests from diverse patients have to be approached with great cultural sensitivity,\" the re- searchers wrote in the study. The study asserted that because of the number of complex provisions in the law \u2014 such as the require- ment that medication must be self-administered by a mentally competent patient \u2014 it will actually affect only a tiny fraction of seriously ill patients. This has been borne out in Oregon, which in 1997 became the first state to pass an assisted-suicide law. \"Only a small sliver of the population will be eligible for the End-of-Life Option Act, and of those eligible, only a portion are likely to utilize this option, and no one ethically opposed would likely do so,\" the study said. \"For example, of the 34,160 Oregonians who died in 2014, only 155 received a lethal prescription and 105 utilized it.\" Although long-debated in California, the issue of physician-assisted death gained momentum after Brit-tany Maynard, a 29-year-old Californian who was terminally ill, decided to move to Oregon in 2014 to end her life rather than suffer the pain and debilitation caused by brain cancer. \"As California is a highly populous majority-minor- ity state, we are soon going to learn how diverse racial and ethnic groups respond to legalizing physician- assisted death,\" Periyakoil said. \"In order to alleviate suffering for all seriously ill patients, it is extremely important that we also provide excellent palliative care early in the illness process.\" Periyakoil's teaching module on physician-assisted death, which is posted on the medical school's website, is designed to be used as a discussion aid for both pa - tients and physicians. It is available at https://palliative.stanford.edu/physician-assisted-death.

People with severe cases sometimes resort to immunosuppressive treatment to quell the skin scaling, itching and joint arthritis that are hallmarks of the dis- order. But long-term administration of the medication can leave them vulnerable to infection and other un - wanted side effects. Now, researchers at the School of Medicine have identified a new molecular target for potential thera - pies. A small protein in the skin called Rac1, which is involved in wound repair, appears to link well-known environmental triggers of the disease with a genetic pre- disposition to the condition. It also sheds light on the interplay between the skin and the immune system that is responsible for disease flare-ups. \"Normally there's a quiet, ongoing conversation be- tween the epidermis and our immune system as they work together to fight disease such as infections,\" said Peter Marinkovich, MD, associate professor of der - matology. \"In psoriasis, this has escalated into an un - controllable shouting match that results in abnormal cellular proliferation, scaling and inflammation with no real effective therapies other than long-term immunosuppression. Targeting a protein in the skin, rather than quieting the immune system, could be a po- tential game changer for many patients and clinicians.\" A paper describing the research was pub- lished online June 13 in the Journal of Clini- cal Investigation. Marinkovich is the senior author, and postdoctoral scholar Marten Winge, MD, PhD, is the lead author. Itchy, scaly patches of skin About one of every 50 people in the world has pso- riasis, which is a genetic disease characterized by itchy, scaly patches of thickened skin across the body. Many also experience pain and associated arthritis in nearby joints. It can occur at any age, and the severity of the condition can wax and wane throughout a person's life. Psoriasis flare-ups can be triggered when skin is dam- aged and the epidermal cells become hypersensitive to growth signals. That's why many people struggle with the condition on their elbows, knees and other areas of the body that tend to get roughed up. But, strangely, the disease can also be activated in susceptible people by the bacteria that cause strep throat. The exact mechanisms by which these events trig-ger the disease are unknown, and most therapies fo-cus on quieting the immune system's side of the noisy conversation. Studying environmental triggers Winge and Marinkovich tried to find other options for patients by eavesdropping on the skin's role in the disease process. That meant considering environmen- tal triggers, which led them to a small molecule, called Rac1, known to play a role in both wound repair and in strep infection. \"Both of these processes activate a small protein called Rac1,\" said Marinkovich. \"So we wondered if Rac1 was somehow involved in triggering psoriasis in susceptible people.\" When activated, Rac1 is believed to promote the proliferation of cells in the epidermis, as well as send signals to activate the immune system. Under normal conditions, this is a necessary response to heal after an injury. But over-proliferation and over-inflammation could have detrimental effects. Interestingly, some ge- netic mutations that have been linked to psoriasis affect molecules that are involved in many of the same signaling pathways as Rac1. The researchers consistently found that Rac1 was highly activated in biopsies of pso- riatic skin from 20 people with the condi-tion. When they artificially activated Rac1 in the skin of laboratory mice, the animals exhibited similar symptoms as human patients. \"They had scaling of the skin and ar- thritis in their joints that precisely mimics what we've seen in the clinic,\" Marinkov- ich said. The effect was abolished, however, in mice engineered to lack immune cells called T cells \u2014 further confirming the immune system's role in the disorder. Blocking protein's activity Finally, blocking the activity of Rac1 in patches of psoriatic human skin that had been transplanted onto the backs of mice reversed the skin hyperplasia and re- duced the recruitment of immune molecules known as cytokines to the transplanted patch. \"Psoriasis is one of the most prevalent skin diseases in the world,\" said Marinkovich. \"But it's been difficult to study due to the complex interplay between genetic and environmental influences. Now we've learned that targeting Rac1 activation in the skin, rather than the immune system's role in the disease, may be a way to treat the disease without needing to suppress the im - mune system.\" Marinkovich and his colleagues plan to continue their study of what causes Rac1 activation in the epidermis. \"The study is the first to find a molecule linking ge- netic susceptibility to the disease with the environmen- tal causes known to trigger it,\" Marinkovich said. \"We'd like to understand all the steps between these gene de- fects and Rac1 activation. Then we can try to identify drugs that can down-regulate the cause of abnormal Rac1 activation in psoriasis. The availability of a cream or other topical application could completely change the way we treat psoriasis in the clinic.\" Other Stanford co-authors of the study are former visiting scientists Bungo Ohyama, MD, PhD, Wei Li, MD, and Teruhiko Makino MD, PhD; former research assistant Clara Dey; former Lisa Boxer, PhD; postdoctoral scholar Chimeh, MD; former Wu, MD; former ars Ngon Nguyen; and professor of dermatology Paul Khavari MD, PhD.

She was right. Three months ago, Ledbetter became one of the estimated 76,000 people in the United States diagnosed with melanoma in 2016. Melanoma is the most lethal of all skin cancers, and its incidence is rising steadily while its mortality rate remains stubbornly stable. Even when melanoma is in situ \u2014 an early stage during which the cancer has not yet grown beyond the outer layer of skin \u2014 removing it is often a multistage process that takes a few days as patients and doctors wait for tissue analysis. Without the finesse of a layer-by-layer surgery called Mohs, which is used universally for other forms of skin cancer, removal of early-stage melanoma can produce large wounds and disfiguring scars. This spring, just in time for Ledbet- ter's surgery, Stanford Health Care be - came the first academic medical center in the western United States to begin using the Mohs technique for melanoma in situ. This outpatient surgery proce- dure is less expensive than the traditional surgical approach, creates a smaller wound and reduces the cancer's rate of recurrence. A melanoma in situ can be removed, and reconstructive surgery completed, in one day. Preparing tissue samples Using Mohs to treat melanoma in situ was not possible until researchers figured out how to prepare tissue samples of the cancer. Unlike more common forms of skin cancer, such as basal cell or squa- mous cell carcinoma, melanoma's cells are difficult to visualize with the standard dyes used to prepare slides for analysis. About 15 years ago, researchers finally developed an immunohistochemistry stain for melanoma, tuned to the cancer's particular biomarkers. That discovery made melanoma visible, but initially it was only used for formalin slides, which take about 12 hours to prepare, not the quicker, frozen-section slides used in Mohs surgery. Doctors wanted to do with melanoma what they could do with other skin can - cers: remove a tissue sample that could be stained, frozen and slide-ready in less than an hour. It wasn't a technical hurdle, but an evidentiary one. Clini-cians were hesitant to use the new stain in the quick-processing preparation until studies showed it was as accurate as the previous formalin-slide-based, multiday analysis. That evidence was published last year in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. \"That study added to the growing body of evidence that shows the incredible usefulness of this immuno- histochemical marker in frozen-section analysis in Mohs for in situ melanoma,\" said surgeon Tyler Hollmig, MD, clini- cal assistant professor of dermatology at the School of Medicine. \"We are incredi- bly excited about those results and about Stanford Health Care's ability to now of- fer this new technique to our patients.\" Proceeding carefully Hollmig and his Stanford Medicine colleagues have proceeded carefully be- cause the new processing and analysis are technically difficult. \"We wanted to do things the right way,\" he said. Stan- ford Health Care's dermatopathology service became a crucial partner for the advanced training needed for the new procedure. The procedure is based on a tech- nique developed by Wisconsin surgeon Frederic Mohs in the 1930s. Mohs sur- gery begins with the removal, like a plug, of the most visible center of the cancer. Then, the surgeon will remove tissue around the center, in layers about 3 mil - limeters thick. That tissue is sliced into micron-thin pieces, stained, frozen and examined within minutes. The incre- mental removal of tissue means that no more will be removed than is necessary. When the cancer is near the eyelid, for instance, the precision of Mohs keeps wounds and scars, or reconstructive sur - gery, to a minimum. Hollmig said he and fellow derma- tologic surgeon nOrbert v On der gr Oebenedyth Ledbetter attends a follow-up appointment with dermatologic surgeon Tyler Hollmig, who removed melanoma in situ from her nose using a technique called Mohs surgery.

Our analysis indicates that this would not only be effective but also a cost-effective investment when compared alongside other health interventions.\" The study was published online June 7 in The Lan - cet Infectious Diseases. Parasitic worm diseases are among the most preva- lent ailments in the developing world, with docu- mented transmission in 78 countries, according to WHO. About 150,000 people die of complications every year from these parasitic infections. The two major categories of parasitic worms are the Schistosoma worms and the soil-transmitted helminths. The Schistosoma parasites reproduce in freshwater snails and can penetrate the skin of people who swim in con-taminated lakes or rivers or who walk in muddy fields. The helminth worms, such as roundworm, whipworm and hookworm, are mainly found in soil. These worms may produce small eggs in the body that can be trans- mitted to others through ingestion of human feces in soil or water supplies. Low-cost treatments Both diseases are easily treated with low-cost drugs that have relatively few side effects, Lo said. Schisto-somiasis is typically treated with praziquantel, which costs about 21 cents a pill and can reduce egg produc- tion by 98 percent, he said. The helminths can be read- ily treated with albendazole, which costs about 3 cents a pill and can reduce the number of worm eggs by as much as 95 percent. In the past 15 years, there has been a significant reduction in the global prevalence of these infections and greater access to medication, with 15 to 45 percent of those who need it getting treatment, according to WHO. Yet these diseases remain a persistent problem in many parts of the world, including Africa, South America and South Asia. In February, WHO issued a press release urging fur- ther expansion of treatment where the disease is most endemic, with a goal of reaching 75 percent coverage in preschool- and school-age children by 2020. However, the WHO guidelines were written a decade ago and have not been updated to reach this goal. \"The guidelines were based on the best judgment of experts at the time, but I think there's fairly broad agreement that it's time to revisit these in view of new data, analyses and priorities,\" Andrews said. He and his colleagues decided to take a systematic look at how best to control these infections, using a variety of models to ex- amine prevalence and transmission patterns across Africa, as well as a cost-effectiveness model to determine what made the most eco- nomic sense. They found that it would be most cost-effective to treat Schistosoma worm infections annually when preva- lence among children was as low as 5 percent \u2014 well below WHO's current threshold of 50 percent preva- lence. In the case of helminth infections, they found it would be economically worthwhile to treat school-age children when prevalence was 20 percent \u2014 the same level currently recommended by WHO. Their analysis also shows that it would be feasible to include preschool-age children and adults in the treatment program, as both age groups may experi- ence the disabling symptoms of parasitic infection but have not been traditionally included in these treatment programs. Moreover, adults can easily reinfect children through fecal contamination in the household environ-ment, Lo said. Finally, the researchers found that it would save money to treat the two diseases at the same time, rather than as separate programs because most of the cost is involved in delivering the treatment, not in the pills themselves. \"It makes sense to work together to treat multiple diseases when they are in a single setting,\" Lo said. \"If you have health-care workers who go into a village to do one treatment, they will have go back to the village for a different treatment, and the second visit costs just as much.\" If these proposed recommendations for sub-Saharan Africa were followed, it would require a sixfold increase in treatment for Schistosoma infections \u2014 from about 120 million to more than 750 million doses annually \u2014 and a doubling of the number of doses for helminth infections from 335 million to nearly 660 million a year, the researchers estimate. Question of affordability The scientists did not calculate the cost of the total proposed program, and it's unclear whether current funders would be willing to increase their sup- port. These programs are currently funded by the U.S. Agency for Interna- tional Development, local ministries of health and various nonprofits, as well as pharmaceutical companies that donate the drugs. In scaling up treatment, it would also be important to be mindful of the potential for drug resistance, al-though the proposed guidelines meet the best practices for avoiding the emergence of resistance, Lo said. He said resistance with these drugs has been documented in animals, though not in human populations. The other Stanford co-author of the paper is Eran Bendavid, MD, assistant professor of medicine. Re- searchers in Switzerland, Canada and the Ivory Coast also contributed to the study. The research was funded by the Doris Duke Chari- table Foundation, the Mount Sinai Hospital-University Health Network AMO Innovation Fund and the Stan- ford University Medical Scholars Program. iSmWorm continued from page 1 Nathan Lo See mohS, page 5InsIde stanford MedIcIne June 20, 2016 5Mohs surgery for melanoma in situ offered at stanford health Care By Joan Semeria \"I did something amazing yesterday!\" exclaimed So- fia Montoya. \"I climbed to the top of the play structure all by myself!\" This would be a normal thing to do for most 8-year- olds, but it's not something Sofia's parents or her doc- tors at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford expected so soon after Sofia went into sudden cardiac arrest while playing with friends. On April 18, while playing tag at her elementary school near Half Moon Bay, Sofia slumped to the ground and was unresponsive. Her friends ran for help. A school staff member, who found that Sofia had no pulse and wasn't breathing, performed CPR as a 911 dispatcher walked her through the steps. Hearing the call over the radio, a sheriff's deputy in the area quickly arrived and took over CPR until the Moss Beach Fire Department got to the school. Firefighters continued CPR and used a defibrillator twice to get Sofia's heart to start beating again. It was quickly determined that Sofia needed to be treated at a trauma center, so she was transported by ambulance to the Half Moon Bay airport, where Stan-ford's Life Flight helicopter was waiting. 'White as a sheet' \"When I first saw her, she was lying on a backboard with a collar on. She was white as a sheet, not mov- ing or breathing very well,\" said Shara Griffis, RN, the flight nurse who was on board with Sofia. During the 10-minute flight to the hospital, Sofia again stopped breathing. Griffis inserted a breathing tube in her mouth. Griffis knew that Sofia's brain was in danger of not getting sufficient oxygen \u2014 a primary concern when someone has to be resuscitated. At Packard Children's, Sofia went through a series of diagnostic tests to determine why she had gone into cardiac arrest. The hospital's Children's Heart Center team diagnosed Sofia with long QT syndrome, a disor- der of the heart's electrical system that causes fast, cha- otic heartbeats resulting in fainting spells, seizures or, in some cases, sudden death. Long QT syndrome can be caused by a genetic mutation and is often inherited. So- fia's family members have since all gone through genetic testing to see if they carry the same mutation. Once Sofia was stabilized, pediatric cardiologist Scott Ceresnak, MD, surgically placed an implantable cardioverter defibrillator in Sofia's chest to help regulate her heartbeat. If the device detects an irregular heart-beat, it generates an electrical shock to restore a normal heart rate and rhythm. After 11 days in the hospital, Sofia returned home. She has resumed most of her normal activities and is expected to make a full recovery. \"The long-term outlook for Sofia is excellent,\" said Ceresnak, an assistant professor of pediatric cardiology at the School of Medicine. \"With the combination of beta blocker medicines, which reduce cardiac events, and the ICD, we expect Sofia to live a long, healthy, fruitful life. And thanks to the tremendous CPR she re- ceived, she has made incredible neurological recovery.\" Lifesaving CPR While the ICD will keep Sofia's malfunc- tioning, it's the CPR and early defibrillation that saved her life and improved her outcome. \"Sofia's story is a perfect example of all the pieces coming together,\" said Lynda Knight, MSN, RN, di- rector of the REVIVE Ini - tiative for Resuscitation Excellence at Stanford Children's Health. \"This scenario is what we train for, starting with bystander CPR. Evidence shows that if a bystander performs CPR, the outcome will be better.\" She said paramedics take four to eight minutes on average to arrive at the scene, and that each minute someone in cardiac arrest goes without chest com- pressions reduces that per- son's chance of survival by 10 percent. In 2013, Knight led an observational study that demonstrated the effec- tiveness of sending parents of children who had high- risk diagnoses home with a video-based, self-instruc- tional CPR kit called CPR Anytime. Parents reported that they felt empowered by their knowledge of CPR, and most shared the kit with at least two other fam- ily members or friends. Since the program began, 10 children have received CPR from members of families that were given the kit. Nine of those children survived with favorable neurological outcomes. Now all infants and children born at or admitted to Packard Children's are sent home with the kit. To date, more than 6,500 families have received the free CPR kits, with an esti- mated impact of 19,000 community members becom-ing trained in CPR. Understanding the difference between treating car- diopulmonary events in children and adults is especially critical for first responders. That's why Knight devel- oped the Pediatric Advanced Workshop with Simula- tion program to train firefighters in pediatric CPR by using scenarios based on real cases of critically ill and injured children.The REVIVE American Heart Asso- ciation T raining Center, located at Packard Children's, also trains an additional 1,500 local health-care profes-sionals annually in pediatric advanced life support. Shawna Montoya, Sofia's mother, acknowledges that her daughter wouldn't be healthy and alive today if she had not received quality CPR. \"Although Sofia has some memory loss, she is mak- ing amazing strides every single day,\" said Montoya. \"I'm so thankful for everyone who was part of her re- covery and for the support of our community. My mis- sion now is to promote CPR training because obviously it can save a life. My daughter is living proof of that.\" iSmTale of Sofia Montoya's survival a testament to power of CPR Sofia Montoya was flown on the Life Flight helicopter to Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford on April 18 after suffering a cardiac arrest on her school's playground in Half Moon Bay. evan Toolajian (left) is the pilot who flew her, and Shara Griffis (right) is the flight nurse who cared for her.jiM rOberts A video about a young Stan- ford neurosurgeon's imminent death from cancer earned the top award in a national competition. The video, \"A strange rela- tivity,\" received a Gold Award in the long video category in the 2016 Circle of Excellence Awards program sponsored by the Council for the Advance- ment and Support of Education. The video was an online com - panion to an essay by the late Paul Kalanithi, MD, published in the spring 2015 issue of Stan- ford Medicine magazine. In the essay and the video, Kalanithi described how his perception of time changed as a neurosurgeon-turned-patient facing a terminal diagnosis. The essay and video were published just a few weeks before he died of lung cancer. The video was produced by Mark Hanlon, video director for the medical school's Office of Communi- cation & Public Affairs. The judges for the contest called the video \"superb on a multitude of levels.\" They praised the video's use of a variety of elements \u2014 from an upbeat, clocklike beat on a guitar to the varying of film speed \u2014 to convey the notion of time. \"We also love how the crew captured the small moments of Dr. Kalanithi with his family, especially when they captured the side of his happy and sad smile while he was playing with his in- fant daughter. It made several of us cry,\" the judges wrote. \"It was a story and video that will leave an im- pression on us all for a lifetime \u2014 that is not some- thing you can say very often.\" CASE is a professional organization for those in the fields of communications, alumni relations and development at educational institutions.

The new technique is well-suited for patients whose melanoma is in areas where sparing tissue is most critical \u2014 the head, neck, hands, feet and genitalia. With speedy analysis of cancerous tissue now available, patients can have a tumor removed and any needed wound repair completed in one day. Ledbetter, who lives in Lodi, said she appre- ciated that. Her melanoma had spread through half of one side of her nose. After removing the cancerous tissue, Hollmig built Ledbetter a new nose with a procedure called a paramedium fore- head flap. The flap is a section of tissue about a half-inch deep and 5 inches long surgically sepa- rated away from the forehead. One edge remains attached to the forehead, just above the eyebrow; the rectangular remainder is turned down toward the nose to cover the area where cancer has been removed. For three weeks, the flap grafts the nose wound. Then, the flap is separated completely from the forehead, and its top edge sewn to the top of the nose. Although the flap procedure is complicated, the one-day process enabled Ledbetter to arrive at the Outpatient Center in Redwood City at 8 a.m., Feb. 17, and head home at 4:45 p.m. T wo months later, her healing was not considered complete, but she has boasted that her friends \"can't tell I've had surgery.\" \"Hearing that from a patient is my best reward,\" Hollmig said. iSmMohs continued from page 4 MArk h AnlOn Paul Kalanathi holds his daughter in a screen shot from Mark Hanlon's video \"A strange relativity,\" which won a Gold Award in the long video category in the 2016 Circle of excellence Awards program sponsored by the Council for the Advancement and Support of education.6 June 20, 2016 InsIde stanford MedIcInestitutes of Health to test the vaccine in 3,000 people, committing hundreds of millions of dollars to scale up production of the vaccine, ready to move into the final stage of testing if the results of the trial were encourag- ing, he said. \"Unfortunately, they were not,\" he told the crowd. \"Instead of making a breakthrough, we found our- selves up a blind alley. We had every reason to expect to succeed, but we had not. And this was a very public failure.\"Kim's story was not, of course, just about failure. It was an inspirational tale of how failures in the world of science add to the greater body of scientific knowledge \u2014 and how his story of failure changed the course of his life, eventually leading him back to Stanford. \"On the day that we stopped the clinical trial, I wrote a letter to all Merck employees ex- plaining the disappointing news,\" he said. \"I concluded by saying, 'Although the answer is not what we desired, we had completed an incredibly important experiment.' In as much as the results were deeply disappointing, we had succeeded in finding an approach that didn't work. And that failure would lead researchers to search for other ways to succeed. \"Now that I am back in academia, I am among those continuing the search. Why? Because today more than 36 million people are living with HIV/AIDS \u2014 that is one out of every 200 people on Earth. The quest for this vaccine simply must continue until it succeeds. 'Something you long look forward to' \"Expect to confront failure, but don't let it defeat you,\" Kim added. \"Remember, as you leave this place, know that you carry with you the hopes of all those \u2014 yet unknown to you or them \u2014 in whose lives you will make a real difference. Carry this, not as a burden, but as an opportunity and a privilege.\" Families and friends of the graduates traveled from across the country, and around the world, to attend the day's ceremonies. The class of 2016 was awarded 49 master's degrees, 87 medical degrees and 94 doctorates. T wenty-six of the graduates received MD-PhD degrees. The mother of AbdulRasheed Alabi, one of those MD-PhD grads, beamed at him in his robes, recalling his brilliance in preschool. \"We came all the way from Nigeria,\" she said. \"This is something you long look for- ward to.\" Graduate Roxana Danesh- jou, who also earned an MD- PhD, took a moment before the ceremony to thank her parents, who escaped persecution in Iran during the 1979 Iranian revolution by immigrating to the United States. \"My family sacrificed so much for me,\" Daneshjou said. \"My people, the Baha'i, are banned from attend- ing higher education in Iran. My entire family came out from Texas to be here today. I'm the first doctor in the family.\" The words of the student speakers reflected the strong emotions of the day. They recounted the schol- arship, hard work and perseverance that brought the graduates their diplomas, but also how their journey has left a lasting emotional mark. \"There's that moment when you see something that no one has ever observed before, ... that precious nugget of knowledge, that moment when your discovery be- comes part of a larger story of scientific progress,\" said Popov, reflecting on the years of research that go into a PhD. Alagappan, who received his MD, described a transformative moment that occurred for him during his clinical rotations: the joy of holding a 10-second-old baby girl. \"Literally all I did was hold a 6-pound infant for three minutes without dropping her, but I was physi- cally and emotionally exhausted. I disposed of my gloves, wiped my eyes and thought to myself, 'Everything was worth it.'\" iSmgraduation continued from page 1 (Clockwise from top left) neil Gesundheit hoods graduating MD-PhD student Roxana Daneshjou at the medical school's diploma ceremony June 11.

Theories have circulated about why this is, but the brain science behind them has been scarce. \"A vast ma- jority of what we know comes from very sterile, single- person studies done in an MRI machine,\" said Joseph Baker, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford and a lead author of the study. The other lead author is re- search associate Ning Liu, PhD. Scanning pairs To figure out how cooperation is reflected in the brains of men and women who are actively cooperating \u2014 rather than just thinking about cooperating while lying in a machine \u2014 the Stanford researchers turned to a technique called hyperscanning. Hyperscanning in- volves simultaneously recording the activity in two peo- ple's brains while they interact. And instead of using an MRI that requires participants to lie perfectly still and flat, the scientists used near-infrared spectroscopy, or NIRS, in which probes are attached to a person's head to record brain function, allowing them to sit upright and interact more naturally. The 222 participants in the study were each assigned a partner. Pairs consisted of two males, two females or a male and a female. Then, while wearing the NIRS probes, each person sat in front a computer, across the table from their partner. Part- ners could see each other, but were instructed not to talk. In- stead, they were asked to press a button when a circle on the computer screen changed color. The goal: to press the button simultaneously with their partner. After each try, the pair were told who had pressed the button sooner and how much sooner. They had 40 tries to get their timing as close as possible. \"We developed this test because it was simple, and you could easily record responses,\" said Reiss. \"You have to start somewhere.\" It isn't modeled after any particular real-world cooperative task, he said. Sex influences both behavior and brain On average, male-male pairs performed better than female-female pairs at timing their button pushes more closely, the research-ers found. However, the brain activity in both male-male and female- female pairs was highly synchronized during the activity, meaning they had high levels of \"inter- brain coherence.\" \"Within same-sex pairs, increased coherence was correlated with bet- ter performance on the cooperation task,\" Baker said. \"However, the loca- tion of coherence differed between male-male and female-female pairs.\" Surprisingly, though, male-female pairs did as well as male-male pairs at the cooperation task, even though they didn't show coherence. Since the brains of males and females showed different patterns of activity during the exercise, more research might shed light on how sex-related differences in the brain inform cooperation strategy \u2014 at least when it comes to this particular type of cooperation. An exploratory study \"This study is pretty exploratory,\" Baker said. \"This certainly isn't probing cooperation in all its manifestations.\" There could be other cooperative tasks, for instance, in which female-fe- male pairs best males. And the researchers noted they hadn't measured activity in all parts of the brain. \"There are a lot of parts of the brain we didn't assess,\" Reiss said, point - ing out that interbrain coherence may have been pres- ent in other regions of the brain that weren't examined during the task. As they continue to study what in the brain underlies cooperation, the scientists' results could help explain how cooperation evolved in humans \u2014 and whether cooperation was selected for differently in males and females \u2014 as well as inform methods that use biofeed- back to teach cooperation skills. \"There are people with disorders like autism who have problems with social cognition,\" said Baker. \"We're absolutely hoping to learn enough information so that we might be able to design more effective therapies for them.\" Other Stanford authors are research associate Xu Cui, PhD; former postdoctoral scholar Pascal Vrticka, PhD; and Manish Saggar, PhD, and Hadi Hosseni, PhD, both instructors in psychiatry and behavioral sciences.

The task force strongly recommends screening adults 50 to 75 for colorectal cancer, as it reduces the risk of dying from the disease. Unfortunately, one-third of people in that age group have never been screened, so we are miss- ing an important opportunity to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer. 2 How should people decide which screening method is best for them? oweNS: What really matters is that people get screened. There are several options that are effective, so we recommend that people discuss the options with their clinician. There are direct visualization tests, like colonoscopy, and stool-based tests, like fecal immuno- chemical testing. Each test has different strengths and limitations, and people may prefer one approach over another. For example, colonoscopy can be done every 10 years, but FIT testing should be done every year. But the real message is, choose an approach in consulta- tion with your clinician and get screened. 3 The task force found that once adults reach age 76, the benefits of screening become smaller and the potential for harm is greater. What should older Ameri-cans consider in deciding whether to be screened? oweNS: We recommend individual decision mak- ing for patients ages 76 to 85. The benefits are smaller because a person's chance of dying of other causes goes up as they get older. The harms are still small but increase with age, pri - marily because the risks of the potential complications of colonoscopy (bleeding, perforation and infection) go up with age. Still, some people in this age group will ben- efit from screening. People most likely to benefit are those who have not been screened before; people who are healthy enough to undergo treat - ment for colorectal cancer, should it be found; and people who do not have other diseases or conditions that limit their life expectancy substantially. 4 African-Americans have the highest incidence of colorectal cancer among all racial and ethnic subgroups. Should this group consider more frequent screenings? oweNS: The task force recognizes the burden that colorectal cancer has on African-Americans, who are at higher risk of being diagnosed with and dying from the disease than other racial/ethnic subgroups. We don't know why this is \u2014 more research is needed in this area. The task force did not find enough evidence to conclusively support that making a different recom- mendation specific to African-Americans would result in a greater net benefit for this population. So our recommendations are intended to apply to all racial/ethnic groups. More robust efforts are needed to ensure that at-risk populations actually re- ceive the screening tests and the follow-up treatments or interventions they need, as people are dying unnecessarily from this disease. 5 What data did the Task Force use to come to its conclusions? oweNS: We commissioned a comprehensive, system- atic review of the available evidence on the benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening. The task force also commissioned a modeling study from the Cancer In- tervention and Surveillance Modeling Network to help it better understand different screening strategies, such as the optimal age to start or stop screening, and the length of time between screenings. The evidence is con - vincing that screening reduces the risk of dying from colorectal cancer. iSmDouglas Owens on colorectal cancer screening Colorectal Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States, after lung cancer, yet many Americans are still loathe to be screened for the disease. Guidelines released by the U.S. Preventive Services T ask Force strongly recommend that adults ages 50 to 75 be screened for colon cancer, and suggest adults ages 76 to 85 make individual decisions about whether to be screened, depending on their overall health and prior screening history. The recommendation and several accompanying edito -rials were published online June 15 in JAMA. The recommendation from the independent body of national experts in prevention and evidence-based medicine also emphasized that colonoscopy is one of many screening options available. Douglas K. Owens, the Henry J. Kaiser, Jr., Professor and director of the Stanford Center for Health Policy and Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research, was a member of the task force when the guidelines were developed and co-authored the recom- mendation.
