Candles have been in existence for a very long time! Aromatherapy candles are natural candles made with essential oils. As they burn, the candle disperses the essential oils' scent and healing properties throughout your room. Essential oils have various therapeutic qualities which you may incorporate into your day-to-day life. Depending on the candle scent, the aroma can be uplifting, reflective, or relaxing to the mind. Most commonly, aromatherapy candles aim to aid the [emotional side of our well-being](https://www.essentialoilhaven.com/essential-oils-and-emotions/). Most essential oil candles also like to use natural waxes as the candle base. Paired with natural soy wax as the base, these essential oil candles make a 100% non-toxic product. Use your aromatherapy candles for any occasion you like! From dinner parties to a steaming hot spa-at-home bath, these beauties are never out of place! Best Essential Oils for Candles Every essential oil has its own properties and wellness benefits. No matter the situation, there's probably an essential oil that can help. But some essential oils lend themselves more to candle-making than others. Specifically, most top-note essential oils won't work very well on their own in a candle. Their evaporation time span is too short. [Blend them with a base note](https://www.essentialoilhaven.com/blending-essential-oils/) in a custom mixture. After that though, the possibilities are endless. Natural scents for candle making are so wonderful! I like to make candles that use essential oils that go with the season: - Fall: Sweet Orange, Cassia, Cinnamon, Balsam Fir, Cardamom, Cedarwood, Bergamot. - Winter: Lavender, White Fir, Peppermint, Eucalyptus, - Spring: Geranium, Palmarosa, Yuzu, Juniper Berry. - Summer: Lemon, Lime, Grapefruit, Mandarin. First, settle on which oil (or oils) would suit best for your ailments, mood, or situation. Then, head over to your essential oils stash, and get mixin' to create your perfect aromatherapy scented candles! Of course, both single oils and pre-made oil blends work equally well for candle making. Single essential oils, as well as blends are readily available from several [reputable essential oil companies](https://www.essentialoilhaven.com/best-essential-oil-brands/). Are Essential Oils Flammable in Candles? Essential oils on their own are flammable. Don't add essential oils directly into an already burning candle. In candle making, the essential oils are blended into the waxes and other oils. Together, this mixture will not be flammable. How much Essential Oil to add to Candles If you're familiar with essential oils, you'll know that there is a proper ratio to how many essential oils to use in your recipes. You'll need to observe [this essential oil dilution chart](https://www.essentialoilhaven.com/essential-oil-dilution-guide/). Essential oils are extremely concentrated substances, and you want to avoid using them too strongly. The ratio for essential oil candles is 3 oz. solids to 35-40 drops of essential oils. This creates a scent that is pleasant, strong, and lasts through multiple uses of your candle. If you want to make your essential oil candles smell stronger, you don't necessarily need more drops of oil. You may be using oils that are top notes and thus evaporate quicker than other oils. [Check our resource on essential oil blending](https://www.essentialoilhaven.com/blending-essential-oils/) and try a mixture of different oils. The scent may last longer! How to Make Your Essential Oil Candle These candles scented with essential oils contain no toxic ingredients. Cassia and Orange Essential Oil Candle Ingredients - 1 \u00bd oz (3 Tbsp) Soy Wax - \u00bd oz (1 Tbsp) Beeswax - \u00bd oz (1 Tbsp) Coconut Oil (solid) - 35-40 drops of Essential Oils* - 1 Wick - 2-3 oz jar or similar container * NOTE: If you're following this recipe with the [Simply Earth Essential Oil Subscription box](https://simplyearth.com/?rfsn=1761756.c6adb4f), you'll be using 30 drops of Orange essential oil, and 10 drops of Cassia. Candle Making Instructions Follow these basic instructions on how to make your own essential oil soy candles. - Melt the solids (soy wax, beeswax, and solid coconut oil) in a double boiler. - Right when the mixture has fully melted, remove from the heat. - Stir in essential oils and blend for 30 seconds. - Dip the bottom of the candle wick into the melted wax and use this to adhere the wix to the bottom of the container. - Prop wick upright, and pour the wax into the container. - Allow the candle to cool completely. Trim the wick to \u00bc\" height above the wax. - Burn the candle within sight and away from flammable objects; and out of reach of children and pets. How to Dress Up Your Candles for DIY Gifts You can make your essential oil candles in any cute container you have around home. Scour your local thrift store for glass containers that need a second life! Also, short mason jars work great. If you're batch-making essential oil candles as gifts, you may like to buy a set of uniform containers, such as [these ones from Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07NJMKFKP?psc=1&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=eoh-diy-tips-20&linkId=159c5e57ab4346d5c0edbbd7171638a0&language=en_CA&ref_=as_li_ss_tl).
