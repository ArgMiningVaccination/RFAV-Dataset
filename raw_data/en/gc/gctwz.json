People all over the world are buying these beautiful natural stones for their own personal use, fashioning them into bracelets and necklaces to wear during the day and even placing them in their homes. The question is: how do they work? In this post, we'll explore what makes crystals so special. We'll also look at some common ways to use crystals. Crystals and Energy There are a lot of different healing crystals out there, and they all have their own unique properties. But what makes them so effective? Crystals have an energy that's easy to feel when you hold them. It's not just in your mind\u2014it's real! That energy can be harnessed to help your body's energy field, also known as your aura. One of the best ways to do this is through meditation with crystals at your side. Think of it this way- crystals originate from the core of the earth, where energy is powerful and potent. How could that energy not be programmed into the stones?! Healing Crystals + The Chakras The seven main energy centers in the body are known as chakras. The word chakra means wheel or disc. Chakras are like energy centers that receive information from the body, mind and spirit and send this information to different parts of the body for use. The chakras interact with one another and work together to help balance our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. The healing crystals you choose to use can be used alongside other healing therapies such as yoga, meditation or massage therapy. These crystals may help remove blockages within your aura or meridians which can contribute to physical ailments like muscle pain and stress. For instance, lepidolite is known as the \"valium stone\" because of its ability to help calm and soothe anxiety. Believe it or not, lepidolite is actually a source of lithium! How do healing crystals work? Healing crystals can be used in healing sessions, meditation, rituals and massage. They simply vibrate at a high frequency because they most often originate from the core of the earth where energy is abundant and potent. So by holding or meditating on them you raise your own vibration so that you can start to feel better. Crystals are like little tuning forks that resonate with the seven main chakra centers (energy centers) of our body. When we use a crystal to meditate or hold it during a session, it resonates with one of these chakras and sends out healing energy for us to absorb into our body which helps raise the vibration of our bodies and the environment around us. Where should I place my healing crystals? You can place your healing crystals anywhere you feel most comfortable, whether that's in a room or on your body. You can also use them to make the energy in your home work for you. Here are some ways to use them: - In a room. If you want to focus the energy of your crystals and create a space where it's easier to relax, try putting them in corners of rooms (where feng shui says there should be water elements) or on your altar if you have enough wall space available for them. - On your body. Crystals are small enough to fit into pockets and jewelry without feeling bulky\u2014perfect if you want something portable that acts as a focal point when meditating or doing yoga! - Under your pillow (optional). This is a good way to surround yourself with healing energies while sleeping at night; simply tuck the stone underneath layers of fabric so it doesn't roll around during sleep! - Crystal grids are popular and effective for amplifying energy as well. - Want to bring good energy to the outdoors? Adorn your garden, yard or even balcony with (sun safe) crystals! - Looking for a spiritual experience in the water? Utilize water safe crystals (like the Quartz varieties) in or near your bath! What are some of the most common healing crystals? There are many types of crystals and stones that can be used for healing, but there are a few common ones that you may want to consider. These include amethyst, rose quartz, citrine, carnelian, hematite, agate and quartz. Other common popular healing stones include sodalite, obsidian, moldavite and jasper. How to Choose the Best Healing Crystal for You If you're new to crystals, the first step is to find one that matches your energy. If you're drawn to a crystal, it's likely that it will resonate with your energy and bring more peace into your life. To find a crystal that resonates with your energy, hold the various stones, one at a time. If different types of stones make you feel relaxed and calm, those are probably good ones for you! When choosing crystals for healing purposes, remember that what helps one person may not work for someone else\u2014so don't be afraid to experiment with different stones until you find something that works best for what's going on in your life right now!
