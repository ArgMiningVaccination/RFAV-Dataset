Homeopathy is an effective & safe treatment that is gentle yet extremely effective when used properly. Homeopathy is based on the principle of the \"law of similars.\" In other words, a substance that could cause symptoms in large amounts can facilitate healing in minute homeopathic doses. Let`s look at some examples: Coffee taken full strength acts as a stimulant and can make it hard to sleep; but the remedy Coffee Cruda, which is the homeopathic for of coffee, can help with insomnia. The homeopathic remedy Allium Cepa (Red Onion) is used to treat the runny nose and watery eyes that occur with a cold or hay fever, the very symptoms it would cause if one were cutting a red onion in the kitchen. There are hundreds of remedies that homeopathic practitioners use. Who can use Homeopathy? Homeopathy is a natural safe form of healing for acute and chronic conditions and they do not cause the side effects associated with standard medicine. Homeopathic remedies come in different potencies or strengths. Some homeopathic remedies or homeopathic medicines are available over the counter while others must be obtained from a homeopathic practitioner. Often times people will try to use homeopathic remedies without guidance; when the remedy \"doesn`t work\" they give up on homeopathy as one valid way to facilitate healing. As a form of holistic healing, a visit to a homeopath requires precise individualization of a person's case. This means that if five patients came to a homeopathic practitioner with a diagnosis of eczema they may each be treated with a different homeopathic remedy. This is because each person's total symptom picture varies greatly.
