Key points: - Public housing tenants notified Commonwealth payments to be counted as income - This will change rate some tenants pay as rent - Opposition says State Government is 'stealing' federal money - WA Government says move designed to 'standardise' sector From late March the Department of Housing will class Commonwealth Government allowances \u2014 such as the carers' allowance and pharmaceutical benefits payments \u2014 as household income, making it part of rent calculation. The department began sending out letters this week notifying tenants of the changes, which come into effect on March 28. Those allowances are not there to be stolen or at least part of it to be stolen, by the West Australian Government to prop us its appalling budgetary mess. It said the change would create a fairer system for all public housing tenants. \"Current rent calculations mean that some tenants pay 25 per cent of their household income in rent, while others pay less than 25 per cent,\" the website said. \"Even with the change, eligible tenants will continue to either pay 25 per cent of their household income as rent or the market rent for the property, whichever is the lower amount.\" But WA Labor's Housing spokesman Fran Logan said the Government was essentially stealing Commonwealth money. \"It's a disgrace that Commonwealth money that is being paid for specific allowances are now being used \u2014 they're not just being used they're being stolen by the West Australian Government, to make housing authority tenants pay part of that for their rent,\" he said. Federal payments set to be newly classified as income also include the clean energy supplement and the large family supplement. Other payments that had previously been assessed at a lower percentage, but would now be subject to the 25 per cent calculation, include family tax benefit, child maintenance, and youth allowance. Mr Logan said there had been no indication of the changes prior to this week, and questioned the thinking behind them. \"This should have been announced clearly in the May 2015 budget, so that people could have actually budgeted for it themselves in their own household income,\" he said. \"Further, it would have given an opportunity for the Federal Government to respond ... and give their point of view. \"Those allowances are not there to be stolen, or at least part of it to be stolen, by the West Australian Government to prop up its appalling budgetary mess.\" Move to 'standardise' public housing sector Housing Minister Colin Holt defended the changes, saying they were first signalled in last year's budget. \"It's taken a while for [the Department of] Housing to work their system to ensure they can move to this new setting,\" he said. The 2015 budget did flag the Government's intent to pursue a standard 25 per cent rental rate for public housing properties, but it contained no information about any proposals to include Commonwealth payments as assessable income. Mr Holt said the Government already heavily subsidised public housing, and the moves were designed to standardise the sector. He said the timing of the move had nothing to do with the state's finances, and that tenants had had suitable advance notice. \"How much time do you give people?\" he said. \"We flagged it in the budget last year. We're implementing the changes and telling them about it now. \"It's going to be another two months before it's implemented. \"You've got to make a move at some point in time and that's what "}
