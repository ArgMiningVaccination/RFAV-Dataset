Organic herbs are obtained from plants which have not been chemically treated and the soil is usually certified to be chemical free for a certain number of years. Many wildcrafted herbs are organic by nature, however, they may not be backed by the certificate. This does not mean the herb is poor quality - it simply means that the farm/harvester did not have the herb certified as organic. The certification process is quite costly and as such, organic herbs are priced much higher than conventional herbs. With some herbs, using conventional instead of organic may not pose any concern. With other herbs, however, you may want to make sure the herb is of organic quality, especially when the plant/fruit is known to be heavily sprayed with pesticides. No products found at this time "}
