You can make an appointment to get vaccinated if you haven't already. At some locations you can get vaccinated without an appointment. If you want a repeat vaccination, you can call [0800 7070](tel:0800-7070) for an appointment. Vaccination makes it less likely that you will be become ill from a coronavirus infection or infect other people. Get vaccinated Vaccinated with BioNTech/Pfizer or Moderna If you are aged 12 to 17 and live in the Netherlands, you will be given the [BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine](https://www.cbg-meb.nl/documenten/publicaties/2022/12/21/vaccin-in-het-kort-comirnaty-herhaalprik-biontech-pfizer---english). If you live on Saba or St Eustatius, you may be given the [Moderna vaccine](https://www.cbg-meb.nl/documenten/publicaties/2022/12/21/vaccin-in-het-kort-spikevax-herhaalprik-moderna---english). You can't choose which vaccine you are given. Both vaccines offer good protection against coronavirus disease (Covid-19). After you have been vaccinated, the chance that you will become ill with Covid-19 is very small. But you should still follow [the basic advice to avoid infection](/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands/preventing-respiratory-infections), like washing your hands often and well. This is important, because you can still pass on the virus to other people. Side effects of Covid-19 vaccination You may experience side effects after being vaccinated. Common side effects are: - a sore upper arm - feeling tired - muscle ache - a headache - a fever If you experience a side effect that's not on this list or you're worried about the side effects you're having, call your family doctor. They can give you advice. Vaccination and fertility Getting vaccinated against Covid-19 does not make you infertile. It is also safe to get vaccinated if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. Repeat vaccination Repeat vaccination refreshes your immune response. You can still get coronavirus, but the chance that you will become very ill is much smaller. Repeat vaccination makes your immune system respond faster if you are exposed to coronavirus. This is because you will have more antibodies in your body after getting a repeat vaccination. This also makes it less likely that you will infect someone in an at-risk group. It is not yet known exactly how long this protection lasts. You can get the repeat vaccination if it has been at least 3 months since your last vaccination or coronavirus infection. To make an appointment, call [0800-7070](tel:0800-7070) or go to [coronatest.nl/en](https://coronatest.nl/en). Informed consent or permission for vaccination Aged 16 or 17? If you are 16 or 17 years old, getting vaccinated is your own decision. Under 16? If you are younger than 16, getting vaccinated is a decision you should make together with your parents or carers. If you and your parents cannot agree, you have the final say about whether you get vaccinated. If you come to the vaccination centre without a parent or carer, you will be asked whether you talked to them about getting vaccinated. You do not need to show written permission from your parents. "}
