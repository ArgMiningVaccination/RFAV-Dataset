Cohen Expressive Therapies Capstone Theses This paper analyzes State of Flow, the definition codified by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and analyzes how Flow as a concept has developed in current psychological and artistic research, alternative therapies, and mainstream medias. This paper also views existing Dance/Movement Therapy frameworks such as Body-Mind Centering and Kestenberg Movement Profile to see how Csikszentmihalyi's definition could integrate into current Dance/Movement Therapy practice, as well as looks at Laban Movement Analysis and its future in Dance/Movement Therapy. This thesis also examines how gender and neurodivergence may impact how one can experience State of Flow. [Using Drama Therapy To Foster Peer Support Among Nurse Leaders](http://digitalcommons.lesley.edu/expressive_dissertations/127), 2023 Lesley University Using Drama Therapy To Foster Peer Support Among Nurse Leaders, Chyela Rowe Expressive Therapies Dissertations This study explored the use of drama therapy to support the social-emotional experiences of nurse leaders at a mid-sized regional hospital system in the Southeastern United States. Nurse leaders have experienced profound changes to their work environments in recent years and burnout has been at an all-time high among healthcare workers globally. Organizational supports for nurses and nurse leaders are both inadequate to meet the needs and under-resourced. The research questions explored 1) whether the drama therapy peer support initiative improved outcomes and 2) whether there was a significant relationship between measures, and 3) what nurse leaders described as facilitators ... [Eco-Interoception: What Plants, Fungi And Protista Have Taught My Body](http://scholar.smu.edu/art_etds/23), 2023 Southern Methodist University Eco-Interoception: What Plants, Fungi And Protista Have Taught My Body, Sara Riley Dotterer Art Theses and Dissertations To me, ecology is the relational, full-body awareness that I am made up of and deeply connected to everything around me; and for better or worse, this is reciprocal. I form ecotones, an ecological transitional zone between two ecosystems, with the world around me. I use this ecotonal lens to blur binaries and dissolve boundaries between me and the world \"outside my body.\" During my Masters of Fine Arts at Southern Methodist University, I have continuously explored and represented the lives of various more-than-human species outside of my body, including plants, fungi and protista through an ecotonal lens.

[Improvement On The Slopes: The Impact Of An Adaptive Snow Sports Program On Children And Young Adults With Disabilities](http://scholarlyexchange.childrensmercy.org/researchdays/GME_Research_Days_2023/ResearchDay5/10), 2023 Children's Mercy Kansas City Improvement On The Slopes: The Impact Of An Adaptive Snow Sports Program On Children And Young Adults With Disabilities, Stephanie Green, Mark T. Fisher, J Eichner, Matthew J. Mclaughlin Research Days Background: Adaptive downhill skiing has been described as a fun, safe, engaging recreational activity for those with disabilities (Sterba, 2006). There are numerous ways the alpine skiing can be modified to meet these athletes' needs. For instance, athletes can use tethered skis, horizontal poles held by their instructors, or modified walkers. For those that have poor standing balance, or are non-ambulatory, sit-skis are an option, with or without outriggers to add additional support and balance for athletes with poor trunk stability or core strength. These options provide equal and accessible alternatives for those with disabilities to get out and enjoy ... [The Breath As A Holistic Regulator: An Expressive Arts Therapy Community Project](http://digitalcommons.lesley.edu/expressive_theses/683), 2023 Lesley University The Breath As A Holistic Regulator: An Expressive Arts Therapy Community Project, Jacobita Munoz Expressive Therapies Capstone Theses This capstone offers the idea that evolution has challenged appropriate breathing and led humans to breathe incorrectly, thus negatively affecting their physical and mental health. As breath can damage the body, it can also serve as a regulator of the mind and body. This thesis points out the multiple effects when uniting controlled respiration, drumming and nature sounds. Breathing, music and nature have many things in common. These include repetition, pattern, awareness of the present moment and relaxation. They all contain a rhythm, and they offer self-regulatory skills. Music-based expressive arts therapies intervention is postulated to provide breathing techniques, united ... [Enacting Stories: Discovering Parallels Of Narrative And Expressive Therapies, A Literature Review](http://digitalcommons.lesley.edu/expressive_theses/747), 2023 Lesley University Enacting Stories: Discovering Parallels Of Narrative And Expressive Therapies, A Literature Review, Zoe Reddig Expressive Therapies Capstone Theses This literature review will analyze the use of narrative therapy (NT) techniques, dance/movement therapy (DMT) techniques, and expressive therapy (ET) techniques in an effort to distinguish where theoretical parallels exist between these methods of counsel. Narrative therapy is a postmodern framework of counseling that assists clients in resisting damaging stories that have been embedded through bioecological systems of exposure throughout development. Narrative therapy structures its philosophy through processes of externalization and deconstruction, and encourages the process of reframing or re-authoring one's personal self-narrative. At their core, DMT and ET already utilize components of foundational NT practices, through processes of enactment, ...

Research led to mindfulness as a possible solution defined as an intentional regulation of attention and awareness of the present moment. This project sought to see if mindfulness practices could be utilized to mitigate the effects of burnout in medical assistants. It was hypothesized that mindfulness could be a solution. ... [Enhancing The Quality Of Life For Senior Citizens: A Facilitator'S Guidebook For Mindful Music And Movement](http://digitalcommons.lesley.edu/mindfulness_theses/71), 2023 Lesley University Enhancing The Quality Of Life For Senior Citizens: A Facilitator'S Guidebook For Mindful Music And Movement, Shannon Sexton Mindfulness Studies Theses Music appreciation and enjoyment enhance well-being throughout the lifespan. The challenges and constraints that people experience as they age can lead to lack of access to music, decreased physical activity, and fewer avenues for creative expression. Group music and movement interventions created for older populations offer opportunities for social connection and improved quality of life. Mindful practices add further benefit when combined with these interventions. Current available programs are scarce and most often do not encompass mixed modalities. In addition, the benefits of these programs do not show long-term sustainability. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the effects ... [Dance/Movement Therapy As A Holistic Approach To Diminish Health Discrepancies And Promote Wellness For People With Schizophrenia: A Review Of The Literature](http://jdc.jefferson.edu/fmfp/69), 2023 Thomas Jefferson University Dance/Movement Therapy As A Holistic Approach To Diminish Health Discrepancies And Promote Wellness For People With Schizophrenia: A Review Of The Literature, Jacelyn Biondo Department of Family & Community Medicine Faculty Papers Individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia face a myriad of obstacles to wellness, beginning with diagnostic discrepancies including over- and misdiagnoses on the schizophrenia spectrum. People with schizophrenia experience profound amounts of stigmatization from the general population, their healthcare providers, and even themselves. Such stigmatization creates a barrier for wellness, poorer prognoses, and often limits adherence to physical and mental healthcare. Moreover, it can exacerbate the already stifling symptomatology of their diagnoses, including specific bodily-related symptomatology. Oftentimes, a diagnosis of schizophrenia disrupts one's relationship with their body including a diminished mind-body connection, decreased interoceptive awareness, and "}
