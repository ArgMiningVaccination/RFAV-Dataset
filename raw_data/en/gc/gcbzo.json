It was created by Dr. John Myers who used it to treat symptoms of chronic conditions such as asthma, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and migraines. Myers Cocktail helps to alleviate chronic symptoms like inflammation, low calcium levels, fatigue, anxiety and stress and restore balance to your mind, body and soul. The Myers' Cocktail is a nutrient cocktail invented by John Myers, a physician from Baltimore, Maryland. The \"Cocktail\" includes magnesium, calcium, B-vitamins (including B12), and Vitamin C and is given by a slow IV push or slow infusion to achieve concentrations of nutrients that are not obtainable with oral administration. The famous mixture of vitamins and minerals, including magnesium, calcium, B-Vitamins, B-complex and Vitamin C, is delivered intravenously. The Myers' Cocktail works by increasing the blood concentration of several essential vitamins and minerals beyond that which can be achieved when supplementing orally. For example, Vitamin C given intravenously has been found to reach blood concentrations more than 50 times greater than what can be achieved when given orally. Key Ingredients in the Myers' Cocktail Magnesium Chloride Helps in the prevention of inflammation, and is also important in supporting a robust immune system. Magnesium chloride is also beneficial in the treatment of asthma, migraines, and high blood pressure. Calcium Gluconate Helps to boost blood calcium, an essential element in building strong bones. Vitamin B Complex The eight B vitamins in B complex are crucial for promoting healthy hair and skin, preventing memory loss, and managing stress. Vitamin C Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that can strengthen your immune system. [Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12805247/) show that consuming more vitamin C can increase your blood antioxidant levels by up to 30%. This blend of ingredients has a range of benefits and work together to boost your overall health and wellness. Health Benefits of Myers' Cocktail - A Stronger Immunity to Beat Colds and Flus - Due to the high dosage of Vitamin C one of the primary benefits of a Myers' IV is to strengthen your immunity and ward off frequent colds and flu. - Better Nerve Health to Fight Fibromyalgia - Vitamin B12 plays a key role in nerve health, and a deficiency in the body is associated with nerve damage that could lead to fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a condition that affects how nerves send impulses to muscles, and therefore a good dosage of Vitamin B12 can help boost nerve health and possibly reduce fibromyalgia symptoms. - Improved Memory - Deficiencies in Vitamin B12 and Vitamin C are associated with poor memory performance and your ability to recall information. As the brain ages, it starts to lose neurons that store memories, which ultimately leads to memory loss. Although this process cannot be halted, it can be slowed down through regular treatments of Vitamin B12 and High Dose Vitamin C. - Supports Bone Health - Calcium Gluconate is used to prevent or treat low blood calcium levels and it can be used to treat conditions caused by low calcium levels. Calcium plays a very important role in the body. It is necessary for normal functioning of nerves, cells, muscle, and bone. If there is not enough calcium in the blood, then the body will take calcium from bones, thereby weakening bones. Having the right amount of calcium is important for building and keeping strong bones. - Boosted Energy Levels - B complex vitamins play an essential role in your body's energy production. Vitamin B12 in particular has energy-boosting traits that when taken, can immediately help you feel more energized. - Help Prevent & Treat Migraines - Studies have found that people who suffer from migraines are more likely than others to be magnesium deficient. There is also evidence to suggest that it can also provide relief from an acute migraine attack more quickly and effectively than a common medication. - Improves Blood Health & Circulatory System -Healthy blood is rich in iron and is made up of healthy and numerous red blood cells. Vitamin B12 plays a central role in the production of red blood cells, while Vitamin C aids red blood cells to absorb iron and can help significantly reduce bad cholesterol. Low Vitamin C levels can hamper iron absorption, leading to anaemia. - Improved Mood and Vitality - Serotonin plays an important role in mood regulation, and Vitamin B12 plays an important role in the synthesis of serotonin. Healthy levels of serotonin can help your mood be properly regulated. A well-regulated mood can ward off depression, anxiety, and other mood-related conditions. Myers Cocktail helps to alleviate chronic symptoms like inflammation, low calcium levels, fatigue, anxiety and stress and restore balance to your mind, body and soul. Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Overview When a high dose of NAD+ is delivered directly into the bloodstream by way of intravenous (IV) infusion, it help bypass the digestive system for efficient absorption. The NAD+ can help repair cells throughout the body including neurons in the brain. The NAD+ Therapy allows your cells to produce more energy and may optimize many cellular functions throughout the body. Since NAD+ is such a powerful molecule in the body, high dose IV therapy can be helpful for many different physical and mental conditions. Patients who have participated in NAD+ Therapy reported increased energy, mental clarity, focus and concentration, improved mood, memory, eyesight and hearing as well as decreased pain and withdrawal symptoms. Several recognized non-redoxroles: Important in cell nuclear DNA repair and telomere maintenance. NAD and NAD+ occur naturally in your body. They play a major role in the chemical process of generating energy. NAD+ is probably the most important co-factor for improving mitochondrial Mitochondria powerhouses\") where macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats from food) are converted to energy-rich ATP molecules for the cell. NAD helps the liver break down fats that are essential to provide energy for the body. It also helps create ATP, which is a major source of energy for cells. Boosting NAD+ may help manage a wide spectrum of diseases, ranging from diabetes to cancer. When NAD+ is given by IV (intravenous), some research has shown it can improve mental clarity, alertness, concentration, and memory. Moreover, NAD+ infusions may improve athletic endurance and reverse the symptoms of chronic fatigue. Glutathione Overview Glutathione is an antioxidant produced in cells. It's comprised largely of three amino acids: glutamine, glycine, and cysteine. Glutathione levels in the body may be reduced by a number of factors, including poor nutrition, environmental toxins, and stress. Its levels also decline with age.In addition to being produced naturally by the body, glutathione can be given intravenously, Glutathione protects cells from free radical damage and helps improve cellular function at all levels (immune function, hormone levels, mitochondrial function, etc.) As people develop chronic illness, glutathione levels decrease. Maintaining adequate glutathione levels is not only critical for wellness but also aids in the recovery process . Glutathione benefits is -Reduces oxidative stress Oxidative stress occurs when there's an imbalance between the production of free radicals and the body's ability to fight them off. Too-high levels of oxidative stress may be a precursor to multiple diseases. These include diabetes, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis. Glutathione helps stave off the impact of oxidative stress, which may, in turn, reduce disease. Our bodies' quintessential antioxidant defense is the glutathione system, which includes glutathione itself, along with the enzymes and other proteins that enable glutathione to do its work. Glutathione is actually, a very simple molecule\u2014our body makes it from three amino acids\u2014cysteine, glycine and glutamine. It is incredibly versatile\u2014a universal toxin-binder. Glutathione is extremely important for maintaining intracellular health. Levels of glutathione have been shown to diminish substantially with age as well as with chronic illness and poor health. Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant that's made in the body's cells. Its levels decrease as a result of aging, stress, and toxin exposure. Boosting glutathione may provide many health benefits, including reduction of oxidative stress. "}
