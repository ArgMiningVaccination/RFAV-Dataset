New data emerges daily, but here's what we know so far. When it comes to COVID-19 treatments, keep your eye out for possible interactions. The FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the drug baricitinib in combination with remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19. Baricitinib is a substrate of OAT3, and dose adjustment is recommended when used with strong OAT3 inhibitors. [Quercetin](https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/professional.aspx?productid=294) is a flavanol that's been touted in combination \"cocktails\" for COVID-19. But it has shown strong OAT3 inhibition potential in vitro. There's also some theoretical evidence that it might interact with remdesivir. While these are only theoretical interactions at this point, it's something to watch out for, especially in patients with renal impairment and severe COVID-19. Keep in mind that EUA drugs haven't been thoroughly evaluated in clinical research the way other drugs have, which limits our knowledge about clinically relevant drug interactions. Thus, practitioners should be cautious about starting any type of \"cocktail\" in patients that are using EUAs. Additionally, before starting inpatient treatments, such as anticoagulants, make sure to ask about any natural medicines that were used at home that [might increase ](https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/tools/charts/chartdisplay.aspx?classificationID=4) [the risk of bleeding](https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/tools/charts/chartdisplay.aspx?classificationID=4) or [interact with medications](https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/tools/interaction-checker.aspx). Regarding COVID-19 vaccines, we still don't know definitively whether anti-inflammatories will reduce the immune response to a COVID-19 vaccine. Because data on this is limited, and vaccines are in short supply, tell patients to avoid using any natural anti-inflammatory supplements, such as [turmeric](https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/professional.aspx?productid=662) or [ginger](https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/professional.aspx?productid=961), in greater than food amounts on the day of vaccination. You might also hear about using natural medicines as vaccine boosters. For now, don't recommend this. Currently, the two approved COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA vaccines. There's no evidence on how natural immune boosters might affect the immune response to this type of vaccine.
