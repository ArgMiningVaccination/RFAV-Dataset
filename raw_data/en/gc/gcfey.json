Pressly and Oscar John Snyder-- targeted Philadelphia as a future home for an osteopathic medical college. While the \"City of Brotherly Love\" had a rich history of medicine, it had but one \"osteopathist\" by the time Pressly and Snyder graduated in 1898 and 1899, respectively. The two doctors of osteopathy (DOs) followed through with their vision, incorporating Philadelphia College and Inrmary of Osteopathy (PCIO) on January 24, 1899. They rented two rooms in the Stephen Girard Building at 21 S. 12th Street\u2014the rst of many homes for the College\u2014and opened their doors to students and patients. In September 1899 the rst PCIO degree was awarded to a transfer student; the rst PCIO \"class, \" comprised of one woman and one MD, graduated in February 1900. It was not long before the early graduates formed an alumni association. The word of osteopathy spread quickly in Philadelphia. As the number of students and faculty grew, the College moved to larger quarters, establishing its rst \"campus\" at 33rd and Arch Streets, a suburban neighborhood in West Philadelphia. In a mansion surrounded by grassy lawns, a tradition of student life started with the organization of athletics, professional societies, fraternities and sororities. By 1906 the College opened the Osteopathic Dispensary at 1617 Fairmount Avenue, forerunner of the Osteopathic Hospital of Philadelphia. The College moved to 1715 N. Broad Street (1908-1912), then to 832 Pine Street in the city's Society Hill section, where a hospital would come to fruition at 410 S. Ninth Street. The College prospered and moved through a number of sites in its rst century, including Spring Garden, 48th and Spruce, and nally, City Avenue. During this growth period, the osteopathic medical curriculum intensied, osteopathic research was initiated, and clinic and hospital services grew rapidly as the medical school's student body and faculty expanded dramatically. Osteopathic medicine is one of the fastest-growing healthcare professions in the United States. Approximately one in four medical students attends a college of osteopathic medicine. More than 151,000 osteopathic physicians and medical students are an integral part of America's health care delivery system. Today, all treatment modalities are available to osteopathic physicians, who may prescribe drugs, perform surgery and specialize in any area of medicine. DOs, whose primary care training prepares them to be highly skilled diagnosticians, are represented throughout the United States and in all branches of military service. The addition of non-DO academic programs to the curriculum starting in the early 1990s began a new era of diversication for the College. In 1993, the College launched a graduate program in biomedical sciences and signaled the development of a graduate school. A range of clinically- focused, collaborative master's and doctoral-level programs and degrees are presently offered at the College today. In 2018, the organization of the graduate school expanded to two schools: the School of Professional and Applied Psychology and the School of Health Sciences. The programs of study under the School of Professional and Applied Psychologyinclude counseling psychology, mental health counseling, school psychology, clinical psychology, educational specialist and organizational development. The programs of study under the School of Health Sciences are forensic medicine, biomedical science, physical therapy and physician assistant. In 2005, the College opened a branch campus in Suwanee, Georgia, with a focus on helping to ll the need for more healthcare professionals in the South. Renamed PCOM Georgia in 2019, the location offers professional doctoral and master's degree programs. In 2017, PCOM received initial approval from the American Osteopathic Association's (AOA) Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) to establish an additional location in Moultrie, Georgia. PCOM South Georgia welcomed its inaugural class of DO students in August 2019. In 2020, PCOM South Georgia expanded its academic offerings to include a biomedical sciences program.

These rights and responsibilities of students on nancial aid are listed in this Student Handbook, the pcom.edu website, on the internal myPCOM website, the internal Self- Service system, and the Master Promissory Note. Students have the right to know the: Financial aid programs available at PCOM, the process which must be followed to be considered for aid, criteria used to select recipients and calculate need, PCOM's refund and repayment policy, the Ofce of Financial Aid policies surrounding satisfactory academic progress, and special facilities and services available for students in need of special accommodations. Students must: complete all forms accurately and by the published deadlines, submit information requested in a timely manner, inform PCOM of any changes in address, name, marital status, nancial situation, or any change in student status, report any additional assistance from non- PCOM sources such as scholarships, loans, fellowships, and educational benets, notify any change in enrollment status, maintain satisfactory academic progress, and re-applying for aid each year. An estimated budget for the total cost of attendance is published on the PCOM website. Additional information may be obtained from individual departments. Student retention and completion data is maintained by the Registrar's Ofce. Our Title IX Coordinator provides information and assistance to students with disabilities who are in need of special accommodations. This ofce should be contacted for additional information.

Packaging Process With the exception of Federal Stafford unsubsidized loans and Federal Graduate PLUS loans, federal nancial aid is awarded on the basis of nancial need. When the student's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is processed, a formula is applied to the information that the student provided to calculate the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The formula is established by law and is used to measure the student's nancial strength based on their income and assets. The student's Federal EFC is used in the following equation to determine the student's nancial need: Cost of Attendance - Expected Family Contribution (EFC) = Financial Need Federal need-based awards are awarded to students who have the lowest EFC and therefore the highest nancial need. Of course, many need-based federal resources are limited and awards are made to those18 Financial Aid and Scholarships students who satisfy all of their nancial aid requirements on a rst- come, rst-serve basis. For the awarding of institutional resources, PCOM has chosen to use an Institutional EFC. This EFC takes into account the Federal EFC but also considers other nancial factors that are made available to the college. For most students, their Institutional EFC is usually higher than their federal EFC. Unlike the federal EFC, the institutional EFC is not reported to the student but rather is an internal calculation done by the Financial Aid Ofce to allocate its limited resources to those students who it deems to have the highest nancial need. Federal Student Loans Federal Direct Stafford Unsubsidized Loan The annual amount awarded varies by a student's program and year. The aggregate lifetime borrowing limit varies by program. There is no credit check required for applying for this loan. The interest rate is calculated using a base 10-year Treasury Note Index plus an add-on amount and is known as \"variable-xed, \" meaning students would receive a new rate with each new loan, but that rate would be xed for the life of the loan. July 1st is when the rate is set for the year. Please note that interest accrues while the student is enrolled in school and during other periods of nonpayment. The student may pay interest or allow it to accrue while attending school. Also, note that interest is capitalized upon repayment meaning that the interest accrued is added to the principal amount of the loan. More details can be found on our Federal Student Loans (http:// www.pcom.edu/about/departments/nancial-aid/types-of-aid/loans/ federal-student-loans.html ) webpage. More information on the Federal Direct Stafford Unsubsidized Loan can be found at studentaid.gov (https://studentaid.gov/). Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan The annual amount awarded can be up to a student's Cost of Attendance minus other nancial aid (loans, scholarships, and federal work-study) awarded. The Graduate PLUS loan has no aggregate lifetime borrowing limit. A credit check is required during the application process of this loan on studentaid.gov (https://studentaid.gov/ ). If the student does not pass the initial credit check, they can appeal the decision or use a credit- worthy cosigner. The interest rate is calculated using a base 10-year Treasury Note Index plus an add-on amount and is known as \"variable-xed, \" meaning students would receive a new rate with each new loan, but that rate would be xed for the life of the loan. July 1st is when the rate is set for the year. Please note that interest accrues while the student is enrolled in school and during other periods of nonpayment. The student may pay interest or allow it to accrue while attending school. Also, note that interest is capitalized upon repayment meaning that the interest accrued is added to the principal amount of the loan. More details can be found on our Federal Student Loans (http:// www.pcom.edu/about/departments/nancial-aid/types-of-aid/loans/ federal-student-loans.html ) webpage.More information on the Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan can be found at studentaid.gov (http://www.studentaid.ed.gov/ ). Non-Federal Private Student Loans Every year, the Ofce of Financial Aid reviews the private preferred lender list. During this time, the ofce will take meetings with various lenders and solicit materials for our staff to review. After we have collected this information, the ofce will collectively admit the various lenders deemed as reputable and benecial to the PCOM community. The ofce will still encourage students to research alternative, non- federal graduate and medical student loans from private banks and credit unions independently in order to nd the best loan given their personal circumstance. Private student loan interest rates, interest accrual, annual amounts, aggregate amounts, and various other loan policies vary between each private lender. It is important for students to discuss all loan details and conditions with the lender. The annual amount can be awarded up to the student's Cost of Attendance minus other nancial aid (loans, scholarships, and federal work-study) awarded. The aggregate lifetime borrowing limit varies by lender. Most lenders offer xed and variable interest rates. A credit check is required for applying for private student loans and having a cosigner can dramatically improve the interest rate. Information can be found on our Private Student Loans (https:// www.pcom.edu/about/departments/nancial-aid/types-of-aid/loans/ non-federal-private-student-loans.html ) webpage and for Student Loans (https://www.pcom.edu/ about/departments/nancial-aid/types-of-aid/loans/third-party-student- loans.html ).

In the event that there are not enough eligible fourth- year medical students, then awards are made to third-year students who meet the same criteria. The annual amount can be awarded up to the student's Cost of Attendance minus other nancial aid (loans, scholarships, and federal work-study) awarded. The amounts awarded to students will vary by funding available. This loan has a xed interest rate set by the federal government and interest does not accrue while the student is enrolled in school and during other periods of nonpayment.

The PCL will be awarded to fourth-year DO students2022-2023 Academic Catalog 19 who have successfully completed both the COMLEX 1 and COMLEX 2 board exams. The student also must have matched in a primary care residency program. Eligible students will be identied in mid-March after residency match has occurred. Students are required to meet with a nancial aid counselor who will fully explain the advantages and possible disadvantages to this loan. A letter will be signed by the student to ensure they understand the disadvantages. The amount of PCL awarded will be based on the amount of federal student loans that the student borrowed in their 4th year of medical school. The PCL is a need-based loan and students must submit parental income information on the FAFSA in order to demonstrate nancial need. Independent students do not have to provide parental nancial information, but must be at least 24 years of age and must provide documentation showing the student has been independent for a minimum of 3 years. The PCL has a low xed interest rate of 5.0% determined by the federal government. Interest does not accrue while the student is enrolled in school and during other periods of nonpayment.

Students will repay these loan funds directly back to the institution by making payments to ECSI (http:// borrower.ecsi.net ), PCOM's third-party on the PCL here: https://bhw.hrsa.gov/funding/schools-apply-loan-program Super Primary Care Loan (Super PCL) Depending on the availability of funding, Primary Care Loan recipients may also be eligible for additional PCL funds to repay prior student loans in previous years of medical school at PCOM. Terms, conditions, and nancial need criteria of the Super PCL are the same as the standard PCL. Award amounts vary upon the availability of funding. Federal Work-Study (FWS) Federal Work-Study (FWS) is a federally subsidized program designed to promote part-time employment of nancially eligible students. If FWS is part of a student's nancial aid package, the student may work on campus or for the public interest with an off-campus public or private non-prot organization. Eligibility for FWS is determined by the Ofce of Financial Aid. This opportunity is awarded to students who: 1.Have completed the FAFSA 2.Demonstrate need 3.Meet all other requirements for Title IV aid 4.Enrolled at least half time (3 credit hours) Students awarded FWS cannot work during their regularly scheduled classes. Incoming students may not begin to work until their rst scheduled day of enrollment. The total amount a student earns cannot exceed his or her FWS allocation. If the student earns the work-study allocation they are instructed to contact the nancial aid ofce to request additional funds if they qualify and if funds are available. Students are not permitted to have more than one work-study position at a time. Federal Work-Study positions have no job involved in religious worship or sectarian instruction. During the academic year during enrollment, eligible students may work up to 20 hours per week. During the summer of non-enrollment eligible students may work up to 40 hours per week. All FWS students are paid $18 an hour with the exception of some qualifying students working in our community service practice are paid $20 an hour. Students are paid bi-weekly. All students are required to use their PCOM badge to clock in and clock out each day they work at the time clocks located in various areas of the campus. All students on FWS and supervisors are responsible to make sure hours are accurate as well as report inaccurate hours if there is a discrepancy in output. It is a federal offense for a student or an employer to falsify any information on a student's payroll record and may result in termination. Each pay period timekeepers in their respective departments approve the hours worked via Kronos. (HR software that allows for automated timekeeping).

Children (under the age of 26) of veterans who died while serving in the military may also qualify for benets. www.gibill.va.gov (http://www.gibill.va.gov ) Financial Aid Over Award There are two methods PCOM uses to limit a student's aid: total aid and need-based aid. The limit for total aid is called the Cost of Attendance (COA). The limit for need-based aid is gross need. If a student exceeds either or both of these limits a correction will be made to bring the student within the limit. This correction could result in the student possibly owing funds back to the institution. 2022-2023 Academic Catalog 21 How are limits calculated? Institutions are required to develop a reasonable COA - both direct and indirect costs that incur in the regular order of being a student. The total aid received by the student must not exceed this amount. Federal regulations stipulate that a student receiving need-based awards cannot receive assistance in excess of one's gross nancial need as determined by the analysis of the information submitted on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA will calculate a student's Estimated Family Contribution (EFC). The COA less the EFC is the gross nancial need. How do they occur? Over awards are usually the result of the student receiving aid that the Ofce of Financial Aid was not aware of when it completed the student's nancial aid package and/or processed a loan application for the student. It is the student's responsibility to provide written documentation indicating additional resources to the Ofce of Financial Aid. This should be done as soon as the student becomes aware that he or she will receive the aid. The institution must account for all sources of aid, even if they are not processed directly through the Ofce of Financial Aid. Over awards can also result from application errors by the student or the Ofce of Financial Aid. Regardless of the reason for the over award, the institution is bound by Federal regulation to correct the over award. Exceptions cannot be made for anyone. How are they corrected? As it relates to the COA limit, the institution will adjust aid in the following order: Federal Loans, Private Loans, Federal Work Study, PCOM Scholarships, and External Scholarships. As it relates to the Gross Need limit, the institution will reduce aid in the following order: Federal Work Study, PCOM Scholarships, and External Scholarships. Cost of Attendance A student's cost of attendance, or nancial aid budget, is the sum of the following: Tuition Comprehensive school fee Class dues (not applicable to all programs) Books and supplies Instruments and equipment (not applicable to all programs) Medical exam costs (not applicable to all programs) Health insurance Room/rent UtilitiesFood/groceries Transportation Personal Each year the college compiles information from its biannual student cost of attendance surveys along with information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) to determine the amount of increase/decrease, if any, which should be made to each program's cost of attendance. Usually, the new cost of attendance information is made available on the PCOM website for the upcoming school year in March. Professional Judgment In certain circumstances, a student might incur a recurring or one-time expense that is educationally-related and that is not already included in the student's standard cost of attendance. As a result, the student can appeal by writing a letter to request that this expense be included in their cost of attendance and therefore allow the student to obtain additional nancial assistance (usually additional loan funding) to help them pay this expense. Documentation of the expense is required for each appeal. When considering these appeals, the PCOM nancial aid ofce uses a very high standard to determine if the expense was unavoidable, if the expense was reasonable, and whether or not the expense was directly related to helping the student obtain their educational degree or certicate. The most common examples of budget increase requests include a one-time cost for a computer purchase and ongoing dependent care expenses. Final approval will need to be determined by the Chief Student Services Ofcer, the Debt Management Counselor, or an Associate Director of nancial aid. Disbursement Procedures Student loans and most other aid will electronically disburse toward students' PCOM tuition/fee charges on the rst date of enrollment at the beginning of each term by the bursar. If you borrow more funds than tuition/fees, the PCOM Bursar Ofce will then release the remaining \"living expense refund\" funds to you 7-10 days after your rst date of enrollment for the term. After PCOM processes your refund, allow 1-3 additional business days for your bank to deposit the funds into your bank account. If you are not signed up for direct deposit through the PCOM Bursar Ofce, please allow 3-5 business days for your refund check to arrive via postal mail from PCOM. Living Expense Refund Policy When a student's loan or scholarship funding is received by the PCOM Bursar Ofce, any balance due to PCOM will be deducted from the amount of the funds. Any nancial aid funding leftover after paying the student's balance will then go to the student as a \"living expense refund check\" via postal mail or direct deposit. All living expense refunds are issued by the PCOM Bursar Ofce. To ensure that you receive your nancial aid refund on time, make sure you have completed all items listed on your myPCOM Financial Aid Checklist. The nancial aid disbursement date is generally the start of classes/ rotations each term. Please note that vacation periods do not count as a class or rotation for nancial aid refund purposes. Upon the disbursement date, a student's loan and scholarship funds pay electronically to PCOM toward the student's tuition & fee charges. If a student's aid disbursement generates a credit balance, the PCOM Bursar22 Financial Aid and Scholarships Ofce will then process the refund about 7-14 business days after the disbursement date. After PCOM processes your refund, please allow 1-3 additional business days for your bank to deposit the funds into your bank account. If you are not signed up for direct deposit through the PCOM Bursar Ofce, please allow 3-5 business days for your refund check to arrive via postal mail. If you wish to sign up for direct deposit of nancial aid living expense refunds, please complete the direct deposit form and return to the PCOM Bursar Ofce along with a voided check or bank statement. Pending Loan Advance (PLA) Requests A student is eligible for a Pending Loan Advance up to 15 days prior to the disbursement of the student's nancial aid for the upcoming term. The student needs to have completed all requirements to accept their nancial aid. To request, a student must complete the online form on myPCOM's Financial Aid and Billing (https://my.pcom.edu/web/home/ naidbilling-stu/ ), but nal approval is required by an Associate Director or Director of Financial Aid. The amount of eligibility will be based on the student. A counselor can speak with the student in person or over the phone to inform the student about any possible future decit of funds for the upcoming quarter and, if necessary, recommend that the student make spending adjustments to eliminate the decit. The student is asked why they need a PLA on the Pending Loan Advance Form. If the stated reason is an expense that could not otherwise be included in the student's cost of attendance or approvable as a budget appeal, the counselor will deny the request. The maximum amount available for a loan advance to a particular student will be limited to the lesser of the following: $2,000 for both graduate and professional students. Amount requested. Amount approved by counselor after a review of budget and aid for upcoming term. The student is limited to one PLA per academic year. If a student has an emergency situation that is unavoidable, the student can meet with the Debt Management Counselor or Chief Student Services Ofcer to discuss a possible 2 nd PLA for the academic year. If approved, the Director will make it very clear that no additional PLA will be approved for the remaining academic school year. There is no charge for PLA requests. Tuition Refund Policy If a student withdraws from classes within seven weeks from the start of the term, a pro-rata refund or tuition credit may be authorized by the PCOM Bursar Ofce. In the case of full withdrawals, the effective date of withdrawal is the date on which the student led with the dean a written notication of withdrawal or a request for a leave of absence. For courses not conducted on a weekly schedule, summer sessions, and for clinical clerkships/preceptorships in the medical and physician assistant programs, the refund is prorated according to the percent of the clerkship, preceptorship or course completed as indicated in parentheses below:During rst week of class (up to 5% of instructional time) 0% Term Charge | 100% Credit During second week of class (more than 5% but no more than 10% of instructional time) 10% Term Charge | 90% Credit During third and fourth week of class (more than 10% but no more than 25% of instructional time) 25% Term Charge | 75% Credit During fth through seventh week of class (more than 25% but no more than 50% of instructional time) 50% Term Charge | 50% Credit Withdrawal after seventh week of class (more than 50% of instructional time) 100% Term Charge | 0% Credit Exceptions to this refund policy may be made in certain unusual situations permitting PCOM to return more than the prescribed refund amount. Examples of such situations may include, but are not limited to: academic dismissal where the student was allowed to continue into the next term before a determination about academic status could be made, serious illness, injury obtained while at a clinical rotation, or being called to military service. No fee or portion of a fee is refundable. The refund policy is subject to change at the discretion of the Board of Trustees, but in no instance will such a change become retroactive. All federal nancial aid funds are credited or returned by the PCOM Financial Aid Ofce in compliance with the Federal Return Policy Schedule. A student's total Cost of Attendance is based on certain enrollment. When a student drops courses, The PCOM Financial Aid Ofce will likely reduce the student's total Cost of Attendance. Often this results in no additional allocation of refund money to the student. Contact the PCOM Bursar Ofce for additional information regarding the Tuition Refund Policy. Return of Title IV Funds The PCOM Financial Aid Ofce is responsible for recalculating federal nancial aid eligibility for students who discontinue enrollment during the term. Upon notication from the PCOM Registrar Ofce that a student has withdrawn from or dropped all classes, was dismissed, or is approved for a leave of absence, the PCOM Financial Aid Ofce is required to calculate the percentage of the term completed if the student received or was eligible for Title IV federal student aid (Stafford, PLUS, and Perkins loans). If the withdrawal date indicates that the student left the institution prior to completing at least 60% of the enrollment period, the PCOM Financial Aid Ofce must recalculate the eligibility for Title IV funds based on the following formula required by the federal government: 1.Percentage of payment period is the number of days completed to the withdrawal date.2022-2023 Academic Catalog 23 2.The percentage of earned aid is the percentage of the payment period completed, divided by the total number of days in the payment period or term. Breaks of ve or more days are not counted as days that are part of the term. Funds paid by federal student aid programs are returned to the appropriate program based on the percentage of unearned aid as required by the federal government: The aid to be returned is the result of the total amount of aid that could be disbursed minus the percentage of aid earned, multiplied by the total amount of aid that could have been disbursed for the payment period or term. If a student earned less aid than the amount disbursed, the institution is required to return the unearned portion of funds to the federal program(s). As a result, the student may owe a debit balance to the institution. The institution must return the amount of Title IV funds for which it is responsible within thirty days of the date of the determination of the student's withdrawal date. Funds are repaid in the following order in accordance with federal regulation: 1.Federal Direct Stafford Unsubsidized Loans 2.Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans 3.Federal Perkins Loans If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to the student account, the institution would request a post-withdrawal disbursement which must be paid within 120 days of the student's withdrawal. Right to Cancel Federal Funds A student can cancel all of or a portion of a loan disbursement within 120 days of the date the loan money is disbursed (paid out) to PCOM. If a student chooses to cancel the amount disbursed, the money received must be returned, and the student will not be charged interest or fees. Consortium Agreements The Ofce of Financial Aid maintains consortium agreements with outside institutions on a case-by-case basis. For more information about a specic consortium or setting up a new consortium, contact our ofce. Satisfactory Academic Progress The United States Department of Education requires every postsecondary institution receiving Title IV federal funds to have an academic progress policy that is used to determine eligibility for and continued receipt of federal funds. SAP policy Although this policy must apply to all students whether or not they are receiving nancial aid, the receipt of nancial aid is a privilege that creates both rights and obligations for the student. The Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy has three components: 1.The student must maintain a certain grade point average or a comparative qualitative measurement against a norm. 2.The student must complete a certain percentage of all coursework attempted. 3.The student has a maximum timeframe to complete the program.Affected nancial aid funds Title IV federal funds affected by this policy at PCOM include the Federal Direct Stafford Loan, Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan, Federal Perkins Loan, and Federal Work-Study program. Although not required by the federal government, all institutional funds are also governed by the SAP policy. SAP review schedule A review of SAP will be conducted at the end of every spring term regardless of when a student enrolls. Failure to meet any component of SAP at the end of the spring term will result in the loss of eligibility for federal and PCOM nancial aid for the next academic year. The Ofce of Financial Aid will notify the student if the student has failed to meet the standards of SAP and has lost eligibility for nancial aid. If nancial aid has already been awarded for the subsequent academic year, the offer of aid will be rescinded. How to appeal SAP eligibility A student may appeal the loss of eligibility of nancial aid and seek to be placed on a Financial Aid Academic Action Plan for one term. This appeal must be based upon either the death of a relative, a serious personal illness/injury or other extenuating circumstance. The student must be able to demonstrate that the illness/injury or extenuating circumstance had a direct impact on the student's academic performance. To do this, the student must: 1.Work with the appropriate academic program adviser and/or student progress evaluation committee to develop an academic action plan. 2.Submit a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal Form with all supporting documentation to the Financial Aid SAP Committee for review within 10 business days. The online SAP Appeal Form is located in myPCOM ( https://my.pcom.edu/ ) within the Financial Aid and Billing section. After the student's SAP Appeal Form has been submitted to the Financial Aid SAP Committee, the SAP Committee will then review and notify the student of the approval or denial of the appeal within 5-7 business days. If the student's appeal is approved, the student is granted Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation and the student will regain eligibility for nancial aid for one term. At the end of the term, the student's academic record will be reviewed. If the student is now meeting the terms of the SAP , the student will regain eligibility for nancial aid for subsequent terms. If the student has still not met the terms of the SAP , but has fullled the terms of the Financial Aid Academic Action Plan, then the student's Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation will be renewed for an additional term and the student will be awarded aid for that term. If the student has not fullled the terms of the Financial Aid Academic Action Plan, then the student will lose eligibility for federal and institutional nancial aid. Students who are dismissed or withdrawn from the school are required to be measured for Satisfactory Academic Progress upon reentry and may be required to submit a SAP appeal before nancial aid eligibility can be determined. The SAP policy will be disseminated annually to all matriculated students. Minimum GPA requirements Doctor of Psychology students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.024 Financial Aid and Scholarships Doctor of Physical Therapy students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 Graduate students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 Graduate Certicate students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 Pharmacy students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) program: Beginning with the class of 2022, students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 during the M1 and M2 years. Prior to the class of 2022, students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 70% during the M1 and M2 years. Students must achieve a passing score in all core and non-core clinical clerkships during the M3 and M4 years. Minimum course completion requirements Students must complete the appropriate percent of all courses attempted to maintain a good academic standing. The completion percentage is calculated by dividing total hours earned by total hours attempted. If a student changes degree programs, then the SAP status will be based on the academic record of the new program. Students may only change degree programs one time in order to establish a new SAP status. It is also important to understand how specic grades and/or course types count toward the completion ratio. The following grades count as attempted but not completed courses: Incomplete No Grade Reported Withdraw Failure Unsatisfactory All students at PCOM are required to maintain a 67% completion of coursework. Transfer credits will count towards a student's attempted and completed credit hours. Maximum timeframe requirements Students may not exceed the maximum time frame for a program as dened as 150% of the total amount of credit hours required to complete the degree as detailed in the course catalog (https://www.pcom.edu/ academics/course-catalogs/ ). In addition, those seeking the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree must complete their degree requirements within 6 calendar years from the date of their initial matriculation. All time enrolled counts towards the maximum time frame regardless of whether or not the student receives federal nancial aid. Attempted credits include: remedial, repeated, withdrawn, transfer and incomplete credits. Time spent in a leave of absence does not count towards the maximum time frame.File Review Database Matches, Rejection Codes, and C-Codes Our Ofce ensures the accuracy of student reported data on nancial aid applications that have been flagged by the Department of Education. Only a portion of the student population is selected and are notied on the FAFSA Student Aid Report (SAR). In addition, the student is notied via the Financial Aid Checklist. The Financial Aid Ofce may request additional information if further investigation is needed to resolve a discrepancy. All discrepancies must be resolved before any aid may be disbursed. Verication The Financial Aid Ofce of Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine veries all les that are selected for verication by the Central Processing System (CPS). A nancial aid representative may also select additional applications for verication when there is discrepant information in the application or missing information on the FAFSA. The Financial Aid Ofce noties students that they have been selected for verication by means of a \"Missing Information Email\" which also requests that students provide documents needed to complete the verication. Emails are generated 10 to 14 days prior to the institutional deadline for application completion, and 10 to 14 days prior to the term tuition due date. If there is no response from the student to the mailings, a nancial aid representative will also follow up with a phone call or email to the student. Students are expected to submit the required documents within 10 days of receipt of the notice. The student's nancial aid application is not processed further until such time that all required documents are received. The institution does not create estimated nancial aid packages using unveried data when verication is required. Documents Required From the Student IRS Data Retrieval Process Applicants selected for verication who retrieve and transfer their income tax return information using the IRS Data Retrieval Process - either when initially completing the FAFSA using FAFSA on the Web (FOTW) or through the corrections process of FOTW - will be considered to have veried the FAFSA IRS information (AGI, taxes paid, and any of the applicable untaxed income items). However, if changes were made to the transferred information or if the institution has reason to believe that the information transferred is inaccurate, the applicant must provide other acceptable documentation as included in the Federal register notice. IRS Tax Return Transcript Required If students cannot or will not use IRS Data Retrieval, either at initial FAFSA ling or through the FOTW correction process, they must document AGI, taxes paid, and untaxed income by providing an IRS tax return transcript for the student and spouse, as applicable. Verication Worksheets and Other Required Documentation The PCOM Financial Aid Ofce will provide a verication worksheet to all students who are selected for verication. These worksheets can be used to document certain items where a signed statement is required as listed below: Household Size | Verication Worksheet Number Verication Worksheet or agency documentation2022-2023 Academic Catalog 25 Child Support Paid | Verication Worksheet Income Earned from Work for NON-Tax Filers | Verication Worksheet and Form W-2 High School Completion | High school diploma or transcript, GED certicate or transcript showing 2-year completion, or home school credential or transcript Identity/Statement of Educational Purpose | Original government-issued ID and signed statement of educational purpose or a copy of that ID and the statement notarized. Timeframe All required documents must be received by the last day of the award period or the last day of the student's attendance in order to meet the institutional requirement for packaging student aid. Loans must be certied by the school using the veried EFC during the award period. Any required documentation submitted after the term of enrollment or last date of attendance will not enable processing of federal funds available to graduate and professional students. Interim Disbursements Students who are selected for verication are not packaged with federal funds until the verication is completed. Therefore, the Financial Aid Ofce does not make interim disbursements prior to verication or experience potential overpayment of Title IV funds. Verication Corrections and Student Notication The Financial Aid Ofce noties students by email when a correction makes it necessary to reprocess the FAFSA. The institution will require that the student reprocess the FAFSA with the CPS when there is a change in the EFC due to recalculation, or if veried items exceed the tolerance allowed in federal verication guidelines. The tolerance for the di#erence is no more than $25 for any veried and reported FAFSA dollar value. There is no tolerance for non-dollar items. The student will be notied by email as to what items need to be corrected as well as the veried value for that item. The student will be notied by email of the recalculated EFC or if no change is expected, as well as the impact, if any on the student's expected aid. The student's award is available in real-time to the student via the Financial Aid Checklist. Students are notied by email when a revision is made to their nancial aid package directing them to view the current award via web access. Printed revisions are available upon request. Students may meet with a nancial aid counselor in regard to corrected information and the reprocessing procedure, timeframe, and effect on the student's eligibility for aid. Overpayment of Federal Title IV Funds The institution has safeguards in place to prevent payment prior to the completion of verication. However, if overpayment should occur, funds are returned according to Title IV regulations. For example, if overpayment is a result of student ineligibility for a program or programs, funds received under those programs will be returned to the program(s) for which the student is no longer eligible.Fraud A student can commit fraud based on, but not limited to, Falsied documents or forged signatures on applications, certications, verication documents, or loan promissory notes False statements of income False statements of citizenship Use of false or ctitious names or aliases, addresses, or SSNs, including the deliberate use of multiple SSNs False claims of independent status Patterns of misreported information from one year to the next. There are difcult situations where students and/or parents purposefully misrepresent information in hopes of obtaining aid or obtaining additional assistance. The Financial Aid Ofce is required to have a policy of referral when confronted with actual or suspected cases of fraud and abuse. We refer all actions to the PCOM ofce of Compliance for best practice for each circumstance. Financial Aid Eligibility and Drug Convictions Substance Abuse Question on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) The FAFSA form asks if the student has ever been convicted of a drug- related offense. Failure to answer this question will automatically disqualify the student from receiving federal aid. Falsely answering this question, if discovered, could result in nes up to $20,000, imprisonment, or both. Under the Higher Education Act, a student may become ineligible for federal student aid upon conviction of any offense involving the possession or sale of illegal drugs while receiving Title IV federal nancial aid. Federal aid includes Federal Direct Loans, Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans, and Federal Work-Study. Federal Financial Aid Penalties for Drug Convictions Possession of Illegal Drugs First Offense: 1 year ineligibility from the date of conviction, Second Offense: 2 years' ineligibility from the date of conviction, Third and Subsequent Offenses: Indenite ineligibility from the date of conviction. Sale of Illegal Drugs First Offense: 2 years' ineligibility from the date of conviction, Second and Subsequent Offenses: Indenite ineligibility from the date of conviction. Convictions During Enrollment According to the United States Department of Education, if a student is convicted of a drug offense after receiving federal aid, he or she must notify the Financial Aid Department immediately and that student will be ineligible for further aid and required to pay back all aid received after the conviction. Regaining Financial Aid Eligibility A student can regain eligibility for federal student aid funds by successfully completing a drug rehabilitation program. To be sufcient to reinstate nancial aid eligibility, the program must include at least 2 unannounced drug tests and be recognized as a federal, state, or local26 Tuition and Fees government agency program. A student will regain eligibility on the date of successfully completing the program. Audit For Federal A-133 or any other audit, the Financial Aid Ofce will supply auditors a random sample of student les to ensure the Financial Aid Ofce is in compliance with federal, state, and institutional policies. Finance, Financial Aid, and Registrar are involved in the audit process with the Director of Financial Reporting and Planning as responsible for the overall coordinating. For Financial Aid, the Chief Student Services Ofcer is the contact person and will provide access to all items requested by the auditor. Findings will be sent to the Director and Associate Director of Financial Reporting and Planning who will then share the potential nding to Manager, Budget & Fin. Planning, the Vice President for Finance & Chief Financial Ofcer, and the Audit Committee - the Board of Directors. They will then notify the department in question to resolve the issue. Enrollment Certication Process Data is submitted to the Clearinghouse pertaining to the student enrollment status at the beginning of each term and is processed by the Registrar's Ofce for PCOM.

International applicants are not eligible to enroll in any 100% online programs at PCOM. Requirements Specic to Non-US Citizens Licensing Requirements It is the sole responsibility of a Non-US applicant to determine that he/ she will meet the eligibility requirements for national certication and state licensing. It is also the applicant's sole responsibility to determine whether any particular country will allow the practice of the profession for which a PCOM degree is received and licensing in the United States is obtained. Financial Responsibility Once an international applicant is accepted and prior to matriculation in a program at either campus, he/she is required to deposit the necessary funds into a U.S. bank account selected by Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. Employment Authorization for International Applicants It is the responsibility of the international applicant to ensure that he/she maintains all applicable terms and conditions of his/her period of stay in the United States, understands any employment- related requirement of the relevant PCOM program, and meets any requirements for receiving U.S. employment authorization. PCOM's DSO ofcer will assist students who currently have or are eligible for a Student Visa (F-1) status with all documentation required including applying approval of work hours that are required by the curriculum in which the student is enrolled and/or desired post- completion employment authorization.

Your score is considered too old, and will not be accepted, if it is more than two years old from the start of your admission term. Country of citizenship does not exempt applicants from this requirement. Language of instruction at the college or university level, and how recent it has been, are the determining factors in meeting this requirement. Applicants are exempt if: English is the exclusive language of instruction at the undergraduate level; or they have earned a degree from a regionally accredited U.S. college or university not more than ve years prior to the anticipated semester of enrollment; or they have completed at least two full-time semesters of graded course work, exclusive of ESL courses, in a U.S. college or university, or at an institution outside the U.S. where English is the exclusive language of instruction, not more than ve years prior to the anticipated semester of enrollment. \u00a9 2021-2022 Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine College of Osteopathic Medicine Admission to PCOM's Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) program is comprehensive as well as competitive.

Each letter grade, for the purpose of calculating a GPA, is assigned a numeric value. The GPA is calculated by multiplying the numeric value of the course grade by the number of course credits and then dividing the total points by the total credits taken. The Pass-No Pass grading policy is only applicable to those courses that are graded on the pass or fail basis and is not gured into the GPA. It does not apply to those courses that are graded on the letter grading scale. Cumulative GPA will be based upon the grades earned during the rst, and second professional years only. Grade Quality Points Percentage A 4.0 89.5-100 B 3.0 79.50-89.49 C 2.0 69.50-79.49 C* 2.0 Remediated Grade F 0.0 Less than 69.50 P (Pass) Not in GPA See Course Syllabus W/WP/WF (Withdraw) See Below See Below I (Incomplete) See Below See Below Withdraw (W): A student who takes a leave of absence or withdraws from the course or program prior to the midpoint of the term or course, as designated in the syllabus, will receive a W on the transcript. Withdrawing after the specied date will result in a WP or WF based on the earned grade to date. Incomplete (I): A student who does not complete the course because of excused reasons will receive an incomplete. Six weeks after the end of the term, the incomplete will revert to a failure under most circumstances. CLINICAL CLERKSHIPS (M3-M4) GRADING Final Clerkship grades are reported as Honors, High Pass, Pass, Fail. The students must refer to their respective campus's Clerkship Manual for all information pertaining to grading. Honors: Superior work exceeding expected competency demonstrated in all knowledge and skill areas, and fulllment of the requirements of the clerkship. High Pass: Above-average work with above-expected competency demonstrated in all knowledge, skill areas, and fulllment of the requirements of the clerkship. Pass: Expected competency demonstrated in all knowledge and skill areas, and fulllment of the requirements of the clerkship. Fail: Below-expected competency and/or failure to meet clerkship requirements. The nal grade for Clinical Clerkships in which a Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Achievement Test (COMAT) exam is given will be based upon the COMAT score and student performance grade in the Clerkship. The students must refer to the DO Handbook and the Clerkship Manual for all information pertaining to grading. Grading is consistent across all campuses.Doctor of Pharmacy Program Doctor of Pharmacy program grade point average is based on a 4.0 scale. Doctor of Pharmacy grading structure is as follows: Grade Quality Points Percentage A 4.0 90-100 B 3.0 80 - less than 90 C 2.0 70 - less than 80 D 1.0 65 - less than 70 F 0.0 less than 65 P Pass (does not affect GPA) RP Remediated Pass RF Remediated Failure The Pass-Fail grading policy is only applicable to those courses that are graded on the pass or fail basis. It does not apply to those courses that are graded on the letter grading scale. For letter grade determination, the nal percentage earned in the class will be rounded to the nearest whole number.

If the instructor approves the request, a written agreement is made regarding the work required and the due date. The new grade must be sent to the Registrar within six weeks of the last class. Failure to complete the assignment within six weeks will result in the Incomplete being changed to a grade of F The only exception is in Psychology where it is required that Independent Study courses and Assessment I or II must be completed by the end of late registration in order to be eligible for enrollment in the next term's course sequence. W Withdrawal Withdrawal before midpoint of the term of a course. WP Withdrawal Withdrawal after the midpoint of a course while passing. (This grade does not apply to the DO, Biomedical Science, or Doctor of Pharmacy programs) WF Withdrawal Withdrawal after the midpoint of a course while failing or unauthorized withdrawal (This grade does not apply to DO, Biomedical Science, or Doctor of Pharmacy programs) AU Audited (no course credit) Grade Point Average The grade point average is calculated by dividing the total credits attempted (excluding grades of HP , S, P , WP , WF , I, AU, W) into the sum of the products of points and credits for all courses taken. Only courses taken at PCOM are included in this calculation. Grade Reports Grades are available to all students at the end of each term via the Banner Web services in myPCOM. PCOM does not distribute paper mailers. Dropping of Courses The deadline to drop a course is the last day of the rst week of the term. Students who drop a course by this deadline will receive a 100% tuition refund. Students enrolled in the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, the Doctor of Pharmacy the Physician Assistant, and the Doctor of Physical Therapy programs are not permitted to drop one course, but are required to drop all coursework in that term. Because of the sequential nature of these programs, students requesting to be dropped from one term may be required to take a leave of absence until the following year. In these programs, consultation and approval from the program dean or program director is required. Withdrawal From Courses After Drop-Add Period Withdrawals occur after the rst week of the term. While students in other graduate programs may be permitted to withdraw from a course, it should be done with the consultation of their program director or dean. Withdrawals may change the sequence of courses to be taken. Students approved to take a withdrawal from a course up to the midpoint of a course will earn a grade notation of Withdraw. After the midpoint of the course, students will not be eligible to withdraw from a course unless there are extenuating circumstances and they are given permission from their program director or dean. The latter option will be reserved for extreme circumstances only. Course withdrawalsapproved after the midpoint of the course will carry a grade notation of WP if withdrawing when passing, or a grade notation of WF if withdrawing when failing. Students may not be permitted to continue in the program with more than one WF grade notation. These students will be reviewed by their program's Student Progress Evaluation Committee and will recommend action to the Student Academic Progress Committee for academic action. Withdrawal grades or credits are not calculated in the grade point average or earned credit hours. Auditing Courses A course audit does not provide the student with any course credit nor can it be used toward degree requirements. A course audit is noted on the transcript with a grade of AU and does not calculate into the GPA. When auditing a course the student is required to actively participate in labs, group assignments and to take examinations. For a student to audit a course, permission must be received from the dean or the program director at the beginning of the term and submitted to the Registrar's Ofce. Course audits must be declared by the rst day of the academic term. Requests to audit courses after that time will not be permitted. Audited coursework will not be eligible for federal nancial aid. If a student wishes to challenge a nal course grade, the student must follow the timelines and procedures outlined in their program of study Handbook. Progression/Promotion by Program PROGRESSION POLICIES BY PROGRAM Maximum Timeframe for Degree Completion* Maximum timeframe for completion of degree from date of matriculation (unless otherwise specied by a program's accreditor): Certicate- 3 years Master degree- 5 years Doctoral degree- 150% of the original program of study as detailed in the university catalog Leave of absences are not included in the amount of time to complete the degree program. Students who are not on an approved leave of absence or are not enrolled for two consecutive terms will be administratively withdrawn from their program. Once a student has exceeded their maximum time frame, the student must appeal if they wish to continue in their program. Only appeals that demonstrate an extreme event, out of the student's control, that directly resulted in exceeding the time frame will be considered. The appeal can be found at https://www.pcom.edu/ about/departments/registrar/. Students who exceed the time frame who do not wish to appeal can reapply to their program. The student who re-applies to their program will be required to follow the new program of study of their program (as detailed in the catalog) and will need to discuss with their program director what, if any, previously passed coursework can be utilized as part of their new program of study. Please also note that nancial aid can only be provided to a student for 150% of their program. Therefore, students in a certicate or master level program who take up to their maximum timeframe (as listed above) could46 Progression/Promotion by Program possibility lose federal nancial aid eligibility and would need to apply for private educational loan funding. Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine ACADEMIC STANDING A student is considered to be in good academic standing when they have passed all courses in the curriculum through the most recent term nal grades submitted to the registrar. ACADEMIC CONCERN A student with a cumulative GPA of less than 2.5 or whose academic performance includes one or more course failures equaling less than 3.5 total credit hours in a term is considered to be in a status of Academic Concern. A student in this status may be required to meet with faculty, attend class in-person, relinquish leadership positions, or provide frequent status updates to key faculty/ administrators. An academic concern is limited and is removed when the student meets the conditions of being in good academic standing. ACADEMIC PROBATION A student whose academic performance warrants sensitive academic monitoring and an improvement plan will be placed on Academic Probation. This status it becomes part of the student's academic record until the issue is resolved. This status is determined by the Student Progress and Evaluation Committee (SPEC) and is determined by: 1.Failure of any single course 6 credits or greater in a term 2.A combination of course failures totaling 9 credit hours (across all terms) 3.Failure of a national board examination. Students in a Probation status may be recommended to remediate a single course. Recommendations for multiple failures may include repeating the year or dismissal, depending on the student's entire academic record. Students with a failed national board examination may retake the exam within the limitations of the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME). Academic Probation is limited and is removed when the student meets the conditions of being in good standing. ACADEMIC PROMOTION M1-M2 Promotion A student may be promoted to M2 with successful completion of all M1 courses. OR a student may be promoted to M2 with fewer than ten credits of total failures and following remediation as approved and recommended to the Deans by SPEC as per policy on academic probation. A student may be permitted to repeat the M1 year or be dismissed following ten credits or more of total failures as approved and recommended to the Deans by SPEC as per policy on academic deciency. M2-M3 Promotion A student may be promoted to M3 with successful completion of all M2 courses. OR a student may be promoted to M3 with fewer than ten credits of total failures during M2 and following remediation as approvedand recommended to the Deans by SPEC as per policy on academic probation. AND demonstrated readiness for COMLEX Level 1 through current mechanisms (i.e. COMSAE performance or other exam) COMLEX Level 1 exam taken by end of Block #1 of the clinical clerkship year. A student may be permitted to repeat the M2 year or be dismissed following ten credits or more of total failures as approved and recommended to the Deans by SPEC as per policy on academic deciency. M3-M4 Promotion A student may be promoted to M4 with successful completion of COMLEX Level 1 and successful completion of all core clinical clerkships including COMAT Examinations ACADEMIC DEFICIENCY Any student who fails a course or clerkship has an academic deciency that may impact progression in the curriculum. Students should be mindful of the responsibility to address deciencies with the course director, faculty, and advisors in a timely manner. The accumulation of any failures on a transcript is subject to review by SPEC. ACADEMIC APPEALS A student dismissed from the DO program may appeal this decision according to the policies set forth in the PCOM General Student Handbook under the section Appealing an Academic Dismissal Decision ADDITIONAL INFORMATION All students should refer to the DO Program Handbook and the Clerkship Manual for additional detailed information regarding: Academic Standing, Academic Concern, Academic Probation, Professionalism Warnings, Academic Deciency including Preclinical Progression (M1-M2) and Clerkship Progression (M3-M4), and Clerkship Remediation. Students should also refer to the following PCOM Policies: Academic Standing Policy (Policy #7.005), Clerkships and (Policy #2.003), and Clerkship Grading Policy (Policy #3.002) which can be found on myPCOM. School of Pharmacy Academic Progression Guidelines: Minimum Passing Grade A minimum letter grade of C or a P for Pass/ No Pass is required to pass a course in the PCOM School of Pharmacy. Grades of D, F , and NP in any didactic or experiential course are non# passing grades. The Academic Progress Review Committee determines the extent of academic deciency by considering specic academic guidelines. Numerous parameters exist that help to maintain proper alignment of academic expectations while describing consequences of failure to achieve these requirements. The progression guidelines also dene academic probation, dismissal criteria and steps that must be undertaken to graduate from the pharmacy program. Progression and Graduation Requirements 2022-2023 Academic Catalog 47 GPA requirements Students may not progress to the next professional year until all coursework and requirements from the previous professional year have been successfully passed or, in the case of D, F , or NP grades, successfully remediated. Students must have at least a 2.0 GPA to enter the fourth professional year and to graduate. If a student falls below a 2.0 GPA, but has passed all coursework, the student may be required to repeat a course or courses at the discretion of the ADA to achieve the 2.0 GPA. Academic Progression: Milestone Progression Examinations and Capstone I Students must pass a comprehensive examination or course, or successfully remediate the comprehensive exam or course, to progress to the next professional year and graduate from the program. Students who do not pass the progression/comprehensive exam or course will be referred to the Academic Progression Review (APR) Committee for evaluation. Students may be allowed to remediate the progression/ comprehensive exam, however, the student will not be allowed to remediate the course prior to a decision regarding their academic standing in the program. For further details, please refer to the school's remediation policy. To complete the PharmD degree requirements and graduate from the program, students must pass the Capstone II course in the spring term of the fourth professional year following APPE's. Student will be given the opportunity to remediate the Capstone II course graded components. Graduation Requirements In order to graduate from PCOM School of Pharmacy, a student must successfully complete all curricular requirements with: C or better in all APPE rotations; Successful remediation for classes where a D, F , or NP was received; A minimum cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 is required in order to graduate; All coursework leading to the PharmD degree must be completed within six years of matriculation. Early Detection and Academic Improvement Plans PCOM utilizes an early detection system to identify students in academic difculty during an academic term. Students who meet the following criteria will receive an 'Academic Alert' notication via email from the School of Pharmacy Ofce of Academic Affairs and be placed on a required academic improvement plan (AIP). Students with an exam grade or a course average less than 75% following any assessment in a single course AIP may vary between courses. The details of the AIP will be provided by the ADA and the course coordinators. Students will be expected to comply with all requirements of the AIP . Failure to comply with the AIP will be considered unprofessional behavior and subject to professional conduct review. Review by the Academic Progression Review (APR) Committee Students who are not meeting academic performance standards are subject to review by the APR Committee. A student is reviewed by the APR Committee when:Receive a second course grade of D; Receive a single course grade of F , NP , or WF; Failure to obtain or maintain a current, valid Georgia Pharmacy Intern License; Are place or continued on academic probation; Remain on academic probation for two or more consecutive terms; The cumulative GP is <2.0 at the end of the third professional year. As part of the review process, the APR Committee will afford the student an opportunity to address the committee during their deliberations. A recommendation from the committee along with a rationale for their decision will then be sent to the PCOM Academic Policy and Promotion (AP&P) Committee for review. The AP&O Committee then forwards a recommendation to the Dean. The Dean will review the recommendations and make a nal decision regarding the student's academic standing. The Dean may impose sanctions including, but not limited to, academic probation repeat of a course or courses repeat of an entire year dismissal from SOP Students remain enrolled in the program in the new academic term until receipt of a decision from the Dean. Academic performance during the new academic term will not be a factor in the decision. This process may take up to 6 weeks. Academic Deciencies and Remediation Policy Didactic Courses Academic deciencies are dened as earning a non-passing grade in any course. All students who earn a non-passing grade (D, F , or NP) must be reviewed by the School of Pharmacy (SOP) APR Committee as part of the academic review process. The APR Committee will then recommend that the student either be dismissed or be placed on academic probation and allowed to resolve the academic deciency, if eligible. Eligible students will not be allowed to remediate the course prior to an APR decision regarding their academic standing in the program. Remediation requirements: Remediation of non-passing coursework is considered a privilege afforded to students; thus not all students will be allowed to remediate non-passing coursework depending on their overall academic standing within the program as well as other factors, including overall credits that can be attempted to remediate . Course remediation will occur at the discretion of the SOP Ofce of Academic Affairs (OAA) with input from course coordinators and /or recommendations from the APR Committee. If eligible for remediation, remediation sessions will occur over the summer, or in special cases, within the rst few weeks of the term following the course failure. Approved remediation plans are considered a \"required experience\" as dened in the PCOM School of Pharmacy Student Handbook. Eligibility and resolution of academic deciencies by remediation or repeat coursework Students may only remediate a maximum of 8 credits each academic year. Furthermore, students may not remediate more than 2 courses each academic year. Students who have academic deciencies in more than 2 courses, or have two courses exceeding 8 credit hour, are automatically ineligible for remediation.48 Progression/Promotion by Program For student ineligible for remediation, the academic deciency must be resolved by repeating the academic year in its entirety. Remediation must be successfully completed prior to the start of the subsequent academic year. Students must Earn a nal grade of 70% or greater to successfully remediate didactic course work, and a grade of \"P\" to successfully remediate all P/NP courses. If remediation is successful, the PCOM academic transcript will indicate the course is passed through remediation by the designation of \"RP\" on the student transcript. However, the original grade will remain on the transcript and will be used in GPA calculations. The decision regarding the nature and number of repeated courses is entirely at the discretion of the dean. Repeating any failed course may extend the student's time in the program beyond four years and may incur further expense. Experiential Courses: There is no remediation for Pharmacy Practice Experiences (PPE's). Student who earn and F , I, WF , WP , or NP on Pharmacy Practice Experiences are required to repeat the PPE, or complete experiential hours, subject to site availability and the discretion of the Ofce of Experiential Education. Repeated PPE's will be at a site different from the original site. Students who receive a grade of F , WF , WP , I, or NP on any PPE rotation will result in delayed completion of curricular requirements to progress and/or graduate from the program. Students will NOT be permitted to use an open block to retake an APPE rotation. Academic Standing Good Academic Standing A student is in good academic standing if he/she has passed all courses, including remediation, and do not meet any criteria for academic probation. Students who are dismissed for the program for academic and/or professional issues are not considered to be in good academic standing. Academic Probation Academic probation is an action taken in the interest of the student. A student who is placed on academic probation should carefully evaluate their chance of success in earning a degree in pharmacy for the SOP . At a minimum, a student should arrange to substantially increase the amount of time and effort they devote to their academic preparedness. Students are immediately placed on probation under any of the following conditions: Term or cumulative GPA is <2.0 at the end of any term. Receive a course grade of D, F , NP , or WF . Upon recommendation by the APR Committee based on academic performance. Repeating professional year coursework as a result of an academic decision or appeal. The probationary period begins the following academic term (or APPE rotation block). Removal from probation only occurs if the student has, atthe end of the probationary period, attained a term and cumulative GPA >/= 2.0, received a grade of P in all P/NP courses during the probationary period, successfully remediated all courses and met any other conditions recommended by the APR Committee or the Dean. A student is at risk for dismissal or repeat professional coursework if criteria are not met while on probation. All students on probation with academic difculty are required to meet with the ADA during the rst week of each probationary term to develop a plan to help improve their academic performance. Students on probation with academic difculty are not permitted to serve as an ofcer of any student organization afliated with PCOM or PCOM School of Pharmacy or attend any non-mandatory SOP sponsored activities. Students on academic probation are also not allowed to work in pharmacy related jobs. Students working while on probation will be referred for review of professional conduct. Academic Dismissal and Appeals Process Dismissal from the PCOM School of Pharmacy may be recommended for ANY student who meets criteria for review by APR. However, situations likely to result in suspension, restart and/or dismissal recommendation include any of the following conditions: Failure to maintain a current, valid State of Georgia Pharmacy Intern License. Receiving one or more grades less the C for all courses taken at PCOM School of Pharmacy. Failure to successfully remediate a course. Receive two or more course grades of F and/or NP in a single term. Acquiring a grade of D, F , or NP while on probation. Failure to attain a cumulative GPA >/= 2.0 at the end of the third or repeated professional year. Students who are dismissed from the program are not considered to be in good academic standing. Students dismissed for academic performance may petition for reinstatement in certain situations. Dismissal appeals procedures are detailed in the Appealing an Academic Dismissal Decision in the PCOM General Student Handbook. All reinstatements are probationary for the re-entry year. The recommendation of the subcommittee is subject to approval by the PCOM Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs, who informs the student of the app Graduate Programs (Master of Science) In the graduate programs, a grade of F (failure), U (unsatisfactory) or WF (withdrawal while failing) in any graduate course will make the student liable for dismissal from the program. A minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 is required for continuation to unconditional degree candidacy status, and conferral of the master of science degree. Doctor of Psychology In the doctoral programs, a grade of F (failure) or WF (withdrawal while failing), or 3 grades of C or U (unsatisfactory) will make the student liable for dismissal from the program. Doctoral students must achieve a B average (3.0) or higher to take comprehensive exams and to graduate from the program. PsyD students may earn no more than two grades below a B- or more than one F in any course, required or elective. In addition, students must record a B- or better in all required courses. There are several courses that require the student to achieve a grade of B. The student may be required to retake the course. This information regarding which course(s) require(s) a grade of B is annotated under the2022-2023 Academic Catalog 49 course description in the Program and Course Description section of the catalog. Each degree program also has specic requirements regarding comprehensive examinations, licensure exam passage, practicum, internship and thesis and dissertation completion. These policies are explained in detail in the student handbook for the respective program. ACADEMIC APPEAL A student who is dismissed for academic deciency may appeal the decision. Such a request or appeal must be made to the Ofce of Student Affairs within fteen business days after the student has been notied of the decision to dismiss. Students may not bring before the Academic Appeal Committee requests other than an appeal of a permanent dismissal action.

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and accompanying regulations dene a person with a disability as someone with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities such as walking, seeing, hearing, or learning as compared to most people in the general population. Functional limitation refers to the behavioral manifestations of the disability that impede the individual's ability to function, i.e., what someone cannot do on a regular and continuing basis as a result of the disability. It is the College's policy to provide reasonable accommodation for students who, through a documented assessment performed within three years of requesting the accommodation at PCOM, qualify for an accommodation(s) under the ADA. As per the ADA, the documentation must conrm that the student \"has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities\" and that the disability supports the accommodation(s) requested. Please Note: Problems such as test anxiety and English as a second language (in and of itself) are not learning disabilities and therefore are not covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, or the PHRA. Additional information regarding disability accommodations can be found on MyPCOM . Accommodations for Licensing Examinations : Students should note that many licensing agencies have a separate process for applying for accommodations for license exams. Students should check with the licensing agency afliated with their intended graduate or professional school program for their process and requirements A student with a documented disability may request reasonable accommodations. This request must be accompanied by appropriate documentation that establishes that the student has a specic disability that supports the accommodation(s) requested. All requests for information should be emailed to the Equity and Title IX Coordinator at disabilityservices@pcom.edu . The Equity and Title IX Coordinator will provide the student with the PCOM Guide to Disability Services as well as instructions for theaccommodation request process. Once all required documentation is submitted, the review process will begin. The Equity and Title IX Coordinator will notify the student of the outcome of the accommodation request, and a plan for implementing any approved accommodations will be set in motion. Once accommodations are approved, they are no retroactive. They are enacted within a reasonable timeframe going forward from the date of the accommodation approval. The Equity and Title IX Coordinator facilitates the interactive process for disability accommodations at PCOM. For more information, please email: disabilityservices@pcom.edu . A student with accommodations who misses an examination or assessment for a no-show, lateness, or cancellation must be prepared to take a make-up examination or assessment immediately upon their return to campus, unless other arrangements are made with Student Affairs or the department contact administering the testing.

Credit Hour Policy Policy Category: Academic/Research Responsible Department: Registrar's Ofce Revision: March 2021 Policy links: U.S. Department of Education Ofce of Post-Secondary Education, \"Guidance to Institutions and Accrediting Agencies Regarding a Credit Hour as Dened in the Final Regulations Published on October 29, 2010. \" This policy also reflects regulations specied in 34 CFR \u00a7600.2, \u00a7602.24 and \u00a7668.8. SCOPE : The Credit Hour Policy follows or exceeds the guidelines set by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), and the US Department of Education.54 Credit Hour Policy Middle States Commission on Higher Education1 is the same as the US Department of Education. For MSCHE compliance, an institution must maintain written policies and procedures to assign credit hours, and provide evidence and analyses demonstrating that these policies and procedures are consistently applied across programs and courses, regardless of delivery mode or teaching/learning format. POLICY STATEMENT : The US Department of Education denes \"credit hour\" as an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and veried by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than: (1) one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of class student work for approximately fteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or, (2) at least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this denition for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. \" DEFINITIONS: Academic engagement - active participation by a student in an instructional activity related to the student's course of study that is dened by the institution and includes, but is not limited to, Attending a synchronous class, lecture, laboratory activity, face-to-face or online Participating in simulated patient exercises or objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) Submitting an academic assignment Taking an assessment or exam Participating in an interactive tutorial, webinar, or other interactive computer-assisted instruction Participating in a group project or online discussion Interacting with an instructor about academic matters during a learning activity Asynchronous learning activity - instruction using instructor created resources such as narrated PowerPoints, written material, or videos. Students are given an opportunity to comment and discuss the material through various media, i.e. face-to-face, video conferencing, chat room discussions. The amount of student work expected in any asynchronous learning activity must be determined to assign a credit hour based on at least an equivalent amount of work represented in the credit hour denition. Carnegie unit - a time-based reference for measuring educational attainment; typically equivalent to 1 credit hour or 1 hr (50 minutes) instruction each week for 15 weeks; At PCOM, this is equal to 12.5 hrs or 750 minutes of instruction per term. Case studies, online scenarios, simulations - examination and exploration requiring critical thinking skills which relate to course objectives. Simulations refer to a realistic looking clinical sim lab room with manikins and equipment that allows studs to practice and develop clinical reasoning experiences. Credit hour - In-person instruction sessions per term or the equivalent for mixed instructional methods that equals 12.5 60-minute hours, 15 50- minute hours, or 750 minutes. These are all equal. Credit hour calculation - the number of hours (or minutes) of course instruction (see equivalency chart) divided by 750 minutes. Included activities for credit hour calculations - activities should Be related directly to the objectives of the course/program Be measurable Have the direct oversight or supervision of the faculty member responsible for the course Be equivalent of an activity conducted in the classroom Dissertation research - guided project with specic learning objectives that is instructor mediated; student and instructor collaborate using electronic methods and/or face-to-face meetings to research, analyze, synthesize and prepare project with instructor providing guidance and feedback. Distance education - An educational activity characterized by separation of the faculty member from the student by either distance or time or both. If student learning outcomes and assignments for an online course are the same as those used when the course is offered face-to-face and distant students are required to regularly engage with the instructor and other students (discussion boards, synchronous sessions, etc.), then the credit hours are the same. If expectations are not the same, additional information is required to calculate credit equivalency. The following denitions also pertain: Distance education course: a course in which 50% or more of the contact hours are completed using distance education modalities and less than 50% of the contact hours included face-to-face interaction between the student and the faculty member. Distance education program: a program in which 50% or more of the required courses, not including clinical education courses, are distant education courses. Interactions between the faculty member and students should be regular and substantive interactions. Regular interactions are predictable and scheduled opportunities for substantive interactions . Homework/out-of-class assignments - The federal denition includes this in the 2 hrs preparation and must be listed separately if exceeding 2 hrs per 1 hr face-to-face instruction; typically, these activities are not included in credit our calculations. Hybrid courses - courses offered in a blended format with 1 or more face-to-face class sessions and at least one or more online sessions, both containing direct interaction with a PCOM faculty member. Online sessions equal less than 50% of the course. PCOM faculty members demonstrate through the course syllabus that the content and activities equate to a standard assignment of lecture credit. Independent study - courses of study in which a PCOM faculty member regularly interacts and directs student outcomes with periodic contact. Minimum credit hours are based on lecture contact minutes with face-to- face meetings and student work. Instructional equivalency - online and other types of instructional time that may include traditional or blended instruction. Any course that does not meet face-to-face for all instructional credit hours must contain an instructional equivalency chart. Instructional time - any regularly scheduled instruction or examination and does not include vacation, homework, orientations, or counseling. Internship - work in an organization to gain experience and satisfy degree qualications. Online/blended learning - these formats may not conform to specic face-to-face time expectations; they must maintain comparable quality, time, and student learning outcomes.2022-2023 Academic Catalog 55 Online courses - courses offered entirely online without regard to face- to-face meetings. These courses have the same learning outcomes and substantive components of a standard lecture course with alternative deliver method. Contact time is satised by several means which can include, but is not limited to, the following: a.) regular instruction or interaction with a PCOM faculty member once a week for each week the course runs. b.) academic engagement through interactive tutorials, group discussions moderated by faculty, virtual study/project groups, engaging with class peers and computer tutorials graded and reviewed by faculty. Regular and substantive interactions - predictable and scheduled opportunities for engaging students in teaching, learning, and assessment and include at least two of the following: Provide direct instruction Assess or provide feedback on a student's coursework Provide information or respond to questions about the content of a course or competency Facilitate a group discussion regarding the content of a course or competency Other instructional activities approved by the institution's or program's accrediting agency. Repeatable credit - A course that a student is allowed to take multiple times for credit up to the maximum specied. This is typically reserved for those courses that either have rapidly changing content, instruction is different with each offering or where student participants receive advanced and sequential instruction depending on individual skill level (e.g., physical tness, elective rotation experiences, independent studies, etc). Research - students conduct experiments, perfecting skills, and practicing skills in a manner analogous to a research or workplace laboratory under the supervision of an instructor. Research may be part of an existing series of projects or a project that is more independent to fulll the requirements of a degree. Skill laboratories - any psychomotor focused activity in a clinically- representative setting to observed, learn, and practice to build skills and condence to apply the same skills in a direct care clinical setting. Students may be videotaped practicing the skills to use for review, practice, and improvement. Skill laboratories may precede simulation experiences. Internship - training designed to provide the student with intensive experience with supervision. Synchronous learning activity - instructor led face-to-face or scheduled web conferencing instruction. Thesis research - guided project with specic learning objectives that is instructor mediated; student and instructor collaborate using electronic methods and/or face-to-face meetings to research, analyze, synthesize and prepare project with instructor providing guidance and feedback. POLICY: For each hour of instruction, the expectation is that the student will spend two hours in preparation (federal denition). For example, a 1-credit course is expected to provide 12.5 hrs (750 mins) of instruction and 25 hrs (1500 mins) of preparation.2 Credit for other instructional activity formats is detailed in the Instructional Equivalency Table. Procedure to Determine Amount and Level of CreditThe faculty is responsible for the curriculum. Credit values for courses are determined at the department level based on faculty expertise and course objectives. It is recommended that A table is created for each course listing each type of learning activity (see Denitions) and contact hours. Using the Instructional Equivalency Chart, the hours of instruction and credit appropriate for the course. Sample calculation method: (number of scheduled hours including equivalency hours x 50 minutes)/750 Faculty should consult with the Registrar if unsure of determinations. The Curriculum Committee is required to review the calculations and forward any approved changes and information to the Registrar for proper entry into the PCOM course management system and University Catalog. Each annual review of courses and syllabi should review hours of instruction and appropriate assignation of credit. Only when course information is received by the Registrar's Ofce and appropriately documented is the course approved for delivery. Review process - the Curriculum Committee will review the credit hour allocation for each course prior to the course being approved for the next academic year or term. Interpretation Authority - Resolution of any discrepancies in credit hour allocation will be determined by the Registrar.

For more information, please visit the Ofce of Civil Rights (https://www2.ed.gov/about/ofces/list/ocr/aboutocr.html). Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) places certain limitations on the disclosure of personally identiable student information maintained by PCOM with respect to students; limits access to academic records; and gives students certain rights with respect to educational records, including the right to access, the right to obtain copies, the right to seek correction of such records through informal and formal internal procedures, and the right to place a statement in such educational records explaining any information that they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. Directory Information PCOM considers certain information to be \"directory information\" under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and, therefore, subject to disclosure without prior consent of the student. Unless written objection is received by the Registrar, the College will treat the following as directory information to be released at the discretion of the Registrar's Ofce: student name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date and place of birth, enrollment status dates of attendance, major eld of study, Dean's list, degrees and awards received and names of undergraduate and/or graduate schools attended, internships and residencies. Right to Withhold Disclosure Under the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, currently enrolled students may withhold disclosure of directory information. The Registrar's Ofce must receive written notication from a student indicating the information to be withheld. Should a studentdecide to inform the institution not to release certain information, any future requests for such information from non-institutional persons or organizations will be refused. Decisions about withholding any information should be made very carefully. PCOM will honor each request to withhold any of the categories of information indicated by a student. However, the College cannot assume responsibility to contact a student for subsequent permission to release them should requests be received. PCOM assumes that failure to request the withholding of directory information indicates approval for disclosure. Right to Consent to the Disclosure of Personally Identiable Information All personally identiable information related to a particular student other than directory information is considered Condential information and may not be released without the written consent of the student. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions: Other schools to which a student is transferring Specied ofcials for audit or evaluation purposes Appropriate parties in connection with nancial aid to a student Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school Accrediting organizations To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena PCOM's Registrar will make reasonable attempt to notify the student Appropriate ofcials in cases of health and safety emergencies State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specic state law School ofcials with legitimate educational interest (including but not limited to administrative, supervisory, academic, research or support staff) National Board of Medical Examiners (NBOME) - a school ofcial is determined to have a legitimate educational interest if the information requested is required for that ofcial to: Perform appropriate tasks that are specied in his/her position/ description or contract/agreement Perform a task related to the student's education Perform a task related to the discipline of a student Provide a service or benet relating to the student or student's family such as health care, counseling, job placement or nancial aid The school ofcial is not authorized to share this information with a third party without the student's written permission. Such information, when it has fullled its original purpose, should be returned to the originating ofce. All other access to a student's record is granted in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Right to Inspection and Review of Records When the student matriculates, the Ofce of Admissions will forward the following materials to the Registrar's Ofce. Information retained in the le is as follows:2022-2023 Academic Catalog 57 Current application AACOMAS prole (DO students) CASPA prole (PA students) PharmCAS students) Transcripts Standardized test scores (e.g., MCAT , GRE, MAT) Letters of acceptance and prepayment Completed Technical Standards form Previous applications and decision-related correspondence All other materials in the applicant le are purged in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. A current or previously enrolled student has the right to inspect and review his or her education records maintained by the school. This right does not extend to applicants, those denied admission, or those admitted who do not enroll. A ten day written notice must be submitted to the Registrar's Ofce. The Registrar's Ofce will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. Other data accrued during the student's tenure at the College including, but not limited to, transcripts, NBOME Board scores, academic status letters (e.g., probation, warning, dismissal), course related forms (e.g., withdrawal), name change, and change of status documentation will be placed in the student's le. Transcripts or grade reports from other institutions, copies of scores from national tests (MCAT , NBOME Board scores, Praxis, etc.) and/or any other third party material will not be released by PCOM. Students must contact the institution that issued these documents to obtain copies. Right to Amendment of the Educational Record Under FERPA, an eligible student has the right to request that inaccurate or misleading information in their education records be amended. While a school is not required to amend education records in accordance with an eligible student's request, the school is required to consider the request. If the school decides not to amend a record in accordance with an eligible student's request, the school must inform the student of their right to a hearing on the matter. If, as a result of the hearing, the school still decides not to amend the record, the eligible student has the right to insert a statement in the record setting forth their views. That statement must remain with the contested part of the eligible student's record for as long as the record is maintained. However, while the FERPA amendment procedure may be used to challenge facts that are inaccurately recorded, it may not be used to challenge a grade, an opinion, or a substantive decision made by a school about an eligible student. FERPA was intended to require only that schools conform to fair recordkeeping practices and not to override the accepted standards and procedures for making academic assessments, disciplinary rulings, or placement determinations. Thus, while FERPA affords eligible students the right to seek to amend education records which contain inaccurate information, this right cannot be used to challenge a grade or an individual's opinion, or a substantive decision made by a school about a student. Additionally, if FERPA's amendment procedures are not applicable to an eligible student's request for amendment of education records, the school is not required under FERPA to hold a hearing on the matter.Complaints regarding alleged violations of rights accorded students by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act or the regulations promulgated thereunder may be directed in writing to: Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Ofce Department of Education Room 4511, Switzer Building 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, D.C. 20202 For more information, visit http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ ferpa/index.html ( http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/ ) Institutional Diversity Statement INSTITUTIONAL DIVERSITY STATEMENT As active citizens in a multicultural world, the PCOM community cultivates an environment of inquiry, inquisitiveness and respect, promotes discovery and celebration of our differences and fosters appreciation of the rich social fabric that binds us together.

Evans Hall Medical and graduate students receive hundreds of instructional hours in the two amphitheaters in Evans Hall that accommodate 250 and 235 students. The building was dedicated in 1973 in honor of H. Walter Evans, DO, a distinguished professor of obstetrics and gynecology. Both lecture halls have superb audiovisual capabilities, including video and computer presentation equipment, and the teaching system can link to Internet resources. Several classrooms and conference rooms are equipped for full two way video conference broadcasts. The seven levels of Evans Hall also house the College library, Ofce of the Provost, Student Affairs, Admissions and Clinical Education. Faculty ofces throughout the building are combined with laboratories where faculty, graduates and students pursue instruction and research. The Anatomy Laboratory, which accommodates 250 students simultaneously in the cadaver dissection lab, is recognized as one of the most advanced teaching laboratories in the nation. The architecture of Evans Hall incorporates the teaching of large classes with the enrichment of student-teacher relationships through the use of small classrooms. Evans Hall is equipped with varied and sophisticated instructional media, exhibit areas and electronic communications equipment.

It recognizes that the neuromusculoskeletal system is of major importance to human life. The interrelationship between this and other body-systems is a basic part of osteopathic philosophy. An emphasis on primary care, health maintenance, prevention of disease and attention to the neuromusculoskeletal system is key to osteopathic medical education and practice. Universally accepted today, these attributes were considered unorthodox when Dr. Andrew Taylor Still (1828-1917) objected to the crude medications of his time and sought to enhance the body's inherent healing through manipulation. The osteopathic physician incorporates evaluation and treatment of the musculoskeletal system as a basis for an approach to health and disease, combining it with the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities used by general scientic approaches to the healing arts. Like their MD counterparts, DOs must be licensed in the states where they practice, and additional board certication in specialties further underscores their professional credentials. All 50 states and the District of Columbia provide for the unlimited practice of medicine and surgery by osteopathic physicians. Licensing boards are usually composed of senior members of the osteopathic profession. In some states, MDs and DOs participate in combined licensing boards. THE OSTEOPATHIC PHILOSOPHY This philosophy provides the osteopathic physician with a unique way of looking at health and disease. These premises include the following: The human body is a unit in which structure and function are reciprocally interdependent. 2022-2023 Academic Catalog 65 The body, through a complex system, tends to be self-regulating and self-healing. The adequate function of body systems depends on the unimpeded flow of blood and nerve impulses. The musculoskeletal system is a major body system, and its importance exceeds that of mere framework and support. There are musculoskeletal components to disease that are not only manifestations of the disease, but also important contributing and maintaining factors. The adoption of these basic premises led to the development of the osteopathic total-body concept. The patient is considered as part of their relationship to their psycho-, social, economic, and physical environment rather than as an isolated unit. Instead of emphasizing the momentary disease state, the osteopathic approach studies and treats the person's well-being, lifestyle and behavior as a whole. LEARNING OBJECTIVES The program leading to the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree is guided by the following goals for the purpose of providing a comprehensive and contemporary curriculum to educate health professionals to care for the whole person, advance the health of diverse communities and participate in the ever-changing environment. The curriculum seeks to: Integrate and appropriately sequence basic and clinical science material Present major themes in biomedicine Integrate early clinical experiences and case studies, and emphasize problem-solving to increase the application of knowledge-based issues to issues of patient care Utilize methods in information technology and informatics Participate in inter-professional education activities. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS Each candidate for the degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine must: Maintain established standards of personal and professional conduct Successfully fulll all academic and clinical requirements Pass COMLEX Level 1, Level 2 CE and Level 2 PE** (National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners). All requirements must be completed within six years from the rst date of matriculation. Each graduate must be free of indebtedness to the College. Those students who have received nancial aid are required to complete the exit interview on-line process at least one week prior to commencement. The College academic transcript will be given when all nancial obligations to PCOM and the exit interview have been met Note: It is the responsibility of the graduate to fulll the requirements for practice for the state licensing board in the state in which he or she chooses to practice. These requirements vary widely and are regulatedby the laws of each state. It is the responsibility of the graduate to get the information needed pertaining to state licensing and to fulll these responsibilities. Graduate Medical Education - Philadelphia Campus Graduate medical education is the crucial step of professional development between medical school and autonomous clinical practice. It is in this vital phase of the continuum of osteopathic medical education that residents learn to provide optimal patient care under the supervision of faculty members.

It recognizes that the88 Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) - Georgia Campus neuromusculoskeletal system is of major importance to human life. The interrelationship between this and other body-systems is a basic part of osteopathic philosophy. An emphasis on primary care, health maintenance, prevention of disease and attention to the neuromusculoskeletal system is key to osteopathic medical education and practice. Universally accepted today, these attributes were considered unorthodox when Dr. Andrew Taylor Still (1828-1917) objected to the crude medications of his time and sought to enhance the body's inherent healing through manipulation. The osteopathic physician incorporates evaluation and treatment of the musculoskeletal system as a basis for an approach to health and disease, combining it with the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities used by general scientic approaches to the healing arts. Like their MD counterparts, DOs must be licensed in the states where they practice, and additional board certication in specialties further underscores their professional credentials. All 50 states and the District of Columbia provide for the unlimited practice of medicine and surgery by osteopathic physicians. Licensing boards are usually composed of senior members of the osteopathic profession. In some states, MDs and DOs participate in combined licensing boards. THE OSTEOPATHIC PHILOSOPHY This philosophy provides the osteopathic physician with a unique way of looking at health and disease. These premises include the following: The human body is a unit in which structure and function are reciprocally interdependent. The body, through a complex system, tends to be self-regulating and self-healing. The adequate function of body systems depends on the unimpeded flow of blood and nerve impulses. The musculoskeletal system is a major body system, and its importance exceeds that of mere framework and support. There are musculoskeletal components to disease that are not only manifestations of the disease, but also important contributing and maintaining factors. The adoption of these basic premises led to the development of the osteopathic total-body concept. The patient is considered as part of their relationship to their psycho-, social, economic, and physical environment rather than as an isolated unit. Instead of emphasizing the momentary disease state, the osteopathic approach studies and treats the person's well-being, lifestyle and behavior as a whole. LEARNING OBJECTIVES The program leading to the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree is guided by the following goals for the purpose of providing a comprehensive and contemporary curriculum to educate health professionals to care for the whole person, advance the health of diverse communities and participate in the ever-changing environment. The curriculum seeks to: Integrate and appropriately sequence basic and clinical science material Present major themes in biomedicine Integrate early clinical experiences and case studies, and emphasize problem-solving to increase the application of knowledge-based issues to issues of patient care Utilize methods in information technology and informatics Participate in inter-professional education activities. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS Each candidate for the degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine must: Maintain established standards of personal and professional conduct Successfully fulll all academic and clinical requirements Pass COMLEX Level 1, Level 2 CE and Level 2 PE** (National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners). All requirements must be completed within six years from the rst date of matriculation. Each graduate must be free of indebtedness to the College. Those students who have received nancial aid are required to complete the exit interview on-line process at least one week prior to commencement.

Students will be required to start in the Summer following their foundation year with BIOM 600G and BIOM 691G. If approved, the student will still be required to complete 24 credits toward their MS degree. A minimum of three credit hours of thesis research will be required each term with the exception of credits taken at the end for the purpose of thesis completion, thesis submission and thesis defense. ** Elective courses must be approved by the mentor and course director. Elective courses can be substituted for Research credits provided students complete enough research credits to complete their project based on time frames approved by joint agreement of mentor, thesis committee, and program director. Electives can also be added as extra courses (in addition to the 53 credits required for graduation). However the student will be enrolled in these courses as out of degree and will be personally responsible for tuition payments for this course work. The only exception would be for courses that the student needs to retake or replace in order to meet the GPA requirement for the degree. Should a student need additional time to complete their research, an extension for completion must be submitted to the program chair and approved. Once approved, the student will be required to register for a one credit Thesis Completion course; there is no tuition charged for this course. For the degree to be conferred, the student must defend their thesis and have their thesis submitted to the library for binding. The thesis paper should be completed no later than one semester beyond defense. Should a student need an additional term to complete, they must submit a request to the Program Director for an extension. Once approved, the student will be required to register for one credit.

The PCOM Department of Physical Therapy will be recognized for its: Commitment to cultivating an inclusive learning environment that is diverse, inquisitive, dignied, and respectful and that will inspire caring graduates who advocate for all individuals in our changing healthcare environment. State-of-the-art learning environment that offers the opportunity for students to learn \"whole person\" patient management through inter- professional collaboration, development and intellectual growth, as well as hands-on experiences. Educational advancement for faculty, students and clinicians to promote development of exceptional healthcare professionals who are committed to life-long learning and engagement in the profession of physical therapy. Physical Therapy Philosophy The International Classication of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) provides the basic framework for organizing the curriculum. This framework was chosen because of its emphasis on the individualclient as the focus of health care and its consistency with osteopathic philosophy, which emphasizes management of the \"whole person\" and recognizes the unity of body systems. This is consistent with the program's belief that physical therapists are experts in movement and use their skills to restore, maintain, and promote optimal movement and function. As such, physical therapists function interdependently in a variety of settings and use theory and established scientic evidence as the foundation upon which they address the needs of the \"whole person\" (physical, psychological, spiritual, and socio-economic). The curriculum is also founded on the belief that optimal physical therapy is provided in a client-focused environment in which the therapist assumes various roles, including educator, consultant, and advocate. The organization of the curriculum is based on the assumption that understanding and responding to the effects of health conditions begins with knowledge of good health. The implication is that practitioners need a rm foundation in \"normal\" in order to recognize and assist clients in managing impairments and decits in activities and participation. The model is \"wrapped\" in an envelope made up of four themes that will be emphasized throughout the curriculum: Critical Thinking, Evidence-Based Practice, Professional Engagement, and Lifespan Development. The curriculum model is best described as hybrid, incorporating elements of traditional and systems-based curricula. In the early stages, the instruction focuses on normal body structure and function and includes content from both the Basic/Foundational sciences and the Clinical/ Physical Therapy sciences. As the student develops an understanding of \"normal\" and how to assess it, the emphasis begins to shift to health conditions commonly seen in physical therapy, focusing on addressing impairments and activity and participation limitations/restrictions. All components of the patient/client management model are addressed in courses that are systems-based. Throughout the curriculum students will encounter each of the four themes noted above; sometimes in one of the systems-based courses or in courses whose primary function is to address those themes. Each course is assigned to one of ve content areas: Basic/Foundational Sciences, Clinical/Physical Therapy Sciences, Evidence-Based Practice, Professional Engagement, and Clinical Experiences. The following provides course information on the sequencing of courses and course descriptions as related to assigned content areas. Educational Goals 1.Provide a professional education that will prepare individuals for entry into the practice of physical therapy. 2.Promote the development of professional core values and behaviors. 3.Promote participation in and appreciation for scholarship that will contribute to the evidence supporting physical therapy practice. 4.Promote participation in activities designed to advocate for the profession, community, and individuals. 5.Engage in service to the college, community, and profession. 6.Provide opportunities for post-professional education and professional development.

It recognizes that the neuromusculoskeletal system is of major importance to human life. The interrelationship between this and other body-systems is a basic part of osteopathic philosophy. An emphasis on primary care, health maintenance, prevention of disease and attention to the neuromusculoskeletal system is key to osteopathic medical education and practice. Universally accepted today, these attributes were considered unorthodox when Dr. Andrew Taylor Still (1828-1917) objected to the crude medications of his time and sought to enhance the body's inherent healing through manipulation. The osteopathic physician incorporates evaluation and treatment of the musculoskeletal system as a basis for an approach to health and disease, combining it with the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities used by general scientic approaches to the healing arts. Like their MD counterparts, DOs must be licensed in the states where they practice, and additional board certication in specialties further underscores their professional credentials. All 50 states and the District of Columbia provide for the unlimited practice of medicine and surgery by osteopathic physicians. Licensing boards are usually composed of senior members of the osteopathic profession. In some states, MDs and DOs participate in combined licensing boards. THE OSTEOPATHIC PHILOSOPHY This philosophy provides the osteopathic physician with a unique way of looking at health and disease. These premises include the following: The human body is a unit in which structure and function are reciprocally interdependent. 2022-2023 Academic Catalog 105 The body, through a complex system, tends to be self-regulating and self-healing. The adequate function of body systems depends on the unimpeded flow of blood and nerve impulses. The musculoskeletal system is a major body system, and its importance exceeds that of mere framework and support. There are musculoskeletal components to disease that are not only manifestations of the disease, but also important contributing and maintaining factors. The adoption of these basic premises led to the development of the osteopathic total-body concept. The patient is considered as part of their relationship to their psycho-, social, economic, and physical environment rather than as an isolated unit. Instead of emphasizing the momentary disease state, the osteopathic approach studies and treats the person's well-being, lifestyle and behavior as a whole. LEARNING OBJECTIVES The program leading to the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree is guided by the following goals for the purpose of providing a comprehensive and contemporary curriculum to educate health professionals to care for the whole person, advance the health of diverse communities and participate in the ever-changing environment. The curriculum seeks to: Integrate and appropriately sequence basic and clinical science material Present major themes in biomedicine Integrate early clinical experiences and case studies, and emphasize problem-solving to increase the application of knowledge-based issues to issues of patient care Utilize methods in information technology and informatics Participate in inter-professional education activities. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS Each candidate for the degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine must: Maintain established standards of personal and professional conduct Successfully fulll all academic and clinical requirements Pass COMLEX Level 1, Level 2 CE and Level 2 PE** (National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners). All requirements must be completed within six years from the rst date of matriculation. Each graduate must be free of indebtedness to the College.

Reports by Concerned Individuals If a student suspects impairment of another student, students should seek guidance from the Student Affairs Director on their respective campus. General Detection of the Impaired Student At the discretion of the Provost or his/her designee, a student may be required to submit to psychological assessment and/or a urine and/ or blood screening to detect alcohol or the presence of illegal drugs based on reasonable suspicion of impairment. Medical professionals will perform such assessments and toxicology tests at no cost to the student, with reports sent in condence to the Provost. If such screening measures detect impairment, the Provost or his/her designee may remand the matter to the Student Professional Conduct Committee. Students who have declined an assessment and/or recovery plan will automatically be remanded to the Student Professional Conduct Committee for dismissal proceedings. In accordance with the College Disciplinary Policy, any student found guilty of the use, sale or distribution of illegal drugs, either on campus or off campus, will be subject to permanent termination of enrollment.PCOM's Substance Abuse Policy can be found on the Resources Section of MyPCOM . Support Available Graduate and professional education can be a time of great stress. It may become difcult for a student to successfully adapt to these stresses, which may lead to the student engaging in potentially harmful coping mechanisms, such as alcohol or drug abuse. The Drug and Alcohol Policies represent the intent of the College to enable students to resolve substance abuse problems by requesting and receiving compassionate, condential professional assistance. In an effort to help our students and to protect patients and others from the harm that an impaired student may cause, PCOM's goals include: 1.Providing effective and compassionate assistance to the impaired student before irreversible harm is done to his/her health, educational process, eligibility for licensure, or ability to function competently upon graduation. 2.Providing a means by which the impaired student may request and receive condential professional assistance without stigma or penalty, and thereby encourage self-reporting and personal responsibility. 3.Enabling the impaired student to confront his/her problem and, where feasible, receive effective therapy with minimal disruption of the student's education. 4.Establishing a process that focuses on counseling and therapy as a front-line approach before disciplinary action is necessary. Additional resouces can be found on the Mental Health and Wellness section of MyPCOM. Policy on the Possession of Dangerous Articles It is the policy of PCOM to provide a safe work environment for our students and employees.

Normal laboratory materials are excluded from this policy when used in a laboratory setting. This policy applies regardless of any permits the student or employee may own. An individual who violates this policy should be reported to the Campus Safety and Security Department on their campus. Violators will be subject to immediate dismissal and/or civil or criminal action. For more detail, see PCOM's Possession of Dangerous Articles Policy on the Resources Section of MyPCOM . Student Records Policy114 The Family Rights & Privacy Act The Family Rights & Privacy Act The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) places certain limitations on the disclosure of personally identiable student information maintained by PCOM with respect to students; limits access to academic records; and gives students certain rights with respect to educational records, including the right to access, the right to obtain copies, the right to seek correction of such records through informal and formal internal procedures, and the right to place a statement in such educational records explaining any information that they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. Directory Information PCOM considers certain information to be \"directory information\" under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and, therefore, subject to disclosure without prior consent of the student. Unless written objection is received by the Registrar, the College will treat the following as directory information to be released at the discretion of the Registrar's Ofce: student name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date and place of birth, enrollment status dates of attendance, major eld of study, Dean's list, degrees and awards received and names of undergraduate and/or graduate schools attended, internships and residencies. Right to Withhold Disclosure Under the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, currently enrolled students may withhold disclosure of directory information. The Registrar's Ofce must receive written notication from a student indicating the information to be withheld. Should a student decide to inform the institution not to release certain information, any future requests for such information from non-institutional persons or organizations will be refused. Decisions about withholding any information should be made very carefully. PCOM will honor each request to withhold any of the categories of information indicated by a student. However, the College cannot assume responsibility to contact a student for subsequent permission to release them should requests be received. PCOM assumes that failure to request the withholding of directory information indicates approval for disclosure. Right to Consent to the Disclosure of Personally Identiable Information All personally identiable information related to a particular student other than directory information is considered Condential information and may not be released without the written consent of the student. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions: Other schools to which a student is transferring Specied ofcials for audit or evaluation purposes Appropriate parties in connection with nancial aid to a student Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school Accrediting organizations To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena PCOM's Registrar will make reasonable attempt to notify the studentAppropriate ofcials in cases of health and safety emergencies State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specic state law School ofcials with legitimate educational interest (including but not limited to administrative, supervisory, academic, research or support staff) National Board of Medical Examiners (NBOME) - a school ofcial is determined to have a legitimate educational interest if the information requested is required for that ofcial to: Perform appropriate tasks that are specied in his/her position/ description or contract/agreement Perform a task related to the student's education Perform a task related to the discipline of a student Provide a service or benet relating to the student or student's family such as health care, counseling, job placement or nancial aid The school ofcial is not authorized to share this information with a third party without the student's written permission. Such information, when it has fullled its original purpose, should be returned to the originating ofce. All other access to a student's record is granted in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Right to Inspection and Review of Records When the student matriculates, the Ofce of Admissions will forward the following materials to the Registrar's Ofce. Information retained in the le is as follows: Current application AACOMAS prole (DO students) CASPA prole (PA students) PharmCAS students) Transcripts Standardized test scores (e.g., MCAT , GRE, MAT) Letters of acceptance and prepayment Completed Technical Standards form Previous applications and decision-related correspondence All other materials in the applicant le are purged in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. A current or previously enrolled student has the right to inspect and review his or her education records maintained by the school. This right does not extend to applicants, those denied admission, or those admitted who do not enroll. A ten day written notice must be submitted to the Registrar's Ofce. The Registrar's Ofce will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. Other data accrued during the student's tenure at the College including, but not limited to, transcripts, NBOME Board scores, academic status letters (e.g., probation, warning, dismissal), course related forms (e.g., withdrawal), name change, and change of status documentation will be placed in the student's le. Transcripts or grade reports from other institutions, copies of scores from national tests (MCAT , NBOME Board scores, Praxis, etc.) and/or any other2022-2023 Academic Catalog 115 third party material will not be released by PCOM. Students must contact the institution that issued these documents to obtain copies. Right to Amendment of the Educational Record Under FERPA, an eligible student has the right to request that inaccurate or misleading information in their education records be amended. While a school is not required to amend education records in accordance with an eligible student's request, the school is required to consider the request. If the school decides not to amend a record in accordance with an eligible student's request, the school must inform the student of their right to a hearing on the matter. If, as a result of the hearing, the school still decides not to amend the record, the eligible student has the right to insert a statement in the record setting forth their views. That statement must remain with the contested part of the eligible student's record for as long as the record is maintained. However, while the FERPA amendment procedure may be used to challenge facts that are inaccurately recorded, it may not be used to challenge a grade, an opinion, or a substantive decision made by a school about an eligible student. FERPA was intended to require only that schools conform to fair recordkeeping practices and not to override the accepted standards and procedures for making academic assessments, disciplinary rulings, or placement determinations. Thus, while FERPA affords eligible students the right to seek to amend education records which contain inaccurate information, this right cannot be used to challenge a grade or an individual's opinion, or a substantive decision made by a school about a student. Additionally, if FERPA's amendment procedures are not applicable to an eligible student's request for amendment of education records, the school is not required under FERPA to hold a hearing on the matter. Complaints regarding alleged violations of rights accorded students by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act or the regulations promulgated thereunder may be directed in writing to: Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Ofce Department of Education Room 4511, Switzer Building 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, D.C. 20202 For more information, visit http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ ferpa/index.html ( http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/ ) Access to Student Records Access to student records may be granted to school ofcials determined to have a legitimate educational interest. The custodian of the records must determine the legitimacy of each request.

FERPA Complaints Complaints regarding alleged violations of rights accorded by students by FERPA or the regulations promulgated thereunder may be directed in writing to: U.S. Department of Education Student Privacy Policy Ofce 400 Maryland Ave, SW Washington, DC 20202-8520 For more information, go to: https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/le-a- complaint (https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/le-a-complaint/ ) Maintenance of Student Records There is one Admissions le for each applicant and each program for which the applicant applies. This le is kept in the Ofce of Admissions until the point of matriculation. When the student matriculates, the following materials are retained in the Ofce of the Registrar: 1.Current application document 2.AACOMAS prole test scores (i.e., , GRE, MAT) 7.Letters of acceptance and prepayment 8.Completed technical standards forms 9.Previous applications and decision-related correspondence A student can request to review the information in his/her le with a 10-business day written notice to the Ofce of the Registrar. All other materials in the applicant's le are purged in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. Other data accrued during the student's tenure at the College including, but not limited to, transcripts, board scores, academic status letters (i.e., probation, warning, dismissal), course-related forms (e.g., withdrawal), name change and change of status documentation will be placed in the student's le. Transcripts or grade reports from other institutions, criminal background check, copies of scores from national tests (MCAT , National Boards, Praxis, etc.) and/or any other third-party material will not be released by PCOM. Students must contact the institution that issued these documents to obtain copies. Right to Withhold Disclosure Under the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, currently enrolled students may withhold disclosure of directory information. To prevent disclosure, the Ofce of the Registrar must receive written notication from a student indicating the information to be withheld. Should a student decide to inform the institution not to release certain information, any future requests for such information116 Intellectual Property Policies from non-institutional persons or organizations will be refused. Decisions about withholding any information should be made very carefully. PCOM will honor each request to withhold any of the categories of information indicated by a student. However, we cannot assume responsibility to contact a student for subsequent permission to release them should requests be received. PCOM assumes that failure to request the withholding of directory information indicates approval for disclosure. Intellectual Property Policies The rights of an individual in regard to his or her own oral presentations, visual productions, computer programs, graphics, etc., must be honored. Aside from PCOM requirements regarding the use of lecture capture programs for recording, use of personal video cameras or recording devices are not permitted in any classroom or lab without the expressed written consent of the academic program director and the course instructor. Copyright Policy It is the policy of Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine to comply with the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976. All PCOM faculty, staff, and students are expected to act as responsible users of the copyrighted works of others, which includes making informed decisions based on the fair use exemptions to the copyright laws. Student violations of copyright policy are also subject to sanctions imposed by the Committee on Student Professional Conduct. U.S. laws protect the rights of individuals regarding their own works. The penalties for violation of copyright law can range from College sanctions to civil and criminal prosecution. Persons who copy and distribute copyrighted material without legal permission may be found liable for civil or criminal copyright infringement. Civil penalties for federal copyright infringement provide for signicant nancial compensation for damages such as $150,000 for each willful act. Criminal penalties can be up to ve years in prison and $250,000 in nes. The College cannot protect students, faculty or staff from a copyright complaint, and the College may also be required by law to disclose information to a complainant for use in pursuing legal action. Copyright infringement may also result in College-imposed sanctions for misconduct. Federal copyright law protects \"original works of authorship xed in any tangible medium, \" which includes works of literature, music, drama, lm, sculpture, visual art, architecture, and other creative media. (Title 17, U.S. Code, Section 101). Most works published after 1923 (except those authored by the U.S. government) should be presumed to be copyright protected, unless there is information or notice from the copyright holder that the work is in the public domain. Works published prior to March 1, 1989, generally require a copyright notice to be protected, but those published on or after March 1, 1989, are not required for copyright protection. Copyright Ofce Circular 22 explains how to determine the copyright status of a work. The doctrine of \"Fair Use\" (section 107 of the U.S. copyright law) in limited situations permits the use of a copyrighted work, including reproducing portions of that work, without the copyright owner's permission. Section 107 of the Copyright Act establishes four basic factors to be examined in determining whether a use constitutes a \"Fair Use\" under the copyright law. These factors are:1.The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprot educational purposes; 2.The nature of the copyrighted work; 3.The amount and substantiality of the portion of the work used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and 4.The effect of the use in question upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. No single factor is determinative of a person's right to use a copyrighted work without permission. Educational use alone is not sufcient to make the use in question a fair one. Photocopies or other reproductions can be furnished only under certain conditions, if they will be used solely for private individual study, scholarship, or research. Use of the reproduction for other purposes may make the user liable for copyright infringement. PCOM reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying request, if, in its judgment, fulllment of the order would involve violation of copyright law (17 U.S.C. 207, and under Title 17 of the U.S. Code as amended by Pub. Law 94-553: 108, 702. Dated August 9, 1977). The full Patents and Copyrights Policy (2.80) can be found on MyPCOM, Resources section.

Policy on Academic Integrity Academic integrity is essential to the success of the educational enterprise, and breaches of academic integrity constitute serious offenses against the academic community. Every member of that community bears a responsibility for ensuring that the highest standards of academic integrity are upheld. Only through a genuine partnership among students, faculty, staff, and administrators will the College be able to maintain the necessary commitment to academic integrity.2022-2023 Academic Catalog 117 Students are responsible for understanding the principles of academic integrity fully and abiding by them in all their work at the College. Students are encouraged to report alleged violations of academic integrity to the Student Affairs Director on their respective campus. Various ways in which academic integrity can be violated are described below. The comments and examples within each section provide explanations and illustrative material, but do not exhaust the scope of possible violations. 1.Cheating: Cheating is dened as giving or receiving unauthorized academic-related aid during an exam or in the context of an assignment for a course. 2.Fabrication: Fabrication is the falsication or invention of any information or citation in an academic work. \"Invented\" information may not be used in any laboratory report or other academic work without authorization from the instructor. It is improper, for example, to analyze one sample in an experiment and \"invent\" data based on that single experiment for several more required analyses. Students must also acknowledge the actual source from which cited information was obtained. 3.Plagiarism: Plagiarism is the representation of the words or ideas of another as one's own in any academic work. To avoid plagiarism, every direct quotation must be identied by quotation marks, or by appropriate indentation, and must be cited properly according to the accepted format for the particular discipline. Acknowledgment is also required when material from any source is paraphrased or summarized in whole or in part in one's own words. A footnote acknowledging only a directly quoted statement does not sufce to notify the reader of any preceding or succeeding paraphrased material. Information that is common knowledge, such as names of leaders of prominent nations, basic scientic laws, etc., need not be cited; however, the sources of all facts or information obtained in reading or research that are not common knowledge among students in the course must be acknowledged. In addition to materials specically cited in the text, other materials that contribute to one's general understanding of the subject may be acknowledged in the bibliography. Sometimes, plagiarism can be a subtle issue. Students should be encouraged to discuss any questions about what constitutes plagiarism with the faculty member teaching the course. 4.Facilitating Violations of Academic Integrity: It is a violation of academic integrity for a student to aid others in violating academic integrity. A student who knowingly or negligently facilitates a violation of academic integrity is as culpable as the student who receives the impermissible aid, even if the former student does not benet from the violation. Note : Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey is acknowledged for the work of its faculty in forming the foundation of the policy above as adapted by PCOM.

Penalties for rst-time violators of the Act range from thirty days' imprisonment, $500 ne, or both for possession or distribution of a small amount of marijuana or hashish, not for sale, to fteen years or $250,000 or both for the manufacture or delivery of a Schedule I or II narcotic. A person over eighteen years of age who is convicted for violating The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act shall be sentenced to a minimum of at least one-year total connement if the delivery or possession with intent to deliver of the controlled substance was to a minor. If the offense is committed within 1,000 feet of the real property on which a university is located, the person shall be sentenced to an additional minimum sentence of at least two years' total connement. 2. The Pharmacy Act of 1961, 63 Pa. C.S.A. 390-8, makes it unlawful to procure or attempt to procure drugs by fraud, deceit, misrepresentation or subterfuge or by forgery or alteration of a prescription. The rst offense is a misdemeanor, with a maximum penalty of one year's imprisonment, a $5,000 ne, or both. 3. The Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. C.S.A. 3101 et seq., which was amended effective July 1, 1977, prohibits driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, or both, if the driver thereby is rendered incapable of safe driving. A police ofcer is empowered to arrest without a warrant any person whom he or she has probable cause to believe has committed a violation, even though the ofcer may not have been present when the violation was committed. A person so arrested is deemed to have consented to a test of breath or blood for the purpose of determining alcoholic content, and if a violation is found it carries the penalties of a misdemeanor of the second degree, which includes imprisonment for a maximum of thirty days. GEORGIA STATE LAW \"Controlled Substances\": This broad category of illegal substance is dened in Drug schedules I-V, Ofcial Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.), Sections 16-13-25 to 16-13-29.1, including a long list of chemical compounds, opiates, hallucinogens, derivatives, isomers and other materials. The State Board of Pharmacy may add new materials to the list as required. \"Dangerous Drugs\": This is an even broader category of illegal substance and is dened in O.C.G.A. 16- 13-71, describing hundreds of chemicalsand other compounds. The Georgia General Assembly may add drugs to the list as required. A summary of the criminal penalties is listed below. Criminal Punishment \"First offender\" treatment for mere possession of minor amounts of a controlled substance or dangerous drug. A person never before convicted of possession of a small amount of the above material may, at the judge's sole discretion, be afforded rst-offender treatment, resulting in no entry of a plea of guilty and no record of any conviction, if the defendant successfully completes a court-monitored comprehensive rehabilitative program (O.C.G.A. 16-13-2(a)). a. Possession of one ounce or less of marijuana. Imprisonment for 12 months or less and/or a ne not to exceed $1,000, or \"public works\" (community services) not to exceed 12 months (O.C.G.A. 16-13-2(b)). b. Possession, manufacture or distribution of controlled substances. This is punishable by connement of up to 30 years in prison and nes of up to $1 million, depending on the schedule sequence of the controlled substance involved, as well as the amount (see O.C.G.A. Section 16- 13-30 and Section 16-13-31). The manufacture, distribution or possession with intent to distribute any controlled substance or marijuana within 1,000 feet of an elementary or secondary school, park, playground, recreation center, housing project or drug-free commercial zone can result in up to 40 years in prison with a ne of up to $40,000 (see O.C.G.A. Section 16-13-32.4, 16-13-32.5 and 16-13-32.6). A detailed chart outlining the state penalties for crimes involving various controlled substances is available in the Student Affairs ofce. FEDERAL LAWS 1. The Federal drug laws, The Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq., are similar to the Pennsylvania Controlled Substance, Drug, Device, and Cosmetic Act, but contain, for the most part, more severe penalties. Schedules of controlled substance are established, and it is made unlawful knowingly or intentionally to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess with intent to distribute or dispense a controlled substance. If the quantity of controlled substance is large (e.g., 1,000 kg of a mixture or substance containing marijuana), the maximum penalties are life imprisonment, a $4,000,000 ne, or both. Lesser quantities of controlled substance (e.g., 100 kg of a mixture or substance containing marijuana) result in maximum penalties of life imprisonment, a $2,000,000 ne, or both. The distribution of small amounts of marijuana for no remuneration or simple possession of a controlled substance carries a maximum of one year's imprisonment, a $5,000 ne, or both, with the penalties for the second offense doubling. Probation without conviction is possible for rst offenders. Distribution to persons under the age of twenty-one by persons eighteen or older carries double or triple penalties. Double penalties also apply to the distribution or manufacture of a controlled substance in or on or within 1,000 feet of the property of a school or college. 2. Students who have been convicted under state or federal law involving the possession or sale of a controlled substance are ineligible for federal student aid for specic periods (ranging from one year to an indenite period depending on the nature of the offense and whether the student is a repeat offender). Alcohol 1. The Pennsylvania Liquor Code, 47 Pa., C.S.A., 1-101 et seq., controls the possession and sale of alcoholic beverages within the2022-2023 Academic Catalog 123 Commonwealth. The Code as well as portions of the Pennsylvania Statutes pertaining to crimes and offenses involving minors, 18 Pa., C.S.A. 6307 et seq., provide the following: 2. It is a summary offense for a person under the age of twenty-one to attempt to purchase, consume, possess or knowingly and intentionally transport any liquor or malt or brewed beverages. Penalty for a rst offense is suspension of driving privileges for 90 days, a ne up to $300 and imprisonment for up to 90 days; for a second offense, suspension of driving privileges for one year, a ne up to $500, and imprisonment for up to one year; for subsequent offense, suspension of driving privileges for two years, a ne up to $500 and imprisonment for up to one year. Multiple sentences involving suspension of driving privileges must be served consecutively. 3. It is a crime intentionally and knowingly to sell or intentionally and knowingly to furnish or to purchase with the intent to sell or furnish, any liquor or malt or brewed beverages to any minor (under the age of twenty-one). \"Furnish\" means to supply, give or provide to, or allow a minor to possess on premises or property owned or controlled by the person charged. Penalty for a rst violation is $1,000; $2,500 for each subsequent violation; imprisonment for up to one year for any violation. 4. It is a crime for any person under twenty-one years of age to possess an identication card falsely identifying that person as being twenty- one years of age or older, or to obtain or attempt to obtain liquor or malt or brewed beverages by using a false identication card. Penalties are stated in (2) above. 5. It is a crime intentionally, knowingly or recklessly to manufacture, make, alter, sell or attempt to sell an identication card falsely representing the identity, birth date, or age of another. Minimum ne is $1,000 for rst violation; $2,500 for subsequent violations; imprisonment for up to one year for any violation. 6. It is a crime to misrepresent one's age knowingly and falsely to obtain liquor or malt or brewed beverages. Penalties are as stated in (1) above. 7. It is a crime knowingly, willfully and falsely to represent that another is of legal age to obtain liquor or malt or brewed beverages. Penalty is a minimum ne of $300 and imprisonment for up to one year. 8. It is a crime to hire, request or induce any minor to purchase liquor or malt or beverages. Penalty is a minimum ne of $300 and imprisonment for up to one year. 9. Sales without a license or purchases from an unlicensed source of liquor or malt or brewed beverages are prohibited. 10. It is unlawful to possess or transport liquor or alcohol within the Commonwealth unless it has been purchased from a State Store or in accordance with Liquor Control Board regulations. The University will cooperate with the appropriate law enforcement authorities for violations of any of the above-mentioned laws by an employee in the workplace or student. 11. The use in any advertisement of alcoholic beverages of any subject matter, language or slogan directed to minors to promote consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited. 12. No advertisement of alcoholic beverages shall be permitted, either directly or indirectly, in any booklet, program, book, yearbook, magazine, newspaper, periodical, brochure, circular, or other similar publication, published by, for, or on behalf of any educational institution.Financial Aid Eligibility and Drug Convictions Substance Abuse Question on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) The FAFSA form asks if the student has ever been convicted of a drug- related offense. Failure to answer this question will automatically disqualify the student from receiving federal aid. Falsely answering this question, if discovered, could result in nes up to $20,000, imprisonment, or both. Under the Higher Education Act, a student may become ineligible for federal student aid upon conviction of any offense involving the possession or sale of illegal drugs while receiving Title IV federal nancial aid. Federal aid includes Federal Direct Loans, Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans, and Federal Work Study. FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID PENALTIES FOR DRUG CONVICTIONS Possession of Illegal Drugs First Offense: 1 year ineligibility from the date of conviction Second Offense: 2 years' ineligibility from the date of conviction Third and Subsequent Offenses: Indenite ineligibility from the date of conviction Sale of Illegal Drugs First Offense: 2 years' ineligibility from the date of conviction Second and Subsequent Offenses: Indenite ineligibility from the date of conviction CONVICTIONS DURING ENROLLMENT According to the United States Department of Education, if a student is convicted of a drug offense after receiving federal aid, he or she must notify the Financial Aid Department immediately and that student will be ineligible for further aid and required to pay back all aid received after the conviction. REGAINING FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY A student can regain eligibility for federal student aid funds by successfully completing a drug rehabilitation program. To be sufcient to reinstate nancial aid eligibility, the program must include at least 2 unannounced drug tests and be recognized as a federal, state, or local government agency program. A student will regain eligibility on the date of successfully completing the program. Violation of the Policy on Possession of Dangerous Articles An individual who violates this policy should be reported to the security department on their campus. Violators will be subject to immediate dismissal and/or civil or criminal action. PCOM's Possession of Dangerous Articles Policy can be found on the Resources Section of MyPCOM Academic Integrity Violations and Sanctions LEVELS OF VIOLATION AND RECOMMENDED SANCTIONS Any violation of academic integrity is a serious offense and is therefore subject to an appropriate penalty or sanction. Academic integrity violations at PCOM are classied into four levels according to the nature of the violation.124 Level One Violations The student's academic program director will determine the level of violation. For each level of violation, a corresponding set of sanctions is recommended. Levels One and Two are administered by the faculty in the academic program. Level Three and Level Four violations are administered by the Student Professional Conduct Committee and could result in temporary or permanent separation from the College. Please note that separation is a possible sanction for repeat violations at Level One or Level Two. The recommended sanctions at each level are not binding but are intended as general guidelines for the academic community. Moreover, due to mitigating circumstances, a standard sanction is not always imposed, even when a student is found responsible for a given violation. Culpability may be assessed, and sanctions imposed differentially for those with more or with less experience as members of the academic community. Examples are cited below for each level of violation. These examples are meant to be illustrations and should not be considered all-inclusive. Note: Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey is acknowledged for the work of its faculty in forming the foundation of this policy, as adapted by PCOM. . Level One Violations Level One violations may occur because of inexperience or lack of knowledge of the principles of academic integrity and are often characterized by the absence of dishonest intent on the part of the student committing the violation. These violations generally are quite limited in extent (e.g., 1-2 sentences), occur on a minor assignment, and represent a small fraction of the total course work. Examples include : 1.Working with another student on a minor laboratory exercise or homework assignment when such collaboration is prohibited. 2.Failure to footnote or give proper acknowledgment in a very limited section of an assignment. Sanctions for Level One Violations May include one or more of the following, although this list is not all- inclusive: 1.Required participation in a noncredit workshop or seminar on ethics or academic integrity. 2.An assigned paper or research project related to ethics or academic integrity. 3.A make-up assignment that is more difcult than the original assignment. 4.No credit for the original assignment. 5.Disciplinary warning. Level Two Violations Level Two violations are breaches of academic integrity that are more serious or that affect a more signicant aspect or portion of the course work compared with Level One violations (e.g., more than a few sentences). Examples include :1.Quoting directly or paraphrasing, to a moderate extent, without acknowledging the source. 2.Submitting the same work, or major portions thereof, to satisfy the requirements of more than one course without permission from the instructor to whom the work is submitted for the second or subsequent time. 3.Using data or interpretative material for a laboratory report without acknowledging the sources or the collaborators. All contributors to the acquisition of data and/or to the writing of the report must be acknowledged. SANCTIONS FOR LEVEL TWO VIOLATIONS May be referred to the Student Professional Conduct Committee and may include one or more of the following: 1.A failing grade on the assignment. 2.A failing grade for the course. Level Three Violations Level Three violations are breaches of academic integrity that are more serious in nature or that affect a more signicant aspect or portion of the course work compared with Level Two violations. Examples include : 1.Repeat Level Two violations. 2.Presenting the work of another as one's own. 3.Copying work on exams. 4.Plagiarizing portions of a written assignment. 5.Acting to facilitate copying during an exam. 6.Using prohibited materials, such as books, notes, or calculators, during an examination. 7.Conspiring before an exam to develop methods of illicitly exchanging information during the exam. 8.Altering examinations for the purposes of re-grading. 9.Acquiring or distributing copies of an examination from an unauthorized source prior to the examination period. 10. Submitting purchased materials such as a term paper. 11. Fabricating data by inventing or deliberately altering material. Fabrication includes citing \"sources\" that are not, in fact, sources. 12. Falsifying information to receive an extension or other modication for an exam adjustment. SANCTIONS FOR LEVEL THREE VIOLATIONS May include an F for the course and probation for one or more terms or permanent dismissal, depending on the seriousness of the violation. Level Four Violations Level Four violations represent the most serious breaches of academic integrity. Examples include : 1.Committing a violation of academic integrity after returning from suspension for a previous violation of academic integrity. 2.Committing a violation of academic integrity that breaks the law or resembles criminal activity (such as forging a grade form, stealing an examination from a professor or from a College ofce, buying a stolen2022-2023 Academic Catalog 125 examination, falsifying a transcript to gain access to the College or its resources, or altering the record of work done at the College). 3.Having a substitute take an examination or taking an examination for someone else. 4.Fabricating evidence, falsifying data, quoting directly or paraphrasing without acknowledging the source, and/or presenting the ideas of another as one's own in a senior thesis, a master's thesis, a doctoral dissertation, a scholarly article submitted for publication, or any other work represented as his or her own by a graduate or professional student. 5.Sabotaging another student's work through actions designed to prevent the student from successfully completing an assignment. SANCTION FOR LEVEL FOUR VIOLATIONS May result in permanent dismissal from the College. Repeat Violations A repeat violation at Level One will ordinarily be treated as a Level Two violation, although it may, under certain circumstances, be treated as a Level Three violation. A repeat violation at Level Two may be treated as a Level Three, and hence a separable violation. Any violation committed after completing probation for a Level Three violation will be treated as a Level Four violation. College Disciplinary Process Categories of Discipline for Violations of Conduct Policies Breaches of appropriate professional behavior and violations of College policy will be subject to, but not limited to, warning, probation, suspension and dismissal. Reports of violations of these policies may be made by an administrator or the Student Professional Conduct Committee to the Provost. Copies of the violations will be submitted to the Registrar. Warning : A written admonition to a student for behavior that is found to have constituted a relatively minor offense. Probation : Disciplinary probation applies when there are ndings of unprofessional behavior and/or infractions of the student conduct policy, as indicated by the Student Professional Conduct Committee, and where further infractions or unprofessional behavior will make the student liable for disciplinary dismissal. The provisions of this probation will be decided by the Student Professional Conduct Committee. Such provisions may include a requirement that the student obtain medical and/or psychiatric consultation and treatment, or other terms designed to remedy the behavior being reviewed and to prevent its recurrence. Suspension : Represents temporary separation from the College. The duration of a suspension shall be determined by the Student Professional Conduct Committee but shall not exceed one academic year. The Committee may also place conditions on the student's return to the College. Such conditions may include being placed on probation, the student's obtaining medical and/or psychiatric consultation and treatment, or other appropriate conditions. Dismissal : Represents permanent separation from the College.Recommendations/Requirements for Psychiatric Consultation or Medical Treatment Where medical or psychiatric consultation and treatment are recommended or required, the condentiality of the physician/patient relationship shall be preserved, and no report shall be made by the consulting physician to the Student Professional Conduct Committee without the consent of the affected student. However, the Student Professional Conduct Committee may condition a student's ability to continue as a PCOM student upon a satisfactory evaluation by a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist appointed by the Provost. Disciplinary Procedures Upon the Provost's initiative, or at the request of any member of the faculty or administration of the College, the Provost may designate a representative to act on their behalf to conduct an investigation. If a member of the faculty or administration orally requests that disciplinary proceedings be initiated, the oral request must be conrmed in writing within 72 hours. The Provost will initiate disciplinary proceedings against a student(s) if there is reasonable probability to believe that a violation has occurred based upon the information received. In determining whether disciplinary action is warranted, the Provost or their representative may conduct an informal investigation of the matter, which may include interviewing the affected student(s) or the student(s) against whom disciplinary proceedings have been recommended. The Provost will notify the Chair of the Student Professional Conduct Committee if it is determined that disciplinary actions are warranted. If the Provost determines that the presence of the alleged offender would be disruptive to the College or would endanger the College or afliated training sites or any involved personnel, they may immediately suspend the student(s) in question from the College. Notice of Hearing The Chair of the Student Professional Conduct Committee shall give written notice of the behavior in question to the alleged offender, at least 7 business days prior to the date of the proceedings, unless an earlier hearing date is agreed to in writing by the student or an attorney acting on his or her behalf. The notice shall also set forth : 1) The time and date of the hearing. 2) A clear and concise statement of the behavior that is alleged to violate professional standards. 3) A list of witnesses that are expected to appear. The student shall reply to the charges against him/her no later than two business days prior to the hearing. The student must also provide a list of any witnesses he or she plans to call on his or her behalf. The student must indicate in the response if he or she intends to use an attorney or other advisor.126 Conduct of Hearing Please Note : The College has the right to supplement the list of witnesses it expects to appear, up to two business days before the hearing. The time for the hearing may be changed for good cause. Conduct of Hearing To ensure a fair process, the protocol is as follows: 1) The hearing shall be conducted by the Chair of the Student Professional Conduct Committee, or in their absence, by a member of the Committee they have designated. The Committee shall have the right, in those instances when it deems it appropriate, to appoint a Hearing Ofcer to preside over and conduct the hearing. 2) The Committee shall not be bound by strict rules of evidence and may admit such evidence and testimony as the Chair or their designee (or the Hearing Ofcer) shall deem relevant to the proceedings. 3) Members of the Student Professional Conduct Committee present at the hearing will disclose any information that points to a possible bias against the charged student. Members of the Student Professional Conduct Committee present at the hearing shall disqualify themselves from hearing a case if they believe in good faith that their capacity for making an objective judgment is reasonably impaired. If a member of the Committee does not disqualify themself but a majority of the Committee believes such bias exists, the majority may vote to excuse that member from hearing the case. 4) The Committee shall ensure that all those involved have full opportunity to present relevant and material oral or documentary evidence at the hearing. 5) The hearing shall be condential unless the charged student elects otherwise in writing at least 5 business days prior to the hearing. The Provost's designated representative shall represent the College at the hearing. This individual may be the same one who conducted the informal investigation. 6) The charged student shall have the right to confront any witnesses testifying against him or her, to testify on his/her own behalf (if he/she so chooses) and to present witnesses. Absent exceptional circumstances, afdavits are not an acceptable substitute for testimony. 7) The charged student shall have the right to be represented by an attorney or other advisor of the student's choosing (who shall be retained at the student's expense). 8) The charged student may remain silent or may testify. The hearing may be conducted in the absence of the charged student but only if the student has been properly notied and fails to appear. 9) Minutes of the proceedings shall be maintained. Only upon the request of the student, the Committee Chair or their designated representative or the Provost shall recording of the proceeding be made. Findings The Committee shall render a written recommendation to the appropriate Dean or Program Director within 10 business days of the conclusion of the hearing. The Committee may make a recommendation for sanctions. The appropriate ofcer will notify the student and/or advisor of the decision.Right to Appeal The student who has been dismissed has a right of appeal to the Provost. The Provost must receive the appeal witing 5 business days. The Provost has discretionary power to afrm, modify or remand within 10 business days from receipt of the appeal. Student Status Note : The policies in this section are general PCOM policies pertaining to all students. Be sure to become familiar with your academic program's handbook, which will provide you with additional policies and procedures specic to your academic program. The full Leave of Absence, Withdraw, Change in Status Policy (7.004) can be found on MyPCOM, Resources section. Student Status There are ve student status categories at PCOM: 1. Active 2. Leave of Absence (LOA) 3. Withdrawal (WD) 4. Dismissal 5. Graduated Active Status A student is considered active if they are enrolled or have the ability to enroll in coursework. Students who are registered for audit coursework or who are in a non-degree program will only be considered enrolled at the institutional level and not for federal or state reporting purposes. There are 3 types of enrolled statuses: Less than half-time, half-time, and full- time. These are dened as: Less than half-time= 2.99 credit hours or less Half-time= 3 to 5.99 credit hours Full-time= 6 credit hours or more It is expected that students will be continuously enrolled (excluding summer for some programs). As a result, students who are in an \"active status\" will be moved to a \"withdrawn status\" after two consecutive terms of non-enrollment. Students should always seek a leave of absence if they believe they will not be able to complete their program of study as listed in the catalog. Leave of Absence Status A Leave of Absence indicates a temporary separation from the student's academic program with the intention to return. There are two types of leaves of absence: College Mandated and Student Voluntary. College Mandated Leave of Absence The academic program can also require a student to take leave if the student does not meet academic standards. More information regarding this required leave can be found in the program handbooks. The academic program/provost ofce will send an email notication to the student if they are required to take a mandatory leave. The student is not required to complete any paperwork for this leave. Student Voluntary Leave of Absence2022-2023 Academic Catalog 127 A voluntary Leave of Absence (LOA) indicates a student's desire to temporarily separate from their academic program with the intention to return. A LOA is granted for a maximum of one year from the date the LOA is approved. The LOA may be granted for medical, military, jury duty, personal, or other reasons such as academic enrichment. Information on the implications and process of requesting a Student Voluntary LOA is provided in this section of the handbook. LOA implications that may be specic to an academic program are provided in the academic program handbook. Implications of a Leave of Absence Academic Progress The academic program will discuss with the student how taking a leave will impact the completion of their program of study. However, it should be assumed that any leave from the program will extend the time it takes the student to complete their degree program. This could result in the student being asked to retake additional previously passed coursework or new coursework added to the academic program of study. The student should reach out to their academic program for details. Financial Aid A student who is on a leave of absence is considered withdrawn for nancial aid purposes. Please be aware that a nancial aid withdrawal status may affect the following: If the leave occurs during a term, it is possible that partial or full nancial aid will be returned resulting in a balance owed to the institution. See the Title IV return of funds policy for more information: https://www.pcom.edu/about/departments/nancial- aid/return-of-funds.html If the leave occurs during a term, it is possible that a partial or full tuition refund will be issued to the student. See PCOM's tuition refund policy for more information: https://www.pcom.edu/about/ departments/bursar/refund-policy.html Depending on the length of the leave, it is possible for the student to be required to start repayment on their previously borrowed student loans. The student will not be charged tuition or receive nancial aid disbursements during their leave. For more information about LOA and its impact on nancial aid, please visit https://courseleaf.pcom.edu/the-college/n-aid/ (p. 16) Registration and Grades Students on a leave are considered withdrawn and are reported as such to various federal and third party agencies such as the National Student Loan Database System and the National Student Clearinghouse. Once the student returns to the program and is registered for coursework those same agencies will be notied of the updated enrollment status. Those students requesting a leave during a term will receive a grade for their coursework. At minimum the student will receive a W (withdrawal), WF (withdrawal failing), WP (withdrawal passing), or a number/letter grade depending on their program's specic policies as listed in their programmatic handbook. If awarded a W/WF/WP grade, that grade will show on the academic transcript but will not impact the student's grade point average. Students should review their program's handbook for more specic information. Student ResourcesWhile on a LOA, the student will retain access to their PCOM email, library, student affairs, and mental health and counseling services https:// www.pcom.edu/student-life/student-affairs/counseling/ How to Request a Student Voluntary Leave of Absence (LOA) Please refer to the Registrar's website at https://www.pcom.edu/about/ departments/registrar/leave.html for instructions on how to request a Leave of Absence. If the decision is made to take a Leave of Absence, the student must complete the PCOM Leave of Absence Form, which includes receiving the appropriate programmatic and administrative approvals with the nal approval from the Dean. The LOA is not approved without the Dean's nal approval. The online form to request the leave is available at the link above. The effective date of the LOA is discussed and determined during the process. Upon approval of the Leave of Absence form, the Ofce of the Registrar will send the student a nal email conrming the leave is approved as well as a similar notice is sent out to the administration and the academic program. PLEASE NOTE: A student who does not re-enroll in coursework at the end of their approved leave of absence will be subjected to Academic Policy 7.004- \"Leave of absence, withdrawal, and change of status\" which requires a student to be enrolled or be on an approved leave of absence. After two consecutive terms of non-enrollment or not being on an approved leave, the student will be administratively withdrawn from their program. Returning from a Leave of Absence (LOA) A student who is on a leave of absence will be allowed to return to PCOM at the end of the LOA and will not be required to apply for readmission to their program. If a student is not prepared to return after the year, they must contact their program director to request an extension. Please note the Dean of their school must approve the requested extension beyond a year and such extensions are usually only made for extreme events that are out of the control of the student. The student must email the Senior Program Manager in the Provost's Ofce stating their intention to return, no later than one month prior to their intended date of return. PCOM may require professional documentation of tness to return from a leave of absence. Withdrawal Status The withdrawal status represents a separation from the degree program with no intention to return. A student who is withdrawn from their program will be required to be readmitted into the program and could be required to complete all previously taken coursework. There are two types of withdrawal status: Administrative and Student Voluntary. Administrative withdrawal is also processed when a student has stopped attending their academic program for two or more academic terms without being on an approved leave of absence. Both the student and the Program Director will be notied prior to the administrative withdrawal process and the student will have two weeks from the date of the withdrawal notication to speak with their program director about re- enrolling into the program or requesting a leave of absence. Student Voluntary withdrawal is a request from the student to withdraw from their academic program. To do so, the student would need to complete the withdraw form ( https:// app.smartsheet.com/b/form/61f2e5e509f246a0b93890b71b62e78d/ )128 Academic Standing at https://app.smartsheet.com/b/ form/61f2e5e509f246a0b93890b71b62e78d (https:// app.smartsheet.com/b/form/61f2e5e509f246a0b93890b71b62e78d/ ), Once the form is submitted, it will be sent to student affairs as well as the student's program director who might reach out to the student to discuss their request. It should be noted that the option of leave of absence should always be considered before withdrawing from the program as the withdrawal results in the student needing to reapply through the admission process and likely having to repeat some or all of the coursework for the program. Please note that an academic dismissal takes priority over a student's request to withdraw or take a leave of absence. Dismissal Status Dismissal represents permanent separation from the College. A student who is dismissed from their academic program must wait one year before re-applying to the same academic program. There are two types of dismissals: Academic Dismissal is a separation from the College based upon the student's failure to fulll the academic requirements of their program. Information on this process is provided in the Academic Standing section of this handbook, and online (https://www.pcom.edu/about/ departments/registrar/academic-standing.html). Please note that an academic dismissal takes priority over a student's request to withdraw or take a leave of absence. Disciplinary Dismissal is a separation from the College based upon the student's violation of a standard of conduct policy and recommended to the Provost by the Student Professional Conduct Committee. Information on the disciplinary process is provided in the Violation of College Policies and Disciplinary Processes section of this handbook, and online ( https:// www.pcom.edu/disclosures/pdfs/summary-of-profesional-policies.pdf). Graduated Status The graduated status represents a student who has met all degree requirements as listed in their program of study and their degree has been conferred. Verication of Enrollment/Good Standing All requests by students or graduates for verication of their enrollment, academic standing or graduation must be made in writing to the Ofce of the Registrar. The enrollment verication form can be obtained from the Registrar's website at pcom.edu/about/departments/registrar/ (https://catalog.pcom.edu/gsh/enrollment-loa-procedures/verication- enrollment-good-standing/pcom.edu/about/departments/registrar/ ). Requests are typically processed within ve business days of receipt.

If an account or reference number is required, this must be stated on the request. College's Right to Separate Students The College reserves the right, and the student, by the act of matriculation, concedes to the College the right, to separate a student from the College at any time deemed necessary to safeguard PCOM standards of scholarship, safety, conduct and compliance with regulations, or for such other reasons deemed appropriate by theCollege. For more information, please visit the College's Right to Separate Students section in the handbook. Academic Standing Each academic program maintains specic policies related to academic standing, promotion and dismissal. The academic standing policies for each degree program are explained in the respective program's academic policy handbook. At the end of each term, student scholastic achievement is rst reviewed by each academic program's evaluation committee, which is a standing committee that may consist of program faculty, staff, and Student Affairs administrators. Each program's evaluation committee makes academic standing recommendations to the senior academic ofcer as listed below. The committees may consider prior academic deciencies/failures when making recommendations on the academic status of any student. The recommendations are based upon the specic academic promotion policies of their academic program. Academic standing recommendations are made to the following senior program administrators: Philadelphia Campus : Osteopathic Medical Program: Dean & Chief Academic Ofcer for Osteopathic Medicine Psychology Programs: Dean for Psychology Programs Health Sciences: Dean for Health Science Programs PCOM Georgia Campus : Osteopathic Medical Program: Dean & Chief Academic Ofcer for Osteopathic Medical Program Health Science Programs: Dean for Health Science Programs School of Pharmacy: Dean and Chief Academic Ofcer School of Pharmacy PCOM South Georgia Campus: Osteopathic Medical Program: Senior Associate Dean & Chief Academic Ofcer for Osteopathic Medical Program Health Science Program: Dean for Health Science Programs The appropriate senior academic ofcer, in consultation with the Provost, will determine if the recommendation will be accepted, modied, or remanded. The student will receive written notice of the action. The full Academic Standing Policy (7.005) can be found on MyPCOM, Resources section. Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy The United States Department of Education requires every postsecondary institution receiving Title IV federal funds to have an academic progress policy that is used to determine eligibility for and continued receipt of federal funds. A review of each student's satisfactory academic progress will be conducted annually at the end of the spring term, regardless of when a student enrolls. For more information, please refer to our webpage at pcom.edu/sap.2022-2023 Academic Catalog 129 Academic Probation A student may be placed on probationary status by action of the respective Senior Academic Ofcer. Academic probation applies to students who have demonstrated a marginal level of performance to the degree that any additional academic deciencies will make the student liable for dismissal. The duration and conditions of probation will be specied by the respective Senior Academic Ofcer. Academic Dismissal By action of the Student Academic Ofcer, students may be dismissed from PCOM for academic deciency in accordance with criteria set forth in their program's student handbook. Written notice of the dismissal action will be sent to the student, which will include information about eligibility to appeal the dismissal (see Appealing an Academic Dismissal Decision, below). Please note that an academic dismissal takes priority over a student's request to withdraw or take a leave of absence. Dismissal for reasons other than academic deciency is governed by policies and procedures for non-academic dismissals set forth elsewhere in this handbook and individual program student handbooks. Examples include but are not limited to violation of the College's Standards of Conduct, violations of local, state or federal law, unprofessional behavior, and criminal activity, or other reasons as set forth in the College Standards of Conduct and Ethics Code, which appear in this handbook. Appealing an Academic Dismissal Decision Students who are dismissed for academic deciency may be eligible to appeal the decision. The request for appeal must be made to the Ofce of Student Affairs within 5 business days after the student has been notied of the dismissal decision. The policy for appealing an academic dismissal is included in the full Academic Appeals policy (#7.003) may be found in the resources section of MyPCOM. The full Appeals Policy (7.003) can be found on MyPCOM, Resources section. The Appeals Hearing Any student appealing a dismissal will be entitled to a hearing before the Faculty Committee on Academic Appeals. The scope of the review shall not include a review of the components of a specic grade or grades. 1. Students may not bring before the Faculty Committee on Academic Appeals any requests other than an appeal of a permanent dismissal action. 2. At the hearing, the student may present relevant evidence on his or her behalf, and with prior notice may be represented by an attorney or another. Such notice must be provided to the Chief Student Affairs Ofcer at least 10 days prior to the scheduled date for the hearing. The full Academic Appeals policy (#7.003) may be found in the resources section of MyPCOM.The Appeals Decision The Faculty Committee on Academic Appeals makes the nal decision. The student shall be notied in writing by the Provost of the nal decision. The full Academic Appeals policy (#7.003) may be found in the resources section of MyPCOM. Re-Applying to PCOM After Dismissal Students who have been dismissed may re-apply to PCOM. Students may not apply for readmission for the academic year immediately following their dismissal. A formal petition by the student must be made in writing to the Provost. A special ad hoc admissions subcommittee will convene to consider the request. The student may be required to complete a new application to the program, provide updated information and furnish a personal statement and/or evidence of additional academic work and/or medical or psychological care. Where appropriate, the subcommittee may also require a recommendation from the director of the respective professional or graduate program and an interview with the student. All prior college- related data is available to the ad hoc committee. The subcommittee may recommend that conditions be placed on any approval for readmission. All reinstatements are probationary for the re- entry year. The recommendation of the subcommittee is subject to approval by the senior academic ofcer of the student's academic program in consultation with the Provost. Please Note : Re-enrollment following a dismissal may affect federal nancial aid eligibility. Tuition Payment and Refund Policies The Tuition Bill Tuition at PCOM is billed electronically. An E-bill will be sent to your PCOM email address approximately 30 days prior to the start of the term. Tuition is charged each enrolled term. A paper invoice will only be mailed upon a student's request to the Bursar's Ofce. Tuition Payment Policy The College expects all tuition bills to be paid by the date stated on the tuition bill. A check that is not honored by the bank on which it is drawn will be subject to a $50 fee. Below is a schedule of important milestones for tuition payment: Deferment of Payment : The College will allow a student to defer payment on those tuition amounts that will be paid from the proceeds of loans to be received by the College. The student: Must have completed all paperwork pertinent to those loans, and all materials must have been sent to the respective lending agency prior to the due date.130 Tuition Refund Policy Please Note: Students who have applied for loans to pay part of their obligation and will pay the remaining balance from personal sources must pay that balance as of the tuition due date. Below is a listed schedule of important milestones for tuition payment at PCOM: Approximately 30 days prior to the start of the term \u2014 Bursar will send out the e-bill. 14 days prior to the start of the student's program's term \u2014 tuition is due. 14 days after the tuition due date \u2014 late penalties to be assessed (i.e.: late fee, hold and inactivate badge). Late penalties will be assessed every 28 days after the tuition due date listed on your e-bill. At ECSI, a series of four increasingly urgent letters and a phone call are completed at 30 day intervals. At the end of that series of letters the student will be placed in collection with one of the two collection companies. A warning letter is sent to each student prior to the submission of their account to collections. All collection fees related to the collection of past due accounts are the responsibility of the student. Allowances will be made for those students that are accepted just prior to the start of the term. Tuition Refund Policy Refunds are determined based on the proration of tuition and percentage of program completed at withdrawal, up to 50% of the program. Refund Process If a student withdraws from classes within seven weeks from the start of the term , a pro-rata refund or tuition credit may be authorized. In the case of full withdrawals, the effective date of the withdrawal is the date on which the student led with the Provost or Registrar a written notication of withdrawal or a request for a leave of absence. Clinical rotation students Students taking part in an off campus clinical assignment who take a leave of absence after completing one or more rotations for a term will not receive a tuition refund. Rather, when the student returns from their leave of absence, the student will not be charged additional tuition beyond the full tuition required for completion of their programs. However, if the student decides to withdraw from the program after completing one or more rotations, the student will receive a prorated tuition refund based on the number of rotations completed compared to the number of rotations required as part of their program of study. Those students impacted by this include, but are not limited to, 3rd and 4th year Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, 4th year Pharmacy, 2nd year Physician Assistant, and 3rd year Physical Therapy. Refund Schedule Withdrawal Within: Tuition Owed Credit 1st week of class (up to 5% of instructional time) 0% 100%2nd week of class (>5% but </=10% of Instructional time) 10% 90% 3rd and 4th week of class (>10% but </=25% of Instructional time) 25% 75% 5th through 7th week of class (>10% but </=25% of Instructional time) 50% 50% After 7th week of class 100% 0% No fee or portion of a fee is refundable. The refund policy is subject to change at the discretion of the Board of Trustees, but in no instance will such a change become retroactive. All federal nancial aid funds are credited or returned in compliance with the Federal Return Policy schedule. If a student is required by their academic program to take a mandatory leave or is academically dismissed while currently enrolled in courses for the term, a 100% tuition refund will be issued for those course/courses for that term. If the student has nancial aid, the return of Title IV aid process (https://www.pcom.edu/about/departments/nancial-aid/return- of-funds.html ) will be completed. If the amount PCOM is required to be returned in nancial aid exceeds the tuition refunded, the student will be required to make payment of the balance before returning to PCOM. If the academic program or academic advisor recommends repeating a previously passed and graded course for audit credit, the student will not be charged an additional tuition fee for the audit course. Removal from Classes for Non- Payment The Bursar's Ofce is charged with the responsibility of notifying the Registrar's Ofce of those students to be dropped from classes or training assignments for non-payment of tuition. The registrar will then drop the student from their current classes if they have not satised their nancial obligations with the College. Outstanding Balances and Graduation If, for any reason, a graduating student has a balance on his/her account at the end of his/her nal class year, that student will not be permitted to graduate and will not receive a diploma. Transcripts will not be sent from the Registrar's Ofce for that student until the tuition account is satised. Any exceptions to this policy must be discussed with the Chief Student Services Ofcer. Students must also comply with any other fees, deadlines, or nancial policies required by their specic program. Late Fees The Registrar's Ofce will charge a late fee to those students who have not completed their registration by the published deadline. The Bursar's Ofce will charge a late fee to those students who have not completed their nancial obligations. A late fee will be placed on each delinquent account 14 days after the due date and every 28 days after the tuition due date listed on your bill, until your account is paid in full.2022-2023 Academic Catalog 131 If proceeds from loans are received by the Bursar and a student does not appear to endorse the check(s) within the authorized time period, a late fee on the balance payable by the loan will be applied retroactively. In the event that a student receives and accepts a late admission to the rst year of study, an exception to the above policy will be considered if the appropriate loan applications are led immediately in the expectation of making full tuition payment. This exception is for the rst payment period of the rst year of study only. Any exceptions beyond the rst payment period must be discussed with the Chief Student Services Ofcer Disbursement of Refunds Refund checks or direct deposits will be produced every Tuesday. Cutoff times for processing refunds are end of day Monday. The exceptions to the refund schedule are the following: Banking or school holidays: Refunds will be processed the next business day. Philadelphia Campus is closed: Refunds will be processed the business day the campus reopens. First disbursement date of each term: Refunds will be processed 7 to 10 days following the disbursement of loans. It is strongly recommended that students sign up for direct deposit for their refunds. This process is safer and a more convenient way for students to receive funds. Direct deposit of student refunds is available by completing an authorization form. The initial setup for direct deposit will take approximately one week. The funds will be electronically posted to your bank account within two days. For example, if your refund is processed on Tuesday, then the funds will be posted to your bank account on Wednesday or Thursday. Disability Accommodation Policy Disability Accommodation Request Policy Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine is committed to complying with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, interpreted and strengthened by the Americans with Disabilities Act, and with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA), by meeting the needs of students who have disabilities under the law. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and accompanying regulations dene a person with a disability as someone with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities such as walking, seeing, hearing, or learning as compared to most people in the general population. Functional limitation refers to the behavioral manifestations of the disability that impede the individual's ability to function, i.e., what someone cannot do on a regular and continuing basis as a result of the disability. It is the College's policy to provide reasonable accommodation for students who, through a documented assessment performed within three years of requesting the accommodation at PCOM, qualify for an accommodation(s) under the ADA. As per the ADA, the documentation must conrm that the student \"has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities\" and that the disability supports the accommodation(s) requested.Please Note: Problems such as test anxiety and English as a second language (in and of itself) are not learning disabilities and therefore are not covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, or the PHRA. Additional information regarding disability accommodations can be found on MyPCOM . Accommodations for Licensing Examinations : Students should note that many licensing agencies have a separate process for applying for accommodations for license exams. Students should check with the licensing agency afliated with their intended graduate or professional school program for their process and requirements Disability Accommodation Request Process A student with a documented disability may request reasonable accommodations. This request must be accompanied by appropriate documentation that establishes that the student has a specic disability that supports the accommodation(s) requested. All requests for information should be emailed to the Equity and Title IX Coordinator at disabilityservices@pcom.edu . The Equity and Title IX Coordinator will provide the student with the PCOM Guide to Disability Services as well as instructions for the accommodation request process. Once all required documentation is submitted, the review process will begin. The Equity and Title IX Coordinator will notify the student of the outcome of the accommodation request, and a plan for implementing any approved accommodations will be set in motion. Once accommodations are approved, they are no retroactive. They are enacted within a reasonable timeframe going forward from the date of the accommodation approval. The Equity and Title IX Coordinator facilitates the interactive process for disability accommodations at PCOM. For more information, please email: disabilityservices@pcom.edu . Exams and Assessments: No-Show, Lateness, or Cancellation A student with accommodations who misses an examination or assessment for a no-show, lateness, or cancellation must be prepared to take a make-up examination or assessment immediately upon their return to campus, unless other arrangements are made with Student Affairs or the department contact administering the testing. It is the student's responsibility to reschedule a make-up exam by contacting a Student Affairs staff member on your campus or the department contact administering the test.
