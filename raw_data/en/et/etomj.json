While prevention is the best defense, what do we do when symptoms hit? Some of us prepare for the cold and flu season in the fall by starting our fire cider and tinctures to stay healthy and treat illness at the onset. I'm Sick - Now What? Many herbalists keep their arsenal stocked and ready. But, what if you find you don't have the herbs you need? What if the herbs you need are not readily available in your area? Once symptoms hit, you don't have time to order online. You want relief and you want it fast. Luckily, there are plenty of herbs you can buy at your local supermarket to alleviate symptoms and shorten the duration of colds and flu. And, if taken early and often, it is possible to prevent an illness from worsening and turning into bronchitis or pneumonia. The supportive herbs below are meant to be simple to make using ingredients that are readily available. The best thing about these recipes is that they can be customized to the individual and many of the herbs can be used to address a variety of illnesses including colds and flu. Supportive Herbs for Colds and Flu Shopping List: Garlic - anti-viral, antibiotic, and antiseptic. Onion - great for coughs and raw onion keeps the respiratory tract open. Ginger - antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory. In addition to treating cold/flu, ginger is excellent for nausea and vomiting. Sage - carminative, antiseptic, and astringent - the mouth and throat plant. Used for sore throats and cough. Also used for sinus congestion. Sage should not be used when pregnant or breast feeding. Thyme - antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiviral, expectorant, and astringent. Thyme is great for respiratory infections and coughs. It is also good for the stomach and relieves gas. Cayenne powder - stimulant, anti-microbial, analgesic, carminative, diaphoretic, and expectorant. Cayenne can help prevent a cold or flu as well as shorten the duration of a cold or flu. It brings heat to the body, which can help dispel coldness. Honey - raw, local honey should ideally be purchased either at a farmer's market or at Whole Foods or Trader Joes. Honey is antibacterial, antimicrobial, and antiseptic. Do not give honey to children under 1 year old. Lemon - high in vitamin C, lemon may help decrease the strength of the cold and flu virus in the body and reduce phlegm. Many folks use lemons to build resistance to cold and flu, and speed up healing. Tea and Infusions HERBAL TEA - GENERAL PREPARATION Herbal teas are a great way to treat colds and flu!
