Kozhikode-born [Dr Jasmine Sulaiman](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/dr-jasmine-sulaiman) , 54, named [Year](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/year) , talks to Chidanand Rajghatta about the honour and what it means :How is one recognized as Country Doctor of the Year? Each year individuals across the country nominate thousands of deserving, extraordinary health providers for the award instituted by the healthcare company AMN. A committee of professionals then reviews the accomplishments, narrows the field, interviews the finalists, and makes site visits to observe the dayto-day activities of the nominees. This has been one of the most meaningful honours I have ever received. It represents the culmination of many years of education, hard work and service.Physicians of Indian origin are the largest group in America after those who are US-born.What does this say about the system in India that lets go of a large number of its medical graduates? I do not believe India is actively \"letting go\" of its physicians. It's an individual physician's choice where she or he would like to practice, and that choice may be driven by numerous factors including financial, educational or quality of life considerations. The US has a growing need for physicians as the country's population continues to grow and age. This demand has created an attractive job market for physicians that draws candidates from around the globe.You did your MBBS from Kozhikode's Government Medical College, moved to the US with your husband and children in 1995, and now practise in Cleveland, Texas. How do physicians from India make the transition? Transitioning from being a foreign medical graduate to a successful physician in the US is not easy. It is expensive, sometimes prohibitively so, to complete the necessary requirements such as USMLE (US Medical Licensing Examination). Then complete training all over again. It is extremely competitive and challenging, but I expect to see more foreign medical graduates migrating to the US in the near future due to the country's predicted physician shortage by 2025.What is the essential difference between medical practice in India and in the US? The medical training in India is largely based on the US system and it places significant emphasis on clinical signs, symptoms, physical examination and less on sophisticated investigations. It requires physicians to approach all diagnoses with those signs in mind. In the US, physicians combine all kinds of investigation techniques with symptom observation in order to be as precise as possible in their diagnoses and patient care. I believe my education and training in India, coupled with my US experience has given me the best of both worlds.Is it fair to say the US system is also expensive and places too much emphasis on documentation and processes, while there is more personal care in India? This is sometimes seen as the \"defensive\" side of medical practice. However I believe documentation is good for both patients and physicians. The US also has definitive preventive health guidelines for all ages, which are followed by all practising physicians. These types of universal guidelines are unfortunately lacking in India. Evidence-based disease management and quality assurance are critical to a sound medical practice here. Addressing sensitive issues such as \"Do not resuscitate\" and \"Living will\" with every patient is often unheard of in Indian medical practice. In my practice I focus on developing a bond with patients and often make home visits to those who cannot come to the clinic, similar to physicians in India's rural areas.What are your views on alternative medicine? I am from Kerala, the land of ayurveda. I embrace alternative medicine. I often have remedies and recipes to share, especially with patients who cannot afford prescription medicines for minor ailments or those who want to approach their health and well-being in a holistic way. At home I have a neem tree in my front yard. More than a few times I have taken the branches to my patients who are suffering from shingles. Here in the US, osteopathy, chiropractic care, acupuncture and naturopathic medicine have achieved tremendous acceptance with mainstream modern medicine. At the end of the day, the goal for all practitioners is to help their patients achieve a sound body and mind. "}
