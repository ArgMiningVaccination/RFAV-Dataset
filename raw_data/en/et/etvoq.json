This membership fee helps us stay in business without compromising on the quality of care we provide. At Heart of Wellness, we strive to provide exceptional care that goes beyond what is conventionally available. Our team of experienced clinicians makes every effort to really understand you and your situation and to identify and treat the root causes of your illness or injury. Our goal is not just to treat your symptoms but also help you optimize your health and to empower you in your healing journey. We also understand the key role that lifestyle education and coaching plays in helping you to optimize your health and wellbeing. Unfortunately this kind care is significantly undervalued within the conventional medical system. Your membership fee pays for educational and group coaching programs that extend the care we provide beyond the confines of conventional medical services. The membership fee pays only for our education and coaching program and other non-medical benefits such as supplement discounts. The membership fee does not pay for any of the medical services that we provide. Please see our [Pricing Page](https://heartofwellness.org/pricing/) for a listing of our medical services and their costs.

This is our win-win solution to the longstanding problem that the kind of care we offer is undervalued within the conventional medical system. The Membership + Medical care model allows us to stay in business without compromising the care that we provide. And it also provides the additional benefit of a membership community that includes an expanded range of coaching and education resources in order to further extend care we offer beyond conventional limits. [Is this in addition to using my insurance or paying cash for visits?](#accordion-item-is_this_in_addition_to_using_my_insurance_or_paying_cash_for_visits?) Yes. You pay for visits and all medical services via cash or insurance depending on if our clinicians are in-network with your insurance plan. The membership fee pays for access to a range of education and coaching resources that are not typically paid for by insurance. [How do I pay for visits? Can I use my insurance?](#accordion-item-how_do_i_pay_for_visits?_can_i_use_my_insurance?) You can use your insurance to pay for visits if our clinicians are in-network with your insurance plan. If our clinicians are not in-network with your insurance, you can pay cash for your visits. Either way, your participation in the membership program has no effect on how you pay for your visits or other medical services. Please see our Pricing page for more information on our billable rates and time of service discounts. If you do have insurance, your membership does not in any way replace your insurance or eliminate your responsibilities under your insurance contract. You are still responsible for meeting your deductible and for paying all copays or coinsurance. [What does my membership pay for?](#accordion-item-what_does_my_membership_pay_for?) Your membership fee pays for members-only educational and group coaching programs and for supplement discounts through our in-house and online dispensaries. The membership fee does not pay for any clinician visits or other medical services. [Does this mean that Heart of Wellness is becoming like Costco or Amazon?](#accordion-item-does_this_mean_that_heart_of_wellness_is_becoming_like_costco_or_amazon?) We understand why you might think that that but the best analogy is really that we are becoming more like local farm that uses a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program in order to ensure provide a stable cash-flow in order to be able to stay in business and compete with much larger industrialized farms. Just like a CSA program we see our membership program as creating a win-win. We get to stay in business and our patients get to enjoy truly extraordinary Membership + Medical care. [How is this different than concierge medicine?](#accordion-item-how_is_this_different_than_concierge_medicine?) Concierge practices typically charge a fee for medical services. Our membership fee only covers non-medical services such as education, coaching and supplement discounts. Concierge practices typically charge a membership fee ranging anywhere from $100 to $1000 per month while our membership fee is only $100 per year (or even less with our generous family discounts). [What is the cost of membership?](#accordion-item-what_is_the_cost_of_membership?) Annual Membership Costs after the initial 3 Month Free Trial: - Individuals: $100 per year - paid in 4 quarterly installments of $25 each - Couple: $150 per year - paid in 4 quarterly installments of $37.50 each - Two Parent Family (any number kids under 26yo): $180 per year - paid in 4 quarterly installments of $45 each - Single Parent Family (any number kids under 26yo): $130 per year - paid in 4 quarterly installments of $32.50 each - Each additional Adult beyond 2 adults in Family: $50 per year - paid in 4 quarterly installments of $12.50 each Please note that even though the memberships require a 12 month commitment even though they may be paid quarterly.

This trial period allows you to explore the value of the membership without risk. You can cancel your membership at any time during the 3 Month Free Trial period and you will not be charged. [What if I only want to see a physical medicine provider for a short series of visits for an acute condition?](#accordion-item-what_if_i_only_want_to_see_a_physical_medicine_provider_for_a_short_series_of_visits_for_an_acute_condition?) We understand that you might not want to pay for an annual membership if you are only coming in for a short series of visits. That is one reason why we offer a 3 Month Free Trial when you first sign up. If you complete your course of visits during this 3 month period then your membership will not cost you anything. [I am ready to sign up. How do I do that?](#accordion-item-i_am_ready_to_sign_up._how_do_i_do_that?) When you click the link to sign up it will take you to an easy sign up process managed by our membership program partner Hint Health. You will need to provide your basic demographic information and read and sign the membership agreement. You will also have the option of entering either your credit card information or your bank account information so that you do not need to do that later. You don't need to enter payment information at the time that you sign up and you will not be charged any fees until after the conclusion of the initial 3 Month Free Trial. Your payment information is not stored either by Heart of Wellness or by Hint Health. [Are membership fees refundable? Do you offer any satisfaction guarantee?](#accordion-item-are_membership_fees_refundable?_do_you_offer_any_satisfaction_guarantee?)

So if you want to be a member but don't want to be a patient we still welcome you to join us. [My payment information has changed.

You can modify your payment information or any other membership details through our membership management partner Hint Health. They offer an easy system for accessing your membership account. Please follow this link: https://heartofwellness.hint.com/login/request [How do I cancel my membership?](#accordion-item-how_do_i_cancel_my_membership?) To cancel your membership please send an email to memberships@heartofwellness.org [How is this membership legal under state and federal laws?](#accordion-item-how_is_this_membership_legal_under_state_and_federal_laws?) The Heart of Wellness membership program has been developed in compliance with all state and federal requirements. Our membership program is consistent with Washington insurance laws governing health care service contractors and direct primary care practices. Heart of Wellness does not collect prepayment for health care services, nor do we directly bill patients for primary care services. Instead, the membership fees pay for non-covered health care services, primarily including educational and group coaching programs. All conventional covered health care services are billed on a fee-for-service basis to contracted insurers or to patients who pay cash or receive coverage from non-contracted insurers. Covered health care services are not paid for by our membership fee. This membership model allows Heart of Wellness to provide care that goes far beyond what is offered under conventional care and paid for by insurance. However, our memberships do not in any way act as insurance and members are still responsible for meeting all requirements under their insurance contracts for services that are covered health care services. The membership model allows Heart of Wellness to expand on its comprehensive integrated care model while complying with all applicable insurance requirements. Because our membership fee gives patients access to non-covered health care services, Heart of Wellness is not regulated as a health care service contractor nor as a direct primary care practice under state law.
