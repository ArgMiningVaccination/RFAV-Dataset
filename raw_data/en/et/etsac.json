Thanks to the introduction of automated solid phase synthesis, molecular cloning techniques and polymerase chain reaction, a greater rang e of studies involving oligonucleotides and long nucleic acid strands became possible at an affordable price and effort. The profound interests upon DNA could be attributed to its unique properties, including self -recognition, sequence programmability, rob ustness and moderate resistance to degradation. In 1991, an artistic building strategy for artificial DNA structures using pristine DNA was introduced by Seeman.1 A series of DNA architectures have been realized ever since, ranging from two -dimensional arr ays2- 5 to well -defined three dimensional tubes,6 convex polyhedra7-11 and brick and origami structures.12-15 The decisive factor behind all these designs is the proper persistence length of a double -stranded (ds) DNA (50 nm). Due to their well -defined size and shape, significant progress has been made in various application areas employing such DNA nanostructures that range from nanoscale assembly line,16 drug delivery,17,18 nucleic acid detection,19 and DNA machines.20,21 Additionally, great efforts have b een devoted to developing applications of DNA by combining its information -carrying capability with new functionalities introduced by new units. Thanks to the enormous development in DNA technology, a great range of tailor -made modifications are commercial ly available nowadays for daily laboratory usage, which in return promotes the advance of DNA technology. For example, when an acrydite is attached to DNA, DNA -based gels could be obtained upon polymerization, which show appealing performance in sensors,22 drug release scaffolds23 or as matrices for the triggered activation of enzyme cascades.24 In addition to the introduction of new functionalities to DNA, ongoing research has also been focusing on altering molecular structures, morphology, self -assembly properties or even solubility of DNA hybrids upon the introduction of tailored structural units. These can be materials being composed of small organic molecules,25 polymers,26-28 inorganic nanoparticles that are covalently attached ts that are combined through electrostatic interactions.32-33 The first class of DNA hybrids tends to assemble into nanoparticles with a hydrophilic DNA corona and an organic or inorganic core. Such hybrids have found use in DNA detection,34 gene regulatio n,35 template synthesis36 and nanoelectronics.37 The second type, upon complexation of DNA with positively Hydrophobic Modification of DNA 11 charged surfactants, is prone to aggregate and precipitate from aqueous phase. These DNA/surfactant complexes have also been extensively studied and found vast applications.38-41 In recent years, a range of hydrophobic structures have been applied to modify DNA. These DNA hybrid materials either tend to self -assemble into micellar systems with dimensions on the nanoscale in aqueous phase due to micro p hase separation or precipitate from the aqueous phase. Their behaviors are very different from pristine DNA. Hence, these materials present appealing potential for applications in the fields of bionanotechnology and nanomedicine. In this chapter, the hydro phobic modification of DNA through small organic molecules, polymers and surfactants will be briefly reviewed. 1.2 Modification Methods 1.2.1 Solid -Phase synthesis (SPS) of nucleic acids Figure. 1.1. Hydrophobic modificat ion of (A) 5' - and (B) 3' - end of DNAs using solid -phase synthesis. (a) deblocking of DMA; (b) coupling of activated CEPA to 5' -end; (c) standard synthesis with nucleoside phosphoramidite. Chapter 1 12 In 1955 the first dinucleotide was chemically synthesized.42 Howev er, a universal method for the chemical preparation of both DNA and RNA was not reported until 1980 in which 2' -deoxynucleoside -3'-phosphoramidites were used as synthons.43,44 The SPS technique now makes it possible to synthesize short fragments of DNA (up to 200 mers). At the same time, researchers also found it convenient to introduce functional groups to DNAs while the DNAs are still attached to the solid support. One classic method consists of using 2 -cyanoethyl -N, N -diisopropylphosphoramidite (CEPA) gr oups to introduce hydrophobic structures to DNA.45 The hydrophobic molecule is first activated with CEPA and then attached to the 5' -end of DNA on the solid supports (Figure 1.1 A). The coupling to the 3' -end of DNA could be achieved either through reverse synthesis employing special CEPA activated units and final attachment of the hydrophobic moiety (similar to coupling to 5' -end in Figure 1.1 A) or using custom solid supports, which already contain the desired hydrophobic moieties that is connected via a cleavable linker (e.g. carboxylic ester) (Figure 1.1 B).46 With SPS, the coupling of hydrophobic entities to DNA could be done either with or without a DNA synthesizer. With a DNA synthesizer, the full synthesis including the hydrophobe can be regarded as a fully automated process. The advantages of the fully automated synthesis are precise control and monitoring of the entire procedure, higher reproducibility and relatively large scales. A wide range of hydrophobic units have been successfully attached to DNAs within a DNA synthesizer.47-50 Very recently, the automated synthesis technique was employed to prepare polymers and DNA -polymer conjugates through atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).51 The coupling of the hydrophobe without a DNA synthesiz er is often used to circumvent the shortcomings of fully automated synthesis. In this way, the hydropbobe is often coupled using a syringe or in a flask with DNA on solid supports as synthesized. This method can be specifically tailored to satisfy the requ irements of some synthesis, which cannot be achieved on a synthesizer, like incompatible solvents or catalysts, extreme reaction conditions or longer reaction time. Hydrophobic Modification of DNA 13 1.2.2 Solution coupling Figure . 1.2. Illustration of the organic phase synthesis of hydro phobic molecules modified DNAs. Solution -phase coupling of DNA with hydrophilic molecules in an aqueous environment has been demonstrated to be highly versatile and efficient at various positions of the DNA molecule . It is a very widely used method to func tionalize DNA with groups like amine s or thiol s and to attach those to specific complementary functionalities like carboxylic acid, thiol s or maleimide s. Modification of DNA with hydrophobic molecules in aqueous phase, however, is less efficient due to sol vent incompatibility of the two components i.e. the nucleic acid is soluble in water while the hydrophobe is not.52 Recently it was reported in our group that with the help of positively charged surfactants, hydrophobic molecules could be attached to DNA even in organic phase, as shown in Figure 1.2.53 In short, terminal functionalized DNA s (e.g. amine) were first complexed with positively charged surfactants, precipitated and freeze -dried. The resultant DNA /surfactant complex es are not soluble in aqueous p hase but can be dissolved in organic solvents like DMF, CHCl 3 and THF while the surfactants do not compromise the reactivity of the functional group on the DNA . Therefore, the coupling of hydrophobic molecules to DNA could be carried out in organic phase with high efficiency. After the reaction, the surfactants wer e removed by simply wash ing the solution s with brine, yielding the desired products. Pyrene, hydrophobic alkyl chains and polystyrene were attached to the terminal s of DNA in high yields. Chapter 1 14 1.2.3 Complexation with surfactants Figure . 1.3. Schematic representation of LLC structures of dsDNA -lipid complexes: (a) lamellar phase; (b) and (c) hexagonal phase; (d) cubic phase. Hydrophobic modification of DNA could be realized by compl exation with positively charged surfactants through electrostatic interactions , yield ing water -insoluble DNA /surfactant complex es. Their properties are different from the ones from DNA amphiphil es. These complexes consist of a DNA backbone from which surfa ctants protrude as non -covalently bonded side chains. Their formation is electrostatically driven and they form bulk films, lyotropic as well as thermotropic liquid crystals and hydrogels. Owing to their molecular shape and weak intermolecular interactions , such as van der Waals and dipolar forc es,54-56 these complexes tend to spontaneously form highly organized assemblies like ordered lamellar, hexagonal and cubic structures as well as disordered isotropic phases,57,58 as shown in Figure 1.3. Hydrophobic Modification of DNA 15 1.3 Applicat ions DNA modified with h ydrophobic molecules tend s to self -assemble into micellar systems with nanometer dimensions because of micro phase separation (except for DNA /surfactant complexes). These nano -sized particles are composed of a soft hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic shell , which has made them very promising candidates in fields like drug delivery, DNA detection and template reactions. On the other hand, DNA/surfactant complexes are mainly investigated in bulk film or as liquid crystals. In both state s the respective materials exhibit well -defined structures, high structural stability and easy processability , thereby allowing diverse applications ranging from optoelectronics to biomedicine and therapeutics. 1.3.1 Drug delivery Figure . 1.4. (a) Schema tic representation of PPO -b-DNA copolymer micelle: folic acid (red dots) modified complementary oligonucleotides are hybridized to functionalize the surface of the nanoparticle with targeting units and drugs (green dots) are introduced to the core of the nanoparticle through mixing.

(F) Hydrophobic compound loaded into the hydrophobic core. (G) Cross -linked nanodomains of PETA in the core. Due to the self -recognition properties of the DNA part and the presence of a hydrophobic core to serve as a carrier unit, DNA amphiphile s have been extensively Chapter 1 16 studied for drug delivery. With polypropylene oxide -DNA block copolymer ( PPO -b- DNA) micelles, researchers in our group exploited it in cancer therapy .59 It was found that the shell functionality of the nanoparticles could be easily introduced through hybridization with functionalized complementary oligonucleotide (in this case, folic acid) while the hydrophobic interior could be loaded with hydrophobic anticancer drug s through simple mixing (Figure 1. 4 a). Cell culture experiments with Caco 2 c ells show ed that these nanoparticles could be taken up through receptor mediated endocytosis and resulted in efficient cytotoxicity and high mortality. Later a more sophisticated design was proposed in our group (Figure 1. 4 b).60 In this design, Pluronics, a triblock copolymer with a PEG -b-PPO -b-PEG architecture, was blended with PPO -b-DNA copolymer. As a result, the PPO from both DNA copolymer and Pluronics formed the core of micelles while DNA from copolymers and PEG from Pluronics were located in the cor ona. The PEG part did not undermine the hybridization of DNA s while the hydrophobic core could be loaded with hydrophobic drugs or cross -linked to prevent dissociation upon dilution. Hydrophobic Modification of DNA 17 Figure . 1.5. Schematic representation of expected structure change of e thidium bromide intercalated DNA -DDAB film between dry and wet states. Changing the environment from water to bulk materials, DNA -surfactant complexes are characterized by long term in vivo stability of the DNA component and subsequently can recover biolog ical activity once wetted .61 These structures contain a high local concentration of the therapeutic nucleic acid agent and hence the study of bulk DNA -surfactant structures is developing into an exciting field for drug delivery applications. Tirrell and co -workers recently simulated a drug release system by employing an ethidium bromide -labelled DNA - didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DNA -DDAB ) film .62 When exposed to a buffer solution, such as PBS, electrostatic screening of the DNA -complex charges led to d isassembly of the film in a layer -by-layer fashion releasing ethidium bromide (Figure 1.5) . It is thus reasonable to expect the film to disassemble easily in vivo and to act as a drug delivery vehicle or DNA depot. Similarly to ethidium bromide, anticancer drug molecules, such as daunorubicin and doxorubicin, also intercalate into DNA inhibiting the enzyme topoisomerase II and prevent ing the DNAs from Chapter 1 18 duplication in fast -replicating cells .63 These drugs are potentially useful in DNA - surfactant films as they could be incorporated into the complex and then locally elute after implantation upon film degradation, either through nuclease action or ion replacement. In this fashion, a drug delivery system was realized by blending the DNA -surfactant complex with pol y (lactide -co-glycolide) and the drug daunorubicin .64 The complex was obtained by casting a film from DMSO/CHCl 3 solution and subsequent incubation into an aqueous solution of daunorubicin with drug loading being controlled by the immersion time. The pharm aceutically active payload was released from the films after introduction into PBS and the release rate was dependent on the chemical structure of the surfactants. These results clearly indicate that a film of the three components - DNA , surfactant and PLG A - is a promising matrix for anticancer drug delivery. 1.3.2 Liposome decoration Liposomes are a class of nanocontainers which are able to encapsulate and protect both small molecules and bio -macro molecules, such as protein and DNA. They are made of two l ayers of amphiphilic lipid molecules of which the hydrophilic heads face to the aqueous solution while the hydrophobic tails point inwards towards each other.65 Liposomes play an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology of living systems and th ey have been intensively studied to understand and manipulate biological events and proce sses.66-68 Cons idering the similarity between liposomes and DNA amphiphiles, it is reasonable to predict that DNA amphiphiles can play a role in decorating liposomes. A. R. Pulido designed a selective cargo -release system with the help of PPO -b-DNA ,69 as shown in Figure 1.6. In th is design, PPO -b-DNA was first inserted into the surface of vesicles with DNA pointing to the aqueous phase, tagging these nanocontainers with sequence information. Next, a BODIPY monoiodine (BMI) photosensitizer modified complementary DNA was used to hybridize with the DNA on the vesicle surface, which subsequently induced the generation of singlet oxygen close to the lipid membrane under light irradiation. The resulting oxidation of the PPO chains or highly unsaturated phospholipids effectively mediates liberation of the vesicle payload. Hydrophobic Modification of DNA 19 Figure . 1.6. Schematic representation of selective cargo release from PPO -b-DNA decorated lipid vesicles. 1). Anchoring of PPO -b-DNA ; 2) Hybridization with photosensitizer -modified complementary DNA ; 3) Generation of singlet oxygen upon light irradiation; 4) selective cargo release induced by the oxidative effect of singlet oxygen. Recently, it was reported by our group that hydrophobicity could be imparted to DNA through the introduction of a dodec -1-yne chain at the 5 -position of a uracil base , which was subsequently coupled to DNA by solid phase synthesis, termed lipid -DNA.70 With this method, the position a nd number of hydrophobic uracils could be chosen with a similar efficiency as normal bases. The lipid -DNA was successfully utilized to induce vesicle fusion.71 This current work deals with a strategy for anchoring oligonucleotides on a membrane by lipid -modified nucleobases rather than by attaching hydrophobic units to the 3' - or 5' -termini. Single -stranded DNA s functionalized with four lipid -modified nucleobases w ere stably grafted onto the membrane of lipid vesicles. The orientation of DNA hybridization a nd the number of anchoring units play ed a crucial role in liposomal fusion, which in the most efficient system reached remarkable 29% content mixing without notable leakage. Besides , DNA amphiphiles have been employed to realize the assembly of larger cont ainer s,72 mimicking cellular systems73 and gene 1 20 1.3.3 Nanoscience DNA amph iphiles are not only suitable for the construction of nanoscopic structures like spherical or cylindrical micelle aggregates or vesicles but they can be manipulated usin g DNA . With PPO -b-DNA , scientists were able to control the size and geometry of the structures .75 As shown in Figure 1. 7 a, 22mer DNA coupled with PPO (Mw=6800 g/mol) self -assembled into spherical particles with a hydrodynamic radius of 10nm. When the num ber of bases was enzymatically extended to 84, particles with radius of 23nm w ere obtained. The geometry of the particles can be modulated through hybridization with a long complementary DNA template, which resulted in rod -like micelles. Figure . 1.7. (a) Schematic representation and AFM images of the morphology change of PPO -b- DNA amphiphiles upon hybridization with short DNA s (top) and long DNA s (bottom) . (b) Schematic representation and TEM images of (i) spherical particles from initial DNA -brush copoly mers, (ii) rod -like structure formation after the addition of phosphodiesterase enzyme and (iii) morphology change of aggregates upon the addition of different DNA sequences. Another elegant design involved phosphodiesterase enzyme .76 DNA -brush copolymer amphiphiles were obtained by grafting DNA s to a hydrophobic copolymer. Long DNA side chains gave the copolymers higher surface curvature, which resulted in spherical aggregates. When the DNA was cut by an enzyme , a rod - like morphology was formed. Later, upo n hybridization with partial complementary DNA to the side chains , spherical particles were formed again because of the increased surface curvature caused by elongated DNA chains. The partial complementary DNA could be removed by adding a DNA which is full y complementary to it, resulting in amphiphiles with short DNA s hence rod -like aggregates. Upon changing DNA sequences, a reversible control over the morphology of the aggregates was realized. (Figure 1. 7 b) Hydrophobic Modification of DNA 21 Figure . 1.8. Schematic representation of DNA cubes with polymer decoration. In a different design, hydrophilic moieties were attached to the outside of DNA nanostructure. Thereby , a DNA cube scaffold was preassembled with single - stranded regions , which w ere further hybridized with four polymer modifie d DNA strands , as shown in Figure 1.8.77 The polymer was located at various corners of the cube , which increase d the nuclease resistance comparing to DNA cubes without polymers. 1.3.4 DNA detection Similar DNA side chain polymers that were described in the previous paragraph were employed also for DNA detection. W hen several DNA strands are grafted along one polymer chain the melting curves are sharper and higher when hybridized with complementary DNA compared to pristine DNA .78 This characteristic melting behavior was exploited for DNA detection. In one study, DNA as well as ferrocene units were grafted to a polymer backbone and the resulting hybrids were used in a sandwich -type electrochemical detection strategy (Figure 1. 9).79 A probe sequence was first i mmobilized on the surface of a gold electrode. After that, the hybrids and target DNA were added and the redox signal was measured. The sensitivity of this strategy reached 100 pM. DNA -grafted polymer based DNA detection has also be exploited in several ot her studie s.80-82 Chapter 1 22 Figure . 1.9. Schematic representation of DNA detection employing a DNA and ferrocene grafted polymer. 1.4 Thesis Motivation and Overview Tremendous efforts have been devoted to the development of DNA functionalization methods over the last decades, including chemical modification and physical complexation. With specific modification, tailored functionalization and potential applications could be realized. For example, when coupled with a fluorophore, DNA could be used to detect particul ar sequence s. When a hydrophobic structure was coupled to DNA, it is possible to yield either DNA amphiphiles or hydrophobic DNA hybrids. N evertheless , both DNA architectures present some unique properties that pristine DNA does not have. These features we re important to successfully realize potential applications in the context of dynamic DNA assemblies, drug delivery and DNA detection. With a great advancement already existing in DNA functionalization techniques, we are seeking easier and more applicable ways as supplements to current ones and exploiting new applications out of it . This thesis focuses on new properties and potential applications of hydrophobically functionalized DNA. The first Chapter briefly introduced the development of hydrophobic modif ication of DNA, including chemical coupling and physical complexation. Their self -assembly properties and applications were highlighted. Despite the many examples that have been listed, new exciting discoveries in DNA functionalization are awaiting to be exploited. Dodec -1-yne chain -modified DNA (lipid -DNA) was one of the DNA amphiphiles that were developed in our group and found vast applications. In Chapter 2 a new class of lipidated aptmer based functional structure were used for the catalytic oxidation of dopamine to aminochrome, which expanded the application of lipid -DNA. Lipidated hemin/G -quadruplex (hGQ) units and the lipidated dopamine binding aptamer (DBA) units were first synthesized and assembled into micellar Hydrophobic Modification of DNA 23 nanostructures. Then the critical mi celle concentrations (CMC) for the different ratio of lipid -DNA were measured. Subsequently, the catalytic functions of the micelles toward the H 2O2-mediated oxidation of dopamine to aminochrome were evaluated -mimicking dinuclear Cu(II) -BPMP complex was also synthesized and employed to explored the possibility of substituting the lipidated hemin/GQ catalytic sites in the micelles . In the following chapter, lipid -DNA was tested in the context of ophthal mic drug delivery. Nowadays, l ow efficiency of topical drug delivery formulations is an acknowledged problem in ophthalmology. To address this challenge, in Chapter 3, we introduce d lipid ated aptamers (lApts) nanoparticles (NP) as a new class of vehicles f or ophthalmic drug delivery. The generality of this approach was demonstrated employing three aptamers selected for the ophthalmic therapeutics : travoprost, brimonidin and kanamycin B. the synthesized lApts form ed nanosized micelles wit h a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic aptamer corona . The loading capacity of aptameric corona of the NP and the effect of t he lipid modification on aptamer ligand binding characteristic were tested . Subsequently, the cornea binding properties and toxicit y of the lApts were evaluated ex vivo and in vivo . Finally, the efficacy of lApt NPs in antibiotic delivery to animal tissue is investigated. Externally regulated biomacromolecules are now considered as particularly attractive tools in nanoscience and the design of smart materials, due to their highly programmable nature and complex functionality. Incorporation of photoswitches into biomolecules, such as peptides, antibiotics and nucleic acids, has generated exciting results in the past few years. Molecula r motors offer the potential for new and more precise methods of photoregulatio n due to their multistate switching cycle, unidirectionality of rotation, and helicity inversion during the rotational steps. In Chapter 4 , we designed and synthesized a photosw itchable DNA hairpin, in which a molecular motor serves as the bridgehead unit. With the photoswitchable bridgehead in place, hairpin formation was checked and photochemical properties of the motor part in this advanced biohybrid system were evaluated . Rot ation of the motor generates large changes in structure, and as a consequence the duplex stability of the oligonucleotide could be regulated by UV light irradiation. The results presented herein establish molecular motors as powerful multistate switches fo r application in biological environments. In Chapter 5 hydrophobic modification of DNA was extended to physical complexation with positively charged surfactants. A new class of DNA -surfactant Chapter 1 24 based organogels by simply mixing DNA with cationic surfactants and subsequent immersion in organic phases. It was found that these organogels showed excellent absorbability of organic solvents. POM and SAXS tests demonstrated a liquid crystalline state of these organogels. Additionally, mechanical properties, processa bility and self -healing property of these organogels were evaluated. Upon with the introduction of iron oxide nanoparticles, the liquid crystal phase of DNA - surfactant organogels were not compromised but a magnetic respons e to the organogel s was endowed. H ence, with these properties, DNA -surfactant LC organogel s may expand the application of organogels to new potential applications . Hydrophobic Modification of DNA 25 References 1. J. H.

Sci., Supramolecular Micelle -Based Nucleoapzymes for the Catalytic Oxidation of Dopamine to Aminochrome Parts of this chapter have been published: Albada HB, de Vries JW, Liu Q, Golub 30 2.1 Introduction Catalytically active nucleic acids (DNAzymes) represent a novel class of bio -inspired catalysts that have attracted substantial research interest in recent years.1 Different applications of DNAzymes were reported, and these i ncluded their use as amplifying labels for sensing platforms,2, 3 functional units for triggering DNA devices,4 triggers for programmed synthesis,5 functional components for logic gates and computing circuits,6 catalysts for driving chemical transformation s,7 and catalytic units for the controlled release of loads (e.g. drugs from nano -carriers).8 One of the most studied oxidation substrates and the formation of chromophoric10 or fluorescent11 products, or the generation of chemiluminescence in the presence of luminol and H 2O2.12 Also, the hGQ DNAzyme induces a variety of oxidation suc the oxidation Furthermore, the hGQ catalyzed the growth of nanoparticles17 and was found to control the aggregation of Au nanoparticles.18 The catalytic functions of the hemin/G -quadruplex were extensively ap plied to develop amplified optical and electrochemical sensing platforms,19 to synthesize conducting polymers20 and assemble supramolecular DNA switches and machines.21 Furthermore, continuous efforts are directed to improve the catalytic functions of peroxidase -mimicking DNAzymes. For -mimicking DNAzymes. These DNAzymes show, however, lower activities than native peroxidase and lack substrate selectivity. Recently, it was reported that the functions of the hGQ DNAzyme can be significantly enhanced by the conjugation of the hGQ to an aptamer that binds the substrate being oxidized by the hGQ catalytic site.23 The DNAzyme -aptamer conjugate was termed \"nucleoapzyme\", and its improved catal ytic properties were attributed to the concentration of the substrate, by means of the aptamer, in spatial proximity to the catalytic site. That is, the nucleoapzyme conjugates act as enzyme -mimicking structures. Specifically, the of do pamine N -hydroxy -L- arginine by 2O2 to aminochrome and hGQ/anti - dopamine or hGQ/anti -L-arginine aptamer nucleoapzyme structures was demonstrated. Furthermore, it was shown that by a rational design of hGQ -aptamer conju gates, structural rigidification could be realized, resulting in nucleoapzymes with improved catalytic functions.24 It was realized, however, that other methods to assemble functional nucleoapzyme structures may be envisaged. Specifically, we Supramolecular Micelle -Based Nucleoapzymes for the Catalytic Oxidation of Dopamine to Aminochrome 31 were intrigue d by the possibility of using micelles formed by lipidated oligonucleotide sequences as functional nucleoapzyme catalytic nanostructures.25 That of lipidated catalytic oligonucleotides and lipidated aptamers into micellar structures is anticipated to yield functional structures, where the substrate is concentrated in spatial proximity to the active sites, thus leading to enhanced catalytic functions of the supramolecular aggregate. Furthermore, dissociation of the micellar aggregate by m eans of surfactants allows us to inhibit the catalytic functions of the system. In the present study, we demonstrate the assembly of micellar nanostructures consisting of the lipidated hemin/G - quadruplex (hGQ) units and the lipidated dopamine binding aptam er (DBA) units. We reveal enhanced catalytic functions of the micellar aggregate toward the H2O2- mediated oxidation of dopamine to aminochrome, as compared to the separated lipidated hGQ and DBA units. Also, we demonstrate that the hGQ DNAzyme catalytic units in the micellar structures can be substituted with an artificial catechol oxidase - mimicking mediated oxidation of dopamine to aminochrome. Chapter 2 32 2.2 Result and Discussion Figure. 2.1. Sche matic depictions of: (A) the lipidated G -quadruplexes and 2), and (B) the tetra -lipidated dopamine binding aptamer (DBA) sequence ( 3). The five residues that form the dopamine binding pocket are highlighted by the colored circles; these are replaced w ith thymine residues in the mutated sequence, lipoDBAm ( 4). (C) Schematic depiction of the DNAzyme/DBA structures composed of hemin/2lipoGQ (1) and 3). (D) Schematic depiction of ( 2) and the structure of hemin are also depicted in panel C. To assemble the desired catalytic nucleoapzyme micellar nanostructures, we prepared various lipidated DNAzyme sequenc es. Specifically, we synthesized two versions of lipidated G -quadruplexes, i.e. di - and , 2.1A). We also prepared a lipidated dopamine binding aptamer, DBA, sequence that contai ned four the aptamer (lipoDBA, 3, Figure 2.1B). In order to assess the effect of the five residues that were previously determined to form the dopamine binding site,26 we prepared a mutated version of lipo DBA (3) in which these bases were substituted with thymines, resulting in the formation of lipoDBAm (4). All lipidated DNAs were prepared by previously described procedures ,27 Supramolecular Micelle -Based Nucleoapzymes for the Catalytic Oxidation of Dopamine to Aminochrome 33 purified by HPLC, and characterized by MALDI -TOF mass spectrometry (Figure 2.6 - 2.8). Figure. 2.2. CMC determination of the lipoDNA mixtures. The critical micelle concentrations, CMCs, for the different G -quadruplex - DNAzymes (DPH) as a fluorescent probe.28 The CMC values for the isolated components 1, 2, or 3, as well as for various ratios of the two components, i.e. 1 and 3, and 2 and 3 (Figure 2.1C and D for a schematic depiction) were evaluated. We find that the CMC values correspo nd to 8 -9 M for the isolated components (2lipoGQ, 1, 4lipoGQ, 2, and lipoDBA , 3), as well as for various combinations of 1 and 3, or 2 and 3 (Figure 2.2). We note that the CMC values were not significantly affected by the number of lipids attached to the G-quadruplex sequences: both the di - and tetra -lipidated G -quadrup lex structures , and their mixture with the tetra -lipidated DBA sequence, revealed similar CMC -values of 8 -9 M. Accordingly, we applied a concentration that corresponded to 10M of the vario us micelle constituents in our subsequent dopamine oxidation studies so that the lipidated components were retained in the micellar structures. Chapter 2 34 Figure. 2.3. (A and B) Saturation curves for the various ratios of 2lipoGQ ( 1) (A) or 4lipoGQ ( 2) (B) with lip oDBA ( 3). Ratios of hemin/lipoGQ ( 1, for A) or (2, for B) : lipoDBA present in the different systems: (a) 20%:80%, (b) 40%:60%, (c) 60%:40%, and (d) 80%: 20%. Figure 2.3A depicts the rates of oxidation of dopamine (5) to aminochrome (6) at different concen trations of dopamine by micelles composed of hemin /2lipoGQ ( 1) and lipoDBA (3) at variable ratios of components (1) and (3). One may realize that the maximum efficiency is observed at a (1) : (3) ratio corresponding to 40% : 60%. The maximum saturation rat e of this system corresponds to Vmax = 62\u00b17 nM s-1. Figure 2.3B shows the rates of oxidation at different concentrations of dopamine, using variable ratios of hemin /4lipoGQ ( 2) and lipoDBA ( 3) as constituents of the micellar structures. We also observe, in this case, a maximum rate for the oxidation of (5) to (6) at a (2) : ( 3) ratio that corresponds to 40% : 60%, yet with a lower Vmax = 38\u00b15 nM s-1 value . Here we note that the concentration of hemin introduced into different systems was equimolar to the concentration of the lipidated G - Supramolecular Micelle -Based Nucleoapzymes for the Catalytic Oxidation of Dopamine to Aminochrome 35 quadruplexes. This ensured that thse catalytic oxidation rates originate from the hemin/G -quadruplex catalytic units in the respective structures. Evidently, as the relative concentrations of (1) to (3) or (2) to ( 3) increase up to 40% : 60%, the rates of oxidation of (5) to ( 6) are enhanced. A further increase of the content of (1) or (2) beyond this ratio results in a decrease in the rates of oxidation of (5) to ( 6) by the DNAzyme/aptamer micelles. Table 2.1. Kinetic paramet ers of the various dopamine oxidizing micelles having different ratios of 2lipoGQ (1) or 4lipoGQ (2) and lipoDBA 13.4 5.9 \u00b1 0.4 2 4:6 20.9 24.2 12.8 13.0 6.9 8:2 32.5 \u00b1 5.3 5.5 78.7 \u00b1 38.6 Conditions: 20, 40, 80 , 150, 250, and 500 M dopamine (5), 1 mM H 2O2. The micelles were composed of 10 M lipoDNA, which contain 2, 4, 6, or 8 M lipoGQ, either 2lipoGQ (1) or 4lipoGQ (2), which formed 1.48, 2.96, 4.44, active hGQ units (equals [catalys t]). Buffer: 5 mM MES, pH = 5.5, 200 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2. Note: k cat = Vmax/[catalyst]. The detailed catalytic parameters corresponding to the kinetic curves of the two micellar systems shown in Figure 2.3A and B are summarized in Table 2.1. Evidently, the Vmax values in the two systems increase up to a ratio of 4 : 6 of (1) : (3) or ( 2) : (3), and then at higher contents of (1) or (2) the rates decrease. That is, even though the content of the catalytic sites increases, the overall catalytic oxidation rate of (5) to ( 6) is retarded. This is reflected by a substantial drop in the k cat value of the systems that contain increased contents of (1) or ( 2) beyond the ratio of 4 : 6. We attribute the maximum catalytic performance of the micellar structures at this ratio to the optimal concentration of the dopamine substrate, using the aptamer units, close to the catalytic sites present in the micelles. Furthermore, the fact that the maximum rates for the oxidation of (5) to (6) are observed at a ratio, where the apta mer concentration in the micelles slightly exceeds the concentration of the hemin/G -quadruplex units implies that binding of the substrate and release of the product from the DBA sites are the rate -limiting steps in the oxidation process. Also, Chapter 2 36 we note tha t the oxidation of (5) to (6) by the hemin/2lipoGQ ( 1) is ca. 2 -fold more efficient than in the hemin /4lipoGQ ( 2) containing system (particularly visible at a 4 : 6 ratio). Presumably, the hemin /2lipoGQ un it is more flexible in the micellar structure, allo wing the positioning of the catalytic center in a favored spatial organization with respect to the dopamine binding site of the aptamer, leading to enhanced catalytic functions of these micelles. Figure. 2.4. Corrected rate of oxidation of 500 M dopamine ( 5) to aminochrome (6) in the presence of nucleoapzyme micelle systems composed of different ratios 2lipoGQ ( 1) and lipoDBA ( 3) (open circles, curve a). When 0.1% of triton X -100 was added, the corrected rates dropped significantly, up to 3.8 -fold (closed circles, curve b). In further experiments, we evaluated the catalytic functions of the lipidated hemin/G -quadruplex and lipidated DBA micelles at a high concentration of dopamine, i.e. 500 M at which saturation of the dopamine binding sites oc curred (see Figure 2.3), and compared the catalytic efficiencies to the separated non - micellar constituents. Figure 2.4, curve a, shows the V corr values of the micelles containing hemin /2lipoGQ ( 1) a nd lipoDB A 3) a t different ratios (Vcorr corresponds to Vmax values that were corrected for the increase in activity caused by the increasing percentage of hemin/lipoGQ in the micelles, see Figure 2.9). Clearly, the rate of oxidation of (5) to ( 6) reaches an optimal value at a ratio of 4 : 6. Similar results we re observed for the hemin /4lipoGQ ( 2) and lipoDBA (3) micelles (see Figure 2.9). Treatment of all micellar compositions with 0.1% triton X - 100 separated the components and led to similar inefficient rates for the oxidation of (5) to (6) (Figure 2.4, curve b). Furthermore, integration of the lipidated mutated Supramolecular Micelle -Based Nucleoapzymes for the Catalytic Oxidation of Dopamine to Aminochrome 37 DBA sequence, lipoDBAm (4), which has reduced affinity for the dopamine substrate, into the micellar structure that includes any of the lipidated hemin/G - quadruplexes, (1) or ( 2), yielded catalytic rate s similar to those observed for the surfactant -induced separated components (Figure 2.9). These results highlight the significance of the DBA units in concentrating the substrate in spatial proximity to the active site within the micellar structure to yield the most active oxidation catalyst. Furthermore, we explored the possibility of substituting the lipidated hemin/GQ catalytic sites in the micelles with complex , (7) (Figure 2.5A). In order to compare t he activity of this complex with that of the hGQ DNAzyme, we applied a ratio of (7) : (3) that corresponds to 40%: 60%. Figure 2.5B, curve (a), depicts the time -dependent absorbance changes at = 480 nm observed upon the H2O2 -mediated oxidation of 500 M dopamine (5) to ( 6) by the catalytic micelles. The rate of oxidation for this system corresponds to 15.4 \u00b1 0.4 n M s-1. Figure 2.5B, curve (b), depicts the rate of oxidation of (5) to ( 6) by H2O2 in the presence of micelles of the same constituents but now treated with 0.1% triton X- 100, leading to the separation of the micellar components and a drop in the rate to 6.2 \u00b1 0.3 n M s-1. Furthermore, micelles c omposed of only lipo -BPMPCu2, i.e. which lack the dopamine binding site, displayed a rate of 7.8 \u00b1 0.5 nM s-1 (Figurre 2.5(B), curve c), whereas micelles composed of only lipoDBA (3) in the presence of 10 M non-complexed Cu(II) displayed a rate of 4.1 \u00b1 0.8 nM s-1 (Figure 2.5B, curve d). We note, however, that the rate of oxidation of dopamine (5) to aminochro me ( 6) by the ( 7)/(3) micelles is s-1, respectively ). Nevertheless, the results demonstrate the successful catalytic oxidation of dopamine by micelles composed of the catechol oxidase -mimicking catalyst (7) and the dopamine bindin g aptamer, DBA. Chapter 2 38 Figure. 2.5. (A) Structural formula of the lipidated catechol of the catalytic oxidation of dopamine to aminochrome by means of micelles composed of 60% lipoDBA (3) and 40% lipo-BPMPCu 2 (7). The curves show the time dependent formation of aminochrome by various systems (50 mM HEPES, pH = 7.0, 200 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2, see the text for further details). 2.3 Conclusion The present study has introduced a novel approach to construct organized nucleoapzyme nanostructures consisting of micelles composed of lipidated hemin/GQ dinuclear Cu2+-complexes as catalytic units and the lipidated dopamine binding aptamer. The association between the substrate and aptamer with the catalytic micelles led to the concentration of the substrate at a close spatial position with respect to the catalytic sites, resulting in enhanced oxidation of the substrate. We observe, however, only moderate catalytic enhancement for the oxida tion processes. This may originate from non -optimal positioning of the catalytic site with respect to the substrate -ligand site and/or due to the flexibilities of the micellar structures. By further optimization of the lengths of the lipidated chains, and eventually by rigidification of the micelles by crosslinking, the catalytic performance of the micellar nucleoapzymes could be improved. Supramolecular Micelle -Based Nucleoapzymes for the Catalytic Oxidation of Dopamine to Aminochrome 39 2.4 Experimental Section 2.4.1 Materials All chemicals and reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification, unless otherwise noted. The tetrakis(triphenylphosiphine)palladium(0), 1 -dodecyne, copper(I) iodide, and diisopropylamine were purchased received; 5' - DMT All (ODNs) were synthesized using standard automated solid -phase phosphoramidite coupling methods on an \u00c4KTA Oligopilot Plus (GE Healthcare) DNA synthesizer. All solvents and reagents for oligonucleotide synthesis were purchased from Novabiochem (Merck, UK) and SAFC (Sigma -Aldrich, Netherlands). Solid supports (Primer SupportTM, 40 mol/g) from GE Healthcare were used for the synthesis of DNA. The oligonucleotides were characterized by MALDI -TOF mass spectrometry using a 3 -hydroxypicolinic acid matrix. Spectra we re recorded on an ABI Voyager DE -PRO MALDI TOF (delayed extraction reflector) Biospectrometry Workstation mass spectrometer. The concentrations of the DNA were measured on a SpectraMax M2 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, USA) using 1 cm light -path quartz cuvette. Fluorescently labeled and unmodified oligonucleotides purification grade. 1H -NMR and 31P -NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury (400 MHz) NMR spectrometer at 25 \u00b0 C. High -resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on an AEI MS -902 (EI+) instrument. Column chromatography was performed using silica gel \u00c5 (200 -400 Mesh). 2.4.2 Sequences The following sequences were prepared manually, using a C 12-lipid modified 2' - deoxyuridine (T*) residue as lipid anchor. In the lipoGQ sequences, the lipidated nucleotides were separated from the G -quadruplex by means of a spacer consisting of two thymine (T) units. The sequences were purified using RPC HPLC (column: Jupiter Phenomenex .

A linear gradient to 100 %B in 62.5 mL was used. Numbers beside the elution peaks represent the buffer B contents when lipidated nucleotides were eluted. The modified 5 -(dodec -1-ynyl) uracilphosphor amidite 3 was synthesized in two steps as previously reported in our group starting from 1 (Figure 2.6) . The modified uracil phosphoramidite was dissolved in CH 3CN to adjust the concentration to 0.15 M, in the presence of 3 \u00c5 molecular sieves. The prepared solution was directly connected to the DNA synthesizer. All oligonucleotides were synthesized in 10 mol scale on a DNA synthesizer using standard -cyanoethylphosphoramidite coupling chemistry. Deprotection and cleavage from the PS support was carried out by incubation in concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution overnight at 60 \u00b0 C. Following deprotection, the oligonucleotides were purified by reverse -phase chromatography, using a C15 RESOURCE RPCTM 1 mL reverse phase column (GE Healthcare) through a custom gradient elution (A: 100 Mm triethylammonium (MWCO Sartorius Stedim). Oligonucleotide concentrations were determined by UV absorbance using extinction coefficients. Finally, the identity and purity of th e oligonucleotides were confirmed by MALDI -TOF mass spectrometry and analytical anion exchange chromatography using a linear gradient elution, respectively (Figure 2.7 and 2.8) . Chapter 2 42 2.4.4 Critical micelle concentration (CMC) determination From a 1 \u00b5 M solution of 1, 6-diphenyl -1, 3, 5-hexatriene (DPH) in acetone, 10 \u00b5 L (10 pmol) was placed in a black 96 -well plate. The solvent was allowed to evaporate overnight. Meanwhile, the solutions containing various ratios of 2lipoGQ or 4lipoGQ and lipoDBA were prepared. T he following ratios of GQ and DBA were used: 25 : 75, 50 : 50, 75 : 25 (%, n/n), with the following concentrations: 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 \u00b5 M. The solutions containing these ratios and concentrations of lipoDNA were thermally cycled (90 oC, 30 min, -1 oC/2 min until RT) to ensure proper micellization, and 100 \u00b5 L of each of the solutions was added to different wells containing dried DPH. The plate was incubated overnight, and the fluorescence spectra (375 -500 nm, ex = 350 nm) were recorded in a microtiterplate reader (monochromator). The fluorescence maximum is plotted for each mixture and concentration; from this plot, another plot is prepared containing the concentration and fluorescence intensity at 425 nm. The concentration of lipoDNA at the intersection of the low fluorescence region with the high fluorescence region corresponds to the CMC. For all systems, a CMC of approximately 8 \u00b5 M was found; this was not significantly affected by the different ratios of GQ and DBA. Therefore, all catalytic studies were performed using 10 \u00b5 M of lipoDNA mixtures. Supramolecular Micelle -Based Nucleoapzymes for Catalytic Oxidation of Dopamine to Aminochrome 43 2.4.5 Oxidation of dopamine (1) to aminochrome (2) by means of lipoDNA micelles Figure. 2.9. Rate of oxidation of dopamine to aminochrome in the presence of nucleo apzyme micelles that were composed of different ratios of lipoGQ and lipoDBA. The green points show the rates obtained for the micelles that contained the native aptamer, i.e. lipoDBA ( 3); the red points correspond to the rates obtained for the micelles th at contained the mutated aptamer, i.e. lipoDBAm ( 4). Micelles with the appropriate ratios of the two different lipidated DNA sequences were prepared as follows. Stock solutions of lipoDNA (100 \u00b5 M) were prepared in the MES buffer (pH 5.5, 200 mM KCl, 2 mM M gCl 2). From these stock solutions, a Chapter 2 44 total of 10 \u00b5 L of lipoDNA from the two stock solutions was added to 69 \u00b5 L of the buffer; the total amount of lipoDNA was composed of the lipoGQ and lipoDBA sequences in order to reach the desired ratios. The resulting s olution with 12.7 \u00b5 M lipoDNA was annealed as described above. Then, 1 \u00b5 L of a solution of hemin in DMSO was added (stock concentrations: 200, 400, 600, 800 \u00b5 M for the experiments of Figure 2.3 , and 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 \u00b5 M or 1 mM for the experiments of Figure 2.4 ), formation of the hGQ unit was allowed to proceed for 1 hr. Correct formation of the hGQ DNAzyme unit was inferred from the presence of the Soret -band at 405 nm. Saturation kinetic curves were determined using micelles compo sed of lipoGQ : lipoDBA = 2 : 8, 4 : 6, 6 : 4, and 8 : 2 (%, n/n). For this, to the solution of hemin/lipoDNA (80 \u00b5 L, 12.7 \u00b5 M) was added dopamine (10 \u00b5 L of dopamine stock solutions: 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.5, 2.5, 5 mM). For determination of the optimal ratio of lipoGQ a nd lipoDBA, 10 \u00b5 L of dopamine (5 mM) was added. After this, H 2O2 (10 \u00b5 L from a stock -solution with a concentration of H 2O2 of 10 mM) was added, and formation of aminochrome ( 2) was determined by measuring the absorbance each well at 480 nm (values were cor rected for baseline drifting by subtracting the absorbance at 800 nm; pathlength corrections were applied). For determination of the optimal ratio of lipoGQ and lipoDBA, the rates were determined at the saturation point, i.e. with 500 \u00b5 M dopamine ( 1). Auth or Contribution In this chapter, H. Bauke Albada and Itamar Willner designed the of lipidated apamers. H. Bauke Albada carried out the kinetic measurements to monitor the catalytic oxidization of dopamine to aminochrome .

Chapter 3 Lipid modified aptamers as vehicles for ophthalmic drug delivery Chapter 3 48 3.1 Introduction Aptamers are DNA or RNA oligonucleotides, which bind to specific ligands with selectivity and affinity co mparable to antibodies .1 The aptamer -ligand binding is facilitated by electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, - stacking, van der Waals interactions and geometric complementarity between the stable three - dimensional aptamer structure and the target molecule.2, 3 Due to their broad range of affinities, aptamers have been widely employed in nanomedicine as metabolite quenchers and targeting probes delivering active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) or contrast agents to the site of action.4-6 Up to no w, oncology has been the main area of application for such aptamer -derived therapeutics, however , the treatment of other pathologies like ocular, infectious, and cardiovascular diseases is also being performed.7-9 Surprisingly, aptamers have hardly been em ployed as drug -loading moiety for medical applications, despite a large number of aptameric sequences available for medically relevant molecules.10 Recently, Herrmann et al. introduced a novel, cornea -adhering DNA -based NP architecture for ophthalmic indic ations and presented the concept of using aptamers as a drug -loading moiety.11 In fact, ophthalmic drug delivery faces many challenges, such as poor bioavailability and s olubility of active compounds and their rapid clearance from the eye.12 Additionally, an increasing failure rate of drugs under development is not being compensated by an adequate number of potential drug candidates for either known or emerging indications. Hence, significant effort is directed into appropriately formulating available drugs to boost their efficacy.9, 13 Topically applied formulations, i.e. eye drops, are convenient and the most accepted form of drug administration that is available to treat anterior chamber diseases. However, research in eye drop development still faces a lo t of challenges and therefore they remain inefficient.14 The effectiveness of topical therapy suffers from limited permeability of the corneal epithelium and insufficient residence time of the drug at the side of action due to lacrimal fluid production.15 To overcome these difficulties, several ophthalmic formulations based on natural and synthetic polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), hydrogels, emulsions and liposomes were proposed.9, 14, 16 Such formulations can significantly improve the drug bioavailability, p harmacokinetic profile, and reduce potential immunogenicity and cytotoxicity due to minimized drug exposure.14 Yet, they seldom reach the market, which indicates the necessity for novel solutions. In this work, we present a strategy to turn virtually any aptamer into a drug -tailored nanocarrier with intrinsic corneal adhesive properties and we introduce lipid -Lipid Modified Aptamers as Vehicles for Ophthalmic Drug Delivery 49 modified aptamers (lApts) as a class of engineered vehicles for topical ocular therapies. 3.2 Result and Discussion 3.2.1 Synthesis and characteriz ation of lApt s Figure. 3. 5 -(dodec -1-ynyl) RPC -HPLC and (B) MALDI -TOF. The lApts were synthesized using a DNA synthesizer (Figure 3.1) . First, the commercially available 5'-DMT product was activated into 5-(dodec -1-ynyl) deoxyuracil phosphora midite which was further incorporated into DNA sequences using a DNA synthesizer. The Chapter 3 50 obtained lApts were purified employing reverse -phase chromatography (RPC -HPLC) and the purity was confirmed by Matrix -Assisted Laser Desorption Time of Flight Mass micelles The lApt design is based on an aptamer molecule which is extended with a domain containing four alkyl -modified 2' -deoxyuridine nucleotides (U) as hydrophobic modification (Figure 3.2A). In such a molecule, the aptamer sequence is selected to promote specific interactions with a chosen drug and therefore to facilitate the direct loading into the micelle corona. At the same time the lipid tails govern the lApt self-assembly into nanosized particles in an aqueous solution. It has to be noted that pristine oligonucleotides do not exhibit corneal adhesive properties, however the introduction of the lipid tails in a geometrically defined manner results in significant affinity to ocular tissu e.11 In the previously reported system a drug -binding aptamer moiety needed to be synthesized in a separate step and afterwards hybridized to the basic carrier molecule (Figure 3.3A).11 Although this approach allowed for versatile functionaliza tion and rapid screening of new formulations, it requires more synthetic effort and, therefore, is less cost and time efficient. In fact, cost efficiency is a significant difficulty in pharmaceutical industry and hence it has to be considered in developmen t projects. The direct synthesis of lipid modified aptamers allows avoiding several cumbersome purification steps and simplifies the formulation process, thereby significantly improving the earlier reported platform. To demonstrate the generality of this approach, three medically relevant ligands (Figure 3.3C ) were chosen. Kanamycin B, is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to cure eye infections. A DNA binding aptamer (Kan) for this particular drug was developed earlier.17 Brimonidine and travoprost represe nt two classes of intraocular pressure lowering (IOP) APIs commonly used to control the progression of glaucoma. The brimonidine and travoprost binding DNA aptamer sequences (Bri and Tra, respectively) were developed for this study employing a competitive binding assay. Anti -glaucoma medication and anti -infectives currently cover the biggest part of ophthalmic market world -wide.18 The aptamers were elongated at the 5' - end with the hydrophobic domain consisting of four U lipid bases during automated synthes is (Figure 3.3D ). As expected, the resulting lAptKan, lAptBri and lAptTra sequences exhibited an amphiphilic character and therefore self -assembled into NPs above their critical micelle concentrations (CMC). The formed NPs exhibited diameters around 10 nm for lAptKan and lAptBri, and 22 nm for the lAptTra (Figure 3.8 ), with CMC values ranging from 6.7 to 13.3 \u00b5M ( Figure 3.7 ). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed to assess the binding capabilities of the Lipid Modified Aptamers as Vehicles for Ophthalmic Drug Delivery 51 hydrophobically modified aptamers and see if the introduced alkyl chains influence the ligand binding affinity (Figure 3.9) . It was revealed that lipid domain does not compromise the aptameric binding and the binding constants are comparable. Figure. 3.3. (A) lApt nanoparticle assembly from the old generation of aptameric NPs ; (B) The new design of a lApt molecule which self -assembles into a NP and the aptamer -assisted loading strategy; (C) Chemical structures of ophthalmic APIs included in the study; (D) Sequences of corresponding lApts (U indicates lipid modified uracil base) . 3.2.3 Lipid aptamer NP evaluation ex-vivo The cornea binding properties of the aptameric NPs were initially investigated using ex vivo porcine corneal tissue. The lApts were equipped with a fluorescent tag (FAM) at the 3' end of the aptamer sequence to facilitate imaging ( Figure. 3.A). Such approach allowed the aptamer to maintain its secondary conformation and Chapter 3 52 eliminated the necessity to introduce additional DNA probes, whic h could impair aptamer functionality upon hybridization. An eye drop of 50 \u00b5 L of lApt solution (20 \u00b5 M) was applied topically on the porcine eyes and, after a short incubation period, tearing was simulated by washing with PBS buffer for the indicated time ( Figure. 3.B). All investigated lApts exhibited remarkable affinity to the ex-vivo tissue and were detected even after 60 minutes of washing. In contrast, the control consisting of aptamers lacking hydrophobic modif ication, were n ot found on the corneal surface .11 Figure. 3.4. A. Design of fluorescently labeled lApts employed in corneal adherence study ex-vivo and in-vivo ; B. Representative images of adherence of the lAptKan, lAptBri and lAptTra, which were present on ex vivo porcine tissue even after 60 min of tear simulation. C. Representative images of the corneas of rodent eyes at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after drop application. Scale bars correspond to 50 \u00b5 m. 3.2.4 Lipid aptamer evaluation in vivo The corneal bin ding was subsequently investigated in an in vivo rodent model. Therefore, a single eye drop (~30 uL) of the FAM labeled lApt at a concentration of 20 \u00b5 M was administrated to a conscious rat using a medical dropping device. The animal was shortly fixated du ring eye drop application, however, lid movements were not hindered throughout the duration of the experiment. The animals were sacrificed 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after eye drop application and cryosections of Lipid Modified Aptamers as Vehicles for Ophthalmic Drug Delivery 53 the eyes were visualized by fluorescence mi croscopy ( Figure. 3.C). The lAptTra residence time reached 60 min, while the lAptKan and lAptBri were detected on rat corneas even after 120 min from drop application (Table 1). The observed difference in residence time is likely due to varying length of the employed aptameric sequences. The hydrophobic -hydrophilic balance within the amphiphilic molecule is an important parameter that governs the micellization process and morphology. As a consequence, it has an infl uence on the NP's interactions with cellular components.19 The lAptTra sequence is the long est among employed aptamers (42 mer) and it forms the largest lApt particles as demonstrated with dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Figure 3.8 ). Hence, its aggregation behavior is presumably different than that of the shorter DNA equipped with the same UUUU functionality (23 mer and 34 mer for lAptKan and lAptBri, respectively). It is very likely that this alters the ocular affinity. This finding also indicates that intr insically short or truncated aptamers are more suited for corneal -adhesive NP formation. Table 1. Evaluation of lApts adherence to in vivo rodent eyes presented as a number of rat eyes tested positive for the presence of lApts out o f total number of eyes to which the NPs were administered. 3.2.5 Toxicity testing For an ophthalmic drug delivery system, it is very important to address its toxicological profile in an early stage. Therefore, the lApts were evaluated on primary ocular c ell lines regarding their influence on cell viability and apoptosis induction. The primary epithelial cells were isolated from freshly inoculated porcine eyes and incubated with lApt NPs at an amphiphile concentration of 20 \u00b5 M for 24 h. No toxicity was fo und and the lApts treated cells were indistinguishable from the cells treated with the pristine buffer. This finding is of crucial importance as it indicates that the lipid modification introduced into the biodegradable aptamer does not result in a toxic e ffect at the investigated conditions. Chapter 3 54 In-vivo treated rodent eyes were subjected to a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling fluorescence assay, TUNEL -positiv e cells w ere found , which indicates that lApt s do not induce apoptosis in in vivo rodent eyes (Figure 3.5) cryo -sections of lApt treated rodent eyes showed almost no apoptosis positive cells when compared to the assay positive control. 3.2.6 Efficacy The aptamer corona of the NP presented in this study is more compact and sterically crowded than in the situation when aptamers are introduced onto the NP via a linker molecule . To investigate if the altered design influences th e lApt functionality as drug delivery system, we tested the bactericidal efficacy of lAptKan NPs. The aminoglycoside based system was selected as it presents an easy to measure endpoint, the bacterial growth. Additionally, no in vitro intra ocular pressure (IOP) based glaucoma models exist, which would be relevant for transcorneal drug delivery.20 First, we studied whether the API can be liberated from the lAptKan formulation. The antibiotic loaded lAptKan NPs were compared to the free antibiotic solution i n a minimum inhibitory concentration test (MIC -test) using Escherichia coli (E. coli ). The bacterial growth was monitored over 5 h at 37 \u00b0 C by measuring the optical density of the bacterial culture at a wavelength of 600 nm ( Figure. 3..6A). The experiment was performed in the presence and absence of DNAse to mimic situation in the relevant body fluid, i.e. tears .21 The MIC tests showed that under in vitro condition s, lAptKan nanocarriers exhibited comparable level of activity to the free drug. The API was liberated from the formulation also in the absence of externally added nuclease and the measured difference in activity was not significant. It was Lipid Modified Aptamers as Vehicles for Ophthalmic Drug Delivery 55 concluded that the steric hindrance introduced by designing a more compact nanoparticle has no significant impact on the drug release profile. Figure. 3.6 . In vitro efficacy of lAptKan. A. E. coli growth inhibition by lAptKan formulated antibiotic in the presence (bl ue) and absence (red) of DNAse and by pristine kanamycin B (black) proves that the antibiotic is liberated form the NPs on antibiotic. B. P. aeruginosa growth inhibition on infected porcine corneas. As a final point the efficacy of the lAptKan NPs at the site of action was addressed. Porcine ex vivo corneas were infected with P. aeruginosa and afterwards treated with free and lAptKan formulated kanamycin B solution. It was revealed that the antibiotic formulated within lAptKan is significantly more potent than when administrated as the free solution. The improved performance can be attributed to cornea -adhesive properties of the formulation, which contributes to prolonged presence at the infected tissue. Hereby, the 5min washing time to simulate tear fluid slow probably plays a very important role (see supplementary information). 3.3 Conclusion The direct functionalization of aptamers with a lipid moiety represent a novel approach for the formation of NPs used for drug delivery intended to treat ophthalmic a pplications. The drug tailored NPs were synthesized for three ophthalmic APIs: kanamycin B, brimonidine and travoprost. It was demonstrated that the lipid modification resulted in the corneal adherence of the aptameric NPs both in vitro and in vivo , and th at it did not contribute to toxicity of the amphiphiles. The drug release was also proven in vitro and the efficacy of the formulated drug was even demonstrated ex vivo . The created NPs offer an additional drug loading modality as the lipid core of the mic elle can accommodate water insoluble medication.22 As such, their performance as drug delivery system can be further developed by introducing an additional load for co -therapy. 00.050.10.150.20.250.30.35 0123456789101112optical density concentration lAptKan lAptKan+ DNAse Chapter 3 56 Utilizing aptamers as a building block makes the presented strategy readily adaptable to other pharmaceutical ingredients. Moreover, the affinity between aptamer and its ligand can be regulated and therefore the lAPts can be fine -tuned to obtain a controlled release profile. In conclusion, the developed NPs formulation is a promising candidate for development of multifunctional nanotechnology products for therapeutic purposes in the field of ophthalmology . 3.4 Experimental Section 3.4.1 Materials All chemicals and reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification. The 1 -dodecyne, copper(I)iodide, tetrakis(triphenylphosiphine)palladium(0), kanamycin B sulfate and brimonidine were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich and used as received. Travoprost was purchased from Tocris Bioscience. All solvents a nd reagents for oligonucleotide synthesis were purchased from Uridine was obtained from Chemgenes. The concentrations of the DNA were measured on a SpectraMax M2 spectrophotometer (Molecu lar Devices) using 1 cm light -path quartz cuvette. 1H-NMR and 31P-NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury (400 MHz) NMR spectrometer at 25 \u00b0 C. Column chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 \u00c5 (200 -400 Mesh). 3.4.2 Synthesis and characteriza tion of lipid modified aptamers The modified aptamers synthesis was performed in 10 mol scale on an \u00c4KTA oligopilot plus DNA synthesizer (GE Healthcare) using standard - cyanoethylphosphoramidite coupling chemistry on polystyrene solid support (Primer SupportTM, 200 mol/g GE Healthcare -1- ynyl)uracil phosphoramidite ( U) was synthesized according to previously published procedure.22 All conventional phosphoramidites and U phosphoramidite were dissolved in anhydrous CH 3CN at the final concentration of 0.15 M u nder argon atmosphere and connected to the DNA synthesizer. For adhesion studies the aptamer sequences were functionalized with a 5 fluorophore 3' hydroxyl group. After synthesis, deprotection and cleavage from the solid support were carried ou t by incubation in concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution for 5 h at 55 \u00b0 C. Crude mixture of modified oligonucleotides was purified by reverse - phase chromatography, on a C15 RESOURCE RPCTM 1 ml reverse phase column (GE Healthcare) through a custo m gradient elution (A: 100 mM triethylammonium Lipid Modified Aptamers as Vehicles for Ophthalmic Drug Delivery 57 acetate (TEAAc) 2.5% acetonitrile, B: 100 mM TEAAc and 65% 3000, UV absorbance using extinction coefficients. Finally, the identity and purity of the oligonucleotides w ere confirmed by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry using a 3 - hydroxypicolinic (ABI Voyager DE -PRO MALDI TOF Biospectrom etry Workstation) and analytical linear gradient elution, respectively ( Figure 3.2 ). 3.4.3 Determination of critical micelle concentration The critical micelle concentration (CMC) was determined by hydrophobic dye solubilization method. The lApts were prepared at concentrations ranging from 0.25 -100 \u00b5 M in 1xTAE buffer (10 mM Tris -Acetate, 20 mM NaCl, 12 mM MgCl 2, 0.2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and annealed by heating up to 90 \u00b0 C for 30 min and slowly cooling down to RT ( -1 \u00b0 C/2 min). Subsequently 100 \u00b5 l of lApt solutions were added to tubes charged with 10 pmol of dry 1,6 -diphenyl -1,3,5 -hexatriene (DPH, Sigma Aldrich) incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0 C. Subsequently , fluorescence spectra (375 - 500 nm) were recorded on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter (Varian Nederland B.V.) at RT using an excitation wavelength of 350 nm (Figure 3.7) . Figure 3.7.

Dynamic Light Scattering of lApt nanoparticles. The amphiphiles were prepared at a concentration of 50 \u00b5 M in 1x TAE buffer and annealed as described above. The 1xTEA buffer was filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5 m syringe filter prior to use. Measu rements were performed in a temperature controlled set up at 25 \u00b0 C and under a scattering angle of 90\u00b0 on an ALV/CGS -3 goniometer system working in autocorrelation and using JDSU 1145/P HeNe laser (=632.8 nm). The average hydrodynamic radius was obtained from 3 measurements of 30 seconds each (Figure 3.8) . Lipid Modified Aptamers as Vehicles for Ophthalmic Drug Delivery travoprost . Isothermal Titration Calorimetry was used to determine the binding constants between lApts and drugs using a MicroCal ITC 200 Microcalorimeter (Northampton, MA). A 1mM drug s olution was injected from a 40 \u00b5 L rotating syringe into an isothermal sample chamber containing 200 \u00b5 L of 7 \u00b5 M lApt solution. A TAE buffer (pH 8.0) was used to prepare both solutions (Absolute ethanol was used for travoprost), as well as to load the refere nce cell. The experiments were carried out Chapter 3 60 at 25 \u00b0 C and with a stirring speed of 750 rpm. Typically, injections of 1.2 \u00b5 L of titrant were added into the cell with a delay between injections of 100 seconds, up to a lApt/drug ratio of 1 : 5. The effective he at of the drug -lApt interaction upon each titration step was corrected for dilution effect by subtracting the values obtained in the titration of 1 into buffer solution. Each injection generated a point for point heat curve (microcalories per second vs tim e) which was conveniently integrated in order to obtain the heats of the bimolecular interactions associated with those injections. Then the normalized heat signals were analyzed by using the ITC non - linear curve fitting functions for 2 binding sites from MicroCal Origin 7.0 software (MicroCal, Inc. ; Northampton, MA). The satisfactorily fitted cure was used to determine the molar enthalpy change for binding (H ) and the corresponding binding constant (Ka). Fundamental thermodynamic equations were used to determine the molar free energy of binding, Go, and the molar entropy change (S). Each drug -lApt titration was repeated at least 3 times in order to increase the accuracy of the thermodynamic parameters. 3.4.5 Corneal adherence ex vivo The fluorescently labeled lApt solutions were prepared at a c oncentration of 20 \u00b5 M. Porcine eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and washed with PBS buffer before use. To every eye 50 \u00b5 l of lApt solution was applied and, after short incubation, the eyes were immersed in PBS for the designated time (5, 15 o r 30 min) to simulate tearing. Afterwards, t he eyes were enucleated and snap frozen in Tissue - Tek O.C.T. (Sakura Finetek) using liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections were longitudinally cut (12 \u00b5 m) on a cryostat (Leica CM 1900, Germany), thaw -mounted onto glass slides (Superfrost plus, R. Langenbrinck Labor - und Medizintechnik) and stored at -30 \u00b0 C before use. For fluorescen ce imaging the sections were fixed with methanol and 4\u00b4 ,6 -diamidino -2-phenylindol (DAPI) nuclei staining procedure was performed as describe d elsewhe re.23 Stained sections were embedded in FluorSave (Calbiochem, using a adherence in vivo The lApt solu tions were prepared at a concentration of 20 \u00b5 M and transferred to a single drop medical device.

The culture was diluted to OD 600=0.1 with 1X LB medium and loaded in a 96 well plate to the final volume of 200 \u00b5 l/well. Subsequentl y, the wells were supplemented with the antibiotic or antibiotic loaded lAptKan NPs to the final concentrations of 0 -12 \u00b5 M and the OD 600 was monitored every 5 minutes over 5 hours at 37 \u00b0 C on a Synergy HT multi -mode microplate reader (BioTek) . For \u00b5 l of 10 mg/ml DNAse solution was added to each well. Experiment s were performed in triplicate. 3.4.9 Evaluation of antibiotic activity on porcine cornea Kanamycin B loaded lAptKan NPs and unformulated antibiotic solution were prepared a t a concentration of 500 \u00b5 M. Pseudomonas overnight at 37\u00b0 C.24 Ex- vivo cornea punches (diameter 7 mm) were prepared from porcine eyes obtained from the local slaughterhouse. The tissue was infected with P. aeruginosa by incubation with 40 \u00b5 l 0.45 -0.6 OD 600 bacterial solution for 15 min. Afterwards each corneal punch was washed with 0.5 ml PBS every 8 hour s and finally supplemented with 0.3 ml DMEM medium. Kanamycin B loaded NPs were prepared at a Chapter 3 62 concentration of 500 \u00b5 M as described above. Treatment was performed by incubating every cornea punch with 40 \u00b5 l solution of unformulated kanamycin or antibiotic l oaded lAptKan NPs. The punches were incubated for 5 min with the solution and subsequently washed for 5 min with PBS. For the placebo, the infected punches were incubated with buffer solution. Treatment was performed for 24 h. In the latter case the above described procedure was repeated a second time. Afterwards, the punches were shaken for 20 min at 24 \u00b0 C at a thermomixer and serial dilutions (1:10) of the supernatants were incubated on PIA (Sigma Aldrich) plates.

In the more than 60 years since Watson, Crick and Franklin unraveled the double helix,1 immense advances have been made in our understanding of DNA structure and function. Moreover, the programmable nature of DNA has led to its use in nanotechnology,2 genetic engineering,3 information storage ,4 and a range of other applications. In the ongoing search to understand and control the key processes of life, the ability to modulate DNA structure and function is highly desired. Various triggers, such as pH change,5 small molecules,6 short primers,7 biological signals,8 heat,9 metal ions10 and light,11-13 have b een applied to achieve this goal. The use of light has distinct advantages over the other triggers. Light is non -invasive to living tissue, and a high level of spatial and temporal control over its application is possible.11 Therefore, light -responsive mol ecular switches (photoswitches) are considered particularly attractive for reversible control over poly - and oligonu cleotide structure and function.12-15 In photoregulation of oligonucleotides, extensive use has been made from hairpin structures which comp rise short loops of self -complementary DNA or RNA. They can form naturally and are frequently found in RNA secondary structure, where, among a variety of functions, they guide folding, protect mRNA from degradation and act as recognition sites or substrate s for enzymatic reactions.16, 17 Hairpins are short oligonucleotides and are therefore relatively easy to synthesize while their self - hybridization is a small -scale model for double stranded DNA hybridization.18 Typically for preparing photoresponsive hair pins, the bridging nucleotides of the loop are replaced by a molecular photoswitch.13 The photoswitch is usually incorporated into the phosphate backbone of the oligonucleotide. In one state, the switch stabilizes the double stranded helix structure. Irrad iation causes a conformational change in the structure of the switch, which leads to destabilization of the helix and a lower melting temperature ( Tm). Ideally, in a certain temperature range, the oligonucleotide can be fully switched between double and si ngle stranded structures. As a result, in that specific temperature range, the structure can exist as a 'closed' double stranded form, or as an 'open' single stranded form, which may engage in intera ctions with other biomolecules. Backbone incorporation of photoswitches was pioneered by Letsinger and Wu,19, 20 using stilbenes as photoactive bridging units at one terminus of the double -stranded nucleic acid. Subsequently, this method was expanded to the use of azobenzenes by Yamana and co -workers.21 Both trans-stilbene and trans -azobenzene stabilize the hairpins through - interactions with neighboring nucleobases as shown by Phot oswitching of DNA Hybridization using a Molecular Motor 69 enhanced T m. Upon switching to nonplanar cis isomer s, the extra stabilization is lost and the duplex structure of the stem is partiall y disrupted , leading to a lower Tm. This effect was enhanced by Sugimoto and co -workers, by precise engineering of the azobenzene backbone linker length.22 In their design, the cis isomer of the photoswitchable backbone linker is too short to function as a bridgehead for the hairpin. Therefore, the hairpin is distorted upon trans to cis isomerization, leading to additional destabilization and lowering of the Tm. The difference in Tm (Tm) between the two isomers was found to be 20 \u00b0 C for a 5 base pair (bp) hairpin. The Tm is highly dependent on hairpin length, and drops to 17.3 \u00b0 C when the base pair adjacent to the bridgehead is changed from C -G to A -T and to 13.9 \u00b0 C for a 6 bp hair pin.23 Regardless, by the use of an ingenious linker design, Sugimoto and co - workers were able to achieve an unusually high Tm by the incorporation of only a single molecular photoswitch.22 At the same time, o vercrowded alkene -based rotary molecular moto rs offer novel opportunities in the field of photoregulation of biologically active molecules due to their unique dynamic properties. The first of this type of responsive molecules was reported in 1999 and was of particular interest because it exhibited re petitive, photochemically driven unidirectional rotation around a carbon -carbon double bond.24 In recent years, however, molecular motors have found a vast range of applications as multistate switches.25 The rotary cycle of an overcrowded alkene - based mole cular motor consists of four steps and therefore features four different isomers . The large geometrical change upon cis-trans isomerization in rotary molecular motors, accompanied by the structural rigidity, are particularly suited to induce a significant structural change in a DNA hairpin upon irradiation. Moreover, the four -state switching cycle and the change in helicity of the motor in each rotary step offer potential for new functionalities and a high degree of photoregulation. With this in mind, we s et off to evaluate the possibility of using a molecular motor to reversibly control the hybridization of a DNA hairpin . Both stable isomers of the motor were synthesized and subsequently incorporated into DNA hairpins using a DNA synthesizer separately. T m of both isomers modified DNA was determined using SYBR Green I in a fluorescence assay. Unlike previously reported systems, it was found that both motor isomers could greatly stabilize DNA hairpins, as demonstrated by the enhanced T m. The trans -motor show ed better stabilization of the DNA hairpin, however, Density Functional Theory (DFT ) simulation showed otherwise. G el electrophoresis revealed that both isomers adopted a hairpin structure. Besides, we demonstrated the photoisomerization of the motor in th e DNA scaffold was not hindered even under hybridization condition. Chapter 4 70 4.2 Result and Discussion Before starting the synthesis of the target motor -hairpin hybrid, computational calculation w as performed to ensure that the design would be optimal for our envi sioned application. By analogy to the azobenzene reported by Sugimoto and co - workers,22 we designed a double -primary -alcohol -functionalized motor, which could be incorporated in the DNA strand through standard solid phase DNA synthesis. Ideally, the cis isomer should have an O -O distance of 13.3 \u00c5, which is the optimal bridgehead length. Rigid side chains are necessary to enforce sufficient distortion of the hairpin upon photochemical switching. We chose to use first generation motor which is symmetrical, h as limited conformational flexibility and therefore maximize s geometrical change , as shown in Figure 4.1A . The xylene -based core structure of these designs has excellent photochemical properties and can be readily synthesized.26 Figure. 4.1. (A) Structur e of proposed motor linker. The molecule has conformational freedom around the bonds indicated in red22 and the structure is designed to bring the primary alcohol moieties closer together upon trans to cis isomerization. (B) PES scan of the O -O distance in the proposed motor, plotted against the Self Consistent Field (SCF) energy. Density Functional Theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the design computationally . From the calculation, the potential energy surface (PES) scan of the O-O distance was used to estimate the effectiveness of the linker. Figure 4.1B shows the PES scan for the O -O distance for the proposed motor. This structure has limited conformational freedom, which is reflected in a much steeper PES. Cis (blue) has a global minimum at ~15 \u00c5. However, the extra energy required to reorganize to an O-O distance of 13.3 \u00c5 (green) is only 1.7 kJ/mol. The trans isomer (red) has a global minimum at 17.9 \u00c5. Reorganization to 13.3 \u00c5 would require an energy input of 22.9 kJ/mol. Therefore, to accommodat e trans as a bridgehead in a hairpin, partial disruption of the B -form helical structure by breaking hydrogen bonding between one or more base pairs seems much more likely than distortion of the motor. Based on the computation, we envision that switching f rom cis to trans in a DNA hairpin Phot oswitching of DNA Hybridization using a Molecular Motor 71 containing motor as a bridgehead unit will lead to a significant destabilization of the hairpin. Figure . 4.2. (A) Synthesis of trans -motor phosphoramidite building block and trans -motor modified DNA hairpin ( the synthesi s of cis -motor modified DNA followed the same route); (B) MALDI -TOF mass spectra of 8T-cis-8A (left) ) (Calculated mass for both: 5361g/mol) . The motor was synthesized and provided by our collaborator, starting from previously reporte d dibromo -functionalized motor.27 The as synthesized motor was firstly converted into the corresponding phosphoramidite building block (Figure 4.2A) and incorporated into a self -complementary DNA sequence, 5'-TTTTTTTT Oligopilot Plus DNA synthesizer using standard -cyanoethylphosphoramidite coupling chemistry on polystyrene solid support . Both trans and cis isomers modified DNA were synthesized. The product s were confirmed by MALDI -TOF mass spectrometry (Figure 4.2B). Chapter 4 72 Figure . 4.3. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis of various DNA samples. (HY = DNA was hybridized prior to running the gel.) Gel electrophoresis confirmed that both isomers form ed hairpins (Figure 4.3). The positions of 8A8T (HY) (lane 5) is slightly lower than the 10bp band from the ladder, which means that this self -complementary DNA forms an intramolecular hairpin structure in buffer instead of hybridization between 2 strands. Meanwhile, for both cis and trans motor modified DNAs (lane 6 and lane 7), the electrophoretic mobilit y of the major bands is lower than the unmodified 8A8T DNA (lane 5) while much higher than the 15bp band from the ladder, which means the m ajority of both cis and trans motor modified DNAs form an intramolecular hairpin structure as well. Their slightly decreas ed mobility compared to 8A8T can be attributed to the introduction of the motor. When DNA is modified with hydrophobic polymer units, mobilit y is also reduced compared to pristine DNA.28 The minor bands for both motor DNAs could be attributed to intermolec ular DNA duplexes. Figure. 4. 4. Tm determination using SYBR Green I. (A) Temperature dependence of fluorescence signals of DNA samples; (B) First derivatives of curves shown in (A). (HY = DNA was hybridized prior to recording melting curves.) The melting temperature of each hairpin was determined using a SYBR Gre en I fluorescence assay (Figure 4.4 ). T m for 8T -cis-8A was determined to be 59 \u00b0 C, and Phot oswitching of DNA Hybridization using a Molecular Motor 73 for 8T -trans -8A to be 65 \u00b0C. The Tm is therefore 6 \u00b0 C, which is comparable to the achievement of Sugimoto and co -workers (20 \u00b0 C/17.8 \u00b0 C for 5 bp (depending on base pair adjacent to bridgehead), 13.9 \u00b0 C for 6 bp).22, 23 Comparison with an 8 bp DNA hairpin containing a n azobenzene or stilbene linker is not possible. Only three such hybrids were previously reported, and a Tm was not reported for any of them.29-31 Notably, the Tm of the native hairpin 8T8A was determined to be 51.5 \u00b0 C. The observation that the Tm of the native hairpin is lower than the Tm of the hybrids can be partly attributed to the fact that the loop in this hairpin consists of a few bases, which are therefore not engaging in base pairing. Typically, a four nucleotide loop is found to be most stable.32 The loss of two base pair interactions is expected to decrease the Tm a few degrees, while the Tm of 8T -cis-8A and 8T -trans -8A are, respectively, 7.5 \u00b0 C and 13.5 \u00b0 C higher than the Tm of 8T8A. It seems therefore that for both isomers, the motor has a sign ificant stabilizing effect on the hairpin. A similar stabilizing effect is observed for trans azobenzenes and stilbenes, where it has been attributed to stacking interactions.12, 3 3 Figure. 4.5.

All spectra rec orded in Milli -Q, 67 \u00b0 C, at ambient a tmosphere. (C) First derivative curves of melting temperatures analysis of different DNA samples. (HY) = DNA was hybridized prior to recording melting curves. For any application under biologically relevant conditions, and in this case to achieve photocontrol over DNA secondary structure, it is very important that the switching ability of the motor in the hybrid is retained. To investigate the action of the motor without interaction between the two substituent DNA strand s we started our experiments under non -hybridizing conditions: in Milli-Q water and at 67 \u00b0 C, above the Tm of either isomer. We subjected a 2.65 M solution of 8T -trans -8A in Milli -Q to the standard UV -vis experiment used to follow the isomerization processes of a molecular motor (Figure 4.5). In the initial absorption spectrum (Figure 4.5A , B, black line) bot h components of the hybrid can be clearly Chapter 4 74 distinguished. The major absorption band can be attributed to DNA ( max = 262 nm), while above ~300 nm, only the motor units contribute to absorption. The band with two maxima at max = 330 and 345 nm is characteri stic for the stable trans conformation of xylene -based first generation motors26, 3 4, 35 and is also observed in the UV -vis spectrum of the motor . Because the DNA does not absorb above 300 nm, the motor unit can be irradiated without affecting the DNA part of the hybrid. Irradiation with 312 nm at 67 \u00b0 C leads to the appearance of a new absorpti on band at a higher wavelength ( max = 385 nm), which typically results from the formation of a higher energy motor isomer (8T -unstable -cis-8A, Figure 4.5A ). The clear isosbestic point indicates the absence of photodamage or side reactions. After 10 min, a photostationary state was reached and the irradiation was halted (Figure 4.5B , red line). Subsequently, the sample was left at 67 \u00b0 C for several hours to induce thermal helix inversion. As expected, the new band disappeared and an absorption at a lower wa velength ( max =347 nm, Figure 4.5B , likely corresponding to 8T -cis-8A. MALDI -TOF analysis showed that the hybrid does not undergo degradation (Figure 4.8 ). Although the UV -vis spectra alone clearly indicate a photoisomerization f ollowed by thermal helix inversion ( THI), the sample used in this experiment was subjected to a melting temperature analysis by a fluorescence assay. We hypothesized that a mixture of (8T -trans -8A and 8T -cis- 8A) should lead to two maxima i n the differentiated curve of the fluorescence spectrum, corresponding to the two different Tm. In fact, the main maximum in this curve was found at 59 \u00b0 C, which corresponds to the Tm of 8T -cis-8A (Figure 4.5C ). This result, in combination with the UV -vis spectra results , leads us to conclude that an efficient photoisomerization and subsequent THI have taken place. To determine the kinetics of the THI, the absorption of the sample was measured at regular intervals (Figure 4.9). The half -life of the unstable cis isomer of 8T -motor -8A is determined to be ~51 min at 67 \u00b0 C, about 2.5 x slower than for the motor 3 itself (vide supra , 19.5 min at 67 \u00b0 C). Therefore, it appears that motor rotation is slightly slowed down but otherwise unhindered when integrated in t he backbone of a biomolecule and operated in aqueous non -hybridizing conditions. Because these experiment s are performed in bulk solution, irradiation had to be performed for 10 min and we were unable to look at the structural dynamics of the hairpin. Howe ver, it may be possible that reconfiguration of the hairpin occurs on a slower timescale than photoswitching of the motor, similar to responses observed in peptides.36-38 Future investigations may include ultrafast IR studies to elucidate the dynamics of hairpin reconfiguration upon photoswitching. Phot oswitching of DNA Hybridization using a Molecular Motor 75 Figure. 4.6. UV-vis spectra of analysis of the photochemical isomerization of stable 8T -trans -8A. (A) Changes of the absorption spectrum of 8T -trans -8A upon irradiation with 312 nm light. ( B) 8T-trans -8A (black line), the sample after irradiation with 312 nm light for 14 min (red line) , the sample after incubation at 37 \u00b0 C for 3 h (blue line) and the sample after incubation at 7 0 \u00b0 C for 5 h (turquoise line). All spectra were recorded in Tris buffer, pH = 8 .0, at ambient a tmosphere. The experiment was also performed under hybridizing conditions at physiological temperature (37 \u00b0 C, 20 mM Tris -HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2, pH 8.0). 8T -trans - 8A was again readily photoisomerized without the occurrence of side reactio ns. However, after several hours at 37 \u00b0 C, only a slight decrease of the absorption band corresponding to the unstable cis isomer was observed (Figure 4.6). Potentially, helix inversion is hindered by the hybridized DNA strands. When the sample was heated to 70 \u00b0 C (above the Tm), THI occurred in a similar manner in aqueous buffer as in water. For full spectra and MALDI -TOF analysis of the irradiated sample, see Figure 4.8. Melting temperature analysis revealed a Tm of 59 \u00b0 C, indicating efficient conversion to the stable cis isomer. Combining the results of the UV -vis and melting temperature experiments, Figure 4.7 gives a schematic overview of the operation of 8T-motor -8A. Stable 8T -trans -8A (left) forms a hairpin structure with a Tm of 65 \u00b0 C. Upon irradiati on with 312 nm light, photoisomerization to unstable 8T -cis-8A (middle) occurs with high conversion. Upon heating, THI can be induced and stable 8T-cis-8A (right) is formed. The Tm of this isomer is 59 \u00b0 C, indicating a destabilization of the hairpin struct ure. Chapter 4 76 Figure. 4.7. Schematic overview of the functioning of 8T -motor -8A. Trans -cis isomerization leads to a destabilization of the helix, as is apparent from the decrease in Tm. For clarity, the destabilization is represented by partial helix unwinding in this figure. 4.3 Conclusion Aided by computational studies, we have designed a first generation molecular motor -based linker that can function as a photoswitchable bridgehead for an 8 base pair DNA hairpin. Both cis and trans isomers of a bifunctional lin ker were prepared and, they were incorporated into a 16 -mer strand of self -complimentary DNA via solid phase synthesis. Hairpin formation was confirmed, and the DNA -motor hybrid was shown to be able to undergo both photoisomerization and thermal helix inve rsion processes. The Tm of 8T -trans -8A was determined to be 65 \u00b0 C, and the Tm of 8T -cis-8A was 59 \u00b0 C. An unexpected observation was the destabilization due to trans -cis isomerization, since DFT calculations suggested the opposite. The results and structura l insights of this study are very important for the design of even more potent molecular motor -backbone linkers. The measured Tm of 6 \u00b0 C (for an 8 bp hairpin) represents a very promising value which ranks this investigation among the most successful attem pts to influence DNA hybridization through the incorporation of a photoswitchable backbone linker. Moreover, the isomerization process was highly efficient, and the bistable switching mode provides a real advance over azobenzenes, for which the thermal cis-trans reisomerisation limits possible applications. This study marks the first time that a molecular motor has been used to control the secondary structure of DNA, and in fact one of the first examples of a molecular motor being applied under physiologica l conditions, demonstrating the ability to regulate a key biological process such as DNA hybridization. Phot oswitching of DNA Hybridization using a Molecular Motor 77 Finally, it must be noted that molecular motors do not just rival conventional photoswitches in efficiency and power. They also offer a much higher degr ee of control and precision due to their four state switching cycle and helicity inversion. This investigation has only begun to uncover the vast range of new possibilities that may be accessed in photoregulated biohybrid systems. It is apparent that the m otor unit by itself is powerful enough to significantly influence hybridization behavior of short oligonucleotide hairpins. Moreover, our results showcase the potential of rotary molecular motors and consolidate their position among the most effective phot oswitches for use in biological surroundings. 4.4 Experimental Section 4.4.1 Materials Chemical were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Acros or TCI Europe N.V.; solvent s were reagent grade and distilled and dried before use according to standard procedures, if required. Melting points are taken on a B\u00fcchi B -545 melting point apparatus. UV -vis absorption spectra were measured on a Jasco V -630 spectrometer. Irradiation was performed using a Spectroline ENB -280C/FE (312 nm). All solvents and reagents for olig onucleotide synthesis were purchased from Novabiochem (Merck, UK) and SAFC (Sigma -Aldrich, Netherlands). Solid supports (Primer SupportTM, 33 mol/g) from Glen Research were used for the synthesis of motor -DNA. The motor -DNA were characterized by MALDI -TOF mass spectrometry using a 3 -hydroxypicolinic acid matrix. Spectra were recorded on an ABI Voyager DE-PRO MALDI TOF (delayed extraction r eflector) Biospectrometry unmodified oligonucleotides were purchased from Biomers.net in HPLC purification grade. 4.4.2 Synthesis and characterization of the motor -DNA sequences The motor was firstly converted into the co rresponding phosphoramidite building block as depicted in Figure 4.2A. T he obtained motor phosphoramidite was dissolved in CH 3CN to a final concentration of 0. 025 5 M, in the presence of 3 \u00c5 molecular sieves, and the prepared solution was directly connected to a DNA synthesizer (\u00c4KTA oligopilot plus, GE Healthcare (Uppsala, Sweden)). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a n 8 mol scale using standard - cyanoethylphosphoramidite coupling chemistry. Deprotection and cleavage from the PS support were carried ou t by incubation in concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution for 5 h at 55 \u00b0 C. Following deprotection, the oligonucleotides Chapter 4 78 were purified by reverse -phase chromatography (RPC) , using a C15 RESOURCE RPCTM 3 mL reverse phase column (GE Healthcare) thr ough a custom gradient elution 65% -exchange chromatography (AIEX ), using a ResourceTM Q 1 mL column (GE Healthcare) through a custom membranes (MWCO 3000, Sartorius Stedim). Oligonucleotide concentrations were deter mined by UV absorbance using extinction coefficients. Finally, the identity and purity of the oligonucleotide hybrids were confirmed by MALDI -TOF mass spectrometry. 8T -8A irradiation with 312 nm and subs equent THI. ( A) Trans, water, 67 \u00b0 C.

Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed using a 20% gel (Invitrogen life technologies), and run at 100 V for 100 min in TBE buffer (90 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with SYBR Gold (Life Technologies Europe BV) and photographs of the gels were taken with a LAS -3000 Image Reader (Fuji Photo Film S3 (Europe) GmbH, Dusseldorf, Germany). The thermal helix inversion (unstable cis to stable cis) of the DNA -motor hybrid was followed over time using UV -vis spectroscopy. Figure 4.9 depicts the absorbance of the sample at 330 nm and 390 nm, mea sured at regular intervals. Exponential decay curves were fitted and the mean lifetime was calculated to be 4572 s (based on 330 nm) and 4336 s (based on 390 nm). On average this measurement leads to a half -life of the unstable cis isomer of 51 min. Phot oswitching of DNA Hybridization using a Molecular Motor 79 Figur e. 4.9.

Chapter 5 Highly Stiff and Stretchable DNA Liquid Crystalline Organogels with Fast Self - Healing and Magnetic Respons e Behaviors Chapter 5 84 5.1 Introduction Macromolecular soft materials, such as liquid crystals (LCs),1-3 hydrogels,4-10 and organogels,11-14 garner significant interest due to their fascinating functional properties and their various technological applications.15-18 Among them, DNA - based LCs19-24 and gels25-30 particularly stand out as they combine molecular recognition capabilities with prog rammability and can be employed in stimuli - responsive materials31-34 as well as biomedical applications.35-37 While these attributes hint towards the potential of DNA in soft matter materials, their relatively poor mechanical properties remain a significan t challenge38-40 that impedes their practical application in fields requiring mechanical integrity and tunability. Additionally, most investigations of DNA -based gel systems are currently limited to amorphous materials.25-33, 36 -40 This renders it difficul t to harness favorable anisotropic electrical, optical, magnetic, or mechanical properties and dynamic functions due to the absence of cooperative effects of ordered internal structures within the network of gelators.6,12,41 In this context, the realizatio n of mechanically strong DNA gel materials with LC structures is highly relevant to a variety of scientific and technological pursuits. For instance, a relatively high stiffness, toughness, and stretchability would enable the formation of free -standing DNA structures, thus permitting their use in chemo -mechanical systems and soft DNA actuators. Moreover and from a perspective of tissue engineering, DNA LC gels with dynamic character and adaptive mechanical performance could act as artificial 3D extracellula r matrices (ECM) for cell proliferation and differentiation.18 Alongside, the internal structural ordering of a DNA LC gel matrix may promote cell growth and motility in a predetermined direction thereby opening the pathway towards the formation of hierarc hical architectures similar as found in tissues and organs.6,42 Eventually, stimuli -responsive DNA gel materials with highly stretchable, thermoplastic, and self -healing properties show great potential for the future fabrication of artificial skin and musc les,43,44 rendering research in this field highly attractive. Here we report mechanically strong DNA -based LC organogels with spatially anisotropic features that are formed by the electrostatic complexation of DNA with cationic surfactants. Inspired by oth er works relying on supramolecular self - assembly,45,46 we obtained nematic DNA -surfactant organogels in combination with a series of polar and no n-polar solvents. Remarkably, although our DNA organogels are non -covalently crosslinked and contain more than 90 wt% organic solvent s, they can be strained more than 3\u00b7 104%, highlighting their exceptional stretchability. Moreover, they display outstanding stiffness with elastic moduli of more than 20 Highly Stiff and Stretchable DNA Liquid C rystalline Organogels with Fast Self-Healing and Magnetic Response Behaviors 85 MPa and toughness up to 18 MJ/m3 rendering them the current reco rd holder among DNA gel s.25-40 Concomitantly, the nature of the supramolecular bond endows the DNA -surfactant organogels with thermoplastic properties and recoverable deformability. This also provides complete self -healing capabilities within 5 s. In turn, blending Fe 3O4 nanoparticles into the DNA gel matrix allows to slightly alter the structural ordering of the organogels magnetically expanding the scope of possible applications to a wide range of possible composite materials. 5.2 Result and Discussion Figure . 5.1.

Scale bar is 100 m. (D ) SAXS profile of the organogel. The formed nematic mesophase shows an average distance of 4.3 nm. The broad diffraction peak at q 4 nm-1 (labeled with *) is due to the kapton used for sealing the DNA -surfactant complex sample. Inset is the corresponding SAXS 2D pattern. The DNA -surfactant complexes were prepared by electrostatic complexation of double -stranded (ds) DNA (14 bp, 22 bp, 2000 bp, and 2686 bp) and cationic surfactants containing procedure , simple mixing of an aqueous solution of 2000 bp dsDNA with cationic surfactant of DDAB results in precipitation of the 2000DNA -DDAB complex (Figure 5.1A), which is then obtained in pure form after centrifugation , removal of the supernatant and lyophilization . In order to determine the composition of DNA - Chapter 5 86 surfactant complexes quantitatively, 22mer single stranded (ss) DNA -DDAB complex was characterized by NMR as a representative example (Figure 5.7). This analysis revealed the stoichiometry of the 22mer ssDNA and the DDAB 1:22 ( i.e. ca. one per phosphate the oligonucleotide). Subse quently , the resulting DNA -surfactant complex is immersed in toluene , which results in significant swelling (Figure 5.1B). The free -standing organogel displayed a DNA content of less than 2 wt% confirming that the organic solvent is the dominant component of the bulk material. Polarized optical microscopy (POM) revealed obvious birefringence when analyzing the 2000DNA - DDAB organogel (Figure 5.1C) clearly indicating the ordered alignment of the gelators. Further analysis by small angle X -ray scattering (SAXS ) revealed profiles with a broad diffraction peak at q = 1.47 nm1 (Figure 5.1D) suggesting an ordered nematic LC mesophase of the 2000 DNA -DDAB organogel with a n internal structural periodicity of 4.3 nm (d = 2/ q). Considering the dimensions of both 2000 bp dsDNA and DDAB, the organogel mesogen cross section is most likely composed of dsDNA units of 2 .0 nm thickness separated by regions containing disordered DDAB surfactant molecules of 2.3 nm thickness , such depicted in Figure 5.1A. DNA organogels with nematic LC states were fabricated within a wide series of polar (THF, DMSO, alcohols ) and non 5.8-5.11 ). Importantly , the DNA LC organogels could even be formed in biocompatible solvents in cluding ethylene glycol and glycerol (Figure 5.11 ), prospectively opening the path towards biomedical applications and their co - processing with living cells. It should be noted that when oligonucleotides (14mer and 22mer were only formed in toluene and DMSO.

(J -L) DNA organogel in toluene was placed between two glass slides and when a small force (1.7 MPa) was exerted on the top of the glass, th e molded gel was compressed in z-direction without noticeable damage . After releasing the force and a short time immersion in toluene the original shape recovered. Subsequently, we investigated the macroscopic deformation behavior of the organogels reveali ng their exceptionally high fracture strains. For example, the 2000DNA -DDAB complex swollen in DMSO can be elongated more than 110 times the initial size (Figure 5.12A ) and fracture still was not observable but the measuring range of our tensile tester was exceeded. When the 2000DNA -DDAB organogel was manually, the extensibility was beyond 3\u00b7 104% (Figure 5.2A-D). Th is recorded elongation is much higher than that of previously known crosslinked DNA gel systems25-40 as well as other reported polymer gels and elastomers.11,44,47,48 Moreover, it w as found that the largely stretched sample can partially self -recover (Figure 5.12B ). Chapter 5 88 The DNA LC organogels are also plastically deformable allowing the stretched samples to be shaped into multiple patterns , such as triangle s, square s, and smiley faces (Figure 5.2E-G). Additionally, the thermoreversible sol-gel transition of the 2000DNA -DDAB complex in DMSO at around 90 \u00b0 C permits recycling of the samples in a simple way highlighting the organogels' thermoplast ic behavior. After heating above 90 \u00b0 C, the 2000DNA -DDAB -DMSO organogel was completely melted rendering it injectable. Cooling to room temperature again reestablished the gel -like character providing access to a wide range of shapes (Figure 5.2H-I). Beside s uniaxial extension, compression of the organogels in toluene is also possible without noticeable permanent deformation and the macroscopic shape of the material can be fully recovered (Figure 5.2J-L). Notably, SA XS analysis of the compressed DNA organoge l indicated a preferential alignment of the DNA -surfactant complex after compression (Figure S 10) suggesting that reversible supramolecular gelation of the DNA -surfactant complexes plays an important role for their deformation and plasticity characteristic s on a longer time scale . Figure . 5.3. Investigation of the mechanical properties of DNA -surfactant LC organogels.

(E, F) Young's moduli and toughness of the corresponding DNA -surfactant organogels in DMSO, THF, and CHCl 3. In order to analyze the intriguing mechanical properties of the DNA organogels in more detail, we subjected them to dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) employing a Highly Stiff and Stretchable DNA Liquid C rystalline Organogels with Fast Self-Healing and Magnetic Response Behaviors 89 shear rheometer .49 We determined storage moduli (G') representing the elastic portion and loss moduli (G'') as a measure for the viscous portion at an applied strain of 10% (in the elastic region). Expectedly, all DNA -surfactant organogels associated with different organic solvents bear viscoelastic properties as evidenced by the larger storage moduli (G'') when compared to the loss moduli (G') over the measured frequency range (0.1 -20 Hz) (Figure 5.3A and Figure 5.14 ). Moreover, it becomes obvious that the elasticity of the DNA -surfactant organogels correlates to the lengths of the employed dsDNA strands. Figure 3B unequivocally reveals that the shear moduli increase from the kPa to the MPa range while increasing the strand length from 14 bp over 22 and 2000 bp to 2686 bp. Alongside, the backbone rigidity (transition from ssD NA to helical dsDNA) also considerably enhances the toughness of the LC organogels (Figure 5.3B). To cover the mechanical properties beyond the yield point in the plastic region, further mechanical analysis was performed by uniaxial tensile testing (Figur e 5.3C and 5.3D). For this purpose, the organogels were molded into fiber shape (e.g. d 3 mm, l 2 cm for 2000DNA -DDAB) and extended at a loading rate of 10 mmmin-1. The obtained tensile strengths were in the range of 1 -3 MPa and from linear regression in the elastic regime the corresponding Young's moduli were calculated to be above 20 MPa (Figure 5.3E). We also investigated the toughness of the DNA LC gels by integration of the stress -strain curves, in which the values can be up to 18 MJ/m3 (Figure 5.3F). Stiffness, toughness, fracture and y ield strengths of our DNA LC organogels are significantly improved compared to other reported DNA soft material systems .25-40 The stiffness is even higher or at least comparable to that of relevant physically and chemically crosslinked polymer gels.11,44,4 7,48 Evenly important, the toughness of the samples suggest that the LC gels have the same high level of fracture energy as spider silk materials.50,51 Control experiments involving the same DNA complexed with another surfactant , i.e. dioctyldimethylammoni um bromide (DOAB) showed the formation of an amorphous organogel, which is not free -standing (Figure 5.15 ). This resulted in a gel with mechanical properties too weak to perform a tensile test. This result strongly suggests that in our supramolecular DNA -surfactant LC organogels, the long macromolecular backbone combined with the multiple intermolecular interactions and the internal structural ordering plays a key role for their outstanding mechanical performance. Chapter 5 90 Figure . 5.4. Fast self -healing behavior of the organogels. (A) The 2000dsDNA -DDAB -DMSO organogel was cut into two parts. (B) The surfaces of the two parts were held together without any additional energy input. (C) The healed organogel was obtained after 5 seconds. (D) The hea led sample can be stretched without any fracture. The two parts of DNA organogel were stained with ethidium bromide (EtBr, purple red) and SYBR Green I (orange) respectively, for visualization purpose. (E) Stress -strain curve of the healed ds2000 - DDAB orga nogel in DMSO. (F) Stiffness and toughness of the healed sample. Subsequently, the self -healing behavior of the DNA -surfactant LC organogels was investigated. For this purpose, the 2000dsDNA -DDAB -DMSO organogel was cut into two parts. As soon as the surfac es of the two parts were joined for 5 seconds without any external energy input, a robust and healed organogel was obtained, which can be stretched extensively without any apparent fracture (Figure 5.4A-D and Figure 5.16 ). Moreover, the stiffness and toug hness of the healed samples were comparable to that of the original DNA organogels (Figure 5.4E and 5.4F). Since a control experiment employing non -complementary DNA -DDAB organogels also showed such ), -specific supramolecular -bond formation, electrostatic, hydrophobic, and van der Waals interactions, are most likely the cause of this phenomenon as opposed to Watson - Crick base pairing. In comparison, other reported polymer gel systems only show Highly Stiff and Stretchable DNA Liquid C rystalline Organogels with Fast Self-Healing and Magnetic Response Behaviors 91 healing b ehaviors at least after 30 s or a few hours .44,47,48 Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, the present DNA -surfactant organogels can be regarded as one of the fastest self -healing gel system reported so far.

(B) The corresponding SAXS profile of the organogel. The formed nematic mesophase shows an average distance of 3.3 nm. The broad diffraction ring at q 4 nm-1 (labeled with *) is due to the kapton which was used for sealing the DNA -surfactant complex sample. (C) Artistic representation of the molecular packing model of the nematic mesophase of the DNA -surfactant -Fe3O4 organogels (Fe 3O4 in black, surfactant head groups in red, the hydrophobic part of the surfactant in gray and double -stranded DNA in blu e). (D -F) Photographs showing the magnetic res ponse of the 2000DNA -DDAB - Fe3O4-DMSO organogel. The downward -bent material fiber was fixated between two glass sticks. After application of a magnetic field, the organogel fiber jumped upwards. To exemplarily show that our DNA organogels are suitable for the preparation of a wide range of functional composite materials, we endowed one of our gels with magneto -responsive properties for the purpose of external field induced actuation. Therefore, we synthesized oleic acid stabilized Fe 3O4 nanoparticl es (NPs) with a diameter of ca. 10 nm (Figure 5.18A, B ) and then introduced these into the DNA - surfactant organogels. POM analysis of the organogels formed with DMSO, THF, and CHCl 3 indicate that the birefringence and thus the LC properties are preserved (Figure 5.5A and Figure 5.18C, D ). Alongside, the corresponding SAXS profile of 2000DNA -DDAB -Fe3O4-DMSO showed one broad diffraction peak at q = 1.9 nm-1 Chapter 5 92 (Figure 5.5B). In combination these results suggest that the NPs are well dispersed within the DNA -surfactant co mplexes, no obvious aggregation occurs, and the nematic phase of the parent organogel is preserved (Figure 5.5C). The alkyl surfactant shell of the NPs allows additional van der Waals interactions between the NPs and the DNA -surfactant complex , which might be responsible for the formation of well -defined DNA -surfactant -Fe3O4 LC organogels. The corresponding average distance of 3.3 nm-1 of the mesophase was found to be almost the same as the pristine DNA -surfactant organogel (Figure 5.8A). Subsequently, the NP-containing organogel was molded into a fiber to investigate its response to magnetic fields. The downward -bent fiber was fixated between two glass sticks (Figure 5.5D) and after application of a magnetic field (N50, NdFeB), the organogel fiber jumped up wards instantaneously (Figure 5E -F). Other modes of movement can also be realized non - invasively (Figure 5.18E, F ) rendering the robust DNA organogels in combination with their response to magnetism interesting for the development of DNA -based soft actuato rs. 5.3 Conclusion In summary, we have successfully developed a new class of DNA LC organogels with nematic ordering based on the electrostatic complexation of DNA with surfactants containing flexible alkyl chains. The obtained materials form supramolecu lar LC organogels when swollen in organic solvents and exhibit remarkable and for this class of DNA materials previously unknown extensibility, deformability, stiffness, toughness, and plasticity. The DNA -surfactant soft material can be stretched to more than 300 times its original length without breaking. Moreover, the supramolecular nature of the network allows rapid self -healing within 5 seconds recovering its mechanical properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of gels that can be healed in such a short timeframe. Concomitantly, due to the formation of LC structure, the DNA gels exhibit exceptional mechanical properties with ultimate tensile strengths in the MPa range, elastic moduli of more than 20 MPa, and toughness of up to 1 8 MJ/m3 - values comparable with the magnitude of covalently crosslinked polymer gels. Additionally, magnetic NPs can be blended into these tough DNA -LC organogels without compromising the formation of the nematic mesophase. This endows the organogels with the ability to shape -respond to external magnetic fields and exemplarily demonstrates the facile preparation of DNA organogel composites. In this work, it was discovered that the excellent mechanical properties originate from the liquid crystalline orderi ng of the DNA surfactant complexes within the organic solvent, however, further studies are needed to understand how the molecular interactions determine the bulk features Highly Stiff and Stretchable DNA Liquid C rystalline Organogels with Fast Self-Healing and Magnetic Response Behaviors 93 of the DNA organogel systems. Undoubtedly, their internal structural ordering, phase behavior, self -healing and stimuli -responsiveness will be the starting point for the construction of novel and functional DNA networks. They will depart from pristine DNA scaffolds in water broadening the scope of DNA nanostructures to achieve operationa l molecular materials even in organic environments. 5.4 Experimental S ection 5.4.1 Materials The surfactants used for the DNA including didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) and didecyldimethylammonium Cetyltrimethylammonium (CTAB) was purchased from Pro Analysi (Bergen, Norway). UltraPure Salmon Sperm DNA (2000bp) and Fisher Scientific (Waltham, United States). Ethidium bromide was purchased from Bio -Red (California, United States). Anhydrous CHCl 3 and DMSO were purchased from Acros ethanol, glycerol, and glycol were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich (St. Louis, United States) and used without further purification. Ultrapure water with a resistivity of ca. 18.2 M\u00b7cm was used for all experimen ts. Chapter 5 94 5.4.2 DNA synthesis Figure. 5.6. Characterization of the synthesized DNA by matrix -assisted laser desorption/ionization time -of-flight mass spectrometry (D) c22mer and agarose of 1\u00b5 g GAG G -3' Mw=6857g/mol) were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer using standard -cyanoethylphosphoramidite coupling c hemistry.52 Deprotection and cleavage from the polystyrene support we re carried out by incubation in concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution overnight at 60 \u00b0 C. After deprotection, the oligonucleotides were purified by anion exchange chromatography, using a Hitrap Q HP 5 mL column (GE Healthcare) through custom gra dient elution. Fractions were desalted using centrifugal dialysis membranes (MWCO Sartorius Stedim). Oligonucleotide concentrations were determined by UV absorbance using extinction coefficients. Finally, the identity and purity of the oligonucleotid es were confirmed by MALDI -TOF mass spectrometry. Regarding 2686bp DNA synthesis, Escherichia coli strain DH5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was transformed with the circular vector pUC19 being comprised of 2686 bp (New England Biolabs) as described by Sambr ook et al.53 The vector was isolated from a 2 L bacterial culture in Lennox Broth medium (Sigma -Aldrich) using the GenElute HP Plasmid DNA Maxiprep Kit (Sigma -Aldrich). The identity and purity of pUC19 was confirmed by 1% TAE agarose gel by using 1\u00b5 g pUC19 digested with Highly Stiff and Stretchable DNA Liquid C rystalline Organogels with Fast Self-Healing and Magnetic Response Behaviors 95 NdeI endonuclease enzyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer's protocol. The sample was run at 120 V for 40 min and subsequent staining of the bands was performed using EtBr for 15 min. After characterization, the circular D NA was used for organogel fabrication. 5.4.3 Preparation of DNA -surfactan t organogel s An aqueous solution of DNA with a concentration of ~10 mg/mL (14 bp, 22 bp, 2000 bp, and 2686 bp) was obtained by dissolving DNA in MQ water. In a second solution of ultrapure water, the concentration of cationic surfactant (DDAB, DEAB, and CTAB) was adjusted to ~50 mM at room temperature. Both solutions were combined in a ratio so that ~5 mol of surfactant equal 1 mol of phosphate residues within the DNA. As a result of m ixing, the insoluble DNA -surfactant complexes precipitated from the aqueous phase. After centrifugation, the water and unreacted surfactants were removed, and then the complexes were lyophilized overnight. Finally, the water -free DNA -surfactant complexes w ere immersed in 100 L organic solvents for 0.5 h, leading to the formation of DNA -surfactant organogels. 5.4.4 Synthesis of Fe 3O4 nanoparticles The iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized according to a reported work .54 2.7g of FeCl 3\u00b7 6H 2O and 9.1g of so dium oleate were dissolved in a solvent mixture which was composed of 20 mL ethanol, 15 mL distilled water, and 35 mL hexane. Then the solution was heated to 70 \u00b0 C and kept at this temperature for four hours. After this step, the organic layer containing t he iron -oleate complex was washed with distilled water and dried. This procedure resulted in the formation of iron -oleate complex in a waxy solid form. Then 9 g of the obtained iron -oleate complex and 1.4g of oleic acid were dissolved in 50 g of 1 -octadece ne at room temperature. This solution was heated to 320\u00b0 C with a heating rate of 3.3\u00b0 C min-1 and kept at this temperature for 30 min. After that, the reaction solution containing the nanoparticles was cooled to room temperature and ethanol was used to prec ipitate the inorganic nanoobjects. After centrifugation, the nanoparticles were collected and dissolved in CHCl 3 (10 mg/mL) for further use. 5.4.5 Preparation of DNA -surfactant -Fe3O4 organogels The as -prepared CHCl 3 solution of Fe 3O4 nanoparticles (250 L, 10 mg/mL) was firstly dried by air flow. Then 500 L aqueous DNA solution (10 mg/mL) was used Chapter 5 96 to disperse the Fe 3O4 nanoparticles. In a next step, 1.75 mL DDAB aqueous solution (50 mM) was added to the above DNA -Fe3O4 mixture result ing in black precipitate. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the precipita te was washed 3 times with ultrapure water, and then the DNA -surfactant -Fe3O4 complex was lyophilized overnight. Finally, the DNA -surfactant -Fe3O4 organogel was ob tained after incubating the complex (15 mg) in 100 L organic solvent for 0.5 h. 5.4.6 Characterization Figure. 5.7. 1H-NMR Analysis of the stoichiometry of the 22mer analyzied by 1H-NMR (400 MHz) in CDCl 3. The signals of terminal methyl (marked by m) and aliphatic groups (marked by c~l) in DDAB and methyl group of thymine in DNA (marked by n) were utilized to estimate the molecular ratio of 22mer ssDNA and DDAB surfactant. The ter minal methyl groups in DDAB surfactant were used as an internal standard. The binding stoichiometry can be roughly calculated as the integration of protons difference (at chemical shift between 1.2 -2.0) between the DDAB and ssDNA -DDAB complex. Assuming tha t one DNA molecule could combine with n DDAB molecules (DNA : nDDAB), then after complexation, the total number of Highly Stiff and Stretchable DNA Liquid C rystalline Organogels with Fast Self-Healing and Magnetic Response Behaviors 97 protons at chemical shift between 1.2 -2.0 can be expressed as: (DNA(T11)) 3 + (DDAB( -CH 2-)20) \u00d7 n. According the integration proton s of DDAB surfactant and ssDNA -DDAB in their 1H-NMR as have: 3 3.92+36) \u00d7 n \u00d7 n=21.9 the stoichiometric ratio of DDAB and 22mer ssDNA is roughly 22:1.

Summary Summary 108 Aside from the role as a carrier for genetic information, DNA ha s also gained tremendous interest in material science owing to its versatile properties, such as outstanding specificity and programmability. On one hand, great efforts have been devoted to exploiting pristine DNA, utilizing its appealing intrinsic features: stiffness (50 nm in persistence length), short structural repeat s (~3.6 nm in helical pitch) and nano -scaled size (2 nm in diameter). Thus, a large plethora of 1D -, 2D - and 3D DNA nanostructures with various size s, geometries and shapes is readily accessible and the subsequent applications are developing further and further . On the other hand, a number of methodologies have been employed to modify DNA, chemically and physically, which generates some properties and structures that pristine DNA does not bear. Among these, hydrophobic modification of DNA is appealing because it can impart special characteristics on DNA, which are not achieved with another material combination. In Chapter 2 , a lipid -modified DNA system (lipid -DNA) was established for the catalytic oxidization of dopamine to aminochrome. 1-Dodecyne was introduced to an uracil base which was subsequently incorporated into two DNA aptamers, yielding a lipidated dopamine -binding aptamer (lipoDBA) dated -quadruplex (lipoGQ), respectively. Mixing of lipoDBA and lipoGQ generated DNA micelles. The association of substrate and catalyst with lipidated aptamers, respectively, led to the concentration of the substrate at a close spatial posi tion to the catalytic sites, resulting in an accelerated oxidation process. We found that the DNA micelles showed best enhancement when the molar ratio between lipoGQ and lipoDBA was 4 : 6. Besides, di -lipidated G -quadruplexes (2lipoGQ) showed -lipidated G -quadruplexes (4lipoGQ), which can be attributed to the retarded flexibilities of both lipidated aptamers in the 4lipoGQ containing system. Additionally, the catalyzed H 2O2- mediated oxidation of dopamine to aminochrom e was also observed if the lipoGQ catalytic units were substituted with an mimicking lipidated dinuclear Cu(II) expand the application of lipid -DNA, in Chapter 3 we exploited the possibility of using lipid -DNA as a tool for ophthalmic drug delivery. Three aptamer sequences were selected for the specific binding of three ocular drugs: kanamycin B, brimonidine and travoprost . All three -deoxyu self -assembled into micelles, as demonstrated by DLS measurements. ITC results revealed that the binding ability of the aptamer part of all lipid -DNA was not compromised compared to pri stine aptamer. It was demonstrated that the lipid modification resulted in the corneal adherence of the Summary 109 aptameric NPs both in vitro and in vivo while it did not contribute to toxicity of the amphiphiles. The drug release was proven in vitro , showing a simi lar effect as free drugs. Moreover, the efficiency of the drug carrier was proven in vitro . Better bacterial killing was found on porcine cornea for the nucleic acid carrier system compared to the free drug. It can be envisioned that t he NPs offer an addit ional drug loading modality as the lipid core of the micelle can accommodate water insoluble medication , which can further enhance their performance in drug delivery by introducing an additional load for co -therapy . In Chapter 4 , the hybridization property of a DNA hairpin was evaluated photochemically after a molecular motor was incorporated into the middle of the backbone. Both cis and trans isomers were prepared and subsequently incorporated into a 16 -mer strand of self -complimentary DNA via solid phase synthesis. The hairpin structure of both isomers modified DNA was confirmed by PAGE gel electrophoresis. The melting temperature analysis revealed that t he Tm of 8T -trans - 8A was 65 \u00b0 C while the that of 8T -cis-8A was 59 \u00b0 C , of which t he measured Tm of 6 \u00b0 C (for an 8 bp hairpin) represents a very promising value . It ranks this investigation among the most successful attempts to influence DNA hybridization through the incorporation of a photoswitchable backbone linker. Besides, it was found that the isomeriza tion process of the motor was not hindered in non - hybridization conditions without degradation, however, it was slightly slowed down by the biomolecule. When the motor -DNA was hybridized prior to UV irradiation, motor -DNA was again readily photoisomerized without the occurrence of side reactions but thermal helix inversion (THI) wa s hindered by the hybridized DNA strands. When the sample was heated above the Tm, THI occurred in a similar manner in aqueous buffer as in water. This study marks the first time that a molecular motor has been used to control the secondary structure of DNA, and in fact one of the first examples of a molecular motor being applied under physiological conditions, demonstrating the ability to regulate a key biological process such as DNA hybridization. Aside from the chemically hydrophobic modification of DNA, the physical modification of DNA was also investigated. In Chapter 5 , the DNA -surfactant complex in a gel state was studied. We found that hydrophilic DNA precipitated from aqueo us phase after complexation with positively charged surfactants. When immersed in organic phases, DNA -surfactant complex turned into a gel state (organogels) with a nematic liquid crystalline mesophase, as demonstrated by POM and SAXS. The gel state was co nfirmed by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and it was found that the elasticity of the DNA -surfactant organogels positively Summary 110 correlate d to the lengths of the employed dsDNA strands. The obtained DNA organogels exhibit ed remarkable extensibility, deformabi lity, stiffness, toughness, and plasticity. For instance, the showed excellent elongation with an extensibility beyond 3\u00b7 104% before fracture and the largely stretched sample can partially self -recover. Moreover, mechanical analysis revealed a t ensile strength of 1-3MPa, Young's moduli of above 20MPa and a toughness of 18 MJ/m3, which are of the same magnitude to covalently crosslinked polymer gels. Additionally, the supramolecular nature of the network allow ed rapid self -healing within 5 seconds hereby recover ing its mechanical properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of gels that can be healed in such a short timeframe. Finally , magnetic NPs were incorporated into these tough DNA -LC organogels without compromising the formation of the nematic mesophase. This endows the organogels with the ability to shape -respond to external magnetic fields and exemplarily demonstrates the facile preparation of DNA organogel composites. The findings in the different chapters illustrate that the functionality of DNA systems can largely increase when combined with other moieties. Structure formation can be manipulated by the blending with hydrophobic moieties. In the one case, this leads to nanoparticles with adhering properties to special tissue. In another case, it influences the bulk order and mechanical properties of DNA organogels. Finally, merging of DNA with complex molecular motors leads to dynamic systems where the energy of light controls key biological functionalities as non -inva sive external power source.

On the other hand, I was rel ieved because my wife (girlfriend back then) was there and showed me the way, just like few lights shining out of the darkness, dim but comforting. Now, after five years, it is coming to an end. It was not an easy time but every single minute was worth it and I am really happy about it. What makes me happier is that we welcomed a new member to our little family during that time, my lovely daughter Ruby. She is one of the biggest support to me finishing my PhD study. Apart from that, there are many people I would like to thank for their support. Without the help from them, I could not finish my PhD. I would like to gratefully acknowledge those who have contributed to this thesis and supported me during my PhD study. To start with, I would like to give my deep est gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Andreas Herrmann . Thank you for offering me the opportunity to carry out PhD study in PCBE group! I still remember how excited I was when I received the offer from you. It was not easy to start in a new environment, es pecially what I was going to do was quite different from what I learnt as a master. But you always patiently and nicely explained everything to me and gave me instructions on my projects as well as my research career whenever I was confused. Your broad kno wledge, inspiring ideas and enthusiasm in scientific research also inspired me a lot. Those knowledge s gained from you help me to be a person with independent thought and an open mind in my future life. I wish you all the best with your work as well as your life in Aachen. I also would like to thank the members of the reading committee: Prof. W. H. Roos , Prof. J. G. Roelfes , and Prof. E. Weinhold for the time and the evaluation on my thesis. I want to express my special thanks to you for your valuable commen ts which helped me improve the manuscript. I would like to thank collaborators involved in my projects. Prof. Ben L. Feringa (Groningen University), Prof. I. Willner (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem), Prof. Acknowledgements 119 A. Kros (Leiden University), Dr. S. Schnichels (University Eye Hospital T\u00fcbingen), Dr. H. B. Albada (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem) and Dr. J. Hurst (University Eye Hospital T\u00fcbingen). I appreciated for the efforts you put on my projects. They helped a lot to improve my scientific work and finish my thesis. I want to specially thank Dr. Anouk S. Lubb e (Groningen University). It was struggling before we can finish the project. But you were always positive and looking at the bright side . Luckily, it was a happy ending and we have a nice paper now. I also want take this opportunity to thank China Scholarship Council (CSC). Th anks for the scholarship for my four years' PhD study, which gave me the opportunity to go abroad and study. Meanwhile, I would like to show my gratitude to my Alma mater, Sichuan University (SCU), which gave me full support when I applied for the CSC scho larship as well as when I was in Nehterlands. Special thanks dedicated to Prof. Zhihua Wu. I was deeply shocked when I heard that you were gone. Your decease is a great loss for Sichuan University as well as the scientific world. Your kindly words still he lp me in my life. May you rest in peace. Now, it is time to thank my lovely PCBE colleagues. Many thanks to Karin and Ursula for the help at the start and during my PhD with all the paper work, even after I left. Thanks a lot. Special thanks to Evgeny for your invaluable technical support on my project. I sincerely want to express my gratitude to Lifei and Kai. Kai, you were like second - promoter to me. It was you who helped me start in the lab, learning DNA synthesis and purification, doing tests and direc ting my projects. In work, you are always filled with passion and energy and work until midnight. It also affected me a bit and my wife complained quite a few times because I stayed late in the lab. But hard work pays. With your help, I got familiar with e verything in the lab fast and ended with a few papers. Thank you very much and wish you all the best in US with your family, Juanjuan , Yige and Yihe . Lifei , I still remember your lazy eyes the next day morning I arrived at Groningen. You were in your short pants and slippers, with a striped shirt which I bet you still wear. But under this floppy appearance is a smart mind Acknowledgements 120 and a kind heart. You have a broad knowledge and always glad to help others. Discussion with you is always inspiring and you can always g et to the point and give suggestions. Like a saying \"a chemist is always a good cook\", you are a very good one at both of them. I wish you all the best with your scientific career and your happy family, Qinhong and Lulu . Special thanks to two of my dear D utch friends, Jan Willem and Mark . Jan Willem, from the first time we met you gave me an impression of a tough guy. Later it turned out that you really are because you always came to the lab with parts of your skins off your hands. But you are nice to ever ybody around you and always with a big smile. You are good at all the equipment in the lab and patient to explain it to others. I will always remember the time we tried to fix Olga and when we were listening to Eminem at max volume. Thanks, man! Mark, our ordering man. With great power comes great responsibility. That is why you are always annoyed by us. You are always busy around the lab, sorting things out and tidying the shelf. As a young man, you have rather mature mind and look. You can get everything organized and done slowly but nicely like an old man. I really thank you for everything you did for us out of the lab. But you need to pace up to find your ideal lady now. I will always keep my finger crossed for you. Jingyi and Shuo , thank you very much for the warm help in the last years. Having you two in our life is a big comfort. You are patient and encouraging and always showed us the bright side of any events. I can not remember how many times you invited Zhuojun and me to your place for hotpots and other dishes, which was a big relief after one -day experiments. Whenever we needed help, you will show up and do your best to help us out of it or at least try to comfort us. I wish you and your lovely son Tuantuan all the best in the future. Jing and Jiaying , you two are warm -hearted and nice to everybody around you. We used to have lots of good time out of the lab, travelling to Lisbon, going to Keukenhof to watch tulip show and picking up chestnuts at Nijmegn. It was fun. There were so many times when w e were playing mahjong. I am looking forward to the next time we play it together again. Many thanks for what you have done for us after we have Acknowledgements 121 left Groningen. It is a bless to have you in our life. Wish you and your lovely son, Milan , success in everythi ng. Lei, you are an easy -going lady and nice to everyone in and out of the lab. I was also quite amazed by how good you are at cooking, like dumplings and steamed and stuffed bum. Hope everything goes well with you, Zhongtao and Yutong . Agnieszka , thank y ou for everything you have done for me and Zhuojun. We had a great time at your wedding in Poland. Wish you all the best with the tall annoying Dutch guy. Alina and Alessio , thank you for helping us with some experiments. Aside from that, you also gave us lots of tips living in Netherlands. Thank you very much for helping me polish my CV when I was struggling searching for a job. Tao and Wenjun , we had quite a few pleasant nights playing mahjong. Hope we can do it again in the future. Jun and Pei, thank you for your help in the lab as well as many delicious dishes. Wish you all the best in University of Zhongshan. Tiancai and Yang , two years were short but we had a great time together. Thank you for that. We still have not hit a bar together. Looking forward to do that in the future. Diego , thanks very much for being there for me in the last years. Life would have been totally different without you guys. It is indeed a very wonderful experience to work together with all of you. Thank you! Qiuyan and Jin, thank you very much for the help in and out of the lab. Guowei , thank you very much for the help you offered in my life. You are warm -hearted b ut a bit shy. Luckily you found your girl now. I wish you all the best in the future. Meanwhile, I would like to thank Chinese Basketball Team in Groningen and Pugilic\u00e9 Groningen . We were at a bad location but with great people. Every year we went to the cities in the south for some games but we already got exhausted after the early morning wake -up and long trip. We got kicked out in the first round but we enjoyed it and kept doing it. Thank you, Li, Shitou , Yifeng , Adu ...It was a totally new experience for me to join the boxing club Pugilic\u00e9 . Though my hands can not stop shaking every time after the training, I liked it. What does not kill you makes Acknowledgements 122 you stronger. And it was fun to know a lot of new guys there, Michael , Byj\u00f6rn , Ramon , Gina , Kelly ...I also had v ery impressive experiences in the Batavierenrace. Thank you for everything. Hope everything goes well with you in the future. My little girl, Ruby , you are like a little angle landing in our little family, which makes our life sweet and unforgettable. You bring laughter to our life with your cuteness and destroy our sweet dreams with your screaming in the midnight. Life is completely different upon your arrival. But you are making me a good father and a better man. For that, I want to thank you. Dad is trying to make a better life for you. My dear wife, Zhuojun , I am so lucky to have you in my life. When I was frustrated from my experiments, you were there. When I was confused about our future, you were there. You are like a lighthouse, showing me the right direction whenever I felt lost and self -doubted. You are understanding, tolerant and encouraging and know to tell me to be down -to-earth whenever I was beside myself. Without your help and encouragement, I could not have finished my PhD study and my thesis. Life is a long journey and I can not wait to go through the next part with you. Publications 1. A. S.
