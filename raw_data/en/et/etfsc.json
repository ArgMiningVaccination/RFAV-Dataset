James David Ford, D.D., offered the following prayer: O God, just as we concern ourselves with the actions that we take, so help us make clear our motives and our purposes \u00b7 in life. Cleanse the thoughts of \u00b7 our hearts\u00b7 by the inspiration of Your spirit, purify our desires, so that what flows from our hearts and minds may be good in Your sight and helpful to all people. Amen. THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has ex\u00ad amined the Journal of the last day's proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. EXPRESSION OF OPPOSITION TO FURTHER FUNDING OF CON\u00ad TRAS (Mr. AuCOIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Speaker, Ronald Reagan is wrong when he says Amer\u00ad ica should fund the Contras because they are fighting for democracy. For one thing, what the Contras have been doing can hardly be called fighting. Reporters from the Philadelphia In\u00ad quirer who investigated the Contras and their operations for 4 months report that the Contras are dodging the Sandinista army and instead pref er to attack civilians, burning farms, clinics, schools, and homes. And when the combat does get tough, the Contras have this peculiar tendency to run for the border. Are these Contras motivated by a selfless love of democracy? If we look at the documents plucked from the files of Oliver North, we will see they are not. North sent his assistant, Robert Owen, to keep watch on Contra operations in Nicaragua. Owen was troubled with what he saw. Listen to Owen's own words from this memo to Colonel North: * * * Calero * * * is a creation of the U.S. government and so he's the horse we choose to ride. Owen says further: I have no problem with this as long as we do and understand Calero's shortcomings. The best way to point these out is to take a close look at who he keeps around * * * they are liars and greed-and power-motivated. They are not the people to rebuild a new Nicaragua. So much then, Mr. Speaker, for the administration's effort to describe the Contras as latter-day Thomas Jeffer\u00ad sons. Today the Sandinistas are negotiat\u00ad ing face to face with the Contras on a cease-fire, something this administra\u00ad tion has always demanded. Mr. Speaker, this is no time for America to invest more deficit money into this war. This is a time instead to give peace talks a chance. THE SILENCE ABOUT THE WEST BANK AND GAZA <Mr. DYMALL Y asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DYMALLY. Mr. Speaker, my statement today is designed to break the congressional silence regarding the uprisings in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. As one who spent 2 days in that troubled region, I feel compelled to appeal to my colleagues in the House to join in this international debate about the \"iron fist\" policy of the Israeli Defense Forces and the need for peace in the Middle East. If \u00b7We were residents of Israel; if we were members of the Knesset, we would not be silent on the most trou\u00ad bling issue facing us today. Indeed, members of the media, the clergy, academicians and the public in general, in the United States and Israel, have all joined in this debate about bringing an end to the conflict which exists in the Middle East, in general and Israel, the West Bank and Gaza in particular. And so I say to my colleagues, this is too important an issue for us to play it safe. Think about it. COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Repre\u00ad sentatives: Hon. JIM WRIGHT, WASHINGTON , DC, January 27, 1988. The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER: Pursuant to the per\u00ad mission granted in Clause 5 of Rule III of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representa\u00ad tives, I have the honor to transmit a sealed envelope received from the White House at 5:35 p.m. on Wednesday, January 27, 1988 and said to contain a message from the President whereby he transmits the request for funding for the Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance. With great respect, I am, Sincerely yours, DONNALD K. ANDERSON, Clerk, House of Representatives. REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL AS\u00ad SISTANCE FOR THE NICARA\u00ad GUAN DEMOCRATIC RESIST\u00ad ANCE-MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES <H. DOC. NO. 100-161) The SPEAKER laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the ac\u00ad companying papers, ref erred to the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intel\u00ad ligence and ordered to be printed. <For message, see proceedings of the Senate of Wednesday, January 27, 1988, at page 262. TRIBUTE TO SEVEN ASTRO\u00ad NAUTS ON SECOND ANNIVER\u00ad SARY OF SPACE SHUTTLE \"CHALLENGER\" ACCIDENT <Mr. SCHEUER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHEUER. Mr. Speaker, the flags at the NASA Space Center fly at half-mast today to mark the second anniversary of the tragic space shuttle accident of the Challenger. Seven courageous astronauts lost their lives when the Challenger shuttle exploded in flames just 73 seconds after liftoff. The families of those seven heroes will never forget the horror of that particular moment, and they will continue to live with a tre\u00ad mendous sense of deep loss. But the seven astronauts did not die in vain, Mr. Speaker. The shuttle acci\u00ad dent shook our space agency. It shook our space program to its very founda\u00ad tions. This may have delayed the shut\u00ad tle program and our space program for 2 years or more. It may have extracted a tragic toll in national trauma, but it also set in motion new standards, new standards of safety, new standards of science that will basically improve our program. NASA is improving its management. NASA has improved its science. Hope\u00ad fully, NASA will change the attitudes and behavior that brought us to the D This symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g., D 1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor. 324 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE January 28, 1988 moment of that awful tragedy. We think they will, and we hope they will. Mr. Speaker, space travel is never 100 percent safe, and the Challenger crew knew that when they joined the space program and embarked on their last mission. They were brave and bold professionals. Francis Scobee, Michael Smith, Robert McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe-your names will forever be etched in the hearts and minds of all Americans and in our na\u00ad tional Pantheon of heroes. SERIOUS QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT PROPOSED SANDINISTA REFORMS <Mr. INHOFE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. INHOFE. Mr. Speaker, some Democratic Members of the House have undermined the effectiveness of U.S. foreign policy by taking it upon themselves to counsel a foreign gov\u00ad ernment on how to influence a vote in the U.S. Congress. In addition to serious questions about the propriety of their actions, they have done a great disservice to the national security interests of this country. If and when the Sandinista regime reforms, it must be from within, not as a means to influence votes in the U.S. Congress. Otherwise there is no confidence that any re\u00ad forms will be anything but temporary window-dressing intended to fool us. What faith can we have in a regime that agrees to a peace plan, and then 2 months later reaches yet another agreement with the Soviet Union and Cuba on a massive military buildup? A buildup that includes a military force of 600,000 and the introduction of a squadron of Soviet Mig-21 fighter air\u00ad craft-but only after the Reagan ad\u00ad ministration and the resistance are gone. The Sandinistas have said that they would relinquish the government if Nicaraguans were crazy enough to vote them out, but they would never relinquish the power. That is directly contradictory to any democratic proc\u00ad ess. As for the Sandinistas reforms, they say they will release 3,300 political prisoners, but only if another country will take them. In other words, they trade imprisonment for exile. And what about the remaining 6,000 politi\u00ad cal prisoners? The state of emergency has been lifted, but peaceful demonstrations that are now legal have been broken up by Sandinista turbas while the police look on. On the day Ortega an\u00ad nounced he would lift the emergency decree, seven members of the internal democratic opposition were arrested. Three days later, another five internal democratic leaders, including an editor of the independent newspaper La Prensa, were arrested. Ironically, by their actions these Democrats have admitted the success of the democratic resistance and U.S. aid in putting pressure on the Sandi\u00ad nistas to make reforms. What they are missing is the fact that without con\u00ad tinued pressure, the Sandinistas are free to make temporary or superficial changes that can then be revoked after aid is denied and the resistance withers away. The continued existence of the resistance is the key to any long-term movement toward democra\u00ad cy and freedom in Nicaragua. JAPAN CONTINUES TO IGNORE INTERNATIONAL MORATORI- UM ON WHALING <Mr. RAVENEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.> Mr. RAVENEL. Mr. Speaker, last month the top whale scientists in the world met to examine Japan's latest attempt to circumvent the interna\u00ad tional moratorium on whaling. Japan submitted a new proposal to kill whales for the benefit of science. This latest proposal was to slaughter 300 minke whales in the Antarctic as a fea\u00ad sibility study for a much more exten\u00ad sive killing operation. The feasibility actually could have been tested in a computer simulation. In fact, it has al\u00ad ready been done by an Australian sci\u00ad entist who found that the proposal will not answer the questions being posed. At the special meeting of the Scien\u00ad tific Committee of the International Whaling Commission only scientists from Japan and Iceland consistently supported the Japanese proposal. Sci\u00ad entists from the United States and other countries exposed the fact that the proposal was not legitimate sci\u00ad ence. Thumbing its nose at the world's sci\u00ad entific community, Japan is back down in the Antarctic right now killing whales! Shame on you, Japan. Shame on you, Japan! CONSIDERING OUR OPTIONS ON CONTRA FUNDING <Mr. JEFFORDS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, next Wednesday, this body will be asked to approve -a package of $36 million in Contra aid assistance-both lethal and nonlethal-plus $20 million for re\u00ad placement of aircraft, and an undis\u00ad closed amount of intelligence assist\u00ad ance. There has been a tremendous amount said on the Central American issue already, but I would like my col\u00ad leagues to step back for a moment and put this debate into historical perspec\u00ad tive. For 6 years, since the administration started backing the Contras, war has raged in Central America. The Sandi\u00ad nistas have slowly and consistently backed out of their prQmises of open\u00ad ness and transition to democracy. During this time, the Nicaraguan Government has imposed a state of emergency, closed La Prensa and Radio Catolica, and grown generally less tolerant of dissent and open oppo\u00ad sition to the Sandinistas. The justifica\u00ad tion for these repressive measures has been the Contra war. An effort by the Contadora nations failed to make significant progress toward peace, partly because of the pressures of war and partly because of lack of support from the Reagan ad\u00ad ministration. Last August, the untiring efforts of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias to create a Central American peace alter\u00ad native resulted in the signing of the Guatemala accord. In the 6 months since the signing of this agreement, all five Central Ameri\u00ad can nations have made strides toward national reconciliation. Yet, much re\u00ad mains to be done. For its part, the Sandinista govern\u00ad ment has released political prisoners, allowed La Prensa and Radio Catolica to resume operations, and has lifted the state of emergency. The reason for these steps toward a more open society and the sincerity of these moves are the subject of much debate. But the reality is that they have occurred, reversing the down\u00ad ward spiral into repression that char\u00ad acterized the preceding 6 years. We cannot ignore the facts of histo\u00ad ry as we review our options. I urge all my colleagues to think carefully about what has been achieved in the past half year com\u00ad pared to the previous 6 years and how we can best ensure that this trend con\u00ad tinues. D 1115 LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM <Mr. MICHEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MICHEL. Mr. Speaker, I have asked for this time for the purpose of inquiring of the distinguished acting majority leader the program for next week. Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. MICHEL. Well, I will yield only after I make the comment that I am happy to see the gentleman here. I know that he has a considerable January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 325 number of his colleagues out in the great State of Iowa today, and it is nice to see that the gentleman re\u00ad mained behind, as he is so diligent in his work on an everyday basis, and I am happy to have the gentleman re\u00ad spond to my inquiry. I yield to the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Speaker, I appreci\u00ad ate the gentleman's kind remarks. I would say to the gentleman that upon adjournment today, the House will adjourn and we will have no ses\u00ad sion on tomorrow. The House will reconvene on Monday, February 1, at noon for a pro forma session. On Tuesday, February 2, the House meets at noon to consider the Private Calendar. Two bills will be on suspen\u00ad sion at that time, one bill dealing with the technical corrections to the Agri\u00ad culture Credit Act of 1987, the second suspension is the civil service due proc\u00ad ess amendments; 40 minutes will be al\u00ad located to each of these bills, 20 min\u00ad utes divided on each side. Recorded votes on those two suspen\u00ad sions will be postponed until after debate on both suspensions. Then on Wednesday, February 3, the House, subject to unanimous con\u00ad sent which I intend to make after our colloquy, would meet at 10 a.m. to con\u00ad sider the resolution which calls for the President's request for funding for Contra aid. Our purpose in asking unanimous consent to come in at 10 a.m., rather than the normally scheduled 2 p.m., would be that the 10-bour schedule for general debate could begin earlier in the day, and therefore allow Members to leave at an earlier point in the evening. After that, on Thursday, February 4, the House meets at 11 a.m. in a pro form.a session. On Friday, February 5, the House will not be in session. Conference reports may be brought up at any time. Any further program will be announced later. Mr. MICHEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. We certainly have no objection to the unanimous-consent request that the gentleman will make for 10 a.m. on next Wednesday. HOUR OF MEETING ON WEDNESDAY NEXT Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns on Tuesday, February 2, 1988, it adjourn to meet at 10 a.m., Wednesday, February 3, 1988. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon? There was no objection. A TRIBUTE TO DEPARTING PAGES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen\u00ad tleman from Missouri [Mr. EMERSON] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. EMERSON. Mr. Speaker, last Septem\u00ad ber, 66 new pages arrived in Washington from all over the United States to serve us here in the House of Representatives. Tomorrow will be the final day of work for many of them. Before they return home, I would like to take a moment to comment on the job they have done for us these past few months. When they arrived they were all strangers to each other and a little nervous about their new assignments. But it didn't take long for them to become friends or to learn their jobs. Curtis Rooney and his staff at the Page Residence Hall helped our new pages with the many adjustments they had to make living away from home and family for the first time, which I recall from personal experience, in\u00ad cludes a twinge or two of homesickness. By the way, Mr. Speaker, Curtis Rooney is himself leaving the page program at the end of this month in order to complete law school. I would like to thank him for all he has done for the page program during his tenure and wish him the best of luck with school and his new career. Mr. Speaker, our colleagues have gotten used to the many demands placed on our time, including the need to get up early in order to attend breakfast meetings, caucuses, conferences and the like. Well, the pages cer\u00ad tainly share in that experience. They must get up, dress, grab a bite to eat, and be in school by 6:45 in the morning. Dr. Knautz and his faculty at the House Page School have been given the task of put\u00ad ting together a curriculum which meets the needs of our pages who come from a variety of educational backgrounds and school sys\u00ad tems. This curriculum includes a class which meets on alternate Saturdays called Washing\u00ad ton Seminar. The Washington Seminar pro\u00ad vides the pages with cultural and historical in\u00ad sights into the development of our Nation and its Government. This past semester the pages traveled to Williamsburg, VA, to see what life in colonial America was like and where the seeds of independence were first placed in the minds of our forefathers. They visited Monticello to learn a little about the man who drafted our Declaration of Independence. And they saw Independence Hall in Philadelphia in the bicentennial year of our Constitution in order to learn how our founding fathers craft\u00ad ed the document with which we still govern ourselves. The hard work of the pages at school and the guidance of the faculty shows up each year when several students are selected for induction in the National Honor Society. I don't expect this year to be any different. After classes end at 1 O a.m., the pages come over here to start work. Peggy Samp\u00ad son, the Republican page supervisor and Lenny Donnelly, the Democratic page supervi\u00ad sor together with the managers of our respec\u00ad tive cloakrooms guide the pages through their daily tasks in the House. The pages perform a variety of tasks which make the job of the Members and our staffs much easier. Messages and mail, bills and briefcases are shuttled back and forth be\u00ad tween offices by pages. The flags, which are flown over the Capitol, that we send to our constituents are delivered to the flag office and returned to our offices by the pages. The phone calls which we receive while here in the Chamber are taken and delivered by the pages. The whip packets containing the bills and resolutions which we must consider, are assembled and delivered to us by the pages. Even the legislative bells which summon us to vote are rung by the pages. The pages' day is not finished when the House adjourns. While our colleagues run to catch airplanes or return fo their offices to complete our work, the pages return to their rooms in the residence hall to begin their homework and other assignments for school. Mr. Speaker, we ask a lot from the young men and women who serve as pages. But we also give a lot in return. The lessons these young people learn in the residence hall about living away from home and managing their time will, no doubt, help them when they attend college. The insights they get into the governmental and political process and the re\u00ad sponsibilities they are given here at work will help them throughout lite in whatever field they choose to follow. Many of these young people may choose to return to Washington after college for careers in Government serv\u00ad ice. Several of our colleagues and many of the staff members who serve us got their start in Government as pages. So, Mr. Speaker, as these young people prepare to return home, I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of myself and my colleagues on the page board to thank them for a job well done and wish them the best of luck in all they do. Mr. Speaker, I am including a list of all of the pages who served us this semester. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PAGE SCHOOL ROSTER-FALL 1987 PAGES 1. Albertie, Heather, J. 2. Aronberg, David A. 3.

PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Rich\u00ad ard C. Halverson, D.D., offered the fol\u00ad lowing prayer: Let us pray: Gracious God, merciful heavenly Father, we may reject Your love or ignore it. You never cease to love us. We may forget You. You never forget us. We may forsake You. You never forsake us. You have committed Your\u00ad self to us in Your own words: \"Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, nei\u00ad ther be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God thee whithersoever thou goest.\"-Joshua 1:9. You have promised: \"I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.\"-Hebrews 13:5. Grant to all Your servants who labor in this pressure cooker place daily-hourly awareness of and trust in Your uncon\u00ad ditional, universal, enduring love and provision. In Jesus' name. Amen. APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please read a communication to the Senate from the President pro tempore [Mr. STENNIS]. The legislative clerk read the follow\u00ad ing letter: U.S. SENATE, PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, Washington, DC, January 28, 1988. To the Senate: Under the provisions of rule I, section 3, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby appoint the Honorable KENT CONRAD, a Senator from the State of North Dakota, to perform the duties of the Chair. JOHN C. STENNIS, President pro tempore. Mr. CONRAD thereupon assumed the chair as Acting President pro tem\u00ad pore. THE JOURNAL Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Journal of the proceedings be approved to date. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Without objection, it is so or\u00ad dered. ORDER OF PROCEDURE Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it was in\u00ad formally agreed last night that the time of the two leaders would be yield-ed to the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. PROXMIRE]. I ask unanimous consent that that be done. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Without objection, the Senator from Wisconsin is recognized. SDI A BAD BARGAIN AT ANY COST: HERE'S WHY Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President , how do we make a realistic estimate of the cost of a project like the strategic defense initiative [SDI]? Supporters of the program tend to ignore its costs, or understate them. Opponents buttress their argument against the project by stressing the costs and overstating them. How do we secure the most likely cost or the range of most likely costs? First, we should recognize that cost projections at this stage of the de\u00ad velopment of a new technological pro\u00ad gram like the strategic defense initia\u00ad tive are guesses. It is impossible to make estimates of the cost of re\u00ad searching, developing, producing, de\u00ad ploying SDI. Even after SDI has been completed, the cost of maintaining , operating and especially modernizing the project will continue at a very high level year after year, in perpetui\u00ad ty. Why can we not secure reliable cost estimates from those most expert in the SDI technology? Here is why: First, there is no agree\u00ad ment on what SDI should be designed to do. Should it simply protect our own missile sites and command and control centers so that the U.S. deter\u00ad rent is safer? Should it defend the Na\u00ad tion's Capitol as the ABM Treaty per\u00ad mits? Should it defend all major U.S. cities? Should it def end all population centers in the United States? Should it defend the entire territory of the United States? Obviously the larger the mission the more costly the project. Defense of missile sites and command and control centers would come in at a small fraction of the cost of a total defense of the entire Nation. Second, how intensive a defense is necessary for each of these American targets to make SDI sufficiently eff ec\u00ad tive to be worthwhile or \"adequate\"? And what is the cost of a system that provides \"adequate\" defense? For ex\u00ad ample, would a system that provides a 50-percent defense; that is, eliminating 50 percent of Soviet ICBM's that would otherwise strike American tar\u00ad gets be adequate? Would a 90-percent defense against U .S.S.R. attack be \"adequate\"? How reliably can we de\u00ad termine the survivability percentage that SDI would provide? Third, in a recent article in The Backgrounder, a publication of the Heritage Foundation, by Grant Loebs, SDI advocates estimate the cost of an SDI system that would safeguard the American population against 90 per\u00ad cent of Soviet ICBM's at about $118 billion. They contended the expendi\u00ad ture would cover a 10-year period and would vary between $10 and $12 bil\u00ad lion per year. The article omitted any shred of documentation to justify the capability of such an SDI to stop 90 percent or any other percentage of Soviet missiles. It made no distinction between Soviet ICBM's that would be fired from the Soviet Union over the pole and those that would be dis\u00ad charged from bombers or submarines. In fact, it assumed that the SDI would primarily use space based kinetic kill vehicles [SBKKV'sl or battle stations to strike Soviet stationary land-based ICBM's in their burst phase. The arti\u00ad cle failed to show how we would defend such an SDI against antisatel\u00ad lite weapons designed to destroy our highly vulnerable SBKKV's. Fourth, even if everything worked according to the unlikely scenario de\u00ad sired by the SDI advocates; that is, no effective counter measures used by the Soviets, no bomber or submarine attack, no mobile land-based launchers that could evade the orbiting SBKKV's, the SDI advocates failed to indicate why we should expect SDI to take out 90 percent of the Soviet's mis\u00ad siles. Fifth, suppose SDI enjoyed that un\u00ad likely success, what would be the result of a Soviet strike using only half of their arsenal of 10,000 nuclear warheads and a 90-percent success rate for our SDI, the consequence would be 500 Soviet warheads finding their American target. The Union of Con\u00ad cerned Scientists estimate that if just 100-not 500-if just 100-Soviet stra\u00ad tegic warheads should strike American cities we would instantly suffer the death of between 35 and 55 million Americans. Our cities would be a steaming radioactive mess. Sixth, obviously the Soviets would be expected at the very least-if we proceed with SDI-to increase their offensive nuclear warheads by what\u00ad ever factor required to nullify our SDI. If they calculate that SDI might eliminate 90 percent of their warheads they could relatively quickly and cheaply increase their warheads by tenfold. Result, the Soviet deterrrent with 100,000 nuclear warheads would carry precisely the same force against a 90-percent effective SDI that it car\u00ad ries now against no SDI. e This \"bullet\" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by the Member on the floor. January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 329 Seventh, it is as impossible to esti\u00ad mate the cost of SDI as it is to esti\u00ad mate how much water it would take to fill a swimming pool that has precise dimensions but also has a drainage hole in the bottom of the pool that flows out into the ocean. Whatever re\u00ad sources we in the United States pour into a defensive system, the Soviets will certainly view SDI as an attempt to destroy the credibility of their de\u00ad terrent. They view their deterrent as we view our own deterrent-as abso\u00ad lutely essential to their nation's secu\u00ad rity. Result: No matter how much we pour into building an SDI-several hundred billion, a trillion dollars or several trillion, the Soviets can spend far less and maintain a capability to retaliate against any attack with a devastating and I mean totally devas\u00ad tating nuclear counterattack. The solid, grim fact remains. SDI or no SDI, no one can win a superpower nuclear war. There will be nothing left but losers. This is why arms control, not SDI, is the only way to peace in this nuclear world. CALIFORNIA PAPERS FAVOR REPEAL OF GLASS-STEAGALL Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, on another subject, that a number of editorials from California newspapers support\u00ad ing a repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the arti\u00ad cles were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the Sacramento Bee, Aug. 10, 1987] BANKING IN THE VISE For a half century, federal law has barred commercial banks from engaging in other businesses, such as selling securities. But while rules designed to protect bank stabili\u00ad ty have restrained banks, a decade of de\u00ad regulation has loosed other businesses, in\u00ad cluding investment firms, brokerage houses, insurance companies, travel agents, auto manufacturers and even retailers, to tread on the commercial banks' turf. The result? The very rules designed to promote bank safety are now making the banking system more risky. In the new world of financial supermar\u00ad kets, banks-defined as institutions that both take deposits and make commercial loans-are being besieged from two direc\u00ad tions. On the deposit side, customers who once had little choice but to keep their money in banks can now buy certificates of deposit at the department store or set up cash management accounts that offer pack\u00ad ages of services-checking, credit cards, in\u00ad surance, brokerage, mutual funds-that banks are not permitted to match. On the loan side, the large and medium\u00ad sized corporations that were once the bank's best borrowers are turning to the commer\u00ad cial paper market for short-term financing. Mortgages and auto loans, once a substan\u00ad tial source of income for banks, are being re\u00ad packaged as securities by investment firms, a technique that lowers costs for consumers but deprives banks of business. That compe\u00ad tition has left banks squeezed into what has become the least profitable and riskiest part of the financial world-lending to small companies, farmers, real estate developers and governments abroad. Although the need to bolster the banking system by putting banks on a level playing field with their less-regulated competitors has been clear to regulators such as the Federal Reserve Congress so far has failed to heed their calls for comprehensive bank\u00ad ing reform. Lawmakers are readier to listen to the investment houses, brokers and real estate and insurance agents, who enjoy the legal shackles that keep the banks at bay. As a result, after five years of trying, the closest that Congress can come to a major reform is a bill, headed for the president's desk, that puts restrictions on the growth of non-bank banks and a moratorium on regu\u00ad latory or court actions that let banks into new fields. That sort of dithering doesn't inspire con\u00ad fidence. To bolster the banks and spread their risks, Congress must free them to com\u00ad pete with other financial institutions in services such as securities underwriting, in\u00ad surance and brokerage. At the same time, lawmakers must think about how to restruc\u00ad ture financial regulation to achieve in today's more market-oriented financial world the same kind of protection against panics and concentration of power that ex\u00ad isted in decades past. Strict laws are needed to see that insured deposits aren't used by diversified institutions to venture into risky businesses, that loans aren't tied to the sale of other financial services and that financial institutions keep firm walls between their banking and non-banking activities. Properly managed, diversified financial supermarkets can bring lower costs and new services to consumers. But the current willy\u00ad nilly deregulation, without comprehensive reform, only brings new instabilities and the risk of a weakened banking system. [From the Oakland Tribune, June 29, 1987] DON'T REGULATE BANKS TO DEATH As if competing with foreign behemoths and domestic financial giants weren't chal\u00ad lenge enough, America's banks must do battle from within a regulatory straitjacket fastened by a false premise. The straitjacket is the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which bars banks from applying their financial expertise to underwriting and dealing in securities, a field monopo\u00ad lized by investment banks and foreign insti\u00ad tutions. The premise behind that act is the as\u00ad sumption that bank meddling in securities markets prompted the wave of bank failures in the Great Depression. This enduring myth has no basis in fact. The great majority of the 4,800 banks that collapsed between 1930 and 1933 were small, rural banks that handled no securities busi\u00ad ness at all. They went under because they had too small an asset base and too restrict\u00ad ed a loan portfolio to survive the one-third shrinkage of the nation's money supply en\u00ad gineered by the Federal Reserve Board. Today the threat to the nation's banks comes not from overspeculation but overreg\u00ad ulation. In today's hypercompetitive inter\u00ad national markets, banks cannot hold onto quality customers without more freedom to expand the scope of their operations. Consider some indicators of the dismal state of the domestic banking industry: Of the world's top 25 banks, only two are American, down from 15 only 30 years ago. Bank profits have slid for the past 15 years, to the point where a quarter of the nation's banks are losing money. For five years run-ning, the bank failure rate has broken post\u00ad Depression records. Glass-Steagall isn't the only culprit. But arbitrary limits on bank entry in the under\u00ad writing field, combined with equally arbi\u00ad trary geographic limits on branch banking, have made it tough for many banks to sur\u00ad vive the sharp deflation of the 1980s. The law effectively stops banks from com\u00ad peting for the prime corporate market in short-term lending; their share of the market has plummeted from 43 percent in 1974 to 27 percent 1985. The reason: Cash\u00ad poor companies find it cheaper to raise money from cash-rich companies through the $1 trillion-a-year commercial paper market rather than going to the bank. Only investment banks-and 15 foreign banks grandfathered by Congress-can underwrite commercial paper and other securities. So U.S. banks have been forced to become lenders of last resort to energy ventures, farm operations and other risky businesses, even while facing tough new competition from \"non-bank banks\" set up by large com\u00ad panies like Sears and J.C. Penney. Frustrated by all these restrictions, Chase Manhattan president Thomas Labrecque even talked of abandoning the bank's feder\u00ad al charter. \"A bank charter begins to look more and more like a one-way ticket to the graveyard,\" he said. Relief is not in sight. Although the Su\u00ad preme Court last week upheld the right of banks to broker commercial paper, they still may not underwrite it. And Congress is moving, under enormous pressure from in\u00ad vestment banks and other financial sectors, to stop further erosion of the Glass-Steagall Act. California Sen. Alan Cranston, listen\u00ad ing to his generous campaign contributors in the securities industry, is among the many in Congress fighting to keep the banks in their narrow place. But the consequences of limiting competi\u00ad tion across the range of financial services will surely be to further weaken domestic banks vis-a-vis their foreign rivals. \"If banks cannot evolve,\" warns Treasury Secretary James Baker, \"the term 'count\u00ad inghouse industry' may before long become an epitaph like 'smokestack' or 'rust bowl.' The victim would be one more U.S. in\u00ad dustry that would not-or in this case could not-evolve to meet the competition.\" CFrom the San Jose Mercury, July 7, 1987] UNBIND THE BANKS House and Senate conferees have ap\u00ad proved a measure that may well be remem\u00ad bered as the banking bill that wasn't. The legislation, which now goes back to the two chambers for approval, is notable more for what it doesn't accomplish than for what it does. The bill fails most broadly and miserably in the crucial area of banking deregulation, a process that is long overdue and which must be undertaken soon if American banks are to retain-recover, in many cases-their health. Congress, unfortunately, has allowed itself to be pressured by the competitors of a reinvigorated banking industry. The con\u00ad ferees agreed to curb the creation and ex\u00ad pansion of limited-service banks, which aren't subject to the same regulations as full-service institutions, and to ban tempo\u00ad rarily the granting of new banking powers by federal regulators. Their position may gladden members of the brokerage, insurance, real estate and travel industries, who fear competition from 330 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENA TE January 28, 1988 fully armed banks, but it makes no econom\u00ad ic sense. It also is a disservice to consumers. The U.S. financial landscape has shifted dramatically since the Great Depression, but the regulations governing banks have remained essentially unchanged. Rules cre\u00ad ated to stabilize the industry more than 50 years ago are throttling it today. In 1970, seven of the world's 25 largest banks were American, today only three are. A post-Depression record of 200 bank fail\u00ad ures is expected this year. Banks are restricted to activities-princi\u00ad pally commercial and consumer lending\u00ad that potentially are far riskier than the un\u00ad derwriting and brokerage business they would like to engage in. No such prohibitions hinder foreign banks or a variety of financial services firms in this country, and they are plundering U.S. banking's business base. There are ways to let banks expand into more lucrative areas without compromising the safety of their deposits, and they should be adopted. A far greater risk would be posed if the current slide were allowed to continue. However, blocking the conference commit\u00ad tee measure is not the best way to achieve the needed reform. The legislation authorizes a crucial refi\u00ad nancing by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the currently insolvent agency that is supposed to provide a safety net for the U.S. thrift industry. On that ground alone, it should be approved. Then, next fall, Congress should take on the crucial, politically nettlesome task it has avoided. Banks must be deregulated. [From the Fresno Bee, July 13, 19871 BANKING IN THE VISE For a half century, federal law has barred commercial banks from engaging in other businesses, such as selling securities. But while rules designed to protect bank stabili\u00ad ty have restrained banks, a decade of dereg\u00ad ulation has loosed other businesses, includ\u00ad ing investment firms, brokerage houses, in\u00ad surance companies, travel agents, auto man\u00ad ufacturers and even retailers, to tread on the commercial banks' turf.

JANUARY GOLDEN FLEECE GOES TO MINORITY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AGENCY Mr. PROXMIRE . Mr. President, I am presenting my Golden Fleece of the month for January to the Minori\u00ad ty Business Development Agency of the Department of Commerce for awarding a second $200,000 grant to a virtually useless conference of mayors in southern Texas despite being told by the Department's own auditors that the \"performance of the confer\u00ad ence during its first grant was ex\u00ad tremely poor\" and that the project should be terminated. Only after the additional $200,000 was spent and a followup audit report concluded that in the second year the \"project's re\u00ad sults were minimal\" did Federal fund\u00ad ing finally stop. The Minority Business Development Agency's CMBDAJ mission is to assist in the establishment and successful operation of minority owned and run businesses. On August 30, 1984, the Lower Rio Grande Conference of Mayors was incorporated in Texas. On September 28, 1984, the conference was awarded a $200,000, noncompeti\u00ad tive, no matching funds required, dem\u00ad onstration project from MBDA. In May 1986, the inspector general issued a highly critical report of the project and strongly recommended no further funding. According to the report only part of the initial focus of the conference related, even indirect\u00ad ly, to minority business enterprise. Most of the effort and funding went into the .overhead costs of setting up the conference and into general com\u00ad munity planning. The auditors pointed out that both the first grant and the proposed second grant duplicated services al\u00ad ready provided by the MBDA and other Commerce Department agen\u00ad cies. For example, MBDA itself was funding minority business develop\u00ad ment centers in key locations in the area. Also, the Department's Economic Development Administration was funding other economic planning and development organizations in the lower Rio Grande region. Finally the auditors questioned the appropriateness of funding a project, \"a major purpose of which would be to generate applications to other Federal agencies for additional grants.\" Disregarding the detailed warnings, MBDA awarded the second grant which ran until July 1987. An interim audit in April 1987 found in addition to producing \"minimal\" re\u00ad sults, the conference was in terrible fi\u00ad nancial straits. The organization was more than $47,000 in debt, including owing $4,400 to the IRS for overdue payroll taxes. The Federal grant money could not be used to pay the money owed IRS. The auditors con\u00ad cluded that it was doubtful that the conference could continue to function without significant non-Federal fund\u00ad ing. Once again the inspector general's report recommended the MBDA not renew the grant. Finally, after wasting $400,000 of taxpayers' money, the MBDA cut off the funding, and without another handout from \"Uncle Sugar\" the Lower Rio Grande Valley Conference of Mayors ceased operations. CIVIL RIGHTS RESTORATION ACT The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. Under the previous order, the Senate will now resume consideration of unfinished business, which the clerk will now report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill <S. 557) to restore the broad scope of coverage and to clarify the application of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Pending: Hatch Amendment No. 1386, to clarify that the exemption to Section 901 of the Education Amendments of 1972 shall also apply to entities closely identified with the tenets of a religious organization. The Senate resumed consideration of the bill in accordance with the unanimous-consent agreement entered on yesterday, which provides as fol\u00ad lows: January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 331 S. 557 (ORDER No. 157) 2.-0rdered, That at 10:30 a.m. on Thurs\u00ad day, January 28, 1988, the Senate proceed to vote, up-or-down, on the Hatch amendment, dealing with religious . tenet, with no time for debate on any rrtotion to reconsider that vote. . . Ordered further, That upon disposition of the Hatch amendment, the Senate proceed to the consideration of a Metzenbaum/Ken\u00ad nedy /Weicker /Packwood amendment, with the time until 1:00 p.m. to be equally divided and controlled in the usual form, with an up-or-down vote to occur at 1:00 p.m. there\u00ad on, and with no time for debate on any motion to reconsider that vote.

Ordered further, That no amendments to any underlying language be in order. Ordered further, That time for debate on any debatable motion, appeal, or point of order shall be limited to 20 minutes, to be equally divided and controlled in the usual form. (Jan. 27, 1988.) AMENDMENT NO. 1386 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The pending question is the Hatch amendment, . Amendment No. 1386. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering will address one of the serious flaws of the legisla\u00ad tion as drafted. In 1972, when Con\u00ad gress enacted title IX, which bans sex discrimination in education programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance, it adopted an exception to coverage under the provisions of the act. This exception reads as follows: This section shall not apply to an educa\u00ad tion institution which is' controlled by a reli\u00ad gious organization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization. <20 U.S.C. section 1681<a)(3).) When this language was adopted, many educational institutions were controlled by religious organizations. Today, this direct nexus is not quite so clear. Today, many of these institu\u00ad tions, while they retain their identity with religious tenets, are controlled by governing boards, a majority of whose members are lay persons. Similarly, many such institutions receive less fi\u00ad nancial support from religious organi\u00ad zations than they did in the past. They are, therefore, outside of the scope of the existing test. The amendment I am offering would expand the scope of the religious tenets exemption by including not only entities controlled by a religious organization, but also those \"closely identified with the tenets of\" a reli\u00ad gious organization. This language is by no means new to Congress. When we last faced this issue directly during consideration of the higher education amendments of 1986, we included in that legislation a nearly identical exemption to a prohi\u00ad bition on religious discrimination for projects under the Construction Loan Insurance Program. So this is not a new idea. It is some\u00ad thing we have approved. The amendment would not protect an institution which sought an exemp\u00ad tion from prohibitions under title VI, that is, race; section 504, that is, handicapped; or the Age Discrimina\u00ad tion Act, that is, age. The exemption would have no application to public schools or hospitals. It would apply only to private institutions which per\u00ad sons attend voluntarily. So it is a very narrow exception. It is one that does recognize religious free\u00ad dom and religious beliefs in our socie\u00ad ty, and I think corrects what is an in\u00ad equity with regard to religious free\u00ad dom and religious beliefs in our society that would not otherwise be corrected without this particular amendment. Moreover, the amendment would not allow an institution to be exempted in its entirety. It would only exempt a policy of the institution that is based on its religious tenets to the extent that the policy conflicts with title IX. So it is very limited in that regard also. Church colleges and universities, freely chosen by the students who attend them, have traditionally re\u00ad garded attitudes about marriage, chil\u00ad dren and families as central to the concerns of their students. These schools provide not just a traditional education but instill important family and religious values as well. In this regard, church schools provide a very different approach than public schools. The latter, as an extension of the -democratic state, must take a more neutral posture regarding cer\u00ad tain values including sexual mortality, abortion, marriage, and family life. Without any amendment, S. 557 will push much closer toward an official orthodoxy on value questions in all schools and educational institutions. And it will be an orthodoxy set by Washington, not by the particular be\u00ad liefs of the citizens out there \u00b7in the re\u00ad spective areas. The proponents of S. 557 will argue that this amendment is unnecessary, that no school has ever been denied a request for an exemption. While that may be technically correct-and that is all it is-during the 10-year period between 1975 and 1984, only 5 out of 220 requests .for exemptions were actu\u00ad ally granted. What the proponents forget to mention is that the bureauc~ racy has stubbornly resisted even acting on the requests, reflecting an apparent hostility for an exemption. If one wanted to accurately describe what has happened with the current exemption, during the period I just mentioned, there were 220 requests, 5 exemptions granted and 215 what we might call \"failures to act.\" So techni\u00ad cally it is true that one can say that the Department did not deny any re\u00ad quests, but such a description creates a false impression. In fact, more than 95 percent of the requests were simply ig\u00ad nored. Obviously, for the schools in\u00ad volved, there is no real difference be\u00ad tween a denial and a failure to act. The result is the same. The schools were forced to bend their religious be\u00ad liefs to accommodate the regulatory demands of the Department of Educa\u00ad tion. Since 1985, when this issue became the subject of congressional debate and public attention, about 145 of the requested exemptions have been granted. Current law provides no guar\u00ad antee, however, that a different ad\u00ad ministration will not revert to the practices of the past or revoke the ex\u00ad emptions already granted. Moreover, since there is a private right of action under title IX, there is also the very real possibility that private suits will be filed to deny schools these exemp\u00ad tions. Moreover, given the scope of Federal jurisdiction called for in S. 557, the need for this amendment will increase as a result of the scope of this bill. While in the past a private, religious school could assume that only a specif\u00ad ic program or activity was subject to Federal regulation, S. 557 would apply coverage over the entire institution, guaranteeing that all value and moral related activities at a school would be subject to Federal regulation. 332 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 I do not know how anybody could not vote for this amendment which corrects that imbalance and restores the rights of these basically religious institutions to believe in the values that they do and in the tenets that they do. \u00b7 The support for this amendment is perhaps the evidence of its merit. It has been endorsed by such main\u00ad stream organizations as the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, which has over 800 member institutions enrolling over 2 million students; the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities; the American Association of Presidents of Independent Colleges and Universities; the United States Catholic Confer\u00ad ence; Agudath Israel; the National So\u00ad ciety for Hebrew Schools; and the Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools. Religious liberty is a basic right of every American, the first right guaran\u00ad teed in the first amendment. I hope my colleagues will join with the other sponsors of this amendment and pro\u00ad tect diversity and pluralism in educa\u00ad tion. That is what this amendment does. This amendment can be adopted without jeopardizing our commitment to civil rights or impairing the effec\u00ad tiveness of the four statutes addressed in S. 557. With that, I will reserve the remain\u00ad der of my time. I will be happy to yield to Senator HATFIELD as the lead co\u00ad sponsor on this amendment. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The Senator from Oregon is rec\u00ad ognized. Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Utah, Sena\u00ad tor HATCH, for yielding time. I rise not only as a cosponsor of the amendment before us, but as one who supports the general principles of the Civil Rights Restoration Act. In light of the Supreme Court's decision in Grove City, there is a clear need to strengthen and expand coverage of the four civil rights statutes banning various forms of discrimination in pro\u00ad grams and activities that receive Fed\u00ad eral funds. With this said, however, I am also troubled by several aspects of this bill, including its impact on first amend\u00ad ment rights as they relate to religious liberty. Our country was founded on principles of diversity and pluralism, particularly with regard to the free ex\u00ad ercise of religious beliefs as guaran\u00ad teed by the Constitution. As currently drafted, this bill does not adequately protect these rights. Let me explain. Title IX of the Edu\u00ad cation Amendments of 1972, which I voted for, prohibits gender discrimina\u00ad tion in educational programs or activi\u00ad ties receiving Federal funds. That title, however, contained an exemption for educational institutions which are \"controlled by a religious organiza-tion.\" Under this exemption, an educa\u00ad tional institution may seek an exemp\u00ad tion from the provisions of title IX where application of that title \"would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization.\" Many private religious colleges and universi\u00ad ties teach fundamental religious prin\u00ad ciples on such topics as marriage, chas\u00ad tity, and abortion. Some religious edu\u00ad cational institutions, while believing that educational and other opportuni\u00ad ties for men and women should be fully and completely available, also teach that particular distinctions based on gender are both natural and religiously significant. While this may not be the viewpoint of any Senator, surely we all support the right of those institutions to follow the tenets of their religion. In 1972, the vast majority of these religious schools were directly con\u00ad trolled by church denominations, catholic dioceses and other religious organizations. The current exemption was adequate to protect each school's first amendment right to the free ex\u00ad ercise of their religious beliefs. I em\u00ad phasize that was in 1972. However, the form of association be\u00ad tween these religious entities and their private colleges and universities has evolved over the past 16 years. And I doubt if there are many Senators here that are fully acquainted with this evolution. Today, many of these edu\u00ad cational institutions, while still hold\u00ad ing to their religious beliefs and doc\u00ad trine, are controlled by lay boards and have additional sources of funding beyond the religious organization. Mr. President, it is pretty obvious with the economics of private colleges today, that they must look beyond those denominational constituencies for sources of funding. They could not exist if they did not. The \"religious tenets\" exemption from application of title IX, as pres\u00ad ently worded, does not reflect this cur\u00ad rent form of relationship in these in\u00ad stitutions. Accordingly, the \"control\" test for application of the exemption no longer affords adequate protection for religious values under title IX. The current exemption must be amended to reflect the changed nature of reli\u00ad giously oriented institutions. The amendment before us restores full protection of religious values by providing an exemption from title IX based on religious tenets not only when the institution is controlled by a religious organization, but also when an educational institution \"closely identifies with the tenets of\" that reli\u00ad gious organization. Keep in mind that we do not seek to \"loosen\" this exemption. I am an ada\u00ad mant supporter of the full application of all civil rights laws. After 37 years in public life, I think that record is pretty well established. But I do not share the fear that this amendment will somehow create a loophole result\u00ad ing in widespread discrimination in education. This amendment simply seeks to restore fully the constitution\u00ad al protection of the free exercise of re\u00ad ligious beliefs in religious educational institutions, therefore satisfying the intent of Congress when it adopted the \"religious tenets\" exemption to title IX in 1972. The amendment will protect important nondiscriminatory principles embodied in title IX and other civil rights statutes. Let me remind my colleagues what this amendment will not do. It is very limited in scope and does not allow a college to unilaterally claim a blanket exemption from all title IX require\u00ad ments. There must be a policy or poli\u00ad cies embodying a particular religious tenet and a particular title IX regula\u00ad tion regarding gender discrimination in conflict before the exemption will apply. We still hold the control over this, Mr. President, under this act. Title IX coverage will properly apply to all other aspects of the institution's activities. Further, under the regulations pro\u00ad mulgated by the Department of Edu\u00ad cation, a college must still apply for the exemption. The Department of Education reviews each exemption re\u00ad quest submitted, and grants or denies the request based on the facts present\u00ad ed. The Department of Education re\u00ad tains jurisdiction to investigate any complaints or concerns raised regard\u00ad ing the school's connection with the particular religious organization, or if there is concern about the legitimacy of the religious tenet articulated by the school. Nor does the amendment permit an educational institution to claim pro\u00ad tection for differentiation on the basis of race, handicap, or age. These civil rights statutes are fully applicable. Finally, the exemption is only avail\u00ad able to schools which are \"controlled\" by a religious organization or \"closely identified with the tenets of a particu\u00ad lar religious organization.\" The lan\u00ad guage places reasonable limits on the class of eligible religious organizations. Let me repeat, Mr. President, that this amendment does not abrogate the intent of title IX; but rather, reflects the actual structure of religious higher education. The amendment strikes a constitutional balance be\u00ad tween the need to promote the princi\u00ad ples of equal rights, while allowing for the legitimate exercise of religious lib\u00ad erty. Let us remember that the first amendment guarantees religious liber\u00ad ty as well as free speech and other rights. This amendment has the support of many organizations, including the U.S. Catholic Conference, the National As\u00ad sociation of Independent Colleges and Universities, the Christian College Co-.r. ... - - January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 333 alition, the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, and the American Association of Presidents of Independent Colleges and Universities. Mr. President, this amendment is badly needed, and I think we ought to be aware of the erosion of first amend\u00ad ment liberties that is happening in our land today. It is interesting to note in closing that a great number of publica\u00ad tions on the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution of the United States are addressing first amendment rights and the problems that are aris\u00ad ing periodically and regularly under those rights, specifically regarding re\u00ad ligious liberties. I speak as one who has had a little experience not only in university and educational life, but in dealing with a very interesting cult that developed in my State. Their presence again called attention to the right to freely exercise religious be\u00ad liefs under the first amendment. I ref er to the Rajneesh. The point is that we must continue to protect our full rights under the Constitution and the first amendment, particularly in the field of religious education. I urge its adoption. Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield such time as the Senator from Vermont may want. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. STAFFORD. Mr. President, I thank the very able Senator from Massachusetts for yielding time to me. Mr. President, it is not without some trepidation that I find myself on the opposite side of an issue from the very able Senator from Utah, Senator HATCH, and my very able friend of many years, the Senator from Oregon, Senator HATFIELD. But that is the way it is today. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment being offered to S. 557, The Civil Rights Restoration Act. The issue before us is whether or not to permit the standard for the reli\u00ad gious tenet exemption as outlined in title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to be expanded from \"con-trolled by\" to \"closely identified\" with the tenets of a religious organization. It is my opinion that we should reject the amendment and leave the lan\u00ad guage in the bill as it now stands. I be\u00ad lieve that the goal of all civil rights laws is universal compliance. Immuni\u00ad ty from such compliance should be granted cautiously and judiciously, as is current practice. Liberalizing the standard for the granting of waivers is unwarranted. There are several reasons why we should reject this amendment. First and f-Oremost in my mind is the simple fact that in order for S. 557 to be ef\u00ad fective it needs to be passed as it is now crafted. I cannot emphasize this point enough. We must not stray from the original intent of this legislation which is to restore the nondiscrimina\u00ad tory statutes back to their pre-Grove City status. We must not allow this measure to be turned into a vehicle for other legislative agendas, but rather, we must permit it to pass in its origi\u00ad nal form. If we allow one amendment to take hold, I am afraid that we will find ourselves lost in a sea of legisla\u00ad tive agendas far from our original shoreline. Let me also remind my colleagues of the short title of this act: The Civil Rights Restoration Act. Its basic premise is to restore the civil rights of all individuals to the status they held before the narrow ruling issued by the Supreme Court in Grove City. It does not address the issue of religion. It is not, and should not become a religious issue. Current title IX regulations provide for a religious exemption to the stat\u00ad ute where it is inconsistent with the religious tenets of the institution. An educational institution need only make application to the Department of Education for such an exemption. To date, no institution that has com\u00ad pleted an application has been denied an exemption. According to a 1987 De\u00ad partment of Education report, there are 150 institutions that have been granted religious exemptions. The Na\u00ad tional Center for Education Statistics reports that nationally, there are 3,301 institutions of higher learning. They report 786 religiously affiliated schools. That represents over five times the current number that could possibly gain exemption from compli\u00ad ance to the nondiscrimination statutes safeguarded by S. 557. It also means that 559,053 students, the total number of women enrolled both part time and full time in religiously affili\u00ad ated schools, would possibly be sub\u00ad jected to discriminatory acts. The en\u00ad actment of the education amendments of 1972 provided women with opportu\u00ad nities to participate in programs and facilities in which they had previously been denied access. The amendment offered by Senator HATCH threatens the rights that we sought to protect in the education amendments of 1972. Some of my colleagues have men\u00ad tioned the fact that contained within the Higher Education Act reauthoriza\u00ad tion of 1986 is language which is simi\u00ad lar, if not identical, to that being pro\u00ad posed by Mr. HATCH. They are indeed correct-there is language. However, the context in which that language is used is entirely different from the way in which the amendment proposes its use in S. 557. The language that was inserted by Congressman HENRY during the conference on S. 1965 refer\u00ad ences only section 752 of the College Construction Loan Insurance Associa\u00ad tion authorization. This was a conces\u00ad sion made very reluctantly by the Senate conferees. When the Senate spoke during floor consideration of the Higher Education Act amend\u00ad ments, the antidiscrimination statute adopted used the phrase \"religiously controlled.\" The expansion agreed to in conference was just that-a confer\u00ad ence agreement. It refers only to reli\u00ad gious discrimination in consideration of doing business with a newly formed loan insurance association. If I had an\u00ad ticipated then, that insertion of that conference agreement language would possibly cause the failure of a reasser\u00ad tion of our civil rights, I would have fought much more vigorously to pre\u00ad vent its inclusion. In the 99th Congress, attempts were made to broaden the religious exemp\u00ad tion language during consideration of H.R. 700, the civil rights legislation. The House Education and Labor Com\u00ad mittee adopted an amendment similar to that proposed by Senator HATCH. The House Judiciary Committee re\u00ad jected this so-called religiously \"affili\u00ad ated\" language. Because of this and other points of disagreement, H.R. 700 was permanently stalled in committee. During the lOOth Congress, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Commit\u00ad tee reaffirmed the House Judiciary's decision to reject this language by a vote of 11-5. I ask my colleagues to support the decision made by the com\u00ad mittee and vote against this amend\u00ad ment. In closing, I would like to reaffirm my commitment to title IX of the edu\u00ad cation amendments of 1972. It is indeed unfortunate that in order to guarantee equality for women, we have to mandate it in Federal funds. It seems to this Senator that we should be able to look upon each other as equals and treat each other in such a manner that does not require Govern\u00ad ment intervention. Discrimination against women should be eradicated from our society. Expanding defini\u00ad tions and manipulating words only cre\u00ad ates a greater potential for side-step\u00ad ping equal treatment. The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr. GRAHAM). Who yields time? 334 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself such time as I may use. Mr. President, I oppose this amend\u00ad ment. I welcome the comments of the former chairman of the Education Committee, now the ranking minority member of the committee, who has made an extraordinary contribution in the areas of education and not only has reviewed our general education programs but also has a unique per\u00ad spective on this issue. He has given it a good deal of attention and is probably as knowledgeable about the real impli\u00ad cations of this amendment and what the current situation is as any other Member of this Senate. Since its enactment in 1972, title IX has contained an exemption for educa\u00ad tional institutions \"controlled by think that ba\u00ad sically addresses the central concerns of the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Utah. The exemption permits an education institution to seek an exemption from the prohibi\u00ad tion on sex discrimination in title IX where the application of title IX \"would not be consistent with the reli\u00ad gious tenets of such organization.\" S. 557 leaves the religious tenet ex\u00ad emption in title IX intact and clarifies that. the exemption is as broad as the title IX coverage of education pro\u00ad grams and activities. Thus, a religious\u00ad ly controlled education program or ac\u00ad tivity which receives Federal financial assistance and is therefore subject to the sex discrimination prohibition in title IX, but is not part of an educa\u00ad tion institution, would still be within the scope of the religious tenet exemp\u00ad tion. The inclusion of clarifying lan\u00ad guage for the religious exemption was prompted by concern expressed by the Catholic Conference in previous Con\u00ad gresses. Bishop Joseph Sullivan, who testified on behalf of the U.S. Catholic Conference before the committee on S. 557, commented approvingly on the religious tenet exemption in S. 557: When we testified on this legislation in the last Congress, we requested that the re\u00ad ligious tenet provision be extended to ensure that the noneducational institutions would also be protected. As we read S. 557 in its present form, the extension of the reli\u00ad gious tenet provision beyond education in\u00ad stitutions have been made. The Catholic Conference later ex\u00ad pressed sympathy with the supporters of a change in the religious tenet ex\u00ad emption. I want to make that clear. But in terms of working out the lan\u00ad guage which we have in S. 557 and re\u00ad viewing that the testimony we had, it was acceptable at that time. There was an effort to develop this further posi\u00ad tion, and the conference has embraced that. The record of implementation of the religious tenet exemption does not in\u00ad dicate any need to broaden the reli\u00ad gious tenet provision. The U.S. De-partment of Education, the agency charged with administering title IX re\u00ad ligious. exemption requests, provided the following information to the com\u00ad mittee by letter dated May 19, 1987. I think this is very important, Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, and I hope the Members are lis\u00ad tening. OCR has received requests for religious exemptions from 227 institutions since July 21, 1975, the date the title IX regulation was implemented, to the present. OCR has granted exemptions to 150 insti\u00ad tutions. Under the 1985 religious exemption project aimed at resolving the requests pending at that time, OCR closed 79 request files for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: the institution withdrew the request; the institution did not need a reli\u00ad gious exemption since its admission prac\u00ad tices were already exempt; the institution had ceased operations; or the institution failed to respond to repeated requests from OCR for additional information sufficient to act on the exemption request. OCR has never denied a request for religious ex\u00ad emption. No requests for religious exemp\u00ad tion are pending at this time. Some requests were not granted be\u00ad cause they were incomplete or the practice engaged in did not violate title IX, as I mentioned. So exemptions have been granted to institutions seeking to discriminate against women based on their marital status, to limit intercollegiate athletic activities for women, and to discrimi\u00ad nate against unmarried pregnant stu\u00ad dents. This amendment seeks to expand the religious tenet exemption to in\u00ad clude entities who are \"closely identi\u00ad fied\" with the tenets of a religious or\u00ad ganization. Expanding the exemption would substantially broaden the exemption by allowing potentially hundreds of schools and colleges to escape from title IX coverage. The National Center for Educational Statistics reports that there are 3,331 institutions of higher education na\u00ad tionwide, of which 794 report a reli\u00ad gious affiliation. Therefore, it is con\u00ad ceivable that as many as one-quarter of all such institutions could apply for and receive exemptions. Admittedly, the control test is, and should be, a difficult one. Many schools have chosen to no longer be controlled in order to be able to re\u00ad ceive private and public aid. By adopt\u00ad ing this amendment, we would allow them to take Federal funds on the one hand and discriminate on the other. There have been no problems in the past. I do not believe that there are problems at the present time. Mr. President, I want to repeat that there are no pending applications at the present time, and there has not been an instance where there has been a rejection, other than as I understand for the lack of additional information or the conditions which we have men\u00ad tioned, and the potential in this other area is indeed significant. Now, we have provided a test that exists and is well understood now by educational institutions. No such test is even suggested by those who pro\u00ad pound this amendment. We provide: is it a school or a de\u00ad partment of divinity? When the initial language was devel\u00ad oped, it was pointed out to the sup\u00ad porters of the amendment that we had various seminaries and other religious organizations, groups, educational, whose tenets were of sufficient nature that may be violative of the language. So there wa.S the development with those various groups of these criteria which have been the standard criteria which now are in place, are under\u00ad stood, with a solid record of adherence to it. These are the criteria: Is it a school or department of divinity, or requires its faculty, students or employees to be members of or otherwise espouse a personal belief in a religion of the or\u00ad ganization which it claims to be con\u00ad trolled or on its charter and catalog or other official publications contain ex\u00ad plicit statements that it is controlled by a religious organization or an organ thereof or is committed to the doc\u00ad trines of a particular religion and the members of its governing body are ap\u00ad pointed by the controlling religious or\u00ad ganizations or an organ thereof or it receives a significant amount of finan\u00ad cial support from the controlling reli\u00ad gious organization or an organ there\u00ad of. Those seem to me to be flexible, Mr. President. They are understood. Those are words that have been interpreted time in and time out, and I think quite frankly the proof is in the pudding and that is that this has not been an issue which we gave that was raised in a significant way in the course of our hearings. In fairness, the issue was raised over the course of the hearings, but in the consideration, when we talked to and inquired of the various religious groups, even at that time the Catholic Conference reported it; later they adjusted it when the Senate pro\u00ad posal came up. But under the current situation I will include the full list of the groups that support the existing law for the reasons that I have identified.

Mr. President, the provisions of title IX allow partial exemptions to institutions where the provisions of title IX are in conflict with their religious tenets. However, these exemptions are limited to insti\u00ad tutions which are \"controlled by a reli\u00ad gious organization\". I support the pending amendment which would extend this exemption to entities which are \"closely identified\" with the tenets of a religious organiza\u00ad tion. This amendment would permit religiously oriented schools to claim an exemption from a particular title IX regulation on the basis of a conflict between that regulation and its own religious principles. I believe it is important that these institutions retain the religious free\u00ad doms so basic to our Constitution. I, therefore, urge the approval of this amendment. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote against the so-called religious tenets amendment because it expands a current exemption in an ill-defined way. It may be true, as the proponents of this amendment claim, that the cur\u00ad rent criterion for educational institu\u00ad tions to receive an exemption from title IX-that they be \"controlled by a religious organization\" -is too rigorous a standard. It is possible that the nature of educational institutions has changed in such a way over the past few years so that meeting this stand\u00ad ard has become too difficult. However, the solution proposed by those supporting this amendment is too vague. \"Closely identified\" is an undefined phrase which, in my view, contains potential for abuse. If the pre-Gover City standard, as expressed through agency regulations, is no longer appropriate because reli\u00ad giously affiliated educational institu\u00ad tions have changed in some way, regu\u00ad lations can be redrafted to accommo\u00ad date these changes. But the standard that would be applied under this amendment is too broad, and there\u00ad fore I cannot support it. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 2 minutes and 56 sec\u00ad onds. Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the remain\u00ad ing time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. WEICKER. I thank the distin\u00ad guished Senator from Massachusetts. I think he has pointed out statistically what the case is. Again, I want to repeat that the bill as written specifically states that any entity which is controlled by a reli\u00ad gious organization is eligible for an ex\u00ad emption. What the distinguished Senator from Utah is trying to do is expand that to entities that are \"closely iden\u00ad tified with the tenets of a religious or\u00ad ganization.\" This is a Civil Rights Restoration Act. What we are dealing with is the Constitution of the United States and, very frankly, any exemptions that are granted should be very narrow in terms of scope. The Constitution\u00ad that is what prevails in this land; that is what allows every faith to go ahead and practice as they will, but in no wise should it contravene the tenets of the Constitution. In this particular instance, all sorts of untold mischief would occur as to title IX were the amendment to be adopted. I think appropriate consideration has been given to people's religious be\u00ad liefs insofar as an entity is controlled by a religion. But to go ahead and expand it as closely identified with, I can assure you anybody that is in con\u00ad tradiction to the civil rights laws of this Nation is all of a sudden going to find themselves closely identified with one faith or another and the whole purpose of the legislation goes by the boards. So, I would hope that this would be roundly defeated in the sense that it once again reaffirms the Constitution of the United States. This is not a the\u00ad ocracy. This was set up as a democra\u00ad cy. And in order to preserve that free\u00ad dom which attaches to all faiths or no faith, it is essential that we have clear\u00ad cut guidelines and touchstones as to what the rights of every American are, regardless of what our religious beliefs happen to be, and they can vary, and I would hope that the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Utah will be defeated. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut yields the floor. The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been intrigued by the arguments by the proponents of the bill and the op\u00ad ponents of this particular amendment. First of all, Senator STAFFORD indicat\u00ad ed we are just doing a simple overrule of the Grove City decision. The record is well established that we are not just returning to the law as it was prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Grove City .. Look at the language in S. 557 con\u00ad cerning two-tier coverage. Did that exist prior to Grove City? No. And the proponents admit this. Look at the language on small pro\u00ad viders, ultimate beneficiaries of school systems. Was comparable language in existence prior to Grove City? No. S. 557 really does a lot more than put us back where we were right before Grove City. What is unfortu\u00ad nate is that the sponsors are so eager to abridge, curtail, and elimi:r;iate basic fundamental religious rights guaran\u00ad teed in the Constitution in the name of civil rights. So when the distinguished Senator from Connecticut starts telling about the Constitution he ought to look at it and read it and realize that the first amendment provides for religious free\u00ad dom first before all other types of freedoms. We can have other effective civil rights laws and still have the basic right to freedom of the religion. With regard to the Catholic Confer\u00ad ence, I was intrigued with the com\u00ad ments of my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts because I have a letter from Rev. Msgr. Daniel F. Hoy, from the United States Catholic Con\u00ad ference, one paragraph of which says: We also understand that Senator Orrin Hatch will offer an amendment at the re\u00ad quest of the National Association of Inde\u00ad pendent Colleges and Universities, to broad\u00ad en the religious tenets exception. We are sympathetic to their concerns in this area and are supportive of the amendment. Contrary to what the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts said, the Catholic Conference is supportive of this amendment, as I think most reli\u00ad gious institutions are. Finally, let us understand what is in\u00ad volved here. When the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts indicated that there has not been 1 exemption denied, actually of the 215 applied for between 1974 and 1984, there were lit\u00ad erally only 5 exemptions granted and 215 of them ignored. Now, admittedly, since Reagan has taken over, that has changed. But it could go right back to that. And the reason they are ignored is because of, I think, bureaucratic hostility to reli\u00ad gion, and that is what we have to watch out for. Finally, with regard to using this \"controlled by\" language, let me just say this to you: \"Controlled by\" means, as near as we can ascertain, only two schools in this whole country who would fit within that category. The other 200 or 300 schools, in excess of 200 schools, would not be covered. 336 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 Only Brigham Young University and Catholic University would literally be controlled by the religions involved. All the rest of them-Georgetown, Notre Dame, all these others-would not fit within that category and their exemptions would be denied if my amendment does not pass. So I encourage all Members of the Senate to vote for the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The hour of 10:30 having arrived, the question is on agreeing to the Hatch amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CRANSTON. I announce that the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. GORE] is necessarily absent. I also announce that the Senator from Delaware CMr. BIDEN] is absent because of illness. I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennes\u00ad see CMr. GORE], would vote \"nay.\" Mr. SIMPSON. I announce that the Senator from Kansas CMr. DOLE] is necessarily absent. I also announce that the Senator from Alaska [Mr. MURKOWSKI] and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. WALLOP] are absent on official busi\u00ad ness. I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Wyo\u00ad ming CMr. WALLOP] would vote \"yea.\" The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Cham\u00ad ber desiring to vote? The result was announced-yeas 39, nays 56, as follows: Armstrong Bentsen Boren Breaux Cochran D'Amato Danforth Domenici Exon Ford Garn Gramm Grassley Adams Baucus Bingaman Bond Boschwitz Bradley Bumpers Burdick Byrd Chafee Chiles Cohen Conrad Cranston Daschle DeConcini Dixon Dodd [Rollcall Vote No. 7 Leg.] YEAS-39 Hatch McConnell Hatfield Melcher Hecht Nickles Heflin Pressler Helms Quayle Humphrey Roth Johnston Simpson Karnes Stennis Kassebaum Stevens Kasten Symms Lugar Thurmond McCain Trible McClure Warner NAYS-56 Evans Packwood Fowler Pell Glenn Proxmire Graham Pryor Harkin Reid Heinz Riegle Hollings Rockefeller Inouye Rudman Kennedy Sanford Kerry Sar banes Lau ten berg Sasser Leahy Shelby Levin Simon Matsunaga Specter Metzenbaum Stafford Mikulski Weicker Mitchell Wilson Moynihan Wirth Duren berger Nunn Biden Dole NOT VOTING-5 Gore Murkowski Wallop So the amendment <No. 1386) was rejected. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was not agreed to. Mr. STAFFORD. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other amendments? By pre\u00ad vious agreement, the Senator from Connecticut is recognized. AMENDMENT NO. 1393 <Purpose: To clarify that S. 557 is abortion\u00ad neutral) Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be stated. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. WEICKER] for himself and Mr. KENNEDY, Mr. METZENBAUM, and Mr. PACKWOOD, proposes an amendment numbered 1393. At the end of the bill, insert the following new section: ABORTION NEUTRALITY No provision of this Act or any amend\u00ad ment made by this Act shall be construed to force or require any individual or hospital or any other institution , program, or activi\u00ad ty receiving Federal Funds to perform or pay for an abortion. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Connecticut is entitled to be heard. We are making good progress and we want to continue to make progress. This is an important issue. The Senator from Connecticut is entitled to be heard. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, par\u00ad liamentary inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on this amendment? The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered. Mr. WEICKER. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, the amendment before the Senate reaf\u00ad firms that the Civil Rights Restora\u00ad tion Act is neutral with respect to abortion. As the committee report states, and as the sponsors of the bill have consistently maintained, this bill creates no new abortion rights. I note the statement in the committee report on page 26: Title IX does not now require any institu\u00ad tion to perform abortions and no abortions would be mandated if S. 557 were enacted. This bill does not expand abortion rights. Frankly, this amendment should not be necessary. A debate on abortion has no place in a bill which seeks only to define what constitutes \"program or activity\" under the four statutes in question. But, to reassure those who are concerned that our bill will require institutions or hospitals to perform or pay for abortions through their health insurance plans, we off er this amend\u00ad ment. This amendment does not change the substantive language of title IX\u00ad in fact it does not amend title IX. Title IX does not mention abortion now, and we do not alter that. For those religiously controlled insti\u00ad tutions, including hospitals which op\u00ad erate educational programs receiving Federal aid, the exemption in title IX will continue to be available. As every\u00ad one is aware after the debate this morning, that exemption allows such institutions to be exempt from those portions of the title IX regulations which are offensive to their religious tenets. No institution has ever been denied such an exemption. Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment in order that the law be clear and in order to satisfy any doubts relative to this subject matter. Admittedly, it is not the intention of this amendment to go ahead and start redefining and redrafting regulations. That is not the job of this body. But it makes very clear what the law can and cannot do in regard to this matter. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment. Mr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut controls the time. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, I yield such time as the distinguished Senator from Oregon requires. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the vote on this amendment has been ordered at 1 p.m. Therefore, the Senator from Connecti\u00ad cut is in control of 70 minutes and the Senator from Utah is similarly in con\u00ad trol of 70 minutes. Mr. PACKWOOD. After the 1 o'clock vote, may I ask the Chair, will there be further debate time on the Danforth amendment which will be voted on at 2 o'clock? The PRESIDING OFFICER. From the conclusion of the vote which will commence at 1 o'clock until 2 o'clock, the time will be equally divided and will be on the Danforth amendment. Mr. PACKWOOD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, let me address myself to the amendment which has been of\u00ad fered by Senator WEICKER and to the January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 337 argument raised by my good friend from Missouri, Senator DANFORTH. You will recall yesterday Mr. DAN\u00ad FORTH made reference several times to the memorandum of law from the law firm of Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood of what would be the effects of the Civil Rights Restoration Act; whether that act would possibly cause institutions who do not have to perform abortions or pay for abortions currently to have to perform and pay for them under this act. The proponents of the Civil Rights Restoration Act as it came from the committee thought the answer to that was no, that we did not create addi\u00ad tional rights that did not exist before. But a red flag was waved indicating that we were not just returning to in\u00ad stitutionwide coverage, instead of pro\u00ad gram-specific coverage, but that we were also attempting to expand the rights so that institutions that did not approve of abortion would have to per\u00ad form or pay for them. This is the memorandum given to Senator DANFORTH by Dewey, Ballan\u00ad tine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood: This memorandum considered whether proposed amendments to title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 could re\u00ad quire covered institutions to fund or per\u00ad form abortions. Then it goes on: No one can predict with certainty how the pending legislation would be construed in court. Based on our analysis of these factors, we conclude that, if the CRRA is enacted in its present form, Education institutions could be required to fund abortions for students or employees; Hospitals that engage in education activi\u00ad ties or that are affiliated with education in\u00ad stitutions could be required to perform abortions for students or employees; Hospitals could be required to perform abortions for the general public; and Many education institutions and hospitals associated with a religious institution could fail to qualify under the Act's \"religious\" exemption. The amendment of the Senator from Connecticut is very specifically de\u00ad signed, I hope, to answer the \"could\u00ad be\" possibilities in the memorandum from the law firm, to answer the con\u00ad cerns of the Senator from Missouri and others allied with him, that this act could expand the requirement, the compulsion, that certain organizations would have to provide or pay for abor\u00ad tions that do not now. This amendment says nothing in this act shall require them. Mr. President, I do not think there should be any argument about that now as to how does the act read, with the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut. The question really becomes, there\u00ad fore, whether all we are trying to do is to put the law back to where it was prior to Grove City. All of us prior to Grove City felt the law meant institu\u00ad tionwide, that it was not meant pro-gram specific. That surprised us all, Mr. President: President Nixon, Presi\u00ad dent Ford, President Carter, and my hunch it maybe even surprised Presi\u00ad dent Reagan. That is all we were trying to do. Mr. President, I think what the Sen\u00ad ator from Missouri is trying to do is to return the law to something more than existed prior to Grove City. He is not quarreling with institution-wide coverage . He supports, as I under\u00ad stand, institution-wide coverage. The amendment of the Senator from Connecticut will take care of the prob\u00ad lem about whether this act compels abortions. Mr. President, I think what the Sen\u00ad ator from Missouri wants to do is to change the interpretation of the law that might possibly follow from the regulations in place long before Grove City. These regulations were promul\u00ad gated by them Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Caspar Wein\u00ad berger in 1975. They all came out si\u00ad multaneously; they all in one form or another relate to sexual discrimina\u00ad tion; they all have some abortion lan\u00ad guage in them-termination of preg\u00ad nancy, as it is called in the regulations. Many of those regulations have never been tested in the court. That was the state of law prior to Grove City. If we want to go back and undo the state of law prior to Grove City, that, I think, is what the Senator from Mis\u00ad souri wants. He would make the argu\u00ad ment that those old regulations that have now been in place for 12 or 13 years have never been tested and he does not want them tested. He wants right now, by law, to simply cut them off and reverse any possibility that they might be tested in the courts and come out adverse to the position of the Senator from Missouri. That is a fair argument. I under\u00ad stand that argument. I do not agree with it. I do not want to achieve the same end that he wants to achieve, but I understand his argument. I think it is fair, however, for every\u00ad one to understand in the Senate what it is he wants to do. Whether it is the Senator from Utah, the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from Massa\u00ad chusetts, or myself, or Senator DAN\u00ad FORTH, we have all argued we do not want to change anything in the law other than reverse Grove City's insti\u00ad tutionwide versus narrow interpreta\u00ad tion. We all say that is all we want to do. I would posit that the Senator from Missouri wants to change much more than that, and to the extent that we are trying to narrowly confine this bill to one purpose, one purpose, and that is to reverse Grove City's very narrow definition of \"program or activity,\" I think he has to admit that he wants to go beyond that and prohibit any court interpretations of 13-year-old regula-tions that might conflict with his posi\u00ad tion. That is the issue we should be argu\u00ad ing. We should not be arguing abor\u00ad tion here at all. We should be arguing whether or not we want to in any way expand substantive rights, substantive rights, not the issue of institutionwide versus narrow. We should be arguing whether or not we want to expand, re\u00ad strict, or in any way change substan\u00ad tive rights under title IX and any reg\u00ad ulations that have been issued there\u00ad under. For the sake of simplicity, for the sake of doing as little as possible other than correcting Grove City, all of us at least on my side have tried to make sure honestly that we were not ex\u00ad panding any rights. Heaven knows, those opposed have tried to make sure that we were not doing anything beyond retaining present rights. There is no question but what the amend\u00ad ment of the Senator from Connecticut makes sure, absolutely makes sure, that there is nothing in the Civil Rights Restoration Act that expands abortion rights. That is clear beyond any doubt. So when we come to vote on the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut, I do not know why anyone in this body would vote no, whether or not they share Senator DANFORTH's position or do not; at least this amendment absolutely guarantees that the Civil Rights Restoration Act does not expand abortion rights. We can then get to the debate on the amendment of the Senator from Missouri, Senator DANFORTH, as to whether we want to pass a law that will change substantive rights and make the substantive law something different-the substantive law some\u00ad thing different-than it was prior to Grove City. That is fair debate. But all of us, including opponents and propo\u00ad nents of this act, including proponents and opponents of the Danforth amendment, have said we do not want to change the substantive law. If the Senator from Missouri wants to, he is so entitled. He has a fair argument on his side. But we should all understand that we are then opening up a crack, the issue of changing the substantive law. Rather than all of us trying to say let us not change the law at all, we are then in a position to say, well, if we are going to change what the law was, not just the institutionwide versus \"program or activity,\" narrow coverage, then we all might have a lot of amendments that we would like to offer to either restrict or expand title IX, to restrict or expand the other three principal civil rights acts in areas where at least in my judgment we have not expanded coverage far enough. But I am willing to put that aside for another time. So I would hope that by a unani\u00ad mous vote the amendment of the Sen-338 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 ator from Connecticut would pass, and then I would hope that this Senate would say, \"There, that takes care of the subject of abortion; there is noth\u00ad ing in this act now that is going to chang~ any abortion rights,\" and then let us focus on whether or not we want to change the substantive law in any way, substantive law as it existed prior to Grove City; I hope we do not. I strongly support the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut. I hope it passes overwhelmingly and that we subsequently def eat the amendment of the Senator from Missouri. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? . Mr. DANFORTH addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri. Mr. HATCH. I yield such time as the Senator from Missouri may need. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, the question is one of substantive law. I do not think there is any doubt about that. The question is, Where will the substantive law be going after Con\u00ad gress acts on the Civil Rights Restora\u00ad tion Act? The concern that has been expressed by the Senator from Mis\u00ad souri is that if we pass the Civil Rights Restoration Act without the Danforth amendment, the result will be that we will open the door to court decisions or to administrative regulations which will have effects which I think most of us in Congress would believe to be out\u00ad rageous. The issue is whether we want to open the possibility, a very real pos\u00ad sibility according to legal opinion which I have, that a court decision could hold, for example, that a hospi\u00ad tal affiliated with a Catholic universi\u00ad ty must perform abortions or that, for example, Notre Dame University must cover abortions under its health plan. That is the substantive law issue. It does not have anything to do with the timing of regulations. It does not have to do with what was done in 1975. The law as of right now is, as I understand it, that medical schools and hospitals are not required to perform abortions if it is contrary to their conscience. They are not now required to do that. The issue is, Could they be required to do that in the future? That is the question before us. Now, that question is not something that just popped out of the head of the Senator from Missouri. I did not wake up some morning and say, \"By golly, we are about ready to pass some\u00ad thing called the Civil Rights Restora\u00ad tion Act which could force Notre Dame University to provide for abor\u00ad tion coverage under their health plan or could require Georgetown Universi\u00ad ty Hospital or Baylor University Hos\u00ad pital to perform abortions.\" That is not something that I dreamed up. That is something that was presented to me by the American Hospital Asso\u00ad ciation, which supports the Danforth amendment, by the Catholic Health Association, which supports the Dan\u00ad forth amendment. So I sought legal opinion. I sought the opinion of coun\u00ad sel. I called the Dewey, Ballantine law firm, one of the great law firms of this country, and I asked them for a legal opinion. I have copies of that legal opinion. Any Senator, any staff person is welcome to see it. The legal opinion said that, yes, as a matter of fact, the combination of title IX plus regula\u00ad tions that have been promulgated under title IX, plus the Civil Rights Restoration Act could be construed by a court or by an administrative agency to require colleges, universities, hospi\u00ad tals to provide insurance coverage for abortions under their health plans and could be construed by a court or by an administrative agency to require the actual performance of abortions on students, on staff, on faculty members, and even on the general public. Now, what is the present state of the law? When Congress passed title IX of the education amendments back in 1972, clearly Congress did not pass a law by which we intended to mandate the funding or the performance of abortions by people who did not want to fund or perform abortions. We did not intend that in 1972. I am sure it was not even thought about in 1972 because Roe versus Wade was not de\u00ad cided until a year later. The glitch comes when title IX is embellished by a regulation of the De\u00ad partment of Health, Education, and Welfare equated sex discrimination with denial of abortion coverage, and further, with the Civil Rights Restora\u00ad tion Act which expands the coverage of title IX to include hospitals, even hospitals that are not related to a uni\u00ad versity or to a medical school. If they have any kind of education programs such as nurses education, they would be included by this bill and which ex\u00ad pands institutionwide the coverage of title IX. That was the opinion that I sought from the Dewey, Ballantine law firm. They said yes, a court could so decide. Now we come to the events of today. We are going to have two amendments to vote on. Under the agreement that we have entered into, no matter what happens to the Weicker-Kennedy\u00ad Metzenbaum-Packwood amendment, we will have to vote on my amendment which will provide notwithstanding anything else in the bill, and so on that my amendment prevails. So we will have two votes. We had a big hassle which lasted about 7 or 8 hours yesterday on the floor of the Senate as to who goes first. I obviously wanted to go first with my vote. I could not do it. But why was that so important to the other side? It was so important to the other side because they wanted to create an initial vote which was a shell, which created a plausible argu\u00ad ment that it was doing something so that people could get political cover by voting for their amendment and then vote against the Danforth amend\u00ad ment. So that Metzenbaum-Kennedy\u00ad Weicker-Packwood amendment is a blank. It is a zero. It does not do any\u00ad thing as a matter of law. It appears to do something as a matter of law, but it does not do a thing. Again, I am not relying on JACK DAN\u00ad FORTH's analysis for saying that it has no legal effect. I again have sought the opinion of counsel. I am going to read into the RECORD the analysis of the Dewey, Ballantine law firm. Here is what they say in an opinion letter that is written to me dated January 27. DEAR SENATOR DANFORTH: This letter fol\u00ad lows up on our letter of January 21, 1988, and an accompanying memorandum on the Civil Rights Restoration Act and the Obli\u00ad gation to Fund or Perform Aborations. You have asked for our opinion on an amendment to the Civil Rights Restoration Act that has been introduced by Senators Kennedy and Metzenbaum as an alternative means of addressing the problem discussed in our earlier memorandum. This amend\u00ad ment reads as follows: Then Dewey, Ballantine sets forth the text of the pending amendment. Then the letter goes on: Based on our review of this proposed amendment, we conclude that it would not solve the problem identified in our earlier memorandum. The proposed amendment declares that the Civils Rights Restoration Act itself does not require the funding or performance of abortions. It is silent, how\u00ad ever, on the possibility-which was the sub\u00ad ject of our earlier letter and memorandum\u00ad that Title IX and regulations promulgated under its authority could require the fund\u00ad ing or performance of abortions. Moreover, since the Civil Rights Restora\u00ad tion Act would overturn the Supreme Court's decision in the Grove City case and thus extend the reach of Title IX, the danger would remain, despite the proposed amendment, that institutions newly brought under the authority of Title IX would also be required to fund or perform abortions for students, employees and even the general public, as described in our earli\u00ad er letter and memorandum. The letter is signed by Dewey, Bal\u00ad lantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood, by J. Paul McGrath who served this country as Assistant Attorney Gener\u00ad al. Here is the opinion of the Justice Department in a letter signed by John R. Bolton, Assistant Attorney General, dated today. DEAR SENATOR DANFORTH: This letter will advise you of the views of the Department of Justice concerning an amendment to S. 557 offered by Senators Edward Kennedy and Lowell W eicker concerning abortion. Then they set forth the text of the amendment which is now pending. The letter continues: January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 339 It is clear that this amendment will do nothing to address the abortion issue raised by S. 557, in light of the enforcement of Title IX under binding agency regulations, as analyzed in our January 25, 1988 bill comment on S. 557. This amendment merely purports to state that S. 557 itself does not require payment for, or performance of, abortions. The cur\u00ad rent pro-abortion Title IX regulations are left in place and fully enforceable by this amendment. Moreover, the underlying bill, S. 557, expands the reach of these regula\u00ad tions, with the continuing result that hospi\u00ad tals \u00b7operating an education program and which receive federal financial assistance will be compelled to perform abortions on demand to the public. Even on its own terms, the language is wholly inadequate: it does not preclude a hospital from being forced to provide the use of its facilities and services to doctors for the performance of abortions. In order to render Title IX abortion neu\u00ad tral, Title IX itself must be amended. The language you are offering is the most appro\u00ad priate and effective way to achieve that e~\u00ad sential goal. I ask unanimous consent that copies of the two opinion letters from Dewey, Ballantine and the Justice Depart\u00ad ment be printed in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the mate\u00ad rial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: DEWEY, BALLANTINE, BUSHY, PALMER & Woon, JANUARY 27, 1988. Hon. JOHN c. DANFORTH, U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS, Washington, DC, January 28, 1988. Hon. JOHN c. DANFORTH, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEAR SENATOR DANFORTH: This letter will advise you of the views of the Department of Justice concerning an amendment to S. 557 offered by Senators Edward Kennedy and Lowell Weicker concerning abortion. We understand this amendment reads as follows: \"No provision of this Act or any amend\u00ad ment made by this Act shall be construed to force or require any individual or hospital or any other institution, program, or activi\u00ad ty receiving federal funds to perform or pay for an abortion:\" It is clear that this amendment will do nothing to address the abortion issue raised by S. 557, in light of the enforcement of Title IX under binding agency regulations, as analyzed in our January 25, 1988 bill comment on S. 557.

In order to render Title IX abortion neu\u00ad tral, Title XI itself must be amended. The language you are offering is the most appro\u00ad priate and effective way to achieve that es\u00ad sential goal. Sincerely, JOHN R. BOLTON, Assistant Attorney General. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, again, the question before us is not the timing of when a result is brought to pass but rather what result could occur in a court decision in the future. I would suggest that the Weicker\u00ad Packwood-Metzenbaum-Kennedy amendment is not in fact abortion neutral, that the effect of our enact\u00ad ing the Civil Rights Restoration Act without the Danforth amendment would be that the Congress of the United States would reaffirm title IX and the regulations thereunder which equate the refusal to provide abortions with sex discrimination, and that fur\u00ad ther enactment of this legislation, even with this Kennedy-Metzenbaum\u00ad Weicker-Packwood amendment, would extend title IX coverage to institution\u00ad wide coverage and to hospitals that have any kind of educational compo\u00ad nent, whether or not affiliated with a university. I think that the Ci'vil Rights Resto\u00ad ration Act would not preserve the status quo on the question of abor\u00ad tions in these institutions but instead would invite prospective court cases which I predict will occur throughout this country should this act be passed without the Danforth amendment. So, again, Mr. President, I cannot emphasize too much that the real issue before us has to do with whether or not we in the U.S. Senate really want to require Notre Dame Universi\u00ad ty to provide abortion coverage under its health plan, Georgetown Universi\u00ad ty to provide.abortions at its hospitals. That is the real question before us. That is the possibility that has been pointed out by Dewey, Ballantine, by the Justice Department, by the Ameri\u00ad can Hospital Association, by the Catholic Health Association, not just by JACK DANFORTH. I think it is a very, very serious matter. I think it is a very serious matter. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, first, as was eloquently pointed out by the distinguished Senator from Oregon [Mr. PACKWOOD], and to bring the ar\u00ad gument back to the amendment before us, we are not debating the Danforth amendment now. We are debating the Civil Rights Restoration Act. We are debating the Weicker-Packwood-Ken\u00ad nedy-Metzenbaum amendment. I ask the distinguished Senator from Missouri whether he feels that the amendment before us in any way di\u00ad minishes the substance of his amend\u00ad ment or, in effect, does anything other than strengthen his contention so far as the law is concerned. In other words, would it not be possible to go ahead and adopt both this amendment and his amendment, if that was the will of the Senate? Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, re\u00ad sponding to that question, I view the Weicker-Metzenbaum-Kennedy\u00ad Packwood amendment as being very similar to a motion to instruct the Ser\u00ad geant at Arms. It is a legal blank. It has no legal consequence. It does not address the issue that has been raised by my amendment, and that is the opinion of the Justice Department and that is the opinion of the Dewey, Bal\u00ad lantine law firm. I think the purpose of offering this Weicker-Metzenbaum amendment at this time is not to have a legal conse\u00ad quence but an attempt to provide po\u00ad litical cover to Senators who want to vote for something and for some reason do not want to vote for my amendment. It has no legal conse\u00ad quence. It is designed as a fig leaf. I suggest that it is a very small fig leaf, a transparent fig leaf, and it does not provide any cover at all for Senators who are seeking cover. Mr. WEICKER. So, therefore, to paraphrase the consequence enunci\u00ad ated by the distinguished Senator 340 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 from Missouri, there is no reason why anybody should not vote for the amendment, because it has no conse\u00ad quence. Mr. DANFORTH. I suggest that the reason for voting against it is to simply state by your vote that this is a hoax, it is a sham, it is a nothing, and that a Senator is not going to address a very significant issue of whether in\u00ad stitutions that have moral concerns about abortions should be farced to perform abortions; that we are not going to address that very serious con\u00ad cern by voting on an amendment that has no consequence at all. Mr. WEICKER. To address the last point of the distinguished Senator from Missouri first, let me make two points. Title IX applies only to students and employees. It is incorrect that the reach of title IX could ever reach the general public. So the Senator's con\u00ad tention that title IX can force hospi\u00ad tals to perform abortions for the gen\u00ad eral public is false. Second, hospitals which have a fed\u00ad erally assisted education program do come under the reach of title IX; and to the extent that they are religiously controlled, they can receive an exemp\u00ad tion. So let us do away with the fact that anybody is going to be forced to per\u00ad form abortions on the public. That is not the case. Let me address, if I can, several of the matters that have been raised in the very articulate presentation by the distinguished Senator from Missouri. I appreciate getting letters from the Department of Justice, except that I think one has to consider, in terms of the substance of those letters, the source. First, this Justice Department, has been opposed to the Civil Rights Res\u00ad toration Act since the matter was first raised. They are against the act, period. This is the Justice Department that commended the court when Grove City was handed down. So, clearly, this administration, this Justice Department, is going to do ev\u00ad erything it can to impede the progress of the Civil Rights Restoration Act or, indeed, if it does progress, to so shape it to the inclinations of this Justice Department and this administration. Would that this Justice Department had strong feelings on behalf of the retarded and the protection of their rights, and of women and their rights, and of blacks and their rights, and of the elderly and their rights. Enforce\u00ad ment has been notably lacking by this Justice Department in all these areas; and when they come up on the subject of abortion, this is, I suppose, one of the principal comments we have heard from the Justice Department relative to Grove City or the Civil Rights Res\u00ad toration Act. So, consider the source. I should like a copy of the letter from the Justice Department. The point being made here is that the Justice Department says in their letter, and I want to now use their letter: It is clear that this amendment will do nothing to address the abortion issue raised by S. 557, in light of the enforcement of Title IX under binding agency regulations, as analyzed in our January 25, 1988 bill comment on S. 557. Has it occurred to anybody that here is the administration that controls the regulations in their Departments of Education and Health and Human Services? This is the Justice Depart\u00ad ment commenting on regulations. Reg\u00ad ulations are written by the executive branch of Government. If they want the regulations changed, they can change the regulations. This, more than anything else, I think unmasks what is going on out there. This is just another in the long series of abortion amendments tacked onto every bill that comes down the pike. If it is regulations that bother the administration, and obviously the administration is bothered, as evi\u00ad denced by this letter from the Justice Department, it can change the regula\u00ad tions. It does not need the Danforth amendment. Again, consider the source: A Justice Department which has done every\u00ad thing under the Sun not to enforce the civil rights legislation that is on the books and which cheered Grove City and has consistently been op\u00ad posed to the Civil Rights Restoration Act. So I am delighted that this is going to be passed among my col\u00ad leagues. But, No. l, consider the source; and, No. 2, the source says that it is the regulations that are going to be affected, regulations which in themselves can be changed by the ex\u00ad ecutive agencies of this administra\u00ad tion. Do you think it can change regu\u00ad lations? Do any of my colleagues have in the recesses of their memory a recent change of regulations by the adminis\u00ad tration in this general area? Does my friend from Missouri have any reaction that this same adminis\u00ad tration which cannot change title IX regulations has changed title X regu\u00ad lations when it comes to family plan\u00ad ning? That is exactly what they have done: change the regulations . So this really is not an issue, is it? Here is the hoax. Here is the smoke\u00ad screen. In dragging the regulatory ar\u00ad gument out here as if remedy were not available to those who complain, they could change those regulations, as indeed they have changed title X. The third point is the legal memo\u00ad randum from Dewey, Ballantine. I cer\u00ad tainly hope that not a great amount of money was expended on that opinion, because all Dewey, Ballantine said is that courts could do this. As pointed out by the distinguished Senator from Oregon, they could do this, they could do that. Courts can do anything. I have not been practicing law since I have been in the U.S. Senate, but as I said, I could issue an opinion like that myself when I was in my general practice days as a young man in Greenwich, CT. Obviously, courts can do anything. There is nothing very definitive about this great memorandum except courts could do this or could do that. If indeed the concern of the U.S. Senate is the law that we are about to pass here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, if that is the concern, and that the law reflects title IX before Grove City, then most assuredly this Pack\u00ad wood-Kennedy-Metzenbaum-Weicker amendment gives the assurance the law will not be changed. I am not in the position here on the floor of the U.S. Senate nor are any of my colleagues, to say what the various executive agencies can or cannot do by virtue of regulation. Why is it, as I say, that they can go ahead and change title X by regula\u00ad tion, but we cannot do anything with title IX? Of course they can. But the larger purpose very frankly is another abortion amendment to chip away at Roe versus Wade. That is what this is. The law, I repeat, as it now is situat\u00ad ed does not force religiously controlled hospitals to perform abortions. It does not. And that contention is entirely false both as to how title IX is applica\u00ad ble, because it is applicable to students and employees only and does not apply to the general public. Exemp\u00ad tions can be granted to those religious\u00ad ly controlled institutions, and we have just been through that argument. If this body wishes, they can pass these two different amendments and they will achieve two different results. The Weicker amendment, if passed, will guarantee no change in the law vis-a-vis abortion. The Danforth amendment, if passed, will radically change the law by re\u00ad pealing the executive branch's regula\u00ad tions. So those who have been arguing for no change are the perpetrators of change. And maybe that is what the body wants. I do not. I disagree with the Danforth amend\u00ad ment. I have given my word that we should pass something that brings us back to the status quo. But a vote for the Weicker amend\u00ad ment has a consequence. It clarifies the law and subsequent memorandums from Dewey, Ballantine, Palmer, Bushby & Wood, a fine law firm, to the contrary notwithstanding. All that they say in their second memorandum is that this amendment which rein\u00ad forces the law will not change execu\u00ad tive regulations. Big deal. They did not January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 341 have to write a memorandum to tell me that. Their other great conclusion in the first memorandum is that it could be interpreted by court to say such and such. Very frankly, if I hire a law firm I would like a little more precise, de\u00ad finitive answer than that. But in any event, I would hope the body would adopt this amendment. If you want to have it both ways, you can have it both ways. I do not advo\u00ad cate that is what we ought to do be\u00ad cause one proposes a radical change from the present regulatory stance, which can be accomplished by an ad\u00ad ministration that somehow has failed to do that. But if you really want to put it on ice then go ahead and pass this amendment, and you can also go ahead and pass the Danforth amend\u00ad ment which I will oppose for some of the reasons I have described here. I also recognize the fact that has been validly raised by the distinguished Senator from Missouri that there might be those who vote for this amendment would not want to vote for his amendment, but nobody is asking for any cover. Nobody is asking for any cover. What we want is a Civil Rights Res\u00ad toration Act passed, with the rights of women, the elderly, the retarded, and minorities to be fully protected by the force of the Federal Government, and a cessation of subsidized discrimina\u00ad tion in this Nation. That is the issue before us. And as I said on the Rupert Mur\u00ad dock amendment and all others that have come along here, these people have been waiting in line and I think these abortion amendments are get\u00ad ting a little tiresome. Regardless of the vestments in which they are pa\u00ad raded on the floor of the U.S. Senate, they come down to the basic bottom line: Let us do something to legisla\u00ad tively change the decision in Roe versus Wade. That is what it all comes down to. There is no basis in the present law to justify the Danforth amendment. As I said in my opening statement, there is nothing in the present law to justify a Weicker amendment. It is al\u00ad ready the law. But to allay fears, the amendment is presented to this body. And I hope it would be adopted. I hope this amendment, as every other extraneous piece of legislation that is going to be heaped on this bill, will be rejected. All we should do is to reaffirm what we meant in the first place, that the civil rights laws of this Nation are to be enforced with all the power at our command and that means if you discriminate you do not get taxpayer money, period. I am sorry that we continue to be di\u00ad verted from what this bill is about, to once again get into arguments on abortion. I have been told, I might add, that we have school prayer wait\u00ad ing in the wings, and probably AIDS amendments, et cetera. I thought that maybe for once some\u00ad thing that was magnificent in its ideals, such as the underlying legisla\u00ad tion, would have its day before the U.S. Senate and not be sullied by the extraneous. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER . Who yields time? The Senator from Florida. Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, will the Senator from Connecticut yield for a question? Mr. WEICKER. Of course I will yield for a question. Mr. GRAHAM. I want to be clear as to what the effect of this amendment as well as the amendment that is being offered by the Senator from Missouri would have on the regulations that were adopted in 1975 or others that might be proposed at a future date. Recognizing the basic legal principle that a regulation must be consistent with and based upon statutory author\u00ad ity, what effect, in the Senator's opin\u00ad ion, would the adoption of the amend\u00ad ment he has proposed have on the statutory authority which is the basis upon which the 1975 regulations are predicated? Mr. WEICKER. I think my answer to you is it would have really no affect at all because we interpret the law as being very clear on that point as the law is now written. This is in response to the request of those who feel the law is not clear. So we have restated in this amendment what the law already is. Mr. GRAHAM. So it is your position that the law as it existed prior to 1975 provided a sufficient statutory basis for the regulations that were adopted and that the effect of adopting your amendment would not alter that stat\u00ad utory basis for the 1975 regulations? Mr. WEICKER. It would not alter the statutory basis and it would not alter the regulations. And the Dan\u00ad forth amendment would or could, as interpreted by Dewey. Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood, alter the regulations. Mr. GRAHAM. Could you give me your basis of that distinction between the Weicker amendment and the Dan\u00ad forth amendment to determine the effect on the statutory basis for the 1975 regulations? Why would your amendment not affect the statutory basis and the Senator from Missouri's would have that effect? Mr. WEICKER. Well, I will let the Senator from Missouri explain how he is reaching into the regulations. I think that is really for him to explain because it is his amendment. Again, all I have done is to restate the law in this amendment. It is simple. I have to repeat to the distin-guished Senator from Florida that my amendment is superfluous to the law as presently written, but it is present\u00ad ed to this body since there are those that have said the Civil Rights Resto\u00ad ration Act gives additional abortion discretion that did not exist in the law before. So in order to reemphasize that that is exactly what we are not doing, we present this amendment, and we say so again in the year 1988. It does no more than that. Mr. GRAHAM. The concern I have is that when a court does come to the interpretation of the 1975 regulations, one of the questions is going to be: Is there statutory authority to adopt a regulation which purports to say that an institution which receives Federal funds must provide in advance its com\u00ad prehensive health insurance program for payment of termination of preg\u00ad nancy? Then, looking at the language which you are now offering, it would appear that a reading of this language would be that that statutory authority of such regulations has been eliminat\u00ad ed. Your answer indicates that you do not think that that statutory author\u00ad ity upon which the regulation would be premised is eliminated by the adop\u00ad tion of your amendment. Mr. WEICKER. No, because I am not in any way addressing the regula\u00ad tions. Mr. GRAHAM. I know you are not addressing the regulations directly, but I am talking about the foundation upon which the regulations have to be based, which is statutory authority. You cannot have a regulation unless there is a statutory basis. Mr. WEICKER. It is a reaffirmation of that statutory authority. No more. I think maybe what is in the back of the mind of the distinguished Senator from Florida-correct me if I am wrong, because I do not mean to go ahead and put words in your mouth\u00ad is, does enactment of this amendment retroactively approve of the regula\u00ad tions that were enacted back then? If that is the question, I do not think it accomplishes that either. I still think it is open to court interpretation. I do not think anything we do here in any way changes the law as it was or the regulatory interpretation of that law. The next amendment clearly does. There is no question about that. We have merely tried to respond to those that have a doubt that we are expanding abortion rights under this legislation, and we tried to assure them by restating that such is not the case. I would yield to my distinguished colleague from Oregon to see whether or not he concurs or has additional re\u00ad marks. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, who has the floor? Mr. WEICKER . I have the floor. Mr. DANFORTH . Who has the floor? 342 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has the floor. Mr. WEICKER. I will be glad to yield, incidentally. Mr. DANFORTH. I was just going to address the question. Mr. WEICKER. I will yield for that purpose after I yield to the Senator from Oregon. Mr. PACKWOOD. I am going to try to address the question because I am not quite sure what you are driving at. Let me ask the Senator from Florida: You are familiar with the argument that both sides seem to make on this that what we want to do is simply go back to the status quo prior to Grove ci.ty. Mr. GRAHAM. I might say, I am not interested or persuaded by that issue. I am interested in finding out the answer to this . question: Someone must have assumed in 1975 that there was a statutory basis upon which the regulations were adopted. Mr. PACKWOOD. I think, then, I can answer the question. Mr. GRAHAM. My question is: As\u00ad suming that was a correct position and that, if challenged in 1975, the regula\u00ad tions would have been sustained, what effect would this amendment have on that statutory basis for the 1975 regu\u00ad lations and what effect would the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri have on that statutory basis? Mr. PACKWOOD. The amendment of the Senator from Connecticut would have no effect, because it says nothing in this act, the Civil Rights Act, shall in any way deny, prohibit, compel abortions. It does not attempt to reinterpret title IX in 1972. It does not attempt to reinterpret the regula\u00ad tions of how a court might pass on those regulations. It simply says, noth\u00ad ing in this act shall in any way give any preference to a court decision for or against abortion. But I think I can answer it this way: I understand what you are saying. I do not know what side you want to come out on, but I think I can explain why we are in the situation we are in. Let us take the sequence: 1972, the education amendments are passed, in\u00ad cluding title IX; 1973 is Roe versus Wade is decided; 1975, the regulations are issued by then-Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Caspar Weinberger, based upon the 1972 act. And there is a variety of reg\u00ad ulations in it. There was relatively little court action involving the sub\u00ad ject of abortion under those regula\u00ad tions, relatively little. But there was no question-now, I will move off this subject for a moment-there was no question but what Congress and the courts, up until the Supreme Court in Grove City, as\u00ad sumed that whatever these regulations related to were institutionwide. And the words \"program \u00b7or activity\" appear in the four key civil rights acts that are in the law. And I would just go through a variety of decisions, and where I say State, it is the district court, and where I say circuit, it is the circuit court. California; the District of Columbia, Fifth Circuit; South Carolina; 10th Circuit; 5th Jersey; New we had cases coming from all over the coun\u00ad try, all of which interpreted the term \"program or activity\" to be institu\u00ad tionwide. No one in this Congress thought it meant anything different. We were all thunderstruck when the Supreme Court came out and said Grove City means program specific. And not only was that not even a con\u00ad test in Congress when we debated this issue 3 years ago, the issue of going back to institutionwide coverage was not even an issue. This act died 2112 years ago, excuse me, but it did not die over that issue. What you have from 1972 on, actually from 1964 onward, with the Civil Rights Act, was an assumption that coverage was institutionwide. In title IX, it says you cannot dis\u00ad criminate in education on the basis of sex and you cannot discriminate insti\u00ad tutionwide. In 1975, come the regula\u00ad tions that are a point of contest, and they set out certain things, including termination of pregnancy under title IX, we presume institutionwide. If Congress ever presumed institution\u00ad wide and if we had meant program specific, we would have changed the law long ago based on all these court decisions. Now we come to the Civil Rights Act and here is what the Senator from Missouri wants to change. He does not quarrel with institutionwide coverage. We are not making any change that might not have happened absent Grove City, because I want to empha\u00ad size again-I think the Senator from Missouri agrees and I see the Senator from New Mexico nodding-we pre\u00ad sumed institutionwide. Whatever prob\u00ad lems he might have had with abortion existed before the Grove City case. They exist after the Grove City case. And he wants to change the statutory basis, the 1972 statutory basis, to make sure the 1975 regulations cannot be used to achieve an end involving abortion that he does not like. Now, I think I make the argument fairly for what he wants to do. For the bulk of the rest of us, we thought this exercise was to simply put the law back to where we thought it was. He could be offering this amendment, and I think would be offering this amend\u00ad ment, whether or not there was a Civil Rights Restoration Act on the floor or whether or not the Grove City case had ever been decided. And he wants to change title IX and the authority that the regulations now might give some court-might give, because it has not been interpreted-to reach a con\u00ad clusion that he does not want. I am ready to yield the floor unless the Senator from Florida has another question. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. HATCH. I would be delighted to yield response time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri. \u00b7 Mr. DURENBERGER. Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, I think the Senator from Florida has focused precisely on what the question is. The question is whether the law is written in such a way as to allow administrative agencies or the courts to decide that it mandates either the funding or the performance of abortions. Now, that really is the underlying question. It does not have to do with what happened in 1972 or 1973 or 1975. The question is: Do you believe that the refusal to fund or pro\u00ad vide abortions constitutes sex discrimi\u00ad nation triggering title IX on an insti\u00ad tutionwide basis and including hospi\u00ad tals? Now, that really is the substan\u00ad tive issue before us. If you will look at the committee report on your desk on page 2, under \"Purpose\" the last paragraph, \"The purpose of the Civil Rights Restora\u00ad tion Act of 1987 is to reaffirm the pre\u00ad Grove City College judicial and execu\u00ad tive branch interpretations and en\u00ad forcement practices.\" To reaffirm the regulations. Without the Danforth amendment, we are voting to reaffirm the regulations pre-Grove City. Those regulations equated the refusal to fund or provide abortions with sex dis\u00ad crimination. The belief of the Dewey, Ballantine law firm and the Justice Department and the American Hospital Association is that if we pass this law reaffirming those regulations, the effect of it would be to broaden the instances in which a lawsuit could successfully be filed against an institution to mandate it to fund or to perform abortions. That is the question. Do you want to open up the possibil\u00ad ity that a court or an administrative agency can do that? Or, instead, do we in the Congress want to say no court and no administrative agency is going to be able to read the law in a way to force people to either fund or perform abortions when they do not want to do it. It does not have anything to with Roe versus Wade. Roe versus Wade is the question of a woman's rights to an abortion. There is a difference of opin\u00ad ion on Roe versus Wade. This has nothing to do with Roe versus Wade. It is not an attempt to chip away at Roe versus Wade. The difference is, on one hand the woman's right to an \u00b7abortion; on the other hand, whether title IX can be January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 343 used as a way to force institutions to either fund or to provide them. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is crit\u00ad ical that my colleagues recognize that the Weicker-Kennedy-Metzenbaum\u00ad Packwood amendment is nothing but an empty shell. This particular amend\u00ad ment states only that the act, S. 557, shall not be interpreted to require in\u00ad dividuals or institutions to perform or pay for abortions. But, as the distin\u00ad guished Senator from Missouri has so cogently stated, it is the existing regu\u00ad lations under title IX that must be ad\u00ad dressed. S. 557 does, in fact, broaden the coverage of title IX and, conse\u00ad quently, S. 557 expands the coverage of the abortion regulations. You cannot read the bill without recognizing it expands the law as it ex\u00ad isted 1 day before Grove City. But it is the application of the regulations under title IX that must be changed and only the Danforth amendment brings about that change. That is a fact. Mr. WEICKER. Would the distin\u00ad guished Senator yield for just one question? Mr. HATCH. I would be delighted. Mr. WEICKER. The distinguished Senator from Utah-I thank him for yielding for a question-sees only the Danforth amendment. Mr. HATCH. That is right. Mr. WEICKER. Does the distin\u00ad guished Senator from Utah agree that the regulations could be changed by the executive agency itself? Mr. HATCH. The answer to that is the agency might change them, but there will be instant litigation to reen\u00ad f orce them, and we do not know what would happen. But also, the second answer to that is, not only may the agency change them, but a subsequent administration may harden them or make them more difficult. So the fact that we have regulations in existence does not necessarily stop them from being changed one way or the other, and it does not change the litigation that would ensure that would reenforce them. I call to the attention of the distin\u00ad guished Senator from Connecticut, my friend, his comments made before the committee, which I thought were unique. Let me do that in just a second, but let me just say this: Danforth solves this problem. It is an abortion-neutral amendment. It seems to me that it is a fair amendment. It does not impose Roe versus Wade on anybody nor does it stop Roe versus Wade from hav\u00ad ing its full force and effect. In short, if the Weicker -Kennedy -Packwood - Metzenbaum amendment passes, then colleges, hospitals, State government agencies and others would be forced to pay for or perform abortions. Only the Danforth amendment corrects this gross inconsistency under Federal law, whereby the Federal Government re\u00ad fuses to fund abortions. Under the Hyde amendment, the Federal Government refuses to fund abortions, but under this bill as it is written now, colleges, hospitals, and others will be forced to fund or per\u00ad form abortions. This is an important thing. Let me just say in that regard, when we debated this matter before the committee, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, my friend and a person for whom I have a great deal of respect, he said this. Just for the RECORD I will state: If you take Federal funds, you cannot deny a person an abortion. The reason why you cannot deny a person an abortion is it is legal in the United States of America. The reason why it is legal is we do not run the Nation by virtue of our individual con\u00ad sciences. We run by virtue of the constitu\u00ad tional system. That is the answer, pure and simple. And it is not going to change. The fact is-- This is the distinguished Senator from Connecticut-- The fact is that the law of the United States of America says that abortion in cer\u00ad tain circumstances is legal. Period. That is it ... that is exactly what the law states ... I just repeat, so that it is relatively simple, that if someone wants to take Federal funds that you cannot deny the rights of a person under the law. That is it. This in no way im\u00ad pinges upon your individual conscience as I said before . Senator HUMPHREY then said: \"Will the Senator yield for a question?\" Does the Senator wish to require Catholic University to perform abor\u00ad tions?\" It probably would have been better for him to have used Notre Dame Uni\u00ad versity, so let us substitute Notre Dame. Senator WEICKER said: \"No, I cer\u00ad tainly do not want ty\"-or in this case Notre Dame Uni\u00ad versity-\"to be required to perform them. The fact is that if Catholic Uni\u00ad versity wants to take Federal funds, they cannot deny-they are not forced to perform them, but they cannot deny an abortion if it is requested.\" Once my amendment went down, the preceding amendment went down to defeat-we only had 39 votes, al\u00ad though that is a significant vote-- Mr. WEICKER. Would the Senator yield? Catholic University has an ex\u00ad emption. Mr. HATCH. That is the point I was going to make personally. Let me just make that point. The reason my amendment was so important before is because under the law as written in this\u00b7 Grove City bill that may pass the floor today, I do not. know-under that law, any institution controlled by a re\u00ad ligious organization is exempt if its tenets conflict with title IX. There are only two who make that a requisite in the whole country today out of thousands of schools and hun\u00ad dreds of religious schools. They are Brigham Young University and Catho\u00ad lic University, because they are the only ones completely controlled by re\u00ad ligious institutions. All the others are now going to be subject to title IX reg\u00ad ulations superseding their own reli\u00ad gious tenets-it is just simple\u00ad with the def eat of the Hatch amend\u00ad ment the last time. I do not think people realize that. This bill is so broadly drafted that, frankly, bureaucrats, with their hostil\u00ad ity to religious beliefs, will be tram\u00ad pling all over religious beliefs in these schools. I think the distinguished Senator from Connecticut would have an\u00ad swered the same way had it been Notre Dame. Is that correct? Mr. WEICKER. To respond to the distinguished Senator from Utah, and, again, I can only respond as I did before, exemptions can be granted and they are granted. Mr. HATCH. Not pursuant to this bill without my amendment. Mr. WEICKER. And they are grant\u00ad ed. And they have been granted to all religiously controlled institutions as far as the public is concerned. So, again, I think you have stated your point articulately and I hope I have mine. But I again have to repeat un\u00ad derlying all of this, yes, to say that Roe versus Wade is not involved is to say that a portion of the law of the land does not have any bearing on what happened after title IX was en\u00ad acted. I think it certainly does. And that is the law of the land, regardless of how some would like to have it changed. In terms of, No. 1, the application of title IX is specific to students and em\u00ad ployees, and not the public. What those nonreligiously controlled institu\u00ad tions are trying to do is get around this business by having a lay board of trustees and they do not come under the law. These are matters which, quite frankly, really we are not getting into insofar as trying to reestablish what the law was. I appreciate the speculations of the distinguished Senator from Utah. All I am trying to do is to make sure that what the law was prior to the Grove City case will be the law again with that one point on the definition of program activity being cleared up. Mr. HATCH. Frankly, that cannot be the case the way this bill is written. Let me say this, and I will substitute Notre Dame University for Catholic University because Catholic University would be exempt. They do have an ex\u00ad emption, as does Brigham Young Uni\u00ad versity, the only two schools in the country that will have the exemption 344 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 if this bill passes both Houses of Con\u00ad gress and is signed into law, which I doubt will happen. So we are going through an exercise here. Mr. HUMPHREY stated, \"Will the Sen\u00ad ator yield for a question? Is the Sena\u00ad tor willing to substitute Notre Dame to perform the abortion? They will be subject to this law when it passes.\" Mr. WEICKER said, \"No, I certainly do not want Notre Dame University required to perform them. The fact is that if Notre Dame wants to take Fed\u00ad eral funds they cannot deny.\" He goes on to say, \"They cannot be forced to perform them. They cannot deny the abortion if it is requested.\" I said, \"It is a lot more than that. Under those title IX abortion regula\u00ad tions they have to provide it regardless of their religious beliefs. If those regu\u00ad lations stay in force and effect, and there is no way it seems to me they do not, and this bill passes in its present form, then Catholic institutions that are not owned and controlled by that church but nevertheless affiliated with the church are going to have to provide abortions as a matter of fact to their students. That is, I think, an abomination and I think it flies in the face of religious freedom.\" Mr. HARKIN said, \"Will the Senator yield? I take it if they don't take Fed\u00ad eral money then they don't have to.\" I said, \"Senator, there is hardly any entity of any size in this world today that does not take Federal money either directly or indirectly. There is hardly a school in this country today that does not indirectly or directly take Federal funds.\" Mr. WEICKER said, \"That comment, of course, is the essence of the entire argument of this legislation. If you are going to discriminate, you do so with your own money and on your own hook. You do not do so with Federal funds. That underlies everything we are doing here today.\" I take it that Roe versus Wade is the law of the land, a constitutional law of the land, and, therefore, it has to be imposed on these schools whether they like it or not, and, frankly, will be imposed whether they have any regu\u00ad lation or not. Mr. WEICKER. Will the Senator yield? Mr. HATCH. Let me finish my state\u00ad ment. I would like not to be interrupt\u00ad ed and I would like to be able-if you will do it on your own time, I will be happy to yield. Mr. WEICKER. Sure. I would just comment to assuage the very misgiv\u00ad ings the distinguished Senator from Utah has, and they are obviously based on fact, from my own lips, to as\u00ad suage those doubts being exactly the purpose of this amendment that is before us now. Now, granted, other misgivings that he has relative to the regulatory agency are addressed by the distin-guished Senator from Missouri in his amendment. But what I am saying, and the Senator will certainly agree, is that this amendment is very clear. The very point raised in committee cannot happen, cannot happen, by virtue of this amendment, at least as far as the law is concerned. It can still happen under regula\u00ad tions, which is the reason why the Senator from Missouri has his amend\u00ad ment. Mr. HATCH. Your point is Roe versus Wade is the constitutional law of the land and supersedes regula\u00ad tions. Is that your position? Mr. WEICKER. It certainly is. Roe versus Wade is the law of the land. Mr. HATCH. Then even this law, which is a statutory law, even your amendment, that does away with your amendment because the precedent that Roe versus Wade would take being the constitutional law of the land would overrule your own amend\u00ad ment. Mr. WEICKER. Is the Senator amending Roe versus Wade? Mr. HATCH. This amendment is abortion neutral and ends the issue, if the Senator is wrong that Roe versus Wade would take precedence. If Roe versus Wade does, then both of these amendments would be unconstitution\u00ad al. I do not agree with that. Be that as it may, the Senator may be right. S. 557 raises serious questions as to the requirements of public and private institutions with regard to the provi\u00ad sions of abortion services. Let me say at the outset that there has been a great deal of confusion regarding the relevance and importance of an abor\u00ad tion neutral amendment to S. 557 which Senator DANFORTH has brought to the floor. To begin, it is appropriate to discuss the abortion neutral amendment that has been offered by Senator DAN\u00ad FORTH. The amendment reads as fol\u00ad lows: Nothing in this Title shall be construed to require or prohibit any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of facili\u00ad ties, related to an abortion. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a penal\u00ad ty to be imposed on any person because such person has received any benefit or service related to a legal abortion. It is hard to believe anybody would vote against that amendment if, in fact, we are trying to go back to pre\u00ad Grove City. The language of the amendment is clear. It would not prohibit any public or private institution from providing abortion services; such institutions would have the option to provide abor\u00ad tion services if they deem such serv\u00ad ices appropriate and desirable. Howev\u00ad er, these institutions would not be re\u00ad quired to provide abortion services when the provision is against the con-science of the institution. I think that is a fair position. What we must recognize is that this is not a question of whether one should be able to have an abortion\u00ad the Danforth amendment in no way prohibits institutions from providing abortions if they so choose. Rather, the question is whether the Federal Government has the right to force these institutions to pay for or per\u00ad form abortion services even if to do so is against religious belief or con\u00ad science. That is the issue here. Frankly, there is a glaring irony in the effect of this bill. On the one hand Congress has consistently prohibited the use of Federal funds for the per\u00ad formance of abortions under the Hyde amendment and yet under this bill, in\u00ad stitutions that receive Federal assist\u00ad ance would be required to pay for or provide abortions. Specifically, the regulations at issue, 34 CFR 106.41 and 106.57 require that: A recipient shall treat ... termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service plan or policy which such recipient adminis\u00ad ters, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipi\u00ad ent's educational programs or activity. That is pretty stark stuff. It is important to note the S. 557 and its accompanying legislative histo\u00ad ry render these regulations even more egregious than they were before the bill was proposed. First, the propo\u00ad nents have interpreted these regula\u00ad tions as meaning that failure to per\u00ad form or provide for abortion services is a form of sex discrimination. While this assumption has been argued on the State level in connection with liti\u00ad gation involving State equal rights amendments, this is the first time that abortion has been linked to sex dis\u00ad crimination with regard to these regu\u00ad lations or in connection with Federal legislation, generally. Second, S. 557 expands the scope of title IX and thereby expands the scope of the existing regulations and the opportunity for future action con\u00ad sistent with the misinterpretation that failure to perform or provide abortion services is a form of sex discrimina\u00ad tion. For example, the proponents of the bill have acknowledged that the bill would extend title IX coverage to any off-campus hospital which has any teaching program, such as medical students, nursing students or resi\u00ad dents. In short, under S. 557, any universi\u00ad ty with students receiving federally subsidized grants or loans will be re\u00ad quired to apply the abortion regula\u00ad tions in all of its operations. If a uni\u00ad versity has a teaching hospital and its students or employees receive medical care at the hospital, it would be re\u00ad quired to provide abortion services on January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 345 the same basis as any other medical service. Even a nonuniversity hospital receiving Federal assistance could be required to provide for abortions if it conducts any education programs. Under this bill, that is how far it has been expanded. It is not taking us back simply to pre-Grove City. In fact, in hearings before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, James J. Wilson, city counselor of the city of St. Louis, MO, tested that S. 557 would not only over\u00ad turn a Missouri State law that treats abortions differently from other medi\u00ad cal procedures but also would invali\u00ad date the contractual relationship be\u00ad tween the city of St. Louis and Region\u00ad al Hospital which specifically prohib\u00ad its abortions being performed by Re\u00ad gional with respect to any patients of the city. The Missouri State Statue, 376.805 R.S.Mo. 1986, provides in pertinent part, \"No health insurance contracts, plans or policies shall provide coverage for elective abortions except by an optional rider for which there must be paid an additional premium.\" The proponents of S. 557 such as the American Civil Liberties Union [ACLUl and Planned Parenthood have publicly conceded that under the bill, the mandatory abortion regulations would cover all educational activities of any teaching hospital. In other words, they concede that hospitals would be required to provide coverage of abortions in the health benefit plans which they offer to the teaching staff and others connected with the teaching program. Thus, the bill conflicts with Missouri State law prohibiting coverage for elective abortions in group health plans. Moreover, hospitals, such as Re\u00ad gional that have a staffing or teaching relationship with a nearby medical school would be required to provide abortion services, thereby invalidating contractual arrangements such as that between St. Louis and Regional Hospi\u00ad tal. There is tremendous controversy in this country surrounding the issue of abortion and those who oppose abortion hold a sincere respect for the right of life of unborn children. To call a failure to perform or provide abortion services sex discrimination is heinous. Students in colleges covered by title IX have already been compelled to support abortions for other students through mandatory student fees. In the case of Erzinger v. Regents of the University of California, the Superior Court for San Diego County relied in part on title IX for its decision reject\u00ad ing the student's claim that the uni\u00ad versity could not compel them to sup\u00ad port the abortions of other students through mandatory student fees. As the court stated: The exclusion of medical care in connec\u00ad tion with termination of pregnancies might very well and probably would violate Feder\u00ad al law, Title IX of the 1972 Higher Educa\u00ad tion Amendments (Erzinger v. Regents of the University of California, No. 458599, Superior Court San Diego, Franklin B. Or\u00ad field, J., presiding, at pp. 63-64.> Moreover, there is strong reason to believe that the mandatory abortion coverage resulting from enactment of S. 557 will go beyond coverage of stu\u00ad dents and employees. As drafted, S. 557 decimates a significant existing limitation on the scope of the title IX abortion regulations-that is, section 901 which provides that the statute applies only to \"educational\" activities is altered by S. 577, section 901 would exclude noneducational operations of otherwise covered hospitals from regu\u00ad lation. S. 557, effectively abolishes that limitation by providing that \"all of the operations\" of an entity en\u00ad gaged in the health care business will be covered in their entirety. This indi\u00ad cates that if a hospital is covered at all under title IX, S. 557 will assure that even its treatment of patients from the general public will be subject to the abortion regulations . As drafted, \"all of the operations of\" listed enti\u00ad ties, would include health care institu\u00ad tions whenever a health care institu\u00ad tion receives any Federal aid. Certain\u00ad ly, it would run counter to the entire thrust of the bill to limit the applica\u00ad tion of title IX, and the abortion regu\u00ad lations, to only a hospital's \"educa\u00ad tional activities.\" No one contends that the act's other requirements will be limited to students or employees. In fact, the coverage of this issue has still further ramifications. If a health care institution receiving Fed\u00ad eral financial assistance is part of a larger chain, all other institutions in that chain are covered even if none of the other institutions receive Federal assistance. Clearly, S. 557 expands abortion requirements dramatically. The proponents have suggested that Congress or the administration need merely rescind the regulations in order to correct the concerns raised by this issue. Mr. President, that is an in\u00ad sufficient solution to a serious prob\u00ad lem. These regulations were promul\u00ad gated in 1974 and therefore, have been on the books for the last 14 years. Any rescission would be met immediately with litigation in an attempt to rein\u00ad state the regulations. The abortion regulations represent one agency's view of what is required by title IX. Administrative revocation of those regulations would not bar a court from deciding that the interpretation of the law reflected in the regulations was valid nonetheless and required by the statute. Absent congressional amend\u00ad ment in the form of the Danforth abortion neutral amendment, future administrations could easily reinstate the egregious regulations. Departmen\u00ad tal regulations do not provide binding interpretations of Federal law. Judi-cial interpretations of Federal statutes do. In any event, S. 557 effectively codifies the title IX abortion regula\u00ad tions, which would place them beyond mere administrative revocation. In short, congressional action is required at this time to correct the proabortion effects of S. 557. It may be useful to point out the views of the proponents of S. 557 on this issue. During the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee markup of S. 557, on May 20, 1987, Senator WEICKER stated: Just for the record, I'll state, if you take Federal funds, you can't deny a person an abortion. The reason why you can't deny a person an abortion is, it's legal in the United States of America. The reason why it's legal is we don't run the nation by virtue of our individual consciences, we run by virtue of a constitutional system. That's the answer pure and simple, and it isn't going to change . It's relatively simple. If someone wants to take Federal funds, then they can't deny the rights of an American under the law. That's it. This in no way impinges on your individual conscience, as I said before . No, I certainly do not want Catholic University required to perform them. The fact is, if Catholic University wants to take Federal funds they can't deny-they're not forced to perform them-they can't deny an abortion if its requested. Mr. President it is outrageous and inconsistent to disallow the use of Fed\u00ad eral funds for abortions on the one hand and to require those receiving Federal funds to pay for or provide abortions on the other hand. It is es\u00ad sential that we accept the Danforth abortion-neutral amendment and cor\u00ad rect this glaring problem posed by S. 557. Let me just add one other sentence. There are those who think that they will be supporting a prolife position by supporting the Weicker-Kennedy\u00ad Metzenbaum-Packwood amendment. That is not so. The only position on the floor this day that can solve this problem is going to be the Danforth amendment. So we are asking all Sena\u00ad tors who have concerns in this area to vote against the Weicker-Kennedy\u00ad Packwood-Metzenbaum amendment. We think that it does more harm to the debate and problem than it does any good, and certainly it seems to me does not solve the problems that we are trying to address here today. It certainly does not solve the expansive nature of this bill, that expands the law way beyond what anybody thought it was back in 1984, before the Grove City decision occurred. Let me just give 5 minutes to the dis\u00ad tinguished Senator from New Mexico, and then turn the balance of my time over to the distinguished Senator from Missouri. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. DOMENIC!. First, I am not a Senator who believes that we ought to leave the Grove City decision alone. I 346 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 have cosponsored legislation to over\u00ad rule the narrow interpretation of the Supreme Court with reference to insti\u00ad tutions. I was an original cosponsor of BOB DOLE'S bill of the 98th Congress, and the Senator from Oregon quite properly noted that I was nodding on that part-and that part only-of his discussion about institutionwide cover\u00ad age versus a narrow interpretation. Second, I am fully aware that this is not and should not be a discussion of whether or not we agree with Roe versus Wade. I think my record is pretty clear; I do not like the decision, but I am not the Supreme Court. I am a member of the legislative branch. Third, it should be eminently clear that the law of the land is that the U.S. Government will not pay for abortions. That is the Hyde amend\u00ad ment. We have had that before us enough times where, regardless of how close the vote, it is pretty clear that the Congress of the United States\u00ad and I hope and assume constitutional\u00ad ly; nobody has taken that issue to the Supreme Court-has said \"You will not spend taxpayers' money for abor\u00ad tion.\" I assume that is an appropriate exercise of our legislative authority. That is point three. We will not pay for abortion as a matter of decision of the Federal Government. We had a choice, to borrow the jargon of the day, and Congress elect\u00ad ed and exercised its right to choose, and we said we do not pay for them. That is No. 3. Fourth, if you believe that the Grove City decision is too narrow, you ought to be down here on the floor trying to enact a bill with legislative language that will be passed, be signed by the President, and that will sub\u00ad stantially ameliorate the narrow inter\u00ad pretations of the Supreme Court re\u00ad garding civil rights. Those are my four positions. Let me take the last one first. I want the last one to happen. In my humble opinion, there is no chance that it is going to happen unless the issue of abortion and civil rights is resolved. I just do not see how, since it has held the House up for 3 years. Can you imagine the President of the United States signing a bill with the Weicker\u00ad Kennedy-Metzenbaum language in it and the rest of this bill as it is, with the very first legal opinion out of the box saying you have, by this legisla\u00ad tion, substantially expanded the cover\u00ad age, and thus the scope for litigation, under civil rights of title IX of the Education Act as interpreted by de\u00ad partmental regulations. Can you imag\u00ad ine the President signing that? Can you imagine a veto being sustained by the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House? I just do not believe there is a chance of that. Now, Mr. President, it seems to me to be-I was going to say the height of hypocrisy, but let me make it a little bit more mellow-it seems to me to be extremely ironic that we will not pay for abortions, exercising our free choice and voting, and we are about to say here today that institutions out there in the United States, principally medical schools doing a fantastic job for American health, doing research, that we are sitting up here saying that an awful lot of them, if they get a little tiny bit of Federal money, there is a real chance, says this legal opin\u00ad ion, that in spite of the Metzenbaum\u00ad Weicker-Kennedy language, there is going to be a coercive effect of this new bill. We are drawing on their deci\u00ad sions regarding their choice to say, \"We do not choose to perform abor\u00ad tions. There is somebody up the street that might. There is some hospital down the road that might. But we do not.\" As a matter of fact, it is a civil rights issue, a pro-choice issue, in my opin\u00ad ion. In this case, it happens to be the same decision that those who are pro\u00ad lif e or right-to-life have come to with reference to their position on this bill. Mr. President, it is very easy for me-and I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Oregon, who sits here, and the Senator from Ohio, who is over there. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired. Mr. DOMENIC!. Will the Senator yield me 5 additional minutes? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recog\u00ad nized for an additional 5 minutes. Mr. DOMENIC!. It is very simple for me to see what is occurring. Let me couch it this way: Those who say vote for Metzenbaum are asking us to dodge the issue instead of deciding the issue. That is a very, very simple point-dodge the issue and be able to say that, as to the four corners of this new legislation we have addressed the issue. But as a matter of fact you cannot separate title IX of the Educa\u00ad tion Act from this. So we are not de\u00ad ciding the issue. We have grown noto\u00ad rious as a Congress for not deciding issues. We have grown to the point where our people expect litigation from our legislation because we do not want to decide in clear, plain English language. I hope those in this body who think they are going to dodge instead of de\u00ad ciding this issue will at least listen to part of this morning's debate because it is unequivocal to this Senator that this legislation before us has in mind affecting title IX of the Education Act in some way or another. Now, we would be told to not worry about it, it is something else, just worry about the four corners of this bill-dodging the issue instead of de\u00ad ciding it so those who think we are saying to our institutions, our medical schools and derivatives of those medi\u00ad cal schools, \"We are protecting you be-cause we adopted this language and if you do not want to perform abortions, you are riot harming anyone, you are not violating Roe versus Wade, they can go somewhere else and have them.\" If they think they are going to tell people that is what we decided, they dodged it. And they will have people litigating from now until it fi\u00ad nally gets to the Supreme Court-on average 5 years-while people out there are saying what does it mean with reference to title IX, which now has a broadened institutional effect according to the very first legal opin\u00ad ion out of the box. \u00b7 And I do not think anybody asked them how to decide. Let us send it to five more lawyers, even if we got a three-to-two decision-three lawyers, good ones saying we agree with this one and two do not-it is precisely the point the Senator from New Mexico is making. Let us make it clear. I guaran\u00ad tee my fell ow Senators, if you are going to vote for the Metzenbaum\u00ad Weicker-Kennedy amendment, and say we made it clear, we protected the choice of institutions to deny abor\u00ad tions because nobody is hurt, you really have not, you have dodged it. I thank the Senator for yielding. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. METZENBAUM addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, how much time is left? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 20 minutes; the oppo\u00ad nents have 14 minutes and 51 seconds. Mr. PACKWOOD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Ohio. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, let us not confuse the issue. Let us not say that which is not so is so, and let us not say that that which is so is not so. The manager of the bill, Senator HATCH, in opposition, talks about the expansion of the rights and the obliga\u00ad tions of medical schools. The commit\u00ad tee report addresses itself to that issue. It says \"title IX covers only stu\u00ad dents and employees and does not reach the public at large.\" How the Senator from Utah can come to the conclusion that it reaches the public at large in spite of that interpretation by the committee report is difficult for me to understand. The language goes on to state that, \"therefore, claims that the bill would require hospitals to provide abortion services to the gener\u00ad al public are false.\" Yet in spite of that, a member of the committee comes on the floor and says it just is not so. Then we hear the very strong argument made by our friend from New Mexico, who says we want January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 347 to correct the Grove City decision, but we want to go further. And there is some concern \u00b7that the language of this bill expands the right to an abor\u00ad tion, or rather the right to keep Feder\u00ad al funds from being used for an abor\u00ad tion. They talk about a Dewey, Ballan\u00ad tine legal letter saying it is possible that it may be interpreted in a certain way. Let us face it. None of us who are in\u00ad terested in the Grove City bill or sup\u00ad porting this amendment would require that abortions be performed for the public at large. None of us want to affect the issue of abortion, and we have tried to say that time and time again. The bill does not change the re\u00ad quirement of title IX that it applies to educational programs or activities and their students and employees. What we are talking about here is an effort on the part of some to put into this civil rights bill a change in the law with respect to the regulations that were passed and enacted several years ago, about 10 years ago. Nobody wants to do that as far as the propo\u00ad nents are concerned. We have tried to make the language as explicitly clear as can be. We say, \"No provisions of this act or any amendment made by this act shall be construed to force or require any individual or hospital or any other institution, program, or ac\u00ad tivity receiving Federal funds to per\u00ad form or pay for an abortion.\" In spite of that specific\u00b7 language, language as direct as it could be, the distinguished Senator from Utah says that amendment is nothing but an empty shell. I do not understand his reasoning. We are saying that abortion is an issue that Congress has dealt with. By my last count, I think it has been almost 500 times since I have been in the U.S. Senate, and every time we get a measure before us, we get an abor\u00ad tion amendment. Grove City is a civil rights bill. What we are saying is \"Let's deal with the civil rights issue, the limitations im\u00ad posed by Grove City, and let us not get into the abortion issue.\" The amend\u00ad ment of the Senator from Missouri would do just that. It would reach title IX. It would undo the regulations. I respect his right to make that ar\u00ad gument, that the regulations should be undone, that they should be changed. I do not happen to think so. He certainly has that right. But it is unbecoming for him and others to come to the floor of the Senate and jeopardize this civil rights bill. I be\u00ad lieve it is confusing the issue. I would have much preferred we not have to consider any kind of disclaim\u00ad er language on the subject of abortion; but we have not been able to prevail upon others who would want us to ad\u00ad dress the regulations adopted in 1975. We do not want to change the title IX regulations. We do not want to add to them. We do not want to detract from them. We just want to make it clear that scare stories; and reports about the impact of this bill on the issue of abortion are not based on fact. That is the reason for our amendment. On another day, it may be appropri\u00ad ate to deal with the question of the regulations. My. views with respect to changing . those regulations would not be different from what they are now. But I feel sad that those who would say they support the reversal of the Grove City decision come to the floor, as the Senator from New Mexico has just done, and say that we need to ad\u00ad dress the abortion issue before we do what is right with respect to Grove City. I do not believe we should condi\u00ad tion our consideration of this bill or consideration of an abortion issue. I\u00b7 remember when Senator Magnu\u00ad son was a Member of this body, and he would say, almost with tears in his eyes, \"Why is it that every time I have an appropriation bill, whether it has to do with this subject, that subject, or any of a number of other subjects, I have to get into a battle on the abor\u00ad tion issue?\" Congress has dealt with that issue on innumerable occasions-as I have said, almost 500 times since I have been here. The question is, can we stay away from that subject and not jeopardize the enactment of a very much needed piece of legislation to correct the civil rights laws of this country? That is what this issue is all about. If you think we ought to be able to move forward on the Grove City matter without getting into the abor\u00ad tion issue, then I hope you will vote for our amendment. But if you are willing to jeopardize the passage of the correction, and if you believe that we ought to reach out beyond and try to do something about the 1975 regu\u00ad lations, then of course you will vote against our amendment. I strongly urge my colleagues: Stay away from the abortion issue on this bill. Vote the Grove City matter up or down, and do not tinker with the 10- year-old abortion regulations. Mr. President, I reserve the remain\u00ad der of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, I wish to respond to a few of the points that have been made by various Sena\u00ad tors. First, I think that perhaps the most telling part of the debate this morning occurred when questions were put to Senator WEICKER and to me by the Senator from Florida [Mr. GRAHAM] about the effect of the two amend\u00ad ments, the Metzenbaum-Packwood amendment and a Danforth amend\u00ad ment that we will shortly be voting on. I think the questions before us are as follows: First, do we, by passing this legisla\u00ad tion, reaffirm a regulation of the. De\u00ad partment of Health, Education, and Welfare which equates the refusal to provide abortions with sex discrimina\u00ad tion? That was the 1975 regulation. It equated the refusal to fund abortions with sex discrimination. The bill before us states, quite ex\u00ad pressly, and I quote from page 10 of the bill before us: Congress finds' that legislative action is necessary to restore the prior consistent and long-standing executive branch interpreta\u00ad tion and broad institutionwide application of those laws it previously administered; That is to say that the bill without the Danforth amendment expressly reaffirms a regulation. Senator WEICKER said, \"Well, a regu\u00ad lation that is adopted by an adminis\u00ad trative agency can be changed by an administrative agency.\" I do not think that is the case once Congress has ex\u00ad pressly reaffirmed it. So the \u00b7 underlying policy question for each Senator to answer is, do you believe that the refusal to fund or to provide abortions or to perform abor\u00ad tions constitutes sex discrimination within the meaning of title IX and therefore should be broadly applied to hospitals and to educational institu\u00ad tions under the Civil Rights Restora\u00ad tion Act? Do we want to open the courts and regulatory agencies to the possibility that institutions may be required to fund or to perform abortions, even though abortion is morally abhorrent to those institutions? Do we want to say to Notre Dame University that it has to be in their health plan? Do we want to say to Georgetown University that it has to be in their hospital? Answering some of the points that have been made, first of all-- Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. DANFORTH. I do not have much time, and I would like to run through these points. I know that some other Senators want to be heard. Senator WEICKER said that the abor\u00ad tion requirement might apply to stu\u00ad dents and staff of a university. But it would not be applied simply to patients. I do not think that is much of a con\u00ad solation to Georgetown University Hospital that the only abortions it would have to perform is for students or staff, but in point of fact the Dewey, Ballantine legal memorandum expressly addresses this question and states that a court could without the Danforth amendment interpret the law so as to require abortions for the general public even in a hospital like Georgetown University Hospital. Second, the scope of the religious ex\u00ad emption we have already voted on today. We have voted on a very narrow 348 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 scope of the religious exemption. Again the religious exemption, de\u00ad pending on what administration is reading it, \u00b7can be read so that a uni\u00ad versity with a lay board of trustees is not covered by the religious exemp\u00ad tion. For example, St. Louis University is generally viewed as a Jesuit univer\u00ad sity. The president of the board of trustees, at least the last time I looked, was Vice President Bush's brother, who is not a Roman Catholic. It would not be viewed as a Catholic institution or a religiously controlled institution. So the religious exemption provides very little coverage. Finally, it has been said, \"Well, do we chip away at Roe versus Wade?\" Before us is not Roe versus Wade. Roe versus Wade has to do with a woman's right to abortion. The issue before us is whether a hos\u00ad pital or a college or a university can be compelled to fund abortions. Senator DoMENICI pointed out we in Congress in the Hyde amendment lan\u00ad guage have already voted that we are not going to be in the business of funding abortions in the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment. Together with title IX and the regu\u00ad lations subsequent to title IX, this bill could be read to force the private sector and local governments, for that matter, to fund abortions when we say that we are not going to do so in the United States. Mr. President, I would simply reiter\u00ad ate that the Metzenbaum-Kennedy\u00ad Packwood-Weicker amendment is a blank. It does nothing. It provides ab\u00ad solutely no cover. We have legal memos from Dewey, Ballantine and from the Justice De\u00ad partment stating that it has absolutely no effect. I would urge the Senate to vote against the sham of that amendment and to vote for the Danforth amend\u00ad ment. I believe that Senator WILSON has been seeking time. How much time does the Senator wish? Mr. WILSON. Three minutes. Mr. METZENBAUM. Will the Sena\u00ad tor yield for a question first? Mr. DANFORTH. Let me ask first: How much time do I have? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 8 minutes. Mr. DANFORTH. Let me say this. I know Senator METZENBA UM and Sena\u00ad tor BUMPERS both wanted to question me. I would like Senators who would like to speak to have the opportunity. I will yield 3 minutes to Senator WILSON and if I have time I will be happy to entertain any questions. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mr. WILSON. Thank you, Mr. Presi\u00ad dent. Mr. President, the Senator from Mis\u00ad souri has I think very clearly stated the case for the need for his amend\u00ad ment, but what is apparently not clear to many on this floor and many who are wondering why this amendment is necessary or why if this is adopted there is a need for the Danforth amendment is simply this: This amendment does not remove the need for the Danforth amendment because the need for the Danforth amendment arises from a regulation that would be unaffected by this amendment. So if Senators wish to vote for this amendment, I suppose they can, but they should dare not delude them\u00ad selves that by so doing. they will have eliminated the need or addressed the problem that gives rise to the need for Senator DANFORTH \"s amendment. Without the Danforth amendment ~ that regulation C0Dtinnes to give promise of not just strife, but certain\u00ad ly of being applied by bureaucrats in a way that will force institutions subject to title IX to perform or to fund abor\u00ad tions against their conscience.. That is not right. And as I stated yesterday, I am one of those Senators generally characterized as prochoice. We will not get into that debate, because there is not time, and that essentially is not the issue. The issue here is one of fair\u00ad ness, for Senators, whether they be prochoice or prolif e. can and should support the Danforth amendment simply because on the basis of fair\u00ad ness, hearkening back to the tradition of honoring the request of conscien\u00ad tious objectors. we say to those who le\u00ad gitimately assert a conscientious objec\u00ad tion that abortion is morally repug\u00ad nant to them that they shall not be re\u00ad quired to perform it or to fund it. That is what this is about. It is noth\u00ad ing more or less. It is a narrow point, but of tremendous importance. But do not delude yourselves, my friends, that. by voting for this amendment you remove the need for the Danforth amendment. That is not true. The Danforth amendment addresses all of title IX. Its reach is broad as the title and needs to be to protect against that unfairness arising from that underly\u00ad ing regulation, and this amendment that is before us. the Weicker-Met.z\u00ad enbaum-Packwood et cetera. et al . does not do that. There is nothing wrong with it, I suppose, as long as you understand it does not give the needed protection against that unfairness. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields time? The Senator from Ohio. Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, it is very interesting to me that the Senator from California says that we need the Danforth amendment for protection against title IX regulations while the Senator from Missouri says the bill does not effect the regulations. These are contradictory positions. But because the Senator from Mis\u00ad souri is saying that the bill does have an impact and enacts the title IX regu\u00ad lations. I want to make it clear that this is not so. The committee report specifically addresses itself to this issue. The title IX regulations are not at issue in this legislation. They have been in place for 12 years and there have been ne.ither any legal challenges to these regulations by anti-choice groups nor any effort on the part of this administration to withdraw or modify the regulations. S. 557 neither rati\u00ad fies nor rejects the title IX regulations re\u00ad lated to disaimination based on pregnancy or termination of pregnancy. It is as clear as it could be, that we are not affecting the title IX regula\u00ad tions, and we do not want to affect those title IX regulations. The admin\u00ad istration can change them if it wants to. That is up to the administration . But what the Danforth amendment does is interject into this civil rights issue the matter of those title IX regu\u00ad lations. We are saying \"stay out of the abortion issue if you want to change the law with respect to Grove City.\" That is as simple and as direct as we can make it. If you think our language does not say it directly enough, tell us. Nobody claimed that our language wasn't clear. We are making it clear. We do not want to affect the title IX regulations. We do not want to change law on the abortion issue. We just want to pass the Grove City legislation. We can deal with the title IX regulations in other legislation. It is within the power of the administration modify them. Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from Mis\u00ad souri be willing t.o engage in a short colloquy that will be very brief. Mr. DANFORTH. Yes. Mr_ BUMPERS. This is an immense\u00ad ly difficult problem for almost every Senator here, I think. But, No. 1. the Senator's amendment only deals with title IX; is that cor\u00ad rect? Mr. DANFORTH. The Senator's amendment deals with the combina\u00ad tion of title IX, the regulations pursu\u00ad ant to title IX. and the Civil Rights Restoration Act. The Senator's amendment says that that combina\u00ad tion is neutral on the subject of abor\u00ad tion, that the law cannot be read by a court or by a regulatory agency to compel a college, university, or hospi\u00ad tal to pay for abortions in its health coverage plan or to perform abortions. That is exactly what the Senator's amendment is intended to do. Mr. BUMPERS. In the Senator's amendment, section 909 says, \"Noth\u00ad ing in this title shall be construed,\" et cetera-- Mr. DANFORTH. Right. January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENA TE 349 Mr. BUMPERS. \"This title\" refers to title IX. Mr. DANFORTH. Yes. Mr. BUMPERS. Now, the second question, as I understand the debate, to be very succinct about it, is that the authors of this amendment and the proponents of the Grove City restora\u00ad tion, the repeal of the Grove City deci\u00ad sion, are saying this bill as presently written has absolutely no effect on the law as it has previously been. We are simply reinstating the law as it was prior to the Supreme Court decision. As I understand the Senator's amendment, the Senator's amendment goes beyond that by simply saying \"I want to make it permissible for any person, private, public or institution to have the right to refuse to perform abortions,\" You say pay for. I do not know why \"pay for\" is there. I do not know anybody who has been required to pay for. Mr. DANFORTH. Yes. That is a very big issue. In fact, that is what the 1975 regulations were specifically about. Whether you say the university health plan, say, Notre Dame Univer\u00ad sity, whether a health plan a Notre Dame University provided generally for students' health care had to pro\u00ad vide for abortions as well. If the Dan\u00ad forth amendment is adopted then the U.S. Senate is saying that Notre Dame University in its health care program does not have to provide for abortion coverage. It is up to Notre Dame to do it or not do it. We are saying that Georgetown Uni\u00ad versity does not have to perform abor\u00ad tions. It is up to Georgetown Universi\u00ad ty. By contrast, if the route we are going is the Metzenbaum amendment, we are saying that if a court or a regu\u00ad latory agency is left open to decide that issue, and according to the legal opinion of Dewey, Ballantine, the well\u00ad known law firm, it is well within rea\u00ad sonable possibility for a court to deter\u00ad mine that, yes, a school, a college, a hospital, can be required to fund or to perform abortions if they are receiving any Federal funds for any part of their program. Mr. BUMPERS. Are you saying Notre Dame can be made to include in its health care plan provisions to pay for abortions? Mr. DANFORTH. That is precisely the issue before us. Mr. BUMPERS. Under existing law? Mr. DANFORTH. Yes. Mr. BUMPERS. Has that been de\u00ad termined by the court? Mr. DANFORTH. That is the opin\u00ad ion of the Dewey, Ballantine law firm. Mr. BUMPERS. Has that been vali\u00ad dated in court? Has any court said that? Mr. DANFORTH. The answer to the question is, no, this is a matter that has not been determined by a court. We anticipate litigation as a result of this legislation. The issue is: Do we want to preclude such a court inter\u00ad pretation or, instead, do we in the Congress want to pass the buck to the Federal judiciary and say, \"You make the policy for us\"? If it is our decision that as a matter of Government policy the decision on funding or performing abortions should be left up to the Notre Dames and the George towns of the country, then we vote for the Dan\u00ad forth amendment. If, instead, we say that no, a court or administrative agency will have a free hand to inter\u00ad pret this law in such a way as to force abortion coverage or abortion per\u00ad formance on these institutions, then we can vote for the Metzenbaum amendment, claim that we have got some kind of cover, and vote for the bill without the Danforth amendment. That is precisely the issue before us. Mr. BUMPERS. Last question: Since the amendment of the Senator only deals with title IX, what would prohib\u00ad it somebody from challenging a hospi\u00ad tal, private or public, under title VI of the Civil Rights Act? Mr. DANFORTH. I have not made any legal analysis of that. I have no idea one way or the other. The only question that I put to the law firm, and the only question I re\u00ad sponded to when it came to me from the American Hospital Association and other organizations had to do with the effect of the combination of the bill that is before us, together with title IX and regulations under title IX. They are concerned that we will have given a basis for a court to determine the funding of abortion or perform\u00ad ance of abortion could be mandatory. Now, that is their concern. Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator's amendment goes far beyond the reli\u00ad gious-- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the amendment has expired. The proponents have 7 minutes and 17 seconds remaining. Mr. PACKWOOD. I would be happy to yield additional time to the Senator from Arkansas if he wants to ask a question and the Senator from Mis\u00ad souri to answer to them on my time, but I want to save 3 minutes. Mr. METZENBAUM. Would you save 2 for me? Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator may just go ahead. I think I have said all I want to say. Mr. PACKWOOD. I think you have got it right. There was, I do not want to say an agreement, but there was an understanding that what we were going to try to do with this legislation was simply reverse Grove City and go back to institution-wide coverage. We were not going to get into school prayer although somebody apparently is going to off er a school prayer amendment. We were not going to get into abor\u00ad tion. We were not going to get into AIDS. We were just going to try to re\u00ad verse Grove City and go back to what all of us, including the Senator from Missouri, thought was the law prior to Grove City and what the law was in title IX and the 1975 regulations and whatever court decisions we had. And you asked whether we had any court decisions that concluded what he con\u00ad cluded and Dewey, Ballantine conclud\u00ad ed, and the answer is no, there were no court decisions. That was the law. Now, because the allegation was made that the bill as it came out of committee actually expanded abortion rights, Senator METZENBAUM, Senator WEICKER, Senator KENNEDY, and myself offered an amendment that says nothing in this act expands abor\u00ad tion rights. You cannot compel any abortions, provide for them, pay for them in this act. We will go back to where we were prior to Grove City. What Senator DANFORTH wants to do is change title IX and change the law so that the regulations that are now in existence could never be interpreted by a court to reach a decision on abor\u00ad tion that he does not like. It is a per\u00ad fectly legitimate position. I do not agree with it. But it certainly cannot be said that all he wants to do is go back to where the law was prior to Grove City. He wants to change the law as it existed prior to Grove City. I will yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Ohio if he is ready. Mr. METZENBAUM. Would the Senator just reply to one simple ques\u00ad tion? Mr. PACKWOOD. Sure. Mr. METZENBAUM. Is it not a fact that the Dewey, Ballantine letter is addressed to the bill without our amendment? Mr. PACKWOOD. Absolutely; total\u00ad ly. As you read the Dewey, Ballantine letter, first, it does not apply to title IX as title IX was originally written. It applies to it as this act amends it. And they have got a whole lot of could be's and may be's, this might happen. This whole memorandum is unrealated to the Weicker-Metzenbaum amendment. It is related, allegedly, to the act as re\u00ad ported. And the amendment that you have offered and Senator WEICKER has offered absolutely denudes the 17-page Dewey, Ballantine memorandum of any relevance. Mr. METZENBAUM. And is it not a fact that even if it had relevancy, all they say in that letter is some court could decide it this way but make no observation that it is certain that the court will interpret them in this manner. Nor does the memo say that the bill cannot be interpreted any other way. It is just one of those spec\u00ad ulative answers. Mr. PACKWOOD. Here is exactly what they say: If the Civil Rights Res\u00ad toration Act is enacted in its present form, that is before your amendment, 350 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 educational institutions could be re\u00ad quired to fund abortions, hospitals that engage in educational activities could be, hospitals could be, education\u00ad al institutions could fail to qualify. There is no court decision under all those regulations that existed under title IX prior to Grove City that ever found; that, that ever compelled that, that ever could be; never took place. The only issue that Grove City decid\u00ad ed was narrow versus institutionwide coverage. That is all. But there have been no bogeyman court decisions reaching those could-be conclusions. Mr. METZENBAUM. That was my understanding. I thank the Senator. Mr. DANFORTH. If the Senator has nothing more to say, I will be happy to ask him some.questions. Mr. PACKWOOD. Go righ,t ahead. Mr. DANFORTH. Well, is not the difference between my amendment's approach and the Senator from Or\u00ad egon's approach that under the posi\u00ad tion of the Senator from Oregon, the \u00b7Senator from Ohio, and others, a court could determine that an institu\u00ad tion such as Georgetown University could be compelled to perform an abortion. Under the Danforth amend\u00ad ment, Georgetown University could not be compelled by a court order to perform abortions under title IX. Is that not the difference? Mr. PACKWOOD. All I would ask my distinguished colleague, since he asked, all I would ask my distin\u00ad guished colleague is this: Is that any different than what the state of the law was prior to the Grove City deci\u00ad sion? Mr. DANFORTH. Well, this is dif\u00ad ferent, as a matter of fact. First of all, because we are, by statute, reaffirming a regulation; and, second, by statute, we are applying the Grove City scope to hospitals, even hospitals that are not connected with universities. So the answer is clearly yes, we are expanding the law beyond what it was before Grove City by enacting this legisla\u00ad tion. Mr. PACKWOOD. I would respond to my good friend, and he is my good friend, from Missouri that that simply is not the case. It was not intended to do that. We have tried to limit that by the Weicker-Metzenbaum-Kennedy\u00ad Packwood amendment. We have no desire to expand the substance of the law beyond where it was. We tried not to do that. And all we wanted to do was say this law applies to institutions. We will go back just prior to Grove City. We had the regulations. We had no particular court decisions on this subject one way or the other. That is the situation we would like to return to. What the Senator from Missouri wants to do is say, not only are we going to go back to that, we are going to pass a law that will prohibit any court decisions that might reach a conclusion which you do not want. Mr. DANFORTH. The Senator has read the Dewey, Ballantine letter of this morning which states that the Metzenbaum-Weicker, et al, amend\u00ad ment is a nullity as far as the issue raised by the Senator from Missouri is concerned. Mr. PACKWOOD. As far as the issue raised by the Senator from Mis\u00ad souri, that is correct, because the amendment of the Senator from Mis\u00ad souri goes back to title IX and the Education Act and the regulations, whereas the amendment of the Sena\u00ad tors from Ohio and Connecticut and Senator KENNEDY and myself relates to this act. So it is a nullity as it re\u00ad lates to your amendment, because your amendment applies to the whole panoply of the regulations in the act of 15 years ago. Mr. DANFORTH. Therefore, the Metzenbaum amendment would pro\u00ad vide no cover for a Senator who wants to come to the floor and address the issues that have been raised by the Senator from Missouri. Mr. PACKWOOD. What the Metz\u00ad enbaum amendment does is clear. What it would do is carry out the un\u00ad derstanding that we would not use this legislation to attempt to change the substantive law of abortion or any\u00ad thing else; that we would try simply to rectify a decision that we all were sur\u00ad prised by and thought was wrong. Mr. DANFORTH. And the Metz\u00ad enbaum amendment therefore would leave open the possibility that a court could mandate that Georgetown Uni\u00ad versity has to provide or fund abor\u00ad tions? Mr. PACKWOOD. The Metzenbaum amendment would leave the law in ex\u00ad actly the same state that it was in prior to the Grove City decision. Mr. DANFORTH. So the answer to my question is yes? Mr. WILSON. Yes. Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, the Senate will have the chance to vote on two amendments relating to the issue of abortion. The first amendment is truly an abortion neutrality amendment. The second amendment, offered by the Senator from Missouri [Mr. DAN\u00ad FORTH], has been described as an abor\u00ad tion neutral amendment. It is not. The Danforth amendment rewrites sub\u00ad stantive law which has been in effect for more than a decade. It would over\u00ad turn the title IX regulations issued under the Ford administration which forbid educational receiving Federal funds from discriminating against stu\u00ad dents or employees who are seeking or have had an abortion. Mr. President, the Civil Rights Res\u00ad toration Act is not an abortion bill. It is a civil rights measure designed to re\u00ad store the scope of coverage of the four basic civil rights statutes which re-quire that recipients of Federal funds refrain from discrimination. The opponents of this legislation have charged that the bill will expand abortion rights, require hospitals to provide abortions to the general public and require religious institutions to perform abortions. Those charges are totally false. The committee report discusses these claims and rejects them flatly. The proponents of the Danforth amendment have contended that the committee report language is not binding and therefore inadequate to respond to their concerns. 'l'he abortion neutrality amendment which is being offered with the sup\u00ad port of the principal sponsors of the Civil Rights Restoration Act, in effect, places the committee report language into\u00b7 the statute itself. If flatly pro\u00ad vides that on provision of this act or any amendment made thereby shall be construed to require or force any indi\u00ad vidual or entity to perform or pay for an abortion. It makes the Civil Rights Restoration Act, on its face, abortion neutral. It leaves the substantive law under title IX with respect to abortion exactly where it was. There is no ex\u00ad pansion nor any contraction of rights with respect to this issue. The Danforth amendment, on the other hand, is intended to and would rewrite title IX. It would overturn the existing regulations which protect stu\u00ad dents, for example, who have had legal abortions from discrimination. It appears to be intentionally drafted to go well beyond the simple issue of per\u00ad formance of or payment for abortion. The Reagan administration has al\u00ad ready attempted under the family planning program authorized under title X of the Public Health Service Act to curtail entities receiving Feder\u00ad al funds from providing any counsel\u00ad ing or referrals for abortion services. The Danforth amendment does not even provide any special treatment for abortions to save the life of the mother. Literally applied, if the Dan\u00ad forth amendment were enacted, a stu\u00ad dent who is a rape victim and has been diagnosed to have an ectopic pregnan\u00ad cy-a life-threatening condition-could be denied information at a student health clinic on the necessity of termi\u00ad nating the pregnancy immediately. Mr. President, the Danforth amend\u00ad ment has no place on the Civil Rights Restoration Act. The sponsors of this measure have drafted the abortion neutrality amendment to make it ab\u00ad solutely clear that this act is abortion neutral. I urge my colleagues to vote for that amendment and against the Danforth amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 1 o'clock p.m. having arrived, the question is on agreeing to the amendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut. The yeas and nays January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 351 have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CRANSTON. I announce that the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. GORE], is necessarily absent. I also announce that the Senator from Delaware [Mr. BIDEN] is absent because of illness. I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennes\u00ad see [Mr. GoRE] would vote \"yea.\" Mr. SIMPSON. I announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mr. DOLE] is necessarily absent. I also announce that the Senator from Alaska [Mr. MURKOWSKI] and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. WALLOP] are absent on official busi\u00ad ness. I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Wyo\u00ad ming [Mr. WALLOP] would vote \"nay.\" The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr. WIRTH). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced-yeas 55, nays 40, follows: Vote No. 8 YEAS-55 Adams Baucus Bentsen Bingaman Bradley Breaux Bumpers Burdick Byrd Chafee Chiles Cohen Cranston D'Amato Daschle Dixon Dodd Evans Fowler Armstrong Bond Boren Boschwitz Cochran Conrad Danforth DeConcini Domenici Duren berger Exon Ford Garn Gramm Bi den Dole Glenn Graham Harkin Heflin Heinz Hollings Inouye Kassebaum Kennedy Kerry Lautenberg Leahy Levin Matsunaga Metzenbaum Mikulski Mitchell Moynihan Nunn NAYS-40 Grassley Hatch Hatfield Hecht Helms Humphrey Johnston Karnes Kasten Lugar McCain McClure McConnell Melcher Packwood Pell Pryor Riegle Rockefeller Rudman Sanford Sar banes Sasser Simon Simpson Specter Stafford Stevens Weicker Wilson Wirth Nickles Pressler Proxmire Quayle Symms Thurmond Trible Warner NOT VOTING-5 Gore Murkowski Wallop So the amendment <No. 1393) was agreed to. Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was agreed to. Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO. 1392 <Purpose: To ensure that the bill does not require that persons, or public or private entities receiving Federal funds perform abortions> The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from Missouri is recognized for the purpose of offering an amendment pursuant to the unanimous-consent agreement of last night. The time will be evenly di\u00ad vided between now and 2 o'clock. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, I call up my amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Missouri <Mr. DAN\u00ad FORTH) proposes an amendment numbered 1392. At the appropriate place add the follow\u00ad ing: Notwithstanding any provision of this act or any amendment adopted thereto. NEUTRALITY WITH RESPECT TO ABORTION SEc. 909. Nothing in this title shall be con\u00ad strued to require or prohibit any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of facilities, related to an abortion. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a penalty to be imposed on any person or indi\u00ad vidual because such person or individual is seeking or has received any benefit or serv\u00ad ice related to a legal abortion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Recog\u00ad nizing the Senator from Missouri, the Chair will once again ask that Sena\u00ad tors who wish to converse please retire to the Cloakrooms. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from Missouri. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator NICKLES be added as a cosponsor of this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, during the last vote, a number of Sen\u00ad ators came up to me and asked my thoughts on how that vote should go, and my response was it did not make any difference. So I know that some Senators who intend to vote for my amendment voted for the Metz\u00ad enbaum amendment, some Senators who intended to vote for my amend\u00ad ment voted against the Metzenbaum amendment. My own view, as I stated on the floor during the debate on the Metzenbaum amendment, was that it was very much like a motion to in\u00ad struct the Sergeant at Arms. It was a rollcall vote, but it had no content at all. It was a rollcall vote that purport\u00ad ed to touch on the question of wheth\u00ad er or not the Government is going to mandate abortions, but in point of fact it did not in any sense prevent the Government or some court from man\u00ad dating abortions or abortion coverage. It did not provide any cover whatever for Senators who voted on it. Some people might say, \"Well, is it some sort of compromise? Was the Metzenbaum\u00ad Weicker amendment some kind of compromise on the issue before us?\" The answer is no, it was not any com\u00ad promise. It was not half a loaf. It was not a slice. It was not a crumb. It was an absolute zero. It did not matter whether it was cast or not, because it had absolutely no legal effect on the issue that has been raised by my amendment. That is not simply my conclusion. When the language of the Metz\u00ad enbaum amendment was available, I asked for two opinions, one from the Justice Department and one from the Dewey, Ballantine law firm. I received both of those legal opinions today. Both of them stated that from the standpoint of the basic question of whether or not abortions or abortion coverage is going to be mandated, the Metzenbaum amendment had no legal effect. The Dewey, Ballantine op1mon, which is dated January 27, after set\u00ad ting forth the Metzenbaum amend\u00ad ment, states, \"Based on our review of this proposed amendment, we con\u00ad clude that it would not solve the prob\u00ad lem identified in our earlier memoran\u00ad dum. The proposed amendment de\u00ad clares the Civil Rights Restoration Act itself does not require the funding or performance of abortions. It is silent, however, on the possibility, which was the subject of our earlier letter and memorandum, that title IX and regu\u00ad lations promulgated under its author\u00ad ity could require the funding or per\u00ad formance of abortions. Moreover, since the Civil Rights Restoration Act would overturn the Supreme Court's decision in the Grove City case and thus extend the reach of title IX, the danger would remain, despite the pro\u00ad posed amendment, that institutions duly brought under the authority of title IX would also be required to fund or perform abortions for students, em\u00ad ployees, and even the general public as described in our earlier letter.\" Mr. President, the State of the bill as it now exists before the Senate, with the Metzenbaum-Weicker amend\u00ad ment which was just added, is that it remains a very live possibility that an administration or a court could require hospitals to perform abortions and could require health plans of colleges or universities to fund abortions. Now, if that is the result that we want, if we want that possibility to stay alive, then the thing to do is to vote against the Danforth amend\u00ad ment. If it is the decision of the Senate of the United States to leave it up to a Federal judge, to enter an order requiring abortions performed at Georgetown University Hospital, to re\u00ad quire abortion coverage under the health plan at Notre Dame University, and so on, if that is the intention of the Senate, let us leave it open. Let us reaffirm the regulations under title IX and kick the buck to the courts. 352 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 If, on the other hand, it is the posi\u00ad tion of the Senate that we should pre\u00ad clude that possibility in a court deci\u00ad sion or in a future regulation, then we should adopt the Danforth amend\u00ad ment. That is the very simple issue before us. Regulations under title IX of the education amendments identi\u00ad fied sex discrimination with the refus\u00ad al to perform or to provide abortions. The bill in its present form expressly ratifies those regulations. No language in a committee report to the contrary undoes the expressed language in the bill itself. So if we in the Senate want to ratify a regulation that identifies refusal to perform abortions with sex discrimination, and if we want to extend that interpretation throughout universities, to university hospitals, to hospitals that have internship pro\u00ad grams flowing out of those universi\u00ad ties, and to other hospitals which have any teaching program at all, if we want that kind of expanded interpre\u00ad tation, then vote against the Danforth amendment. I think it would be an absolute out\u00ad rage for the Senate, the Congress to force on Georgetown or Notre Dame or the city of St. Louis or wherever a policy that under the Hyde amend\u00ad ment we do not support ourselves. We do not fund abortions. We have made that decision. I do not under\u00ad stand why the Senate at this point should force even church-related col\u00ad leges and hospitals to do what we will not do ourselves. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Texas. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will be brief. What we have seen here is ex\u00ad actly the same kind of sham that has outraged the American people for years about this greatest of delibera\u00ad tive bodies. We have a clear-cut issue before us. The issue is as simple as any issue can be: Do we want to make it clear that under title IX, with the ex\u00ad pansion that is being contemplated, Baylor University and Notre Dame do not have to fund abortions or to per\u00ad form abortions in their medical facili\u00ad ties? Now, you can beat all around the bush. You can try to confuse the issue all you want. You can say, well, let us leave it undetermined as it is in the current law. But when you get down to the bottom line, when you vote on.the Danforth amendment, there is only one issue: Do we want to leave it open to some Federal judge to come along and say to Baylor University or Notre Dame or St. Mary's or any other pri\u00ad vate, church-related college in Amer\u00ad ica that although the fundamental teachings of your church are totally opposed to abortion, we are going to force you to fund abortion and we are going to force you to conduct abor\u00ad tions? Now, the great paradox is that the Congress will not even fund abortion under Medicaid unless the life of the mother is in danger, and yet here we have a clear-cut attempt to force church-related institutions to do what we have prohibited under Medicaid. So you can try to make this a technical question. You can cloud it and go back home and say we were neutral on this subject; it was unclear before. We left it unclear. The point of this amendment is that it ought not be unclear. There ought to be no doubt in anyone's mind that Baylor University should not be forced to fund something they fundamentally oppose. If you vote against this amendment, you are voting against that basic guarantee. I yield the floor. Mr. METZENBA UM. Does the Sena\u00ad tor from Texas understand that-\u00ad The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Texas has expired. Who yields time? Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes 44 seconds. Mr. HATCH. Let me yield 2 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under the control of the Sena\u00ad tor from Missouri, Senator DANFORTH. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, I yield-how long would the Senator like?-2 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from Missouri. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, this is one of those votes in the U.S. Senate for which it is extremely easy for this Senator to cast and support the Danforth amend\u00ad ment. The case has been adequately made in previous arguments before this body. And I will not attempt to rehash those statements. Suffice it to say unless the Danforth amendment becomes law we are leaving an unan\u00ad swered question that should not be left unanswered in this very, very im\u00ad portant civil rights legislation. I hope that all of the Members of this body will recognize and realize that the Danforth amendment is very simple, it is very straightforward. It simply says that we should not be in a position of forcing any institution re\u00ad gardless of its association to do some\u00ad thing for which the fundamental tenets of that institution-and funda\u00ad mental beliefs that many of us share\u00ad should not be put in jeopardy on a whim of one Federal judge at some time in the future. It is a clarifying amendment. It states clearly what we should do. I appeal to all of my colleagues to sup\u00ad port the Danforth amendment. It will do nothing in the opinion of this Sena\u00ad tor, and legal scholars that I have talked with, to harm or weaken the amendment that we are going to vote on, the bill itself, which has to do with civil rights. I hope we will pass the Danforth amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who yields time? Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. METZENBAUM addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, first I would like to point out to my friend from Texas that Baylor Univer\u00ad sity is specifically exempted under the religious tenet exemption. So his argu\u00ad ment in connection with that universi\u00ad ty is not applicable. Second, I want to point out that if you vote for our amendment, the Packwood -Kennedy -Weicker -Metz\u00ad enbaum amendment, you will be undo\u00ad ing that amendment 100 percent be\u00ad cause that amendment provides that \"Notwithstanding any other provision of the law or any other provision in this bill.\" So if you voted with us and now you vote for the Danforth amend\u00ad ment, you've totally turned around. It would be a 100-percent change in vote. I hope those who have seen fit to stand with us by 55 votes will see fit to reject the Danforth amendment. The big question is whether we are going to have a civil rights bill or an abortion bill. We have made it clear in our previously offered amendment now in the bill that this is a civil rights bill and we do not want it to be encumbered with abortion issues. If you vote for the Danforth amend\u00ad ment, you will have voted for language that totally negates the impact of our amendment, or at least language which would appear to do so on its face. That is the intent of the Dan\u00ad forth amendment. I hope it does not. But I am afraid that it will. The amendment offered by the Sen\u00ad ator from Missouri is also problematic because it does not preclude the impo\u00ad sition of a penalty on a woman if she has a legal abortion. The amendment says nothing in the preceding sentence \"* * * shall be construed to permit a penalty to be imposed on any person * * * because such person * * * has re\u00ad ceived any benefit or service related to a legal abortion.\" That language is extremely unclear. It says nothing in the amendment that permits a penalty but the lan\u00ad guage does not prohibit a penalty or discrimination against a woman who has had an abortion. For example, a woman who has had an abortion or who has been counseled for abortion January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 353 can be excluded from scholarship pro\u00ad grams, student employment, or even enrollment in classes. The Danforth amendment not only permits this dis\u00ad crimination but it also may encourage institutions to treat women differently because they exercise their constitu\u00ad tional right. If we pass this amendment, we sanc\u00ad tion discrimination against women who exercise their constitutional right. So this civil rights bill which we have introduced to expand the civil rights of all people would sanction dis\u00ad crimination against women. So I think it is fair to say that a vote for the Danforth amendment is a vote for dis\u00ad crimination against women. We say that is inappropriate. Another problem with the Danforth amendment is that it changes title IX to permit discrimination against women as the medical services provid\u00ad ed to them. The Danforth amendment says that \"Nothing in this title shall be construed to require or prohibit any person or public or private entity to provide or pay for any benefit or service including the use of facilities related to an abortion.\" This language means that if a uni\u00ad versity provides a medical service and that service has doctors who are ethi\u00ad cally required to counsel patients on medical options, it would not be dis\u00ad crimination to fail to counsel pregnant women on all options. What we say when we pass the Danforth amend\u00ad ment is that women are not victims of discrimination when they are denied all information about their options in\u00ad cluding the option of abortion. The discrimination that the Dan\u00ad forth amendment sanctions is the kind of discrimination that reduces women to less than full human beings because it denies women the information they need to make an important medical decision. There is not even a life of the mother exception in the Danforth amendment. And a woman could be bleeding to death from pregnancy complications and under the Danforth amendment she could be denied a life\u00ad saving abortion. A man who is bleed\u00ad ing to death can be saved. That, to me, is discrimination against women. We have already said we do not want to do anything about abortion. We have indicated we want to move for\u00ad ward with the Grove City legislation situation. I would hope that my col\u00ad leagues would not undo the impact of the amendment which we just passed. That is what this amendment would do. But much more important than that, this amendment would permit discriminatiqn against women in this country. How inappropriate, how wrong it would be to include in a civil rights bill language which would authorize the discrimination against all women. We must def eat the Danforth amendment. 19-059 0-89-12 (Pt. 1) Mr. DANFORTH addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would remind the gallery that they are here as guests of the Senate. The Senator from Missouri. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, the characterization of the bill by the Sen\u00ad ator from Ohio is completely errone\u00ad ous and totally without foundation at all. It is a fabrication. My amendment expressly says, \"Nothing in this sec\u00ad tion shall be construed to permit a penalty to be imposed on any person or individual because such person or individual is seeking or has received any benefit or service related to a legal abortion.\" I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from California. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. WILSON. Mr. President, at the risk of being rude, the Senator from Ohio has flatly misstated the contents of the Danforth provision. The lan\u00ad guage just read by the Senator from Missouri was language which I and others insisted be in there, precisely to ensure that there could not be discrim\u00ad ination against women who either are seeking or have received abortion-re\u00ad lated services. You could have voted for or against the Metzenbaum amendment. You could have voted for it as simply being a truism, as Mr. DANFORTH said, with\u00ad out content, or voted against it as being a sham aimed at trying to per\u00ad suade people that it would suffice and that there was no need for the Dan\u00ad forth amendment. There is need for the Danforth amendment. To focus momentarily on the strict legal question, the amendment by Sen\u00ad ator METZENBAUM stated that the bill does not require abortion, but it does not reach the off ending regulation which gives rise to the need for the Danforth amendment. That need con\u00ad tinues to exist, even with the Metz\u00ad enbaum amendment in it. The Metz\u00ad enbaum amendment is without con\u00ad tent. The Danforth amendment is re\u00ad quired to prevent a travesty. I am prochoice, but I will be hanged if I can see my way or want the Con\u00ad gress of the United States to be on record as imposing upon someone who conscientiously objects to providing or funding abortion, as something moral\u00ad ly repugnant to him or to her or to their institution, to be compelled by a Federal bribe to do so. That is wrong. We should not leave the law unclear. The argument has been made that we should go back to what it was before Grove City. It is not what the law was. The question is what the law should be. It should be clear. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who yields time? The Senator from Missouri has re\u00ad maining 4 minutes and 37 seconds. The Senator from Ohio has remaining 12 seconds. If neither side yields time, the time available will be counted equally against both sides. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Texas. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 1 minute. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to respond to the Senator from Ohio. First, is he aware that Baylor Uni\u00ad versity waited 9 years to get an exemp\u00ad tion? They currently have an exemp\u00ad tion. But, as we are all aware, under the law, a new Secretary could come into office, do an investigation, and deny them that exemption. Let me give the names of some Texas colleges that are religion affili\u00ad ated that have asked for exemptions, and that for one reason or another did not get them: The Dallas Theological Seminar, Lubbock Christian College, University of Dallas, Southwestern As\u00ad semblies of God College, Concordia Lutheran College. I ask my colleagues: Do we really want to leave any doubt as to whether Lubbock Christian College should have to conduct and/or pay for abor\u00ad tions if that is against the tenets of their religious beliefs? That is the issue here, and I urge my colleagues to f OCUS on that. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who yields time? Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves the remainder of his time. If neither side yields, the time will be counted equally against both sides. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, purely and simply, this is a question of fund\u00ad ing for abortion. Access to abortion is not affected by the Danforth amend\u00ad ment. The fact is, Mr. President, that the Weicker-Metzenbaum amendment does not solve the problem which is raised here today by Senator DAN\u00ad FORTH. Are we going to force all col\u00ad leges and many other institutions to pay for or perform abortions despite any decision of conscience or religious belief to the contrary? That is what the Danforth amendment addresses, pure and simple. Again, the Danforth amendment merely eliminates the coercion factor. Colleges and hospitals and other insti\u00ad tutions will be free to provide for abor\u00ad tions if they want to, if they choose to, even under this amendment. But the 354 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 amendment ensures that they are not forced to fund or perform abortions if they object on the ground of con\u00ad science or religious belief. It is outrageous for the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment not \u00b7to choose to fund abor\u00ad tions, on one hand, and to require col\u00ad leges or hospitals to fund or perform abortions, on the other hand-if you think about it, merely because those institutions receive, directly or indi\u00ad rectly, Federal funding. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. HATCH. May I have an addi\u00ad tional 30 seconds? Mr. DANFORTH. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the follow\u00ad ing documents printed in the RECORD. An analysis of student health insur\u00ad ance plans and a criticism by the U.S. Department of Education; a letter from the U.S. Catholic Conference, dated January 27, 1988; a letter from the U.S. Catholic Conference, dated January 27, 1988, with respect to inac\u00ad curacies in the January 21, 1988, letter from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, regarding this bill; a letter dated January 28, 1988, from the National Right to Life Committee. There being no objection, the mate\u00ad rial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, Washington, DC, June 11, 1987. To: Alicia Coro, Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights. From: Philip G. Kiko, Acting Director, Policy and Enforcement Service. Subject: Analysis of Student Health Insur\u00ad ance Plans. CONCLUSION Due to the current Title IX regulation, OCR has been placed in the position of being committed to its enforcement when such a practice sometimes appears to have been in conflict with the religious rights guaranteed under the First Amendment and a consistent Federal policy manifested in the Hyde Amendment, Title VII, which in\u00ad cludes an abortion-neutral provision, and other Federal statutes. The essential diffi\u00ad culty has been caused by the inclusion of the terms \"termination of pregnancy\" and \"full gynecological care\" within the defini\u00ad tion of sex discrimination in the Title IX regulation, as it relates to mandated cover\u00ad age for elective abortions. INTRODUCTION Pursuant to our discussion and your in\u00ad structions, the Policy and Enforcement Service conducted an analysis of the provi\u00ad sions of the Title IX regulation on health benefits and services, as it pertains to OCR's recent investigations of recipients' health insurance programs. During the past three years, the Office for Civil Rights has received 693 complaints which allege that recipients of Federal fi\u00ad nancial funds have violated the regulation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Specifically, each complaint alleged that a recipient of Federal funds violated the Title IX regulation by not providing the same student insurance benefits for preg\u00ad nancy and pregnancy-related conditions as are provided for other temporary disabil\u00ad ities. Of the 693 complaints filed, all but one have been closed by OCR's regional offices. A total of 486 cases were closed when it was determined that no jurisdiction existed over the insurance programs of the institutions. Five of the \"no jurisdiction \" determinations involved the granting of a religious exemp\u00ad tion under Title IX. Of the remaining com\u00ad plaints, 24 were closed for administrative reasons, 13 were closed when no violation was found within the insurance plans, and 169 were closed when a voluntary agree\u00ad ment was reached between OCR and the re\u00ad cipients. Many of the complaints specifically requested: \"Please abor\u00ad tion is covered. <emphasis added).\" <See, e.g., 01-86-2041.) The voluntary agreements were entered into before jurisdiction over the health in\u00ad surance plans of the institutions was deter\u00ad mined. The fact that 169 institutions en\u00ad tered into these agreements before jurisdic\u00ad tion was determined suggests that the mere filing of the compliant and the commence\u00ad ment of an investigation by the Department of Education was all that was necessary to motivate the institutions to enter into agreements to either < 1) amend the benefits of insurance plans, or <2> cancel their offer\u00ad ings of insurance plans for their students. VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT PLANS As stated above, OCR has entered into voluntary agreements with 169 institutions. These institutions including some that are religiously affiliated, agreed to take correc\u00ad tive measures before jurisdiction under Title IX was determined. In responses to these cases, a memorandum dated March 7, 1986, was sent by the Acting Assistant Sec\u00ad retary for Civils Rights. The memorandum notified the regional offices that the institu\u00ad tions which were subjected to the health in\u00ad surance investigations should be informed of their rights under Section 901(a)(3) of Title IX. The memorandum also attempted to clarify the meaing of the term \"tempo\u00ad rary disability \" within 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 106.40<b><4> 106.57<c>. Subsequently, this Policy lyzed the complaints, OCR's regional inves\u00ad tigations, and OCR's regional agreements with the institutions. The analysis revealed that the institutions adopted corrective action plans in order to bring their health insurance plans into full compliance with the pertinent provisions of the Title IX reg\u00ad ulation. Several institutions that were inves\u00ad tigated requested exemptions based upon the religious tenets exemption of Section 90l<a><3> of Title IX and its implementing regulation, 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 86.12. However, other institutions that may have been eligible for the religious tenets exemption apparently were unaware of its existence, failed to ask for it, and thus revised their health insur\u00ad ance plans to fully comply with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 106.39, 106.40<b><4>, and 106.57(c). These revisions appear to contradict the religious tenets of some affected institutions; exemp\u00ad tions had been granted for other institu\u00ad tions in similarly situated instances. In one complaint which resulted in a vol\u00ad untary agreement , <complaint # 02-86- 2035 >. the complainant alleged that a Catholic college violated Title IX by not providing elective abortion coverage in its student health insurance plan. OCR investi\u00ad gated the compliant and found the college in violation of 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 106.40<b><4>. Under the college's student health insur\u00ad ance plan, \"voluntary termination of preg\u00ad nancy was explicitly excluded from cover-age, while, according to the insurance carri\u00ad er, other elective surgery generally was cov\u00ad ered\" (p. 3, voluntary agreement # 02-86- 2035). OCR held that \"the College was unable to provide OCR with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, for its limitations on pregnancy-related medical benefits.\" (Id.) Thus, the insurance plan was deter\u00ad mined to be discriminatory and in violation of Section 106.40(b)(4). The result of the complainant 's allegation that Title IX had been violated by this Catholic college for not providing coverage for elective abortion was summarized in a letter from OCR to the College: \"In a letter dated March 3, 1986, the Col\u00ad lege advised OCR that it has taken correc\u00ad tive action to secure voluntary compliance with Title IX. Specifically, effective Febru\u00ad ary 26, 1986, the College has eliminated the four-day limit on maternity care benefits, and deleted the exclusion of termination of pregnancy .... \"([d.) <emphasis added). Based upon the above remedial action by the College, OCR stated: \"We consider the College to be presently fulfilling its obliga\u00ad tions under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Continued compliance is contingent upon the College carrying out the provisions of its plan. Failure to imple\u00ad ment the plan fully may result in a finding of violation.\" Ud.> It should be noted that after OCR's com\u00ad plaint investigation began, but before a final determination on jurisdiction was made, the Catholic College decided to revise its insurance plan. The following is a quote from a letter from the Dean of Students, who is a Catholic nun, to the president of the insurance company: \"In addition, [the College} wishes to delete, effective today's date, [February 26, 1986}, under the maternity care clause, the sen\u00ad tence, 'Elective abortions are not covered '. This limitation is no longer to be included in our Student Accident and Insurance Plan <emphasis added).\" Thank you for your assistance in assuring that [the College] is in full compliance with the federal requirements under Title IX. This Catholic nun's letter exemplifies the impact that the complaint and subsequent investigatory process can have upon a recip\u00ad ient of Federal financial assistance . In complaint No. 01-86-2075, the insur\u00ad ance plan of a Catholic college originally ex\u00ad cluded coverage for \"voluntary termination of pregnancy.\" After the complaint process had concluded with the signing of a volun\u00ad tary agreement, the president of the Col\u00ad lege, a member of a Catholic religious order, wrote to OCR and stated: \"[The College] has committed itself to full compliance with the various laws and regulations forbidding discriminatory prac\u00ad tices and will continue to do so.\" The president of this College enclosed a copy of the revised insurance plan with this letter; the exclusion of voluntary termina\u00ad tion of pregnancy in the former plan had been deleted in the revised plan. Many of the voluntary agreements begin with the requirement that the institution agree that its student health insurance plan will comply with Sections 106.39 and 106.40(b)(4) of the Title IX regulation. These agreements request that the student health insurance plans provide benefits for \"pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, ter\u00ad mination of pregnancy, and related medical conditions and recovery therefrom.\" If pro\u00ad vided, these benefits must be provided to the same extent as benefits are provided for other temporary disabilities. January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 355 Approximately 30 of the voluntary agree\u00ad ments include an example of what the stu\u00ad dent health insurance plan must cover in order to comply with the Title IX regula\u00ad tion. These agreements state: \"If the plan provides major medical cover\u00ad age, specifies a maximum level of costs, covers the cost of a private room, or pays the cost of office visits to physicians for temporary disabilities, pregnancy-related conditions must be treated the same.\" These approximately 30 agreements also state: \"The University will not require students to pay a disparate premium for comparable coverage of pregnancy-related conditions under its student health insurance plan.\" Approximately 30 voluntary agreements also include an attachment, marked \"Exhib\u00ad it A.\" This attachment fully quotes Sections 106.39 and 106.40<b)(4) of the Title IX regu\u00ad lation. The quote from Section 106.39 states, in pertinent part: \"This section shall not prohibit a recipi\u00ad ent from providing any benefit or service which may be used by a different propor\u00ad tion of students of one sex than of another, including family planning services. However, any recipient which provides full coverage health service shall provide gynecological care.\" A number of insurance plans are enclosed herein; they indicate that corrective action taken as a result of the filing of these com\u00ad plaints has resulted in the inclusion of elec\u00ad tion abortion coverage in institutional in\u00ad surance plans. For example, in complaint #01-86-2055, the former policy excluded coverage for \"childbirth, pregnancy and complications thereof.\" After the OCR in\u00ad vestigation, revised policy included the following coverage: \"[MJaternity, complica\u00ad tions of maternity, and abortion shall be payable as any other illness.\" In complaint #01-86-2041, the insurance policy excluded coverage of \"elective treat\u00ad ment, preventive medicines, serums or vac\u00ad cines where no injury or sickness is in\u00ad volved.\" This provision was replaced with \"preventive medicines, serums or vaccines.\" Thus, elective treatments, such as abortion, were added to the coverage of the policy. In complaint #01-86-2024, the universi\u00ad ty's insurance plan was also revised after OCR's investigation. Attached to the revised insurance plan was a letter from the insur\u00ad ance company to the college, stating the fol\u00ad lowing: \"Subject to all the terms of your contract, your benefits have been changed.\" ... 2. Termination of Pregnancy Services: The benefits that are available under your contract for the treatment of a medical con\u00ad dition are also available for termination of pregnancy. The following insurance plans are en\u00ad closed in order to demonstrate the changes which occurred after the complaint and OF HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS Approximately 12 of the institutions which were subjected to the complaint and investigation process decided to terminate their offerings of health insurance to the students. <See, e.g., #03-86-2105.) In one complaint against a religiously affiliated col\u00ad lege, < #06-85-2077), the complainant al\u00ad leged that the college discriminated against female students by not offering an insur\u00ad ance plan that treats pregnancy-related con\u00ad ditions in the same manner as other tempo\u00ad rary disabilities. Subsequent to the filing of this complaint and during OCR's investiga\u00ad tion, the college discontinued offering a health insurance plan for its students. In a similar instance, < # 10-85-2041 ), a uni\u00ad versity entered into a voluntary agreement to find a carrier that would \"provide cover\u00ad age for pregnancy and related conditions.\" Because of the university's small enroll\u00ad ment, it was unable to find a carrier willing to provide the expanded coverage. Thus, this university was compelled to not offer a student health insurance plan due to the economic burdens placed upon it by the complaint and subsequent agreement with OCR. Enclosed herein are copies of voluntary agreements between OCR and the recipi\u00ad ents which resulted in the termination of student health insurance plans by the insti\u00ad tutions. <See, e.g., #06-85-2081, 06-85-2082, and 08-86-2034.) COMMENTS This office is currently reviewing the vol\u00ad untary agreements reached between OCR and state university education systems, in\u00ad stitutions, or other public schools. The abor\u00ad tion provisions of the Title IX regulation conflict with the laws of some states that prohibit the use of state funds for abor\u00ad tions. It is important to discover whether the enforcement of the abortion provisions of the regulation may have resulted in the violation of state laws by any public recipi\u00ad ent. In addressing federalism principles, an analysis will be conducted to measure the extent to which a conflict exists between OCR's voluntary agreements and state laws. The above analysis does not review the present circumstances of private and public hospitals receiving Federal financial assist\u00ad ance, since they are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Title IX regulation also conflicts with Federal policy to prohibit funding for abor\u00ad tion. In 1976, Congress enacted the Hyde Amendment, which repeatedly was re-en\u00ad acted in succeeding years, to prohibit Feder\u00ad al funds from being used to pay for nearly all abortions in programs receiving Medicaid funds, with limited and clearly specified ex\u00ad ceptions. For example, the current version of the Hyde Amendment states: \"None of the funds contained in this act shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be en\u00ad dangered if the fetus were carried to term.\" The Federal policy to prohibit funding for abortion is exemplified by several other Federal statutes as well: 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1093 prohibits, in the provision of medical care to members of the armed forces, the use of Federal funds to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be en\u00ad dangered if the fetus were carried to term; 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2151b (f)(l) and (2) state that none of the funds provided for international development assistance shall be used for abortions as a method of family planning or to motivate any person to practice abortion; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300a-6 prohibits the use of Fed\u00ad eral funds by any population research and family planning program where abortion is a method of family planning; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300z-10 prohibits the payment of Federal grants to any Adolescent Family Life Dem\u00ad onstration Projects that provide abortions or abortion counseling or referral; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996f <bH8) states that Legal Services Cor\u00ad poration funds shall not be used for legal as-sistance with respect to proceedings that seek to procure a nontherapeutic abortion. The abortion provisions of the Title IX regulation adopted by the Department di\u00ad rectly contravene the Federal policy to pro\u00ad hibit Federal funding for abortion, as exem\u00ad plified by numerous congressional enact\u00ad ments. The regulation requires funding of abortion, where other Federal legislation prohibits such funding. In so doing, the reg\u00ad ulation creates a confusing inconsistency within Federal law. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibiting discrimination in employment, appropriately does not include a provision prohibiting the use of Federal funds for abortion, inasmuch as no Federal funding is involved; significantly, however, Title VII does include an abortion-neutral provision that protects employers from being forced to cover employees in their health insurance benefits: \"This subsection shall not require an em\u00ad ployer to pay for health insurance benefits for abortion, except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, or except where medi\u00ad cal complications have arisen from an abor\u00ad tion.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e (k). The inconsistent policy between the Title IX regulation and the Title VII provision may subject an insti\u00ad tution to conflicting legal standards govern\u00ad ing the type of coverage that is mandated for health insurance plans. Thus, an institu\u00ad tion could be placed in the anomalous posi\u00ad tion of having the same health insurance plan being in compliance with Title VII as it relates to coverage for abortion and in viola\u00ad tion of the Title IX regulation as it relates to coverage for termination of pregnancy. The right to choose whether to cover abor\u00ad tion that is secured employers by Title VII is abrogated by the Title IX regulation for those employers that are federally funded educational institutions. A resolution of this dilemma could be achieved through the legislative process. It is the legal opinion of this Acting Director that if the abortion-neutral language of the Sensenbrenner-Tauke amendment and the religious tenets amendment contained in either H.R. 1881 or the legislation that was adopted in the House Education and Labor Committee in the 99th Congress, had been enacted into law, OCR would have been able to enforce the Title IX proscriptions against pregnancy discrimination without the com\u00ad plications outlined above. Specifically, OCR would not be placed in the position of run\u00ad ning afoul of the First Amendment and the existent Federal policy that is manifested by such Federal statutes as the Hyde Amendment and Title VII. In the 99th Congress, the House Educa\u00ad tion and Labor Committee adopted the Sen\u00ad senbrenner-Tauke amendment. It is my un\u00ad derstanding that this amendment will be of\u00ad fered in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate when any Grove City legislation is considered by either body. Thus, no regulatory revisions are necessary until congress acts. Furthermore, a revision from the legislative process is preferable since a mere regulatory change could be de\u00ad leted in the future. Thus, OCR has witnessed a conflict be\u00ad tween the constitutional rights of some re\u00ad cipients and a Federal policy of proscribing Federal funds for abortions, on the one hand, and enforcement of the provisions of the Title IX regulation concerning \"gyneco\u00ad logical care\" and \"termination of pregnan\u00ad cy,\" on the other hand. 356 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 U.S. CATHOLIC CONFERENCE, Washington, DC, January 27, 1988. DEAR SENATOR: As the Senate considers the Civil Rights Restoration Act <S. 557 ), the U.S. Catholic Conference wishes to reaf\u00ad firm its conviction regarding this important legislation. We wish to renew our support for efforts to strengthen and make more ef\u00ad fective the federal commitment to combat discrimination in our nation. The U.S. Catholic Bishops have actively supported the major civil rights acts that have come before the Congress. Our consistent support is based on our strong beliefs that govern\u00ad ment has the fundamental moral duty to protect and enhance the life, dignity and rights of the human person. In our teaching and advocacy, we have sought to condemn racism and unjust dis\u00ad crimination and to work for full equality and opportunity for all people. The USCC supports the goals of the Civil Rights Resto\u00ad ration Act-to insure that federal funds and institutions that receive federal funds do not discriminate. But we cannot support a measure which, under the guise of \"civil rights,\" would require any entity to provide abortion services, which we and millions of other Americans regard as the destruction of innocent human life and a violation of fundamental human rights. We therefore renew our call for the adop\u00ad tion of the Abortion Neutral Amendment to be offered by Senator Danforth and the passage of strong civil rights legislation which combats discrimination without in\u00ad fringing on the legitimate rights of religious institutions and without requiring any insti\u00ad tution to participate in abortion. BACKGROUND The Civil Rights Restoration Act <CRRA) would amend four civil rights laws, includ\u00ad ing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Title IX prohibits discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" in federally assisted education programs. In 1975, federal regula\u00ad tions interpreted Title IX to require institu\u00ad tions to treat abortion the same as pregnan\u00ad cy in student and employee health and other insurance programs. Title IX was enacted in 1972 when it was illegal in most states to perform abortions except to save the mother's life. Clearly, the Congress that enacted Title IX did not intend to mandate that institutions provide or pay for abortion services as a condition for receiving federal funds. In its 1984 Grove City College v. Bell deci\u00ad sion, the Supreme Court construed Title IX to apply only to specific programs receiving federal assistance. The CRRA would reverse that decision and expand coverage under civil rights laws, which we support. Howev\u00ad er, in expanding the reach of Title IX, the CRRA as drafted would also inevitably expand the reach of the proabortion regula\u00ad tions to entire institutions. The CRRA and the abortion regulations would apply to non-educational institutions having educa\u00ad tion components, and thus would affect hos\u00ad pitals. The Catholic Health Association <CHA), which represents over 600 Catholic hospitals in the United States, has conclud\u00ad ed that S. 557 \" ... could require all Catho\u00ad lic hospitals which participate in teaching or other educational programs, e.g., interns, residents, nursing students, to provide abor\u00ad tion services.\" To prevent these results, the Senate needs to adopt the following amendment to be of\u00ad fered by Senator Danforth: \"Section 909. Nothing in this title shall be construed to require or prohibit any person or public or private entity to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including use of facilities, related to abortion. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a penalty to be imposed on any person be\u00ad cause such person has received any benefit or service related to legal abortion.\" The CHA supports this amendment, as does the American Hospital Association <AHA), which represents 5,600 institutions. AHA maintains that \" ... a hospital-reli\u00ad giously affiliated or secular-should be free to choose whether abortion-related benefits and services will be performed in its institu\u00ad tion without fear of violating Title IX regu\u00ad lations.\" The amendment has rightly been called abortion neutral because it does not prevent institutions from including abortion services, but merely does not force institu\u00ad tions to include abortion services against their deep conviction or policies. If the \"Danforth\" amendment is not included in the CRRA, then the federal government will be in the ironic position of denying fed\u00ad eral funds for abortions through the Hyde Amendment, while simultaneously requiring under Title IX that public and private orga\u00ad nizations provide abortion coverage with non-Federal funds. We also understand that Senator Orrin Hatch will offer an amendment at the re\u00ad quest of the National Association of Inde\u00ad pendent Colleges and Universities <NAICU), to broaden the religious tenets exception. We are sympathetic to their concerns in this area and are supportive of the amend\u00ad ment. The Senate need not choose between greater protection of civil rights and the concerns of the Catholic Bishops. With these improvements, we believe the Civil Rights Restoration Act can help this nation fulfill its commitment to protect individuals against discrimination. We urge strong sup\u00ad port of a bill with the protections we have advocated. We do not support any other amendments which we believe would weaken the bill's basic civil rights protec\u00ad tions. We support a strong and effective Civil Rights Restoration Act, one that will combat discrimination without requiring any institution to violate deeply held convic\u00ad tions of human life and religious liberty. Sincerely, Rev. Msgr. DANIEL F. HOYE, General Secretary. U.S. CATHOLIC CONFERENCE, Washington, DC, January 27, 1988. DEAR SENATOR: I am writing as a result of several inquiries which have been made con\u00ad cerning a memorandum on S.557, the Civil Rights Restoration Act, circulated to mem\u00ad bers of the Senate by the Leadership Con\u00ad ference on Civil Rights <LCCR>. This corre\u00ad spondence addresses several of the same issues which are of concern to the Catholic Bishops Conference in this proposed civil rights legislation. The enclosed fact sheet corrects the record and documents several of the inad\u00ad equacies in this memorandum. I hope you will find this helpful to you in dealing with this very important legislation. Sincerely, FRANK J. MONAHAN, Director. JANUARY 26, 1988. INACCURACIES IN THE JANUARY 21, 1988 LETTER FROM THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE ON CIVIL RIGHTS REGARDING S. 557 The January 21, 1988 letter and accompa\u00ad nying memoranda to each U.S. Senator from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights regarding proposed amendments to S. 557 contain inaccuracies which can only serve to confuse the Senate and the public in the ongoing debate on S. 557 and the need for the \"Danforth\" amendment. Pro\u00ad ponents rely heavily on the \"principle of restoration\" as the reason for opposing any amendments to S. 557. As will be demon\u00ad strated below, the restoration principle is at least as much myth as it is reality. Follow\u00ad ing are several illustrative examples from that letter, and Committee Report 100-64, which do not comport with reality. 1. Myth.-\"Proponents of the Restoration Act have adhered unswervingly to the fun\u00ad damental principle of simply restoring cov\u00ad erage ... and have opposed every amend\u00ad ment that would change substantive law.\" See page 1 of the letter. Reality.-Proponents in fact have support\u00ad ed changes in substantive law in S. 557. As reported, the bill contains at least two sub\u00ad stantive changes in current law, e.g., the re\u00ad ligious tenet exemption in Title IX has been broadened and the definition of \"program or activity\" for the four amended statutes now singles out for special treatment five kinds of private organizations (i.e., those en\u00ad gaged principally in education, health care, housing, social services, or parks or recrea\u00ad tion). Proponents admit in Committee Report No. 100-64 <at p. 18) that the defini\u00ad tion of \"program or activity\" differs from what they perceive as the scope of coverage prior to the Grove City College decision. In addition, in at least one respect, S. 557 would require a substantive change in long\u00ad standing regulations. Under current Title VI regulations which predate the regulations implementing the other three statutes, there is no per se rule of institution-wide coverage of all activities for institutions such as hospitals and universities. Such cov\u00ad erage is merely presumed unless the institu\u00ad tion \"establishes, to the satisfaction of the responsible Department official, that the in\u00ad stitution's practices in designated parts or programs of the institution will in no way affect its practices in the program of the in\u00ad stitution for which Federal financial assist\u00ad ance is sought, or the beneficiaries of or participants in such program.\" 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.4(d)(2). S. 557 would eliminate buttable presumption of institution-wide coverage. S. Rep. 100-64 does not attempt to explain this deviation from the principle of restoration. The above can hardly be described as un\u00ad swerving adherence to the principle of res\u00ad toration. In reality, proponents have sup\u00ad ported substantive amendments that suit their purposes while hiding behind the rhet\u00ad oric of the so-called \"restoration principle\" to oppose other meritorious amendments. 2. Myth.-\"It should also be emphasized that Title IX does not now require any insti\u00ad tution to perform abortions .... \" See page 2 of the letter. Reality.-Section 106.39 of the current Title IX regulations provides in relevant part that \"[i]n providing a medical, hospi\u00ad tal, accident, or life insurance, benefit, serv\u00ad ice, policy, or plan to any of its students ... any recipient which provides full coverage health service shall provide gynecological care.\" 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 106.39. The Title IX regu\u00ad lations require abortion to be treated the same as pregnancy and other temporary dis\u00ad abilities. Abortion services would have to be provided as part of gynecological care in the case of a recipient, such as an educational institution, if it provides full coverage health service. Myth.-\"No institution would be mandated to perform abortions if S. 557 were en-~\u00b7 __..~J--Y,.V-:\"\"\"~--... . ~ ' ,' ~- . January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 357 acted.\" See page 26 of Senate Report 100- 64. Reality.-As indicated above, section 106.39 of the current Title IX regulations on its face already requires certain recipients to provide abortion services. In addition, assertions in the Committee Report may lead the Senate and the public to believe that the language, \"all of the op\u00ad erations of\", which modifies all categories of entities described in the new definition of \"program or activity,\" will mean one thing <i.e., all of the activities) for educational in\u00ad stitutions such as colleges, but will mean something else <i.e., only certain activities) with respect to other institutions such as hospitals. This is simply doublespeak. It defies common sense, violates well-estab\u00ad lished rules of statutory construction, and is blatantly inconsistent with the concept of \"institutional\" coverage embodied in S. 557. Courts will simply not give two different meanings to a single phrase in a sentence despite what the Committee Report sug\u00ad gests. Finally, the Committee Report <at p. 2) stated that one of the purposes of S. 557 is \"to reaffirm ... executive branch interpre- tation ... which provided for broad cover- age ... of these civil rights statutes.\" In this respect it should be noted that in inter\u00ad preting the scope of Title IX's coverage in 1975, then HEW Secretary Weinberger stated that \"if Federal funds go to an insti\u00ad tution which has educational programs, then the institution is covered throughout its activities.\" See Grove City College v. Bell, 104 S.Ct. 1211, 1233 <Brennan, J., concurring and dissenting in part). Once S. 557 is en\u00ad acted, the stated purpose of the bill, Secre\u00ad tary Weinberger's 1975 interpretation, along with the all inclusive \"all of the operations of\" language, will be relied upon to extend Title IX coverage to all activities of institu\u00ad tions such as hospitals that have been sin\u00ad gled out for broad coverage in S. 557. Be\u00ad cause S. 557 now singles out health care or\u00ad ganizations for special corporate-wide cover\u00ad age, courts will conclude that \"all of the op\u00ad erations of\" a hospital which has an educa\u00ad tional activity and receives federal assist\u00ad ance will be subject to Title IX coverage, in\u00ad cluding the abortion requirements. 4. Myth.-Citing the Senate Committee Report, proponents indicate that Title IX would \"apply only with respect to students and employees of educational programs\u00ad not to a hospital's patients.\" See page 1 of the memorandum relating to abortion amendments attached to the letter. Reality.-As enacted in 1972, Title IX ap\u00ad plies to persons, which on its face is broad enough to include patients and is not limit\u00ad ed to students and employees of education programs. In this respect, it is interesting to note that longstanding regulations under Title VI, which is the seminal statute after which Title IX and the other two affected statutes are patterned, embody the principle that \"[i]n a research or demonstration grant to such an institution [a hospital] dis\u00ad crimination is prohibited with respect to any educational activity and any provision of medical or other service and any financial aid to individuals incident to the program .\" <Emphasis added.) 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.5(d). Ap\u00ad plying this principle, and given the very broad \"all of the operation\" language, it is unrealistic to believe that courts will inter\u00ad pret Title IX to prohibit hospitals from dis\u00ad criminating against students and employees while at the same time allowing the hospital and its employees to discriminate against patients, such as pregnant women, who re\u00ad ceive medical services. 5. Myth.-Committee Report states: \"Judicial recognition of tion wide coverage waned only after the Su\u00ad preme Court opinion in North Haven See, e.g., Dougherty County School System v. Bell, 694 F.2D 78 <5th Cir., 1982) (follows North Haven dicta that Title IX requires program specific interpretation). Prior to North Haven the weight of authority was clearly on the side of institution wide cover\u00ad age of the civil rights statutes.\" Reality.-Prior to North Haven the weight of judicial authority was clearly running against institution-wide coverage of the civil rights statutes. The Committee Report does recognize some contrary authority but un\u00ad derstates the weight of that authority by failing to recognize other Court of Appeals cases had already ruled against institution\u00ad wide coverage. See, e.g., Romeo Community Schools v. U.S. HEW, 438 F. Sup. 1021, (E.D. Mich. 1977), aff'd, 600 F.2d 581 (6th Cir. 1979), cert denied, 444 U.S. 972 0979) (\"HEW contends that the term 'program or activity' as used in \u00a7 1681 [Title IX] refers to the entire operation of the recipient edu\u00ad cational institution .... Hence, HEW argues that it may regulate employment practices through a school district's entire system. This novel and protean interpretation of a well established statutory term was thor\u00ad oughly refuted in Board of Public Instruc\u00ad tion of Taylor Co. v. Finch, 414 F.2d 1068, 1077 (5th Cir. 1969).\" 438 F. Supp. 18); Mandel v. HEW, 411 F. Supp. 542 <D.Md. 1976) affirm'd by equally divided court, 571 F.2d 1273 <4th Cir. 1976) (\"There is much authority for the proposition that Title VI requires HEW to employ a pro\u00ad gram-by-program analysis when reviewing federally funded institutions.\" 411 F.Supp. at 556). One can only assume that proponents' continued denials of the extent of contrary authority stems from a need to defend the so-called principle of restoration at all costs in order to avoid any amendments, however meritorious, to S. 557. In addition, there are other interesting facts which proponents routinely do not ac\u00ad knowledge. For example, North Haven was a unanimous decision. There were no dis\u00ad senters to the program-specific discussion of Title IX in the case, which the Committee Report (at p. 10, n. 1) acknowledges paved the way for Grove City. Grove City itself, was a 6-3 decision with no Justice, including those in dissent, advocating the per se insti\u00ad tution-wide coverage standard that propo\u00ad nents assert had always been the case. Of particular relevance here, even Justice Brennan recognized that \"the program spe\u00ad cific language in Title IX was designed to ensure that the reach of the statute is de\u00ad pendent upon the scope of federal financial assistance provided to an institution.\" Grove City College v. Bell, 104 S.Ct. 1211, 1237 (1984) <Brennan, J., dissenting). Crucial to the validity of the restoration principle is a 1969 case, Board of Public In\u00ad struction of Taylor County v. Finch, 414 F.2d 1068 (5th Cir.), on which proponents heavily rely for the proposition that \"courts assumed and endorsed institution-wide cov\u00ad erage.\" Committee Report at p. 10. While various administrative officials undoubtedly urged this interpretation on the courts, the majority of Circuit Courts rejected this in\u00ad terpretation. In the words of Justice Bren\u00ad nan, the court in Taylor v. Finch \"refused to assume . . . that defects in one part of a school automatically infect the whole ... and rejected the definition of the term pro\u00ad gram offered by the Department. . .. ' \" Grove City College v. Bell, 104 S.Ct. 1211, 1231 <Brennan, J., dissenting) <citations omitted). Finally, the Eleventh Circuit re\u00ad cently described the Finch holding in the following manner: \"Our predecessor court sided with the Taylor County School Board. In a ruling later cited with approval by the Supreme Court, Finch held that HEW's attempt to characterize the entire school system as the relevant 'program' was contrary to the legis\u00ad lative history of title VI. A review of the congressional debate showed that the legis\u00ad lators expected the statute to be applied to narrowly focused grants, referring by name to programs such as the school lunch pro\u00ad gram, the agriculture extension program for home economics teachers, aid for vocational agriculture teaching, and aid to impacted school districts. The Finch court concluded that Congress intended title VI to apply 'to particular grant statutes ... , not to a collec\u00ad tive concept known as a school program or a road program.' \" U.S. v. State of Alabama, 828 F.2d 1532, 1549-50 0987) (citations and footnotes omit\u00ad ted). Put simply, courts have generally re\u00ad jected the misinterpretation of Finch advo\u00ad cated by administrative officials. 6. Myth.-\"[Tl he bill deals only with how much of an entity is covered-not with what it must do once it is covered.\" See page 1 of the memorandum relating to abortion at\u00ad tached to the letter. Reality.-Proponents cannot deny that, if enacted, S. 557 will extend coverage under the four affected statutes to more oper\u00ad ations and activities of covered institutions than is the case at the present time. Institu\u00ad tions will have to bring newly covered oper\u00ad ations and activities into compliance with the four affected statutes. The very purpose of S. 557 is to insure coverage of these ac\u00ad tivities. Yet, disingenuously, proponents at\u00ad tempt to separate the extended coverage provided by S. 557 from the effect of that coverage on newly covered activities. Who is kidding whom? Despite protestations to the contrary, an entity must, of course, do some\u00ad thing once covered-it must bring its activi\u00ad ties into compliance. With respect to Title IX, whatever one's views are regarding proponents' restoration principle and assertions regarding coverage of hospital patients, no one can deny that S. 557 will require more abortion coverage in employee and student health and benefit programs. Attempting to counter the reality that S. 557 will result in the application of the pro-abortion Title IX regulations to more activities, proponents routinely trot out a statement taken out of context from a 1985 legal analysis prepared for the United States Catholic Conference. Proponents consistently fail to disclose that in the same paragraph, the legal analysis concluded that the \"bill would extend the reach of the Title IX [abortion] regulations ... to all of the operations of ... organizations that re\u00ad ceive federal assistance and operate educa\u00ad tion programs.\" Conclusion.-As the above demonstrates, there are many inaccuracies associated with the restoration principle. This is not to sug\u00ad gest that there is no need for a Restoration Act. The Conference has consistently sup\u00ad ported the need to reverse the Grove City College decision and broaden coverage of the four civil rights statutes. This does not mean that the Conference must accept the lobbying rhetoric promoting the very sus\u00ad pect \"restoration principle\" that is used as a tool to allow some proponents to choose among amendments to S. 557, arbitrarily ac-358 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 cepting some and rejecting others which have merit, e.g., the Danforth Amendment. NATIONAL RIGHT TO LIFE COMMITTEE, INC., Washington, DC, January 28, 1988. Re Danforth and Metzenbaum amendments to S. 557. Senator JOHN DANFORTH, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEAR SENATOR DANFORTH: The National Right to Life Committee <NRLC) strongly supports your amendment to the \"Civil Rights Restoration Act\" <S. 557). The final form of your amendment, upon which the Senate will vote today, states that: \". . . nothing in this title [Title IX] shall be con\u00ad strued to require or prohibit any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of facilities, related to an abortion. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a penalty to be imposed on any person or indi\u00ad vidual because such person or individual is seeking or has received any benefit or serv\u00ad ice related to a legal abortion.\" As you know, Title IX regulations define it as \"sex discrimination\" for recipients to fail to provide abortion \"services\" on the same basis as other \"medical benefits.\" By vastly expanding the reach of Title IX, S. 557 would impose this pro-abortion legal doctrine on thousands of new institutions, including virtually every hospital in the nation which has any teaching program. The Danforth amendment would establish the simple legal principle that Title IX does not require hospitals, colleges, and state government agencies to provide abortions, insurance coverage for abortions, or facili\u00ad ties for abortions. The Danforth Amendment, and only the Danforth Amendment, is supported by the American Hospital Association, the U.S. Catholic Conference , the Catholic Health Association, the Southern Baptist Conven\u00ad tion, and other organizations which oppose the use of Title IX to compel federally as\u00ad sisted institutions to support the practice of abortion. The National Right to Life Committee is strongly opposed to the alternative amend\u00ad ment proposed by Senators Metzenbaum, Kennedy, and Weicker. By design, the Metz\u00ad enbaum Amendment does not address the substantive legal issue at stake, but instead is merely cosmetic. The Metzenbaum Amendment carefully leaves the current pro-abortion Title IX regulations undis\u00ad turbed. The preamble to S. 557 [Section 2 (2)] states that the purpose of S. 557 is to \"restore prior consistent and long-standing executive branch interpretation\" of Title IX, which clearly includes the pro-abortion reguations. The Metzenbaum Amendment in no way curbs this ratification of, and ex\u00ad pansion of the reach of, the current pro\u00ad abortion Title IX regulations. The Metzenbaum Amendment merely as\u00ad serts that that \"no provision of this Act or any amendment made by this Act shall be construed to force or require any individual or hospital or any other institution, pro\u00ad gram, or activity receiving Federal funds to perform or pay for an abortion.\" Because the Metzenbaum Amendment refers only to \"this act\" <S. 557) and not to Title IX itself, it would not protect hospitals, colleges, and state agencies from \"sex discrimination\" lawsuits if they fail to provide abortion \"services,\" including abortion procedures, on the same basis as other medical proce\u00ad dures. After all, it is Title IX itself (as interpret\u00ad ed by regulation) which imposes the re-quirement that educational institutions pro\u00ad vide abortions. It is undisputed that S. 557 would expand the reach of those pro-abor\u00ad tion requirements. The Metzenbaum Amendment neither removes the current substantive requirements that recipients of federal funds provide abortion services, nor prevents the expansion of those require\u00ad ments to the thousands of institutions to which coverage is extended by S. 557. Moreover, under S. 557, Title IX coverage (including the pro-abortion requirements) would usually extend to a teaching hospital because such a hospital would be deemed to be an \"operation\" of a federally assisted medical school or nursing school-not be\u00ad cause the hospital itself receives federal funds. The Metzenbaum Amendment, by design, refers only to direct recipients of federal funds, and on its face would have no application to whatever to the teaching hos\u00ad pitals and other institutions which are cov\u00ad ered bill's sweeping \"all of the op\u00ad erations of\" language. It is also noteworthy that the Danforth Amendment explicitly reinforces existing legal barriers against penalization of women who are seeking or who have obtained legal abortions. The Metzenbaum Amendment has no comparable provision. The Metzenbaum Amendment has been sponsored by the leading pro-abortion advo\u00ad cates in the Senate in an attempt to scuttle your amendment, and to thereby preserve and expand a mandatory abortion policy under Title IX. In this context, the National Right to Life Committee can only regard a vote for the Metzenbaum Amendment as a pro-abortion vote. Thank you for your continuing efforts to prevent thousands of federally assisted col\u00ad leges, hospitals, and government agencies from being compelled to provide abortions and abortion-related services.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the distin\u00ad guished Senator from Missouri be given the opportunity of speaking with his remaining time immediately before the vote. Mr. PACKWOOD. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec\u00ad tion is heard. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, I obviously would like some time at the end to rebut whatever is said. I will not be given that. The issue before us is simple, and that is whether the U.S. Senate wants to leave up to the Federal courts and the regulatory agencies the possibility of requiring hospitals, colleges, and universities to fund or perform abor\u00ad tions when abortions are contrary to the moral sentiments or religious sen\u00ad timents of those organizations. It is very simple. The characterization by Senator METZENBAUM is absolutely erroneous. There is no element of discrimination. This does not have anything to do with Roe versus Wade. The question is not whether a woman has the right to an abortion, but the right to pick a hospital to give her an abortion or to have it paid for by a hospital or insti\u00ad tution or has a physician that is con\u00ad trary to the basic principle of abor\u00ad tion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Ohio will yield to me. The Senator from Ohio controls the time. Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from Oregon needs. Mr. PACKWOOD. I thank the Sena\u00ad tor. Mr. President, it has been said in this debate that this is not about Roe versus Wade or not about the right of a woman to have an abortion, that it is solely involved with the question of whether or not we are going to compel Baylor University or Notre Dame to provide or to do abortions against their will. Respectfully, Mr. President, I say that is not the issue. The issue is mul\u00ad tif old. One is that there is a certain antiwoman animus in the attitude of the proponents of this amendment. Two, there is no question but that any school that has any religious con\u00ad science can get out from under these regulations altogether. I do not know where the figures came from that the Senator from Texas had, but I will quote a letter from the Office of Civil Rights, May 19, 1987. This is from the Reagan ad\u00ad ministration Office of Civil Rights: The Office of Civil Rights has never denied a request for religious exemption. No requests for religious exemption are pend\u00ad ing at this time. There have been a number of schools that refused to comply. For whatever reason, they did not ask the Government for a religious exemption. But do you mean, has any school ever been turned down for a religious exemption? The answer is no. Let me read just some of the schools that have obtained the exemptions: Brigham Young; St. John's Union College; Catholic University; George Fox in my home State of Oregon; Pepperdine in California; Union University, in Tennessee; Seton Hall. I ask unanimous consent there be submitted for the RECORD and printed in the RECORD a list of 142 colleges as of October 25, 1985, that had request\u00ad ed exemptions and received them. I do not have the list beyond that date. .......,....--- .... ..--. ... 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 359 There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS: TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972 EXEMPTIONS GRANTED 1.

' Five institutions were not included in the count of 216 case files officially pending as of February 19, 1985. Mr. PACKWOOD. So if you want to get out from under these regulations you have no difficulty. You can apply for an exemption and it will be grant\u00ad ed. I think the issue here is not religious exemption. The issue really boils down as to whether or not you really do think a woman is entitled to make a choice for herself whether she wants an abortion, whether she happens to be a student at Oregon State Universi\u00ad ty, or whether she happens to be a woman who is a housewife or whether she happens to be a woman who is working in the lumber mill or a lawyer. Whether she happens to be going to a public university or a pri\u00ad vate university that is not religiously affiliated and takes substantial amounts of money from the Govern\u00ad ment-and most are happy to take money from the Government if they can get it in most cases-can she be denied the right not to have the uni\u00ad versity perform the abortion, but to provide the access to it under a stu\u00ad dent health plan? What the Senator from Missouri is afraid of, and I can understand his fear, is that under the old law, the 1972 law, he thinks there is a possibili\u00ad ty that some court might interpret the 1975 regulations in a manner affecting abortion that he and his supporters do not agree with. He has ref erred to a 17-page memorandum from the law firm of Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood in which they offer their opinion as to what could-not will-could happen if this bill were to pass. According to Dewey, Ballantine if the Civil Rights Restoration Act is en\u00ad acted, educational institutions could be required to fund abortions; hospi\u00ad tals that engage in educational activi\u00ad ties could be required; hospitals could be required to perform abortions; edu\u00ad cational institutions and hospitals as\u00ad sociated with a religious institution could fail to qualify under the act's re\u00ad ligious exemption. Mr. President, that has never hap\u00ad pened. No institution that has applied for a religious exemption has ever failed to get it. No court has ever yet imposed on any institution the fears that the Senator from Missouri has expressed. But he wants to make sure that no court might. What bothers me with his approach on this was the tacit-I do not want to say explicit\u00ad the tacit understanding that all we were trying to do in this act was to re\u00ad verse the case of Grove City, which the Supreme Court decided 3 or 4 years ago, in which they said that what everyone in this Senate, and I think everyone in the House, and everyone in any administration had ever thought title IX and the regula\u00ad tions meant. Title IX of the Education Act of 1972 is the one that basically prohibits discrimination in sex and employment. I might add it is the act under which we finally managed to pry loose moneys for women in sports. I would wager today there are a great many proud-I do not mean just halloaed-1 mean proud fathers who have reveled in the success of their daughters in track or high school basketball or field hockey with equipment of reasonable quality that they never had access to until we passed title IX. I might say checking the votes of some of the people who were here in 1972, some of the people who are op\u00ad posed to giving women the right to make a choice on abortion, also did not like title IX and the right to give women an equal shot at equal athletic facilities. Now, Mr. President, there is a thread that runs through this entire debate, and that thread is bigger than just the issue of whether or not Notre Dame would have to provide health coverage which might provide abortion. Notre Dame can opt out if they want. The issue is bigger than that. The issue is whether or not you really believe that a woman is entitled to do something beyond what many in this body would limit her to do. That is the basic gene\u00ad sis of the support of many, not all, but many for this amendment. Deep down in their hearts they are convinced that the world would be better off if women would not be in the marketplace, if they would simply stay home with the children, that deep down we would be better off if the Government could compel and prohibit them from making a choice freely as to whether or not they want an abortion, legally, because we know what the situation would be if they cannot. They would freely make a choice to have an illegal abortion. I hope we are not going back to those days. They just know the world would be better off if what we did on Friday night was watch boys basketball games, and that is-I do not want to use the word animus, because that has a certain sense of maliciousness. It is not animus so much as it is a sense that we all have a place in society that has been ordained by God and if we would all stay in our place, America would be stronger, safer, freer. That in whole is the problem we are facing. The vote on the Danforth amendment is frankly an itsy-bitsy part of that whole debate. It is not an integral part of the debate. It is an effort to try to roll back the rights a little bit, of women in this country in the hopes that this can be the harbin\u00ad ger of rolling them back a lot. No. This is not a vote to repeal Roe versus Wade and overturn the Su\u00ad preme Court, although I assume we may have those votes from time to time in this Congress, but it is an effort to start down that road, and I would hope that this Senate today in just a few minutes would vote to say we are not going to start down that road, not today, not this Congress, not ever. The PRESIDING OFFICER Who yields time? The Senator from Ohio has remain\u00ad ing 2 minutes; the Senator from Mis\u00ad souri 10 seconds. If no one seeks time, the remaining time will be charged equally against both sides. Mr. DURENBERGER. Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, I rise as a supporter and cospon\u00ad sor of the Danforth amendment to the Civil Rights Restoration Act. The legislation before the Senate is designed to restore the four landmark civil rights statutes to the force and vi\u00ad tality they enjoyed prior to the Grove City versus Bell decision of the Su\u00ad preme Court. The fact that this effort has taken more than 3 years for the Congress to accomplish, and we are not done yet, testifies to the complex\u00ad ity and controversy of some of the issues it raises. I would expect that the work of this body on this matter will be subject to substantial interpretation and litiga\u00ad tion by administrations not yet elected and in future Court cases. The Grove City controversy arose in the first in\u00ad stance out of a misunderstanding of congressional intent with respect to January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 361 the \"program or activity\" language in the four statutes. It is therefore vital\u00ad ly important that we make our intent very clear with respect to the contro\u00ad versies which have been raised and dis\u00ad cussed in relation to this bill. I appre\u00ad ciate the work the committee has done, in its report and in legislative history made on this floor, to antici\u00ad pate and deal with such matters prior to disposition of this measure. The pending amendment is a neces\u00ad sary addition to this bill because it re\u00ad solves an ambiguity which has been raised: The obligations of religious and other educational institutions to pro\u00ad vide abortion related services or insur\u00ad ance coverage. Title IX of the educa\u00ad tion amendments was enacted in 1972 and implemented by HEW regulations in 1975. Those regulations define the denial of abortion services or health plan coverage as sex discrimination, in violation of title IX. Were those regu\u00ad lations to be proposed as a bill in the lOOth Congress, I would not support it and doubt very seriously that it would ever become law. I do not believe it is the view of a majority of the Congress that we should force hospitals associated with educational institutions, whether they be religious or secular institutions, to make a choice of whether, on the one hand, to forego all forms of Federal funding or, on the other, to violate the tenets of their moral conscience by providing abortions. The inconsistency of that choice with other elements of Federal law, and principles we cherish in this de\u00ad mocracy, is both striking and obvious. But that conclusion does not, in itself, remove the necessity of dealing with the issue. As the Senator from Missouri has stated, there is a reasonable possibility that a future Court or administration may interpret our silence on this issue, or our failure to clarify this ambiguity, as a tacit congressional affirmation of the broadest interpretation of the title IX regulations. We should not allow that to happen. It is argued that title IX's \"religious tenet exemption\" will provide teach\u00ad ing hospitals with an opportunity for relief. That exemption is the subject of the underlying amendment and will be debated as soon as this amendment is disposed of. But as the American Hospital Association has argued, there is a large number of hospitals without religious affiliations who do not per\u00ad form abortions as a matter of con\u00ad science. There is no similar \"exemp\u00ad tion\" opportunity for these institu\u00ad tions as currently exists for religious teaching hospitals. Throughout my career in the Senate, I have consistently and with\u00ad out exception voted to protect the sanctity of human life, including ques\u00ad tions of abortion, medical ethics, and capital punishment. Many disagree with a number of those votes. But I regard the Danforth amendment as an important decision by this body with regard to our respect as a nation for all human life. I recognize that many of my col\u00ad leagues do not and will not share my conviction on matters of life. Never\u00ad theless, I urge them to carefully con\u00ad sider the pending amendment as a nec\u00ad essary protection of the freedom of conscience for organizations, in their own States and throughout the coun\u00ad try, who have chosen not to perform abortions. We should respect and pro\u00ad tect their right to do so. We should act affirmatively on the Danforth amend\u00ad ment. Mr. ADAMS. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the Civil Rights Restora\u00ad tion Act. Consistent with the concept of the bill, I have opposed all amend\u00ad ments which seek to do anything but restore the status quo ante. All I want is to go back to where we were before the Supreme Court decision in the Grove City case. There have been a number of amendments which clearly would have had the effect of making substantive changes in the law. In those cases, given my desire to restore the law to the status enjoyed prior to Grove City, it has been a simple deci\u00ad sion to oppose them. The amendment offered by Senator DANFORTH, however, represents a more difficult decision. I know that the rela\u00ad tionship between this bill and an al\u00ad leged expansion of abortion rights has prevented congressional action for a number of years since many believe that this legislation in some way ex\u00ad pands abortion rights. If I agreed with that assumption, if I thought it was factually correct, I would be inclined to support the Danforth amendment: after all, the goal of the bill before us is to return us to where we were-not move us either forward or backward in terms of abortion. After careful study of the legislative language, the committee report, and the memorandum of law prepared for Senator DANFORTH by Dewey Ballan\u00ad tine, I have concluded that this bill does not expand abortion rights, does not change either the rights or the re\u00ad sponsibilities of institutions, does not alter the law or the regulations cre\u00ad ated by title IX. The amendment of\u00ad fered by Senator WEICKER earlier today makes this perfectly clear. While I was pleased to vote for the Weicker amendment, I agree that it was not necessary. It was not neces\u00ad sary because no compelling case was made to support the claim that the Civil Rights Restoration Act changes the legal or regulatory scheme which was in effect relative to abortion prior to Grove City. The Dewey Ballantine memorandum which is used to justify the \"worst case\" situations which the Danforth amendment seeks to prevent, for ex-ample, is cast in conditional terms. They argue that there is \"a serious risk\" that a court \"could require\" ac\u00ad tions which some would find unaccept\u00ad able. The point is that the memoran\u00ad dum does not establish even a proba\u00ad bility that a court would so rule. Indeed, the committee report very clearly precludes such a ruling. On page 26 and page 27, the majority makes that point explicitly. The report is worth quoting at some length since it establishes clear congressional intent on this point: Title IX does not now require an institu\u00ad tion to perform abortions and no abortions would be mandated if S. 557 were enacted. Religiously-controlled organizations will continue to be able to apply for, and receive, an exemption from Title IX requirements where compliance with those requirements would violate their religious tenets. For ex\u00ad ample, a religiously-controlled university that wished to exclude insurance coverage of abortions from an otherwise comprehen\u00ad sive student health insurance policy, could seek a religious exemption. Additionally * * * claims that the bill would require hos\u00ad pitals to provide abortion services to the general public are false. Given this clear legislative history, I simply do not believe that the legisla\u00ad tion restricts or expands or in any way changes abortion rights under title IX or under Roe versus Wade. Let me, however, make one more point: While the bill is abortion neu\u00ad tral, I am not at all sure that the lan\u00ad guage of the Danforth amendment is. There have been persuasive arguments made to indicate that adoption of the Danforth language is specifically de\u00ad signed to alter the regulations which have been in effect since the mid- 1970's to implement title IX. That is not the purpose of this bill. And that is not something that I would want to see done. Those who support the Dan\u00ad forth amendment have an agenda which is different then mine: Their desire is not to have an abortion neu\u00ad tral law, rather their desire is to re\u00ad strict the right to abortion. That is a desire I do not share. And that is why I have supported the abortion neutral language in the bill and the Weicker amendment and why I oppose the Danforth language. Mr. HEINZ. Mr. President, I strong\u00ad ly support passage of the Civil Rights Restoration Act-S. 557. I was an origi\u00ad nal cosponsor of this legislation both in the 99th and lOOth Congresses. Re\u00ad storing these four civil rights stat\u00ad utes-title VI of the Civil Rights Act, title IX of the Education Act amend\u00ad ments, section 904 of the Rehabilita\u00ad tion Act, and the Age Discrimination Act-is essential. Restoration of these laws reflects America's commitment to one of the most cherished values in our democratic system: Equality under the law. During Senate consideration of the Grove City bill over these past few days, along with other colleagues, I 362 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 have resisted all amendments that would further dilute these civil rights. These include attempts to expand the religious exemption and to narrow the scope of coverage to individual institu\u00ad tions not systems. The Senate now is enrolled in a debate on an issue upon which there is considerable disagreement-whether this bill will have an effect on the pro\u00ad vision of abortions. I would like to dis\u00ad cuss this objectively and dispassionate\u00ad ly before the Senate votes today. First, let me take a minute to de\u00ad scribe what these civil rights laws that we are restoring do: They protect indi\u00ad viduals against discrimination in f eder\u00ad ally assisted programs or activities. Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin; title IX prohibits discrimina\u00ad tion on the basis of sex; section 504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of physical or mental disability; and the Age Discrimination Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of age. Americans have made it clear that they will not tolerate discriminatory treatment of others because of race, sex, age, or disability. We all agree that Federal financial assistance should not be used to subsidize dis\u00ad crimination of any kind. Since there is agreement about these principles, why is there opposition to the Civil Rights Restoration Act? In 1984, in its Grove City College v. Bell decision, the Supreme Court sub\u00ad stantially narrowed the scope of title IX of the Education Act amendments. The Court ruled that title IX applied only to specific programs or activities that directly or indirectly received Federal funds. With this decision, the three other similarly worded civil rights statutes that I have mentioned which protect the rights of the elder\u00ad ly, minorities and the disabled were similarly narrowed. Mr. President , I believe that a care\u00ad ful examination of the legislative his\u00ad tory demonstrates the clear intent of Congress to apply title IX not just to a specific program but to an educational institution as a whole. It is for this reason that I joined as an original co\u00ad sponsor of civil rights restoration leg\u00ad islation. S. 557, the legislation before us is intended to reverse the Grove City decision and restores title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972 as well as the three other civil rights statutes to the meaning and scope intended by Congress. I fully support the overall goal of the legislation. We need to restore the full force and effectiveness of our Na\u00ad tion's civil rights laws to millions of women, the elderly, minorities and the handicapped from discrimination. Since the Supreme Court decision, jus\u00ad tice delayed has been justice denied for these individuals. I am, however, concerned that this legislation goes significantly beyond its original goal of prohibiting Federal subsidization of discrimination. It may, in fact, infringe on certain reli\u00ad gious or deeply held moral beliefs, par\u00ad ticularly regarding abortion. It is for this reason we are currently debating the pending Danforth amendment. The root of the concern here, as I understand the issue, lies in the conse\u00ad quences of enacting S. 557, specifically the effect it would have because of ex\u00ad isting Federal regulations. Currently, Federal regulations implementing title IX require that educational institu\u00ad tions receiving Federal financial assist\u00ad ance treat abortion on par with other medical treatments for pregnancy. These regulations state: A recipient shall not discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular activity, on the basis of such students * * * termination of preg\u00ad nancy* * *. A recipient shall not discriminate against or exclude any person on the basis of * * * termination of pregnancy [in admission or recruitment] * * *. A recipient shall not discriminate against or exclude from employment any employee or applicant * * * on the basis of * * * termi\u00ad nation of pregnancy * * *. A recipient shall treat * * * termination of pregnancy * * * in the same manner and under the same policies as any other tempo\u00ad rary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit* * *or policy* * *. Mr. President, people on both sides of this issue have told me that they do not favor legislation that would re\u00ad quire institutions to perform abortions against their will. I am certain that op\u00ad ponents of the Danforth amendment are sincere in their belief that restora\u00ad tion of title IX will not result in un\u00ad willing abortions. However, as I read the language of the bill in the context of its legislative history and its imple\u00ad menting regulations, I am concerned that there is considerably uncertainty about how the courts or administrat\u00ad ing agencies would construe this legis\u00ad lation. I share the concern that S. 557 could expand the scope of title IX and its prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of abortion in two ways. First, it could conceivably expand the reach of these regulations within institutions to cover college and university health insurance plans at any institution that receives Federal funds, directly or indi\u00ad rectly, regardless of whether that health insurance plan receives direct Federal funding. Second, and more importantly, there is reason to believe it could expand the reach beyond the confines of the edu\u00ad cational institutions to any hospital which operates \"Federal assisted edu\u00ad cation programs or activities.\" It is my understanding that under S. 557, if a hospital participates in a program of nursing or medical education in affili\u00ad ation with a university or medical school and that educational institution receives any Federal assistance what-ever, the hospital is brought within the scope of title IX. At a minimum, this may result in the hospital having to provide abortion insurance coverage to residents, interns, nursing students, and teaching staff. More importantly, an institution's refusal either to pro\u00ad vide insurance coverage or to perform abortions would equal-for purposes of title IX-\"sex discrimination.\" The in\u00ad stitution would stand in violation of the statute. Mr. President, I do not believe that Congress ever intended, directly or in\u00ad directly, to compel health care facili\u00ad ties and personnel that object to abor\u00ad tion as a matter of conscience and reli\u00ad gious belief to provide abortions. Nor do I believe that Congress intended these facilities' refusal to do so to be the equivalent of sex discrimination. There are innumerable religiously af\u00ad filiated hospitals which have had a long record of offering care to those in need in a nondiscriminatory manner. They should not be liable and subject to suit for sex discrimination. This would be unfair, and it would be a cruel irony if in trying to provide jus\u00ad tice to certain individuals, we should end up denying justice to others by forcing them to act against their con\u00ad victions. In my own State of Pennsylvania, we could be a significant problem for the vast majority of hospitals, both reli\u00ad giously affiliated and nonaffiliated. There are 380 hospitals in Pennsylva\u00ad nia, of which 240 are general commu\u00ad nity hospitals. Only 40 out of these 240 provide or fund abortions on demand. Mr. President, the great ma\u00ad jority-200 of these-have chosen for moral reasons not to perform or fund abortion. These involve both private, nonaffiliated hospitals like Scranton State General Hospital, NTW Medical Center <Wilkes-Barre), Western Penn\u00ad sylvania Memorial Hospital, and so forth, and the many Catholic hospi\u00ad tals throughout the State, none of which perform abortions. It is my understanding that in the absence of an abortion neutral amend\u00ad ment, none-I repeat, none-would meet the religious exception test of title IX principally because they have lay boards. Hence, all of these hospi\u00ad tals I have just mentioned would be re\u00ad quired to provide abortions or be guilty of sex discrimination. In short, we would be requiring hospitals such as Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh and St. Joseph's Hospital in Philadelphia to act in a manner that directly vio\u00ad lates a fundamental precept of their religious affiliation. We should not do so. My colleague from Missouri, Senator DANFORTH, has offered an amendment to avoid this situation. His amendment states: Nothing in this title shall be construed to require or prohibit any person, or public or January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 363 private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of facili\u00ad ties, related to an abortion. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a penal\u00ad ty to be imposed on any person because such person has received any benefit or service related to a legal abortion. Mr. President, this amendment would clarify that neither title IX of the Education Act amendments nor the implementing regulations require educational institutions, hospitals or other entities to provide or pay for abortions and abortion-related serv\u00ad ices. Insofar as I can judge, the amendment is narrowly drawn to remove the risk that institutions\u00ad such as those I have named in Penn\u00ad sylvania-could be compelled to off er abortions against their moral convic\u00ad tions. It would appear to protect women who have had abortions from discrimination. It would neither re\u00ad quire nor prohibit the provision of abortion services as a condition of the receipt of Federal funds. More significantly, Mr. President, it would remove abortion from the di\u00ad mension of categories for purposes of sex discrimination under title IX. I recognize that this is the core argu\u00ad ment in opposition to the amendment. And, I must say, it has given rise to some very serious claims that remov\u00ad ing abortion from the categories of sex discrimination will result in women losing scholarships, being denied em\u00ad ployment or admission to educational institutions-in short, losing every\u00ad thing they had gained in the last 16 years. These charges were troublesome to me in that I have always been a strong proponent of legislation sup\u00ad porting women's rights including, in particular, the equal rights amend\u00ad ment. Upon my review of all the inf or\u00ad mation, however, I am not persuaded that removing abortion from the cate\u00ad gory of discrimination will produce these dire results for two reasons. First, given the advances made by women since enactment of title IX in 1972, our country would neither coun\u00ad tenance nor condone these types of draconian measures inflicted upon women who have had abortions. Second, abortion was never an issue, or an element of congressional intent, in the original legislation. In fact, when title IX was enacted in 1972, abortion was almost entirely illegal in most States. There is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that Con\u00ad gress intended to include it within title IX. The Danforth amendment, in my judgment, is fully consistent with the goal we all share of restoring title IX to its meaning when first enacted, and I will vote for the amendment. Mr. President, let me address a final comment to the bill itself, S. 557. Some have portrayed this legislation as a simple question of justice. Others have portrayed it as a complex consti\u00ad tutional issue. Irrespective of these portrayals and arguments there should be no ambiguity where we stand: Federally assisted discrimina\u00ad tion should be illegal. It is vital that we pass legislation to ensure that the civil rights of women, minorities, the elderly and the disabled be protected. That is why I wholeheartedly support the Civil Rights Restoration Act. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I do not believe that the law should mandate the performance of abortion-through a threat of withdrawal of Federal funds if an entity receiving Federal funds wishes not to provide abor\u00ad tions-nor do I believe that an entity receiving Federal funds that wishes to perform abortions should be penalized for doing so. I believe the Danforth amendment carries out that policy. The Danforth amendment provides that nothing in the law shall be con\u00ad strued: * * * to require or prohibit any person or public or private entity to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including use of fa\u00ad cilities, related to abortion or * * * to permit a penalty to be imposed on any person be\u00ad cause such person has received any benefit or service related to legal abortion. In stating that institutions receiving Federal funds have a choice of per\u00ad forming or not performing abortions, without being threatened one way or another relative to the receipt of Fed\u00ad eral funds, I believe the Danforth amendment strikes an appropriate bal\u00ad ance in dealing with this issue. Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has remaining 1 minute and 50 seconds. Mr. METZENBAUM. And all time has expired on the other side? The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired for the Senator from Missouri. Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, let me just summarize where we are: We passed our amendment, the Pack\u00ad wood -Kennedy - W eicker -Metz\u00ad enbaum amendment, and we said we do not want to address the issue of abortion in this bill. Our amendment was adopted by a vote of 55 to 40. Now, Senator DANFORTH comes along with an amendment that says notwith\u00ad standing any other provision of the bill, his language will be applicable. There is not much question about the fact that that language negates the impact of that which has already been passed. I would say to my colleagues, if you voted with us on the past one, I would hope you would vote against the Dan\u00ad forth amendment. If you do not, you are totally reversing your vote cast just a few minutes ago. But the real issue is not abortion but of civil rights. We want to pass a civil rights bill. We do not want to get in\u00ad volved in the issue of abortion. That is the entire thrust of our efforts. Unlike Senator DANFORTH, we are not trying to change law on abortion. We are not trying to expand the rights to abortion. We are not trying to cut back. The amendment of the Senator from Missouri does reach out beyond the limits of this bill. That's why it should be rejected. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Ohio has ex\u00ad pired. All time has expired. Under the pre\u00ad vious order the vote occurs on the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri. The yeas and nays have not been ordered. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend\u00ad ment of the Senator from Missouri [Mr. DANFORTH]. The yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CRANSTON. I announce that the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. GORE] is necessarily absent. I also announce that the Senator from Delaware [Mr. BIDEN], is absent because of illness. I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Dela\u00ad ware [Mr. BIDEN] and the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. GORE] would each vote \"nay.\" Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, on this vote I have a pair with the Senator from Alaska [Mr. MURKOW\u00ad SKI]. If he were present and voting, he would vote \"aye.\" If I were at liberty to vote, I would vote \"nay.\" Therefore, I withhold my vote. Mr. SIMPSON. I announce that the Senator from Alaska [Mr. MURKOW\u00ad SKI] and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. WALLOP] are absent on official business. I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Wyo\u00ad ming [Mr. WALLOP] would vote \"yea.\" The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced-yeas 56, nays 39, as follows: Armstrong Bentsen Bond Boren Boschwitz Breaux Cochran Conrad D'Amato Danforth DeConcini Dixon Dodd Dole [Rollcall Vote No. 9 Leg.] YEAS-56 Domenici Humphrey Duren berger Johnston Exon Karnes Ford Kasten Garn Levin Graham Lugar Gramm McCain Grassley McClure Hatch McConnell Hatfield Melcher Hecht Moynihan Heflin Nickles Heinz Nunn Helms Pressler 364 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 Proxmire Shelby Thurmond Quayle Simpson Trible Reid Stennis Warner Roth Stevens Wilson Rudman Symms NAYS-39 Adams Fowler Packwood Baucus Glenn Pell Bingaman Harkin Pryor Bradley Hollings Riegle Bumpers Inouye Rockefell er Burdick Kennedy Sanford Byrd Kerry Sar banes Chafee Lau ten berg Sasser Chiles Leahy Simon Cohen Matsunaga Specter Cranston Metzenbaum Stafford Daschle Mikulski Weicker Evans Mitchell Wirth PRESENT AND GIVING A LIVE PAIR AS PREVIOUSLY RECORDED-I Kassebaum, against. Biden Gore NOT VOTING-4 Murkowski Wallop So the amendment <No. 1392) was agreed to. Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was agreed to. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to just say a few words about the preceding vote. I know that it was a difficult vote for everybody in the Senate and everybody on the floor at the time. I know it was difficult for you to come back from New Hamp\u00ad shire. I want to pay tribute to the three Presidential candidates who returned for this last vote: Senator SIMON, Vice President GEORGE BusH, and of course, our own minority leader, ROBERT DOLE. I think that emphasized how important that vote really was and really is to the American people. I want to compliment each of them for thinking enough about how impor\u00ad tant that issue is to be here and to make the extra effort to be here. I know that it was an extremely diffi\u00ad cult effort for all three. I happen to know a little bit about the inconven\u00ad ience that it caused to all three of them, and I want to express my admi\u00ad ration to all three of them. Mr. President, I would also like to extend my congratulations to the dis\u00ad tinguished Senator from Missouri. I think the passage of his amendment could not have occurred had he not led the fight for it and he did so with great skill, with consummate legal ability and I think with a tremendous capacity for tolerance for all of us here on the floor. I just could not have more respect for an individual than I have for him at this time, so I would like to pay my respects there. I would like to pay my respect to all who voted for or against the amendment because it was a diffi\u00ad cult battle. AMENDMENT NO. 1394 <Purpose: To provide institution-wide cover\u00ad age in education, and to retain the scope of coverage for all other entities that ex\u00ad isted prior to the ruling in Grove City Col\u00ad lege versus Bell) Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FOWLER) . The amendment will be stated. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Utah [Mr. HATCH] pro\u00ad poses an amendment numbered 1394. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: Strike out all after enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof the following: SHORT TITLE SECTION 1. This Act may be cited as the \"Civil Rights Act of 1987\". PROGRAM OR ACTIVITY SEc. 2. <a> Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new sec\u00ad tion: \"SEc. 908. (a) Notwithstanding the deci\u00ad sions of the Supreme Court in Grove City College and others, versus Bell, Secretary of Education, and others (465 U.S. 555 0984)), and in North Haven Board of Education and others, versus Bell, Secretary of Educa\u00ad tion, and others <456 U.S. 512 0982)) the phrase 'program or activity' as used in this title shall, as applied to educational institu\u00ad tions which are extended Federal financial assistance, mean the educational institution. \"(b) In any other application of the provi\u00ad sions of this title, nothing in subsection (a) shall be construed to expand or narrow the meaning of the phrase 'program or activity' and that phrase shall be construed without reference to or cpnsideration of the Su\u00ad preme Court decisions in Grove City and North Haven. \"(c) Nothing in this title shall be con\u00ad strued to require or prohibit any person or public or private entity to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including use of fa\u00ad cilities, relating to abortion.

Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the sub\u00ad stitute that I have offered is a reason\u00ad able response to the Grove City deci\u00ad sion. We all oppose discrimination and favor vigorous civil rights enforce\u00ad ment. This substitute amendment pro\u00ad vides explicitly for institutionwide cov\u00ad erage of educational institutions under all four cross-cutting civil rights stat\u00ad utes: Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. It is our intent that educational in\u00ad stitutions include elementary and sec\u00ad ondary schools, postsecondary institu\u00ad tions, and public school districts. Thus, whenever one school in a public school district receives Federal aid, the January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 365 entire public school district is covered. This coverage of public school districts reflects the Department of Educa\u00ad tion's title IX regulation which defines \"educational institution\" as including public school districts. 34 C.F.R. 106.2(j). With respect to all other applica\u00ad tions of the term \"program or activi\u00ad ty,\" the meaning of that term is nei\u00ad ther expanded nor narrowed by the substitute proposal. The Grove City and North Haven cases are to be disre\u00ad garded in determining the scope of the \"program or activity\" language out\u00ad side of the educational institution con\u00ad text. Therefore, resolution of the scope of coverage outside of education will turn on these statutes' plain language and legislative history and past clear agency practice with respect to specif\u00ad ic cases. Where such coverage was broad, taking into account the nature of the Federal aid and its uses, the plain language of the statutes, and their legislative histories, then cover\u00ad age will be broad. For example, all of the activities conducted within a build\u00ad ing constructed with Federal aid would be covered as they have been in the past. Federal block grant funding may yield broad coverage when a State or local agency or other entity receives such funding and uses it for a variety of purposes. Where coverage before Grove City was more narrowly focused, such coverage will be re\u00ad tained. Farmers will not be covered solely by virtue of receiving crop subsi\u00ad dies, although they are covered by the committee amendment. Grocery stores and supermarkets will not be covered solely by virtue of their participation in the Food Stamp Program; entire re\u00ad ligious school systems will not be cov\u00ad ered solely because one school in that system enrolls a child in the school lunch program, every plant, facility, division, and subsidiary of a corpora\u00ad tion will not be covered just because one part of one plant receives some Federal aid. Let me reiterate, my substitute ap\u00ad plies all four statutes throughout an educational institution or public school district receiving any Federal aid. And my substitute does cover all areas outside of education in exactly the same way they were covered before Grove City. Further, this substitute includes the Danforth abortion-neutral language for title IX endorsed by the National Right-to-Life Committee, the U.S. Catholic Conference, the American Hospital Association, the Catholic Health Association, and others. The substitute also includes language ade\u00ad quately protecting religious tenets under title IX. This religious tenets language, which I will describe short\u00ad ly, is endorsed by the National Asso\u00ad ciation of Independent Colleges and Universities which has 800 member in-stitutions enrolling 2 million students; the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities; the American Asso\u00ad ciation of Presidents of Independent Colleges and Universities, Agudath Israel, an orthodox Jewish organiza\u00ad tion, and others. These laws were intended to be pro\u00ad gram-specific when they were original\u00ad ly drafted. Now, Mr. President, with respect to the scope of these statutes, I want to point out again that the plain lan\u00ad guage of these statutes, together with their legislative histories, demon\u00ad strates that Congress always intended the scope of these statutes to be \"pro\u00ad gram-specific,\" as the Supreme Court correctly determined in the Grove City decision. They all use a phrase \"program or activity\" which on its face denotes something less than an entire entity or institution. Frankly, the term \"program or activ\u00ad ity\" would appear by common sense to mean something less than an entire in\u00ad stitution. Congress is often criticized for its ambiguity, or its mistakes in legislative drafting, but I do not think it made such a wholesale mistake as to expect the entire country to think that the term \"program or activity\" was a synonym for an entire school, a school system, or a state. Title IX itself makes reference to \"an educational institution\" and de\u00ad fines the term \"educational institu\u00ad tion\" as broader than a program < 20 U.S.C. 1681(c)). In all honesty we have to admit that Congress knew how to cover an entire institution whenever one part of it received Federal aid, but declined to do so in the antidiscrimina\u00ad tion provision of these laws. Moreover, in section 904 of title IX, Congress prohibited discrimination on the basis of blindness or vision-impair\u00ad ment \"in any course of study by a re\u00ad cipient of Federal financial assistance for any education program or activi\u00ad ty .\" 10 U.S.C. 1684. Here, Con\u00ad gress clearly banned discrimination on the basis of blindness throughout the institution by using the word \"recipi\u00ad ent\" in the statute itself-in stark con\u00ad trast to the more discrete term \"pro\u00ad gram or activity\" used in the anti-sex discrimination provision of title IX and in the other three statutes. Con\u00ad gress clearly knew how to provide in\u00ad stitution-wide coverage under these statutes and declined to do so. Thus, it is important to recognize that references by the proponents of S. 557 to the \"long-standing\" interpre\u00ad tation of these laws are inaccurate. Indeed, while some lower courts did rule that these statutes covered an entire institution whenever any part of the institution received Federal aid courts ruled, as the Supreme Court did, that the statutes were program\u00ad specific. And the trend in the lower courts leading to the Grove City deci-sion by the Supreme Court was cer\u00ad tainly in that direction. The list of program specific holdings is long. I invite my colleagues to read a few of these cases: Rice versus Presi\u00ad dent and Fellows of Harvard College, 663 F. 2d 336 Ost Cir. 1981>, cert. denied, 456 U.S. 928 0982>; Hillsdale College versus Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 696 F. 2d. 418 (6th Cir. 1982) <Federal scholarship and loan aid to a college subjects only the college's student aid program to title IX coverage), vacated and re\u00ad manded in light of Grove City College versus Bell: Dougherty County School System versus Bell, 694 F. 2d. 78 (5th Cir. 1982) (reaffirming earlier decision holding that title IX is program-spe\u00ad cific>; University of Richmond versus Bell, 543 F. Supp. 321 (E.D. VA. 1982), university's intercollegiate athletic program not subject to title IX cover\u00ad age because it did not receive Federal financial assistance. \"Grove City has not impaired execu\u00ad tive branch enforcement except in education.\" That was basically the testimony before our committee. Mr. President, let me repeat that we recognize that harm has been docu\u00ad mented in the area of education, and my substitute will fully meet those concerns. Institutions of higher educa\u00ad tion, private elementary and second\u00ad ary institutions, and public school dis\u00ad tricts receiving any federal aid are cov\u00ad ered throughout. Federally assisted education programs in non-education\u00ad al entities are also covered. However, it is important for my col\u00ad leagues to be aware, that outside of the Department of Education most, if not all, other agencies enforces the statutes properly as program-specific, and have not seen their enforcement activities diminished by the Grove City decision. For example, the Department of Labor reported that all 47 of its com\u00ad plaint investigations initiated since March 26, 1985 were unaffected by the Grove City decision. No investigation was narrowed in scope as a result of Grove City, and no investigation was found to be beyond the Department's jurisdiction as a result of Grove City. Letter from William J. Harris, Direc\u00ad tor, Directorate of Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Labor, to Susan J. Prado, Acting Staff Director, U.S. Commission of Civil Rights, December 9, 1986. Indeed, Secretary of Labor William Brock advised Senator KENNE\u00ad DY on April 2, 1987 that no Depart\u00ad ment of Labor enforcement on investi\u00ad gative activity has been curtailed as a result of the Grove City decision, adding: The Department has traditionally interpreted the phrase \"program or activity\" consistently with the inter\u00ad pretation set forth by the Supreme 366 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 Court in Grove City-letter from Sec\u00ad retary of Labor William E. Brock to Senator EDWARD KENNEDY. April 2, 1987. The Veterans' Administration re\u00ad ported that its conplaint investigation process had not been affected by Grove City, no compliance reviews were dropped, narrowed, or \"put on hold\" as a result of Grove City, and the Department's procedures for han\u00ad dling complaints and compliance re\u00ad views had not been changed-letter from James R. Yancey, Director, Office of Equal Opportunity, Veter\u00ad ans' Administration, to Susan J. Prado, Acting Staff Director, U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, February 27, 1987. Thus with respect to the vast bulk of Federal agency activity, not only has there been no showing by sponsors of S. 557 that the effectiveness and vitali\u00ad ty of these four crosscutting civil rights statutes has been impaired, re\u00ad ports from a number of agencies dem\u00ad onstrate to the contrary. Even for the Department of Educa\u00ad tion, of the 674 complaints closed in whole or in part, or suspended, during fiscal years 1984 through 1986, 468 of them concerned abortion rights and were filed by one person. Moreover, if this substitute language had been adopted when it was first offered 3 years ago, all of these cases could have been resolved. INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO WARRANT 557'S BROAD SWEEP Let me emphasize, Mr. President no case has been made for the radical ex\u00ad pansion of Federal jurisdiction repre\u00ad sented by S. 557. Everyone in this body knows that Federal regulations, and the private right of action under at least three of these statutes, are not without significant costs. They should not be imposed without a basis in the record of harm. When we expand Fed\u00ad eral authority, we expand the burdens that go with it. Justice Lewis Powell, joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, neatly cap\u00ad tured the point in a nutshell in a con\u00ad currence in this very Grove City case: \"[Wlith acceptance [Federal finan\u00ad cial] assistance one surrenders a cer\u00ad tain measure of the freedom that Americans have always cherished.\" 465 U.S. at 577. As Judge Abraham Sofaer, now the State Department's legal advisor, said in a title VI case, a Federal agency's power is very significant and threaten\u00ad ing, even at the investigation phase: \"[TJhe power to inquire, and to demand explanation, provides leverage that will inevitably delay or discourage many nondiscriminatory and essential decisions.\" Bryan v. Koch, 492 612 (2d Cir. 1980). In other words, Mr. President, we must recognize that when we expand Federal jurisdiction under these laws, we expand the burdens accompanying them-paperwork, onsite compliance reviews, affirmative action require\u00ad ments, and much more. No record has been made demon\u00ad strating a need for the sweeping reach of S. 557. If there are demonstrated problems, let's address them. That is why I'm prepared to go institution\u00ad wide in education. The tailored approach is the way we handled the issue of discrimination by airlines against persons with handi\u00ad caps. Advocacy groups argued that sec\u00ad tion 504 covered an airline which used an airport which received Federal aid. Now, that reading of section 504 would mean businesses using federally aided highways would be covered and there would be no end to coverage. The Su\u00ad preme Court rejected this interpreta\u00ad tion. Congress responded by enacting a law which banned discrimination by an airline against persons with handi\u00ad caps, the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986. Now, Mr. President, that's the way to fix a problem: Identify a prob\u00ad lem, not with slogans, rhetoric, and catchy titles, but with fact, and then craft legislation addressing it. S. 557, in stark contrast, covers the country with a blanket of Federal jurisdiction, regardless of whether there is a prob\u00ad lem in a given area or not. Have any of my colleagues heard complaints about farmers, grocers, churches, and syna\u00ad gogues? As I mentioned, except for the Department of Education, Grove City has had either no impact or virtually no impact at any agency in 4 years. ABORTION The substitute amendment also ad\u00ad dresses the separate abortion issue raised by title IX, by including the Danforth abortion-neutral language. Congress must ensure that no recipi\u00ad ent of Federal aid is compelled to pro\u00ad vide or pay for abortions or abortion\u00ad related services as a condition of the receipt of such Federal aid. RELIGIOUS TENETS Again, we have already debated this issue. New religious tenets language is needed in title IX to protect a covered institution's policy which is based upon tenets of a religious organization where the institution is controlled by, or closely identified with the tenets of, the religious organization. The religious tenet language found in the substitute amendment is virtu\u00ad ally identical to language in the Higher Education Amendments of 1986, adopted by Congress and signed into law in October 1986. There, a pro\u00ad hibition against religious discrimina\u00ad tion in the Construction Loan Pro\u00ad gram was enacted with an exception using virtually the same language rec\u00ad ommended for title IX. This provision, in short, is modeled on language used by the 99th Congress. This language is supported by such organizations as the National Associa\u00ad tion of Independent Colleges and Uni\u00ad versities [NAICUJ, with over 800 col\u00ad lege and university members-enrolling over 2 million students; the U.S. Catholic Conference; the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities; Agudath Israel, a national orthodox Jewish movement with tens of thou\u00ad sands of members; National Society for Hebrew Day Schools-approxi\u00ad mately 500 elementary and secondary schools; the Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools-ap\u00ad proximately 60 schools, the National Association of Evangelicals, and others. Mr. President, we need not expand the scope of Federal regulation beyond what is required to correct problems identified under title IX, this language recognizes that religious liberty is a civil right. The Senate need not and must not sacrifice religious freedoms in an attempt to strengthen civil rights protection. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the substitute amendment. No record has been made demon\u00ad strating the need for the sweeping reach of S. 557. All the rhetoric aside about why these other three statutes have to be covered, the fact is they were not covered pre the 1984 Grove City decision. If there are demonstrat\u00ad ed problems of discrimination or fail\u00ad ure to provide proper enforcement against discrimination, then let us solve those problems. And I will work hard with Senator KENNEDY and all others to do so. But I am prepared with this substitute to go all the way with regard to institution-wide cover\u00ad age of title IX in education, something that many thought was not the law before the Grove City case. I reserve the remainder of my time. Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 15 minutes. The Senator from Utah has 2 minutes and 19 seconds. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use. Mr. President, this amendment is to\u00ad tally inadequate for several reasons. It overturns only a part of the Grove City decision. The four statutes which were affect\u00ad ed by the Grove City decision prohibit discrimination against women, minori\u00ad ties, the disabled, and the elderly in a wide variety of activities in addition to education such as health, social serv\u00ad ices, transportation, and housing. In fact, on the same day that Grove City was decided, the Supreme Court applied the same narrow construction to section 504 in an employment case. January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 367 The Hatch substitute says that, in applying the four civil rights laws to other than education institutions, there shall be no reference to the Grove City and North Haven deci\u00ad sions. But there is nothing in the sub\u00ad stitute to prevent the court from reaching the exact same narrow result in the next case that comes along. Under the Hatch substitute, the fol\u00ad lowing federally subsidized discrimina\u00ad tion could occur: A black patient could be denied med\u00ad ical care at a State hospital even though the State hospital system re\u00ad ceives Federal funds if the funds were not traceable to the particular hospi\u00ad tal and unit where the discrimination occurred. A State department of social services that receives Federal funds could refuse to permit the adoption of dis\u00ad abled children if the funds are not traceable to the particular unit re\u00ad sponsible for adoption. People over the age of 55 could be denied immunization by a city clinic's policy of providing such services only to the so-called working age popula\u00ad tion. Such discrimination would be permitted even though the city re\u00ad ceived Federal funds for health serv\u00ad ices, unless the funds were traceable to this particular service. A qualified disabled employee could be denied a promotion in a nursing home corporation if the specific de\u00ad partment involved received no Federal money even though the corporation received Federal money in other de\u00ad partments. Our civil rights laws were designed to prevent this kind of discrimination, not support it. These four statutes all contain the same \"program or activity\" language. The courts have specifically applied Grove City to limit coverage under title VI and section 504. Even as to education, the Hatch sub\u00ad stitute does not restore the broad cov\u00ad erage that existed prior to the Grove City decision. For example, prior to Grove City, an entire school system was covered if any school within the system received Federal aid. This broad coverage, which prevents a school system from using Federal money at one school and discriminat\u00ad ing at another, would be lost. Disabled Americans would be par\u00ad ticularly disadvantaged by this amend\u00ad ment. Section 504 is the only Federal law which prohibits discrimination against the disabled. This amendment would leave in place the Grove City re\u00ad quirement that Federal funds be traced to a discriminatory program before a claim of discrimination can be made. These fundamental civil rights laws have never included a dual system of protection from discrimination, giving you more protection if you are in a federally supported school than if you are in a federally supported nursing home. Our bill would overturn the Grove City decision completely and restore the full protection against the use of Federal funds to discriminate what Congress intended when it passed these laws. I urge the Senate to reject the amendment. Let me give you an example, Mr. President. In the case of Foss versus City of Chicago, the city of Chicago and its fire department received Fed\u00ad eral funding. There was alleged dis\u00ad crimination against a fireman who had some disability, and under the Grove City case they would say, since the money just went to the city of Chicago and that fire department and did not go to his particular ladder, he was out of court. It did not make any differ\u00ad ence; he was out of court. We changed the whole concept of Grove City to say that if the principal departments are going to get Federal funding, they cannot discriminate on the basis of race, they cannot discriminate on the basis of disability, and they cannot dis\u00ad criminate on the basis of age. That condition would continue under the Hatch substitute but not under our bill and not under the original four pieces of legislation that existed prior to the Grove City decision. And that particular example exists on the basis of race and on the basis of age. All this amendment does is deal solely with the issue of education. What you are saying in effect is OK, we will take care of education but we are going to close the door to the handicapped, close the door to minori\u00ad ties, and close the door to the elderly. That is the effect of the substitute. And for what reason? For what reason? This country and this body de\u00ad cided we were not going to discrimi\u00ad nate on the basis of race, age, or abili\u00ad ty. It took a period of years to reach that decision, but that has been the decision and that has been the way that the courts interpreted it for years before Grove City. The Hatch amend\u00ad ment will say we are just going to deal with education but too bad if you are handicapped or disabled and too bad if your skin is a different color and too bad if you are too old. What possible sense does that make, Mr. President? It does not make any sense. That is the principal reason the amendment should be rejected. I reserve the remainder of my time. Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. THURMOND. I yield myself 1 V2 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina, [Mr. THURMOND] is recognized. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the substitute pro-posal. S. 557 in its present form clearly provides for an expansion of Federal control under the four civil rights stat\u00ad utes. The substitute proposal offered by my colleague from Utah provides a responsible approach to the Grove City decision. We heard testimony concerning the problems and confusion arising in some educational institutions since the Grove City decision. Regarding educa\u00ad tional institutions, this amendment provides explicit institutionwide cover\u00ad age and for coverage of entire public school districts whenever any Federal aid goes to such a district as a whole. But no showing has been made of the necessity for the sweeping Federal coverage in all areas of American life that is embodied in S. 557-particular\u00ad ly S. 557's encroachment on religious liberty. Regarding this substitute, it will retain coverage in areas outside of education to the extent that it existed before Grove City. Where such cover\u00ad age was broad, the substitute proposal retains such coverage. Where the cov\u00ad erage before Grove City was narrow, such coverage will result under the substitute. I urge support for the substitute. I yield back any time that I did not use. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would also point out to the member\u00ad ship that the substitute also includes two other provisions which the Senate has previously rejected in terms of treating private schools and public schools differently. We rejected that proposal. That is included in the Hatch proposal. And also with regard to the tenet protections, that is al\u00ad tered and changed in the Hatch substi\u00ad tute. So we have addressed those ideas after full debate. We reversed the deci\u00ad sions of the Senate, and we come back again to the fundamental approach of the Hatch proposal. That is to deal with only the questions on education and not deal with the issues of the dis\u00ad abled, the elderly, and minorities. It just defies both, I believe, logic, common sense, decency, and as well, public policy and morality to do that. So I hope that amendment would be rejected. I reserve the balance of my time. How much time do I have? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8% minutes remaining. The Senator from Utah or his desig\u00ad nee has 50 seconds remaining. The yeas and nays, the Chair advises the Senator from Massachusetts, have not been ordered. Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. 368 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I must respond to my colleague from Massa\u00ad chusetts. In no way does this substi\u00ad tute amendment close the door to the blind, to the handicapped, to the aged. Instead, this amendment responds with institutionwide coverage in all four of these civil rights statutes in the area of education. This is the only area in which there was documenta\u00ad tion of harm from the Grove City deci\u00ad sion. When and if other problems arise I will lead the fight to craft legislation to deal with those problems. I am really disappointed with the misleading rhetoric expressed by my colleague from Massachusetts. This substitute would resolve the problems raised by the Grove City decision. And it is the only bill that can pass both Houses of Congress and be signed by the President. Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I must re\u00ad luctantly vote against the substitute offered by my distinguished colleague from Utah. I agree that legitimate concerns have been raised about whether the legislation now before the Senate wil truly restore the status quo ante Grove City, or whether it will sig\u00ad nificantly expand pre-Grove City law. Should this bill become law, the courts should be mindful of the concerns that have been raised and the assur\u00ad ances of the sponsors that they have no intention of going beyond pre\u00ad Grove City bounds. However, my concern with this amendment is that it might go too far in the opposite direction-that is, be\u00ad cause of certain drafting problems, it may leave the door open for the courts to continue to construe all these laws in a narrow, program-specific manner and we would be right back where we started. Specifically, because of the manner in which the phrase \"educational insti\u00ad tution\" is used, the courts could inter\u00ad pret the language to mean that only specific departments of a university or college should be covered, as opposed to the entire institution. In addition, I am concerned that under the amendment, section 504 would continue to be narrowly con\u00ad strued because the grandfathering clause fails to reference the Darrone case-a section 504 case decided short\u00ad ly after Grove City which held that that law was also program specific. Again, Mr. Chairman, I want to em\u00ad phasize that I am very concerned about this bill's sweeping language. There is virtually unanimous agree\u00ad ment that our goal should be to re\u00ad store pre-Grove City law, nothing more and nothing less. This legislation should be interpreted by the agencies and the courts with that goal in mind. However, I am also concerned that this amendment may leave the door open for the courts to once again give a narrow, program-specific interpreta\u00ad tion of these laws. As a result, we would have to pass another piece of corrective legislation. This Grove City case has had a sub\u00ad stantial detrimental effect on civil rights enforcement, particularly on section 504. We have been struggling with this legislation for over 4 years. It is time to put this issue to rest. Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the ab\u00ad sence of a quorum. Mr. THURMOND. With the time not being counted to either side. Mr. KENNEDY. That is right. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, time for the quorum calls will not be counted to either side. Mr. KENNEDY. I thought the time was to be counted on either side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If that is the request, the Chair is in error. What is the request of the Senator from South Carolina as to allotment of time in the quorum call? Does the Senator from South Carolina wish it be counted against both sides? Mr. THURMOND. I wish it not count against either side. Mr. KENNEDY. I object. We are prepared to vote, Mr. President. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we will go ahead if we cannot find Sena\u00ad tor HATCH. He was handling the bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do both sides yield back the remainder of their time? Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we will go ahead. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields his time. Does the Sen\u00ad ator from Massachusetts yield the re\u00ad mainder of this time? Mr. KENNEDY. If the time has been yielded. Mr. THURMOND. No. I want to make a statement. We have 50 seconds left, do we not? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Senator has 50 seconds. Mr. THURMOND. I will take part of that. If Senator HATCH has not come back, we will talk about it later. Mr. President, here is what I want to say. The White House has sent word down that if this amendment is adopt\u00ad ed they will sign this bill. If this amendment is not adopted, the Presi\u00ad dent will not sign this bill. It is just that simple. So now if we want a piece of legislation, we have a chance to get it. But if we want to claim discrimina\u00ad tion when there is no discrimination, then that would take place. So I think it is to the advantage of all concerned to go ahead and vote for this amendment. It ought to pass. It is fair. I have heard no argument against it that is reasonable at all. I hope that the Senate will pass this bill and the President will sign it, and it will become law. This will end the contro\u00ad versy. Otherwise this controversy will go a long time except if the President will veto it, and that would be the end of it. I reserve the balance of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the Senator from South Caro\u00ad lina has expired. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I find it absolutely extraordinary that on the floor of the U.S,. Senate through my good friend, the Senator from South Carolina, that we would hear the President of the United States say close the door to the handi\u00ad capped, close the door to the elderly, close the door to those minorities. That is what the effect of the Hatch substitute bill does; it closes them out, it treats them one way with regard to education under Grove City, and treats them entirely different. No way. Tell all the handicapped people that are outside in that corridor, in their wheelchairs, tell all of the blind people, no way, no way. Why? Let us hear that answer from the President of the United States. Why do you not, Mr. President? Why do you not, Mr. President, want to permit the handi\u00ad capped and the elderly and the minori\u00ad ties to be included? Why? I would be glad to yield time to hear that answer from any of those who want to speak for the President on this issue about that. But the silence is deafening. I yield back my time. I hope we will reject this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. Mr. THURMOND. This amendment addresses the problem where there is discrimination. It takes care of the sit\u00ad uation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the amendment of\u00ad fered by the Senator from Utah, Mr. HATCH. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CRANSTON. I announce that the Senator from Florida [Mr. CHILES], the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. GORE] and the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. INOUYE], are necessarily absent. I also announce that the Senator from Delaware [Mr. BIDEN], is absent because of illness. I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennes\u00ad see [Mr. GORE], would vote \"nay.\" Mr. SIMPSON. I announce that the Senator from Alaska [Mr. MURKOW\u00ad SKI] and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. WALLOP] are absent on official business. I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Wyo\u00ad ming [Mr. WALLOP], would vote \"yea.\" The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Cham\u00ad ber who desire to vote? The result was announced-yeas 19, nays 75, as follows: ~. \u00b7-..

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was rejected. Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum with the time to be equally charged. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER <Ms. MIKULSKI). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the agreement that was entered into last evening provides for an amendment at this time by Mr. HUMPHREY that is wrongfully referred to on the printed calendar as the \"Airlines\" amendment. It is the Arline amendment, I believe, is it not? Mr. KENNEDY. That is right. Mr. BYRD. Madam President, at this time, under the agreement, Mr. HUMPHREY was to call up an amend\u00ad ment dealing with the so-called Arline amendment. He wishes to proceed in\u00ad stead to that part of the agreement which provides that, upon the disposi\u00ad tion of the Arline amendment, Mr. HUMPHREY is to call up an amendment, the so-called small providers amend\u00ad ment. The agreement provided also that there would be a qualifying amendment to that amendment. Mr. HUMPHREY is agreeable to proceeding with that amendment prior to the Arline amendment if those who were qualified to offer a second-degree amendment do not intend to do so. I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the order of the two Humphrey amendments be reversed and that the small providers amendment not be subject to amendment and that the amendment in the first degree contin\u00ad ue to be subject to the 1-hour limita\u00ad tion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Mr. WEICKER. Reserving the right to object. Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield? Mr. WEICKER. Of course I will yield. Mr. HATCH. It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire would limit his time to 30 minutes, equally divided, if there are no amendments to his amendment. Mr. BYRD. Very well. I include that in the request. The distinguished Sen\u00ad ator from Connecticut has reserved the right to object. Mr. WEICKER. My understanding then is that this amendment has 30 minutes to be equally divided, to which there can be no amendment. Mr. BYRD. That is correct. Mr. WEICKER. Well, I have to say that I am not inclined to those kinds of procedures out here, but I think that, in the interest of expediting this bill and feeling hopeful that my col\u00ad leagues will see the deficiencies in the proposed amendment, I would agree to the unanimous-consent request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority lead\u00ad er's request? Hearing none, the unani\u00ad mous-consent request is agreed to. Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut and I thank Senator HUM\u00ad PHREY, Senator KENNEDY, Senator HARKIN, and Senator HATCH. AMENDMENT NO. 13 9 5 <Purpose: To provide for the treatment of small providers under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973) Mr. HUMPHREY. Madam Presi\u00ad dent, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consider\u00ad ation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from New Hampshire <Mr. HUMPHREY) proposes an amendment num\u00ad bered 1395. Mr. HUMPHREY. Madam Presi\u00ad dent, I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: On page 14, strike out lines 5 through 11 and insert in lieu thereof the following: \"(c) Small providers are not required by subsection <a> to make structural alterations to existing facilities for the purpose of as\u00ad suring program accessibility. For the pur\u00ad pose of this the term 'small pro\u00ad viders' means any nongovernmental corpo\u00ad ration, partnership, sole proprietorship, or other private organization or business which has less than fifteen employees during each working day in each of thirty or more calendar weeks in the current or pre\u00ad ceding calendar year.\" Mr. HUMPHREY. Madam Presi\u00ad dent, there is very big trouble brewing for small business persons in this country if the bill is passed as it now stands. And I would go beyond that to say that there is big trouble brewing for Senators and Congressmen who are going to be appealed to by such small business persons if this bill is en\u00ad acted as is. And that is because small business persons, small providers, as we call them in this context, are going to be subject to suits, indeed they will be sued in many cases wherever there is a will to do so, by those who com\u00ad plain that such small providers have not built adequate access to their fa\u00ad cilities for handicapped persons. The purpose of the amendment which is now pending is to qualify that feature of the bill to limit it-I should say to exclude from it, small providers, small business persons, who employ not more than 15 persons. Under the bill as it now stands, absent amendments, small businesses such as corner grocery stores and the like would be-drycleaners, you name it-anything that is a business and small, would be required to make structural alterations to ensure handi\u00ad capped accessibility to that facility. In the bill it allows that small busi\u00ad nesses may be excused from making significant structural alterations. \"Sig\u00ad nificant\" is the word, undefined, by the way, but only if \"alternative means of providing the services are available.\" It also provides that \"the terms used in this subsection shall be construed with reference to the regulations ex\u00ad isting on the date of enactment of this subsection.'' In other words, for anyone who wants to know the meaning of \"signifi\u00ad cant,\" he should refer to the regula\u00ad tions on the date of enactment of this subsection. Well, that sounds simple enough and handy enough, but it is not, as a prac\u00ad tical matter. Under various acts, there are a host of different regulations that define \"significant\" and define the other important terms in the bill with respect to its applicability to small business. So that is not a solution to the problem of vagueness. In fact, it compounds the problem of vagueness. What do we mean by \"significant\"? There are regulations supposedly cov\u00ad ering this point but there are many 370 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 sets of different regulations depending upon which agency you examine. The same holds true for the provi\u00ad sion that even significant structural alterations are required if there are not \"alternative means of providing the service.\" What does this mean? Does it mean that a grocer is excused from provid\u00ad ing a wheelchair ramp? Remember, we are talking about small grocers now, not Giant Food stores. We are talking about small ones if this amendment is adopted. But absent the amendment, does this mean a grocer is excused from providing a wheelchair ramp only if he provides home delivery serv\u00ad ice as an alternative means of provid\u00ad ing the service? The requirements and the terms are really, hopefully, imprecise and sub\u00ad jective and I believe will put an unfair burden on these small providers; sub\u00ad ject them to lawsuits and ultimately subject Members of Congress to a rising tide of pleas for relief because, absent this amendment, the effect will be unreasonable. For example, ref erring, again, to the welter of regulations governing small providers , the USDA, for example , re\u00ad f erred to small providers but then re\u00ad quired them to engage in consultation with handicapped persons to ascertain whether \"significant alterations\" are necessary. If a small provider wishes to avoid structural alterations through so-called alternative methods, the pro\u00ad vider must ascertain if there is an al\u00ad ternative accessible provider who pro\u00ad vides the services in question at no ad\u00ad ditional cost, remember. And if there is no equal cost provider the regula\u00ad tions off er no further guidance. Presumably, in that case, the small provider must undertake the signifi\u00ad cant structural alterations. Well, if Senators want every little mom and pop grocery in this country to con\u00ad struct, for example-and this is only one example-wheelchair ramps for handicapped access then certainly they will want to defeat the amend\u00ad ment pending. But if they think that we ought to carve out, as we have so often on a very reasonable and appro\u00ad priate basis, an exception for small providers, for small businesspersons , then they will want to support the amendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire. Take the case of a minority grocery store proprietor who receives assist\u00ad ance of the Department of Commerce minority business program and who also accepts food stamps in his trade. Does he refer to the Commerce De\u00ad partment regulations or the USDA or both? And what if they differ, if they do? Then he has not only to worry about this but a hire a lawyer to make sure he is doing the right thing, and he might not even find out through hiring a lawyer. He may qualify as a USDA small provider, but not as a Commerce Department small recipi\u00ad ent. It is a very confused situation and we would be a lot better off now, we and the affected citizens, who will be legion, if we get this straight now and to carve out a reasonable and appro\u00ad priate exception in the case of small businesses as we have so often in other matters of this kind. So, in summary, Madam President, it is really quite a reasonable amend\u00ad ment. It does not break any new ground. It does not set any precedent. I would urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment and, Madam Presi\u00ad dent, I would yield the floor at this time and reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have 15 minutes, as I understand it; is that correct, Madam President? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I voice opposition to this amendment . As chair of the Handicapped Subcom\u00ad mittee I find this amendment to be one that ought to be soundly rejected by the Members of this body. I really cannot understand why the Senator would off er an amendment like this. I do not know if the Senator from New Hampshire is a veteran or not. I just ask: Is the Senator a veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States? Mr. HUMPHREY. Yes, he is. I would be happy to answer your pre\u00ad ceding question, by the way; why I am offering this amendment. Mr. HARKIN. I am just saying, in my own mind I cannot understand. I think it is incomprehensible that a veteran would be insensitive to the rights of our disabled American veter\u00ad ans who want to be accepted in our so\u00ad ciety. I have a letter from the Paralyzed Veterans of America, which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: PARALYZED VETERANS OF AMERICA , January 28, 1988. Hon. ToM HARKIN, Chairman, Subcommittee on the Handi\u00ad capped, Washington , DC. DEAR SENATOR HARKIN: The Paralyzed Veterans of America strongly urges you to reject the \"small provider exemption \" amendment to S. 557 being proposed by Senator Gordon J. Humphrey. The amend\u00ad ment, if accepted, will destroy the entire reasonable accommodation and program ac\u00ad cessibility premise of Section 504 of the Re\u00ad habilitation Act of 1973. Section 504 currently allows small provid\u00ad ers an exemption from making their busi\u00ad ness accessible to persons with a disability if they can prove that the cost of making such structural modifications would impose an undue financial burden. This test of reason\u00ad ableness is central to the success of Section 504 implementation. Mr. Humphrey's pro\u00ad posal would remove this test from existing law and would allow \"small providers\" a blanket exemption from making \"structural alterations to existing facilities for the pur\u00ad pose of assuring program accessibility.\" This amendment must be defeated. Mr. Humphrey's attempt to destroy the \"reasonable accommodation\" principle of Section 504 violates the accomplishments made in making a more accessible America. His proposal also comes in conflict with the only other federal statement on accessibil\u00ad ity-Section 190 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 190 allows publically-used, privately-owned businesses to deduct up to $35,000 per year for expenses they incur in making their business accessible to elderly and handicapped persons. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reaffirmed Congressional ac\u00ad ceptance of this important incentive to small businesses by making it a permanent part of the tax code. If Mr. Humphrey 's amendment is incorporated into S. 557 it will establish a counter-productive federal policy for small providers who wish to make their places of business more accessible to persons with handicaps. Sincerely , DAVID M. CAPOZZI, National Advocacy Director. Mr. HARKIN. The letter asks that the small provider exemption pro\u00ad posed by Senator HUMPHREY be reject\u00ad ed. I can understand that. I can under\u00ad stand why they would want to reject it. We have a lot of disabled American veterans in this country that would like to have accessibility to the same kind of things that we have accessibil\u00ad ity to. The Senator says: Well, it is going to cost all this money and it is going to create a burden on our small shop\u00ad keepers. We have already taken care of that in this bill. There is a provision in the bill that already addresses that. They are not required to make significant structural alterations to their existing facilities if alternative means of pro\u00ad viding the services are available. Now, the Senator from New Hamp\u00ad shire mentioned putting in a ramp to a dry cleaning establishment or some\u00ad thing like that. First of all, dry clean\u00ad ing establishments , let us be honest about it, are not going to be included because they are not recipients of any kind of Federal aid. Let us talk about grocery stores. We have looked into the cost of putting in just a couple of planks of wood to make a ramp so someone in a wheel\u00ad chair can get into a grocery store; what, 100 bucks? You are going to tell a paralyzed veteran who risked life and limb for his country that for 100 bucks he cannot go into a grocery store? Mr. HUMPHREY. May I respond to the question? Would the Senator yield for a response to the question? Mr. HARKIN. I do not think the Senator wants to tell these paralyzed January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 371 veterans that. I do not even mean to focus on the veterans. How about the other handicapped people in our society who happen to be born that way who cannot help it? They would like to have accessibility. The Senator uses a cutoff of 15 em\u00ad ployees. It makes it sound reasonable. Fifteen employees could be a small business that has an income of $5 mil\u00ad lion, $10 million, $15 million a year and for 100 bucks to put in a small ramp so someone can get across the threshold of a door? Maybe a person to assist someone? And beyond that, our bill even provides for referral. They do not even have to do that if, in fact, they have consulted with the handicapped person and can refer that handicapped person to another recipi\u00ad ent of such Federal aid that has acces\u00ad sibility. So if the small mom and pop grocery does not want to spend $100 putting in a couple planks of wood so that a person in a wheelchair can get into the store, they can ref er the handi\u00ad capped person to a store down the street that might do something like that. They are perfectly covered by this. They do not have to make significant alterations. Madam President, I have a letter from the Consortium for Citizens with Developmental Disabilities represent\u00ad ing about 38 different groups of handi\u00ad capped citizens in opposition to this amendment. They recognize also that this amendment would take them out of the accessible environment. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. [See exhibit 1.J Mr. HARKIN. In the case of a small provider, more is provided by this bill. As I said, we have this last resort pro\u00ad vision that says if they have fewer than 15 employees, then they can ref er the person to another provider where the facilities are accessible. So we leave plenty of room in there for the mom and pops who absolutely do not want to build that ramp, who do not want to provide the facility to help a handicapped person to shop in that store. They can ref er them down the street to someone else who has such accessibility. That is not too much to ask in our society. In 1964, we passed the Civil Rights Act in this country. We said people could not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin. In 1973, we passed the National Reha\u00ad bilitation Act, section 504, which the Senator is amending, extending those rights to handicapped people but only to those who are recipients of Federal aid. I will go the Senator one better: We have to extend the same Civil Rights Act of 1964 that applied to individuals of this country on the basis of sex, re\u00ad ligion, race, and national origin to handicapped people, too. We are not doing that here. We are saying that under section 504, those small amounts of civil rights we give to handicapped people in terms of accessibility in our society, we are going to assure those civil rights. To back off with an amendment like that we back down on our commit\u00ad ment to handicapped people to equal treatment in our society. It is a step backward that no one in this Senate, I am sure, wants to take. EXHIBIT 1 CONSORTIUM FOR CITIZENS WITH 'DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES, January 28, 1988. DEAR SENATOR: The undersigned member organizations of the Consortium for Citi\u00ad zens with Developmental Disabilities strong\u00ad ly urges you to reject Senator Humphrey's proposed amendment to the Civil Rights Restoration Act which would exempt small providers from compliance requirements currently in place under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. As representa\u00ad tives of many of America's 36 million citi\u00ad zens with disabilities, we find it most discon\u00ad certing that Congress would consider limit\u00ad ing already existing protections in the proc\u00ad ess of restoring those which were lost. Senator Humphrey has wrongly charac\u00ad terized the requirements embodied under the Section 504 regulations as \"burden\u00ad some\", somehow failing to recognize that those very regulations do in fact provide for an extremely flexible small provider excep\u00ad tion. This exception has anticipated the po\u00ad tential difficulties which might be faced by a small provider, and provides for a variety of options which will allow the recipient to comply with program accessibility require\u00ad ments. In fact, since their inception in 1977, the existing regulations have so well met the intent of Congress and the needs of small providers, that they have been direct\u00ad ly incorporated into the Civil Rights Resto\u00ad ration Act under Section 4. In enacting the Rehabilitation Act fifteen years ago, Congress understood the signifi\u00ad cant barriers faced in our society by persons with disabilities and sought to assure that at least those segments of society which had access to the resources of the federal gov\u00ad ernment would not engage in the continuing discrimination against and exclusion of America's largest minority. It is unaccept\u00ad able to permit any recipient of federal funds to engage in the discriminatory actions which would be permitted under Senator Humphrey's proposal. Senator Humphrey's amendment is not only unnecessary, it will roll back the clock on the progress already made. We are asking you today to reaffirm your support of those protections which Congress has al\u00ad ready extended to our nation's citizens with disabilities.

Mr. President, Senator HUMPHREY'S amendment to exempt \"small providers\" from any responsi\u00ad bility to provide access to persons with physical handicaps is another response to apprehensions rather than reality, and I urge my colleagues to reject it. When the section 504 regulations were promulgated by HEW in 1977, small providers were given alternatives to making expensive structural changes in their facilities. The regula\u00ad tions for all recipients require \"pro\u00ad gram accessibility\"; structural changes are frequently not necessary to ensure that the program or activity is avail\u00ad able to individuals with handicaps. The regulations for small providers, those with fewer than 15 employees, are even more flexible. To avoid signif\u00ad icant costs to small, low-budget provid\u00ad ers, the regulations provide another alternative; if small providers cannot make their programs accessible, they may ref er individuals with handicaps to other providers which are accessi\u00ad ble. The bill responds to concerns that have continued to be raised by those who are not familiar with the flexibil\u00ad ity of the existing regulations. S. 557 includes the small provider exception from the regulations to indicate clear\u00ad ly that small providers are not re\u00ad quired to make significant structural alterations to their existing facilities. They can provide the services through 372 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 alternative means or, when necessary, they can ref er the individual to an\u00ad other provider. What they are not per\u00ad mitted to do is to totally ignore the needs of persons with disabilities. The Humphrey amendment says to all small providers, including those which make more than $1 million a year, that people with disabilities are not their concern. It says to an Ameri\u00ad can veteran who was disabled in serv\u00ad ice to this country that he can be shut out and ignored by a Federal recipient, just because that recipient has no more than 15 employees. It says to every tax-paying citizen with a disabil\u00ad ity that his or her hard-earned income can help support a small emergency medical services company and that company can choose not to serve him or her. This goes far beyond what is fair to small providers, and creates a real injustice for our citizens with dis\u00ad abilities-citizens whose taxes help provide the Federal assistance to the small providers who will be able to ignore them if this amendment is passed. This is an unnecessary and an unjust amendment, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator from New Hampshire that he has 7% min\u00ad utes remaining and the Senator from Massachusetts has approximately 81/2 minutes. Who yields time? Mr. HUMPHREY. Madam Presi\u00ad dent, as the Senator from Iowa point\u00ad ed out, there is already an exception in this bill. The problem is that the exception is impractical, as the Sena\u00ad tor says, and the language of the bill clearly says that. Small businesses are excepted from providing this alterna\u00ad tive. In other words, if it is a grocery store, provided there is an alternative grocery store that, in this case, would have a wheelchair ramp. Remember, wheelchair ramps are one thing but there must be widening of the aisles and a whole host of modifications. I used the wheelchair ramp as one ex\u00ad ample. Madam President, Senators should not be confused on that point. It would include widening aisles and other matters as well. Let me say to the Senator from Iowa that if he thinks he can get anything built by a carpenter today for $100, he has not had anything built for a long time. It will be in multiples of hun\u00ad dreds of dollars or the carpenter will be subject to suits for inadequate con\u00ad struction. Madam President, there are excep\u00ad tions in the bill, but they are not workable exceptions. The only time the exceptions come into play is if there is an alternative provider, in the case of a grocery store if there is an\u00ad other one nearby with a ramp. Sup\u00ad pose there is not. I can think of a lot of small towns in my State where there is only one little mom and pop grocery store at a crossroads. It is not a matter of going down the street. In some places in Iowa, I think you might have to go to the next county. That may be an exaggeration, but it is not just a matter of going down the street because in many cases it is the only business around for miles and that business person will have to modify his facilities and not at the cost of $100 but more likely multiples and more likely multiples of thousands be\u00ad cause it is not just wheelchair ramps. I understand the rights of the veter\u00ad ans and the obligations, particularly those we have to those who have been injured. But there are also property rights, and there is also the concept of reasonability, which we have always applied in handicapped regulations in the statutes heretofore. This amendment which the Senator from New Hampshire is offering is rea\u00ad sonable. It is within the context of other things of this kind that we have done before. All it does with respect to the bill is to modify and improve the exception which is already there by stipulating that businesses with fewer than 15 em\u00ad ployees are simply flat out exempt. It is reasonable. I know the paralyzed veterans orga\u00ad nization will say they are obligated to represent the interests of their mem\u00ad bership. Of course, they are going to say, \"We want every last business in America to make their stores and their facilities absolutely perfectly accessi\u00ad ble to our membership.\" We can un\u00ad derstand that. They are an advocacy group. But have we not the right and the obligation, I should say, to consid\u00ad er the general interest as well as the special interest? Do we not have the obligation to consider the burden, the unreasonable burden in this case, on small business? That will be to hun\u00ad dreds of thousands and perhaps mil\u00ad lions, though I do not know the fig\u00ad ures. They will be large, indeed, how\u00ad ever. What the Senator from New Hamp\u00ad shire is saying is let us clarify, let us improve this unworkable, unrealistic, draconian exception in the bill, which is no exception at all in most cases, im\u00ad prove it by excepting businesses where fewer than 15 persons are employed. Madam President, I reserve the re\u00ad mainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 36 seconds re\u00ad maining. Who yields time? Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield such time as he may desire to the Senator from Connecticut. Mr. WEICKER. Madam President, I rise to oppose the amendment. I be\u00ad lieve Senator HARKIN has well enumer\u00ad ated the reasons on behalf of handi\u00ad capped persons of this Nation. Again, I would point out that there are excep\u00ad tions made in the bill as it exists, both as to size and as to what is expected. I would like to address this amend\u00ad ment from the point of view of the small business owner. Gran~ed, in the change in leadership in the U.S. Senate, I was dethroned as chairman of the Small Business Committee, as I was dethroned as chairman of the Handicapped Subcommittee, but I keep in touch with the constituencies as the ranking Republican member. Not one small business, not one small business, has written in support of this amendment. After all, who would want to write in support of this amendment? As far as the small business aspects are concerned, I have to point out that section 190 of the Internal Revenue Code allows privately owned business\u00ad es to deduct up to $35,000 per year for expenses they incur in making their businesses accessible to elderly and handicapped persons. So to my good friend, Senator HARKIN, I say never mind a few planks for a wheelchair ramp; there is $35,000 to make the premises available to the handicapped. Madam President, from a business point of view and from a small busi\u00ad nessman's point of view or a small businesswoman's point of view, nobody has asked for this amendment. Indeed, there has been provision made in our Tax Code to enable the smallest of our businesses to comply with the law. I realize it is rather bitter and cold outside, but it will not be long before they will start to sing the hymn, at least in my church, \"Welcome Happy Morning; Age to Age,\" they will sing, at Eastertime. Well, happy morning for the dis\u00ad abled of this Nation came when sec\u00ad tion 504 was passed and they came from out of the cold into this family called America. They can participate in all aspects of our lives, not segregat\u00ad ed and relegated to whatever can be done in some special hole or hovel which was assigned to them. For us who support the Civil Rights Restoration Act to go back to those cold days and away from that happy morning I do not think is the object of the exercise on this floor. I hope that we use this occasion to affirm the fact that the lame and the halt and the blind are as fully mem\u00ad bers of our society as anyone else, no more, no less. And by affirming that great moment when we made that pos\u00ad sible in this Nation I would hope that the Senator from New Hampshire would be alone in his vote for the amendment. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? ~-..,......~~\u00b7\"'\"'\\.\"'T,. ... 373 Mr. HUMPHREY. Madam Presi\u00ad dent, parliamentary inquiry. How much time remains to each side? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 3 minutes 36 seconds, the Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes 43 sec\u00ad onds. Mr. HUMPHREY. Madam Presi\u00ad dent, I wonder if I might address a question to the Senator from Iowa. Is it his intent that every small business in this country will be required to pro\u00ad vide access for handicapped persons if there is no alternative business nearby that provides such access? Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield for my response-- Mr. HUMPHREY. Yes. Mr. HARKIN. That is neither the language of the law nor the change we made, nor is it the intent of the Sena\u00ad tor. The language and the intent is quite clear. It is only those businesses that are recipients of Federal money, period. Mr. HUMPHREY. Yes, of course. Mr. HARKIN. The Senator keeps saying every business in America. The bill does not cover every business . Mr. HUMPHREY. The Senator is correct. But every business that is touched in some by way by the Feder\u00ad al Government, food stamps or what\u00ad ever. Let us just take grocery stores. Is it the intent of the Senator that every grocery store in America that takes food stamps will have to make struc\u00ad tural alternations to provide access to the handicapped, if there is no alter\u00ad native provider in the locale? Mr. HARKIN. There are many ways in which they can meet the require\u00ad ment. They can do it through struc\u00ad tural changes. They can do it through other kinds of changes. In fact, I come from a very small town in Iowa where-- Mr. HUMPHREY. Will the Senator answer my question in that it is on my time? Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator repeat the question, please? Mr. HUMPHREY. I withdraw the question because I did not really wish to have a filibuster on my time. I think the refusal of the Senator to answer my question answers the ques\u00ad tion. He wishes every business in America in some way, however tangen\u00ad tially touched by the Federal Govern\u00ad ment, to be required, however small it may be, however marginally profitable it may be, to provide access to the handicapped unless, of course, there is an alternative provider nearby. Who knows what \"nearby\" means, by the way? Who knows what \"adequate al\u00ad ternative\" is? It is not defined. The Senator from New Hampshire is merely trying to improve the excep\u00ad tion already in the bill by exempting from all of this vagueness, and trou\u00ad blesome vagueness, and expensive vagueness, as it will be, you may be sure, businesses that employ fewer than 15 persons. It is reasonable. It is prudent and I urge Senators to sup\u00ad port it. I reserve whatever time I may have remaining. Mr. KENNEDY. I yield a minute to the Senator from Iowa. Mr. HARKIN. I wanted to respond to a couple points. The answer to the Senator's question is that any recipi\u00ad ent of Federal services, Federal aid or moneys, yes, has to meet the require\u00ad ments of this bill and has to be accessi\u00ad ble to handicapped people, but within that umbrella there are many ways in which they can do that. It is not nec\u00ad essarily structural changes. As I began to tell the Senator, I am from a small town in Iowa and I know many times that if an elderly person came to the store to shop and could not make it around the store, the owner or one of his aides would do the shopping for them. They would ask the person what they needed and pick the item off the shelf. There are many differ\u00ad ent ways in which they can meet this requirement. I know the Senator talks about costs. Are there costs involved? Yes, there are costs involved. But I note also that the Senator from New Hampshire is a great proponent of the rights of handicapped infants, that they be kept alive-a great proponent of that. I compliment him for that be\u00ad cause, I, too, feel strongly about that. We can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep these infants alive but-- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 1 minute. Mr. HARKIN. Just 30 seconds. Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have, Madam President? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts now has 3 minutes and 27 seconds. Mr. KENNEDY. Thirty seconds. Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. I just wanted to finish . on that point. We spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep these handicapped in\u00ad fants alive right at birth and yet we are going to tell them later on, be\u00ad cause they want to do things that other people want to do in terms of whether it is shopping or having acces\u00ad sibility, I am sorry, for a few hundred we cannot make this place accessible. I find that a rather curious juxtaposi\u00ad tion of an outlook on the right of handicapped citizens. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. KENNEDY. First of all, Madam President, in order to even have 504 apply they have to be able to get Fed\u00ad eral funds. If you listen to the Senator from New Hampshire, you would think that applies to every small busi\u00ad ness in the country. Obviously, laun\u00ad dries, McDonald's, they do not get Federal funds. It is only those that are going to get Federal funds that this even applies to, No. 1. Second, when we had the broad interpretation of these provisions between 1977 and 1984, 7 years, there was not a single letter to our Human Resources Com\u00ad mittee complaining about this. Even when you have the narrow interpreta\u00ad tion of Grove City, over the last 4 years, there was not a single com\u00ad plaint. Who is complaining except the Senator from New Hamsphire? Finally, Madam President, I find this one of the most mean-spirited amendments that I have heard on the floor of the Senate in recent times. To talk about the paralyzed veterans\u00ad speaking for a special interest-they are speaking for the American inter\u00ad ests. Hopefully, we have made some progress in recent years. Hopefully they are speaking for all of us. Hope\u00ad fully we have a little more generosity of heart and spirit to those individuals who have either been afflicted by dis\u00ad ease or by accident or by war than to close the doors on those individuals because we just are not going to do it. We have addressed this issue in the legislation in a reasonable and ration\u00ad ale and sensible way. That is the way we ought to approach this question. I hope that the amendment of the Sen\u00ad ator from New Hampshire is over\u00ad whelmingly defeated. If I have any additional time, I will yield it. I ask for the yeas and nays, Madam President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. HUMPHREY addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. HUMPHREY. How much time remains? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Exact\u00ad ly 1 minute. Mr. HUMPHREY. I would assure the Senator from Massachusetts as well as my other colleagues that were I the proprietor of a business, however large or small, you may be sure that I agree with your sentiment, that it is enlightened and indeed in the self-in\u00ad terest of a business to make it as fully accessible to the handicapped as that business can be. Of course, you are right. I am not arguing that point at all. My point is that it is a step re\u00ad moved when you say that you are for something but then you are going to force everybody else, however small and marginally profitable, to accept your point of view. That is what I am talking about. I am talking about something that comes down to the dis\u00ad tinction of freedom. Now, I agree larger businesses prob\u00ad ably ought to be coerced, if that is nee-374 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 essary. We hope that would not be necessary. That is why I am saying we should exempt only businesses em\u00ad ploying fewer than 15 people. The ex\u00ad emption now contained in the bill is vague, is unworkable, is going to cause lots of trouble for many businesses that are touched by Federal funds and, by gosh, that must be all of them by now, every last one of them, And we better amend it and clarify it now and avert the trouble rather than let the bill go through as it is. I thank the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 1 minute 5 seconds. Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back what\u00ad ever time I have. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is now on agreeing to the amendment offered by the Sena\u00ad tor from New Hampshire. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll.

Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New Hampshire was to have been rec\u00ad ognized. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent-if this will accord with the wishes of the Senator from New Hampshire-that the distin\u00ad guished Republican leader may pro\u00ad ceed for whatever time he needs. Mr. DOLE. About 4 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. (The remarks of Mr. DOLE in connec\u00ad tion with the introduction of the joint resolution appear at a later point in today's RECORD.) Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I under\u00ad stand that the principals who are in\u00ad volved in the next amendment are trying to perhaps work out some accord. Or shall we proceed with the amendment? What is the situation? Mr. HUMPHREY. There is an effort to ?ome up with acceptable language, which I understand is promising. Mr. BYRD. All right. Mr. HUMPHREY. I am told we will require perhaps another 10 minutes or so. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will agree. I think there is a real possibility we might be able to work out some sat\u00ad isfactory language. I think it is still uncertain, but I think we are close to having a final decision whether we are able to do that or not. I would hope that we could, and we could have a short interlude for that purpose. Mr. BYRD. All right. Let me take this occasion to express the hope, then, that the Senate may finish action on this bill. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. MATSUNAGA wants to speak. Mr. BYRD. On this? Mr. MATSUNAGA. On S. 557 just briefly. ' Mr. BYRD. All right. Let me just say an expression of hope that might be of interest to others that if the Senate completes its business on this bill today, there will be no session tomorrow. However, the hol;lr of 6 o'clock is, I would say, the ultimate beyond which we may go today for good and sufficient reasons which the people in the fourth estat~ especially know about. I hope that we will all work hard to try to complete action on the bill so that the Senate can be out at 6 o'clock and, as I say, if we are able to do that, then the Senate will go over until Monday. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Mr. MATSUNAGA. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of S. 557, a bill which now has 59 cosponsors in the Senate I rise in support of the measure. ' S. 557, the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, would not create any new \"rights\" nor would it extend rights to any new, previously unrecognized mi\u00ad nority group. Nonetheless, enactment of S. 557 is essential in order to restore remedies used by the Federal Govern\u00ad ment for years to enforce four major civil rights laws: Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects the rights of racial minorities; title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972, which mandates equal education\u00ad al opportunity for women; section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 de\u00ad signed to protect the rights of h~ndi\u00ad capped individuals; and the Age Dis\u00ad crimination Act of 1975. The need for this legislation stems from a 1984 Supreme Court decision Grove City College versus Bell i~ which the Court ruled that Feder~! fi\u00ad nancial assistance to an educational institution mandated such an institu\u00ad tion to provide equal opportunity only in the specific program which received Federal aid and not throughout the entire college or university. Prior to the Grove City decision, the language in these four laws was widely inter\u00ad preted to mean that remedies could be imposed upon the institution as a whole and not merely against a com\u00ad ponent program or activity. Since the Supreme Court decision in 1984, enforcement of the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment's civil rights statutes has become much less effective. Many on\u00ad going investigations and enforcement activities were suspended. Moreover as many observers have pointed out' compliance with the Grove City deci~ sion puts the Federal Government in the ridiculous position of saying to in\u00ad stitutions that \"discrimination is strictly for bidden in your financial aid program, but it is okay to discriminate in your English Department or in your Math Department because those de\u00ad partments do not receive Federal aid.\" Mr. President, as we debate the Civil Rights Restoration Act, there will be January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 375 efforts to amend the act so as to exempt additional institutions and agencies from coverage under the Na\u00ad tion's civil rights laws, and there will be efforts to expand the existing ex\u00ad emption granted to religious institu\u00ad tions under title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972. I urge my colleagues to reject these attempts and simply provide for restoration of the Federal Government's enforce\u00ad ment authority. I hope that Congress will place itself firmly on the side of justice by saying that discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age and physical handicap is always wrong. We must reaffirm once and for all our commitment to equal opportunity-in education, in employ\u00ad ment, in housing, and in medical care. Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Senate has begun debate on the most important civil rights bill to come before the Senate since the 1982 ex\u00ad tension of the Voting Rights Act and the most important omnibus civil rights legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1964. S. 557, the Civil Rights Restoration Act, overturns the deci\u00ad sion of the Supreme Court of the United States in Grove City College versus Bell by restoring the broad scope of coverage previously under\u00ad stood and enforced under the four principal civil rights laws by the four previous administrations. Title IX of the Education Amend\u00ad ments of 1972, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Amendments of 1973 and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 represent the cornerstones of equal opportunity and the basic pro\u00ad tections against Federal subsidization of discrimination. The Congress did not enact these statutes needlessly, nor did we craft their language care\u00ad lessly. Each of these statutes contains language that was closely modeled on the basic title VI language which sought to target, for purposes of iden\u00ad tifying discrimination, the entire pro\u00ad gram or activity involved, but for pur\u00ad poses of fashioning a remedy to proven discrimination-only the spe\u00ad cific entities affected by the discrimi\u00ad nation would be the object of the relief granted. In 1984, while serving in the other body, I was privileged to chair the House Education and Labor Subcom\u00ad mittee on Postsecondary Education and to serve as floor manager of H.R. 5490, the Civil Rights Act of 1984. H.R. 5490 was the predecessor version of the bill now before the Senate. The House passed that bill overwhelmingly by a vote of 375 to 32, with 26 not voting on April 12, 1984. Not since the adjournment sine die of the 98th Con\u00ad gress have we been as close as we are today to restoring the rights of women of all races, the handicapped, the young and the old, and those whose race and national origin is not the pre-dominant one in America-to nondis\u00ad crimination in Federal programs. During the 99th and the 1st session of the 100th Congress, it has not been possible to bring before the Senate the Civil Rights Restoration Act. As we continue with this landmark session of the 100th Congress, the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution, and the cele\u00ad bration of the 59th birthday of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.-it is both fitting and proper that we mark this occasion by passing S. 557. Enactment of S. 557 would not only close a gap in the enforcement of civil rights, but it would recommit the Nation to the basic principles of equal opportunity. There is, however, an\u00ad other good reason for passing this bill. Everyday that we delay further, the rights of another child to the best edu\u00ad cation possible or to participate fully in every aspect of the curriculum or interscholastic sports may be denied. Each year we postpone action on this legislation, we deny some elderly person access to the job training they may need to be free from the shackles of dependency or the poverty that too often characterizes their golden years. Each moment we delay consideration of this bill, we ask some handicapped child or adult to postpone their transi\u00ad tion to independence and economic self-sufficiency. Why do we delay? What does Grove City say that creates a problem in civil rights enforcement? It has been almost 4 years since the High Court's decision on February 28, 1984. Grove City College v. Bell, 104 S.Ct. 1211 held: First, that title IX applied to Grove City College because some of its students received Pell grants and guar\u00ad anteed student loans and used them to pay for their education at the college and that Congress intended that these Federal funds constitute \"Federal fi\u00ad nancial assistance\" to the institution; second, receipt of these Federal stu\u00ad dent aid funds, however, did not 'trig\u00ad ger' institutionwide coverage, but re\u00ad stricted coverage to the college's stu\u00ad dent financial aid office; third, refusal of an institution to execute a proper program-specific assurance of compli\u00ad ance warrants termination by the De\u00ad partment of Education of Federal as\u00ad sistance the college's student financial aid program; and fourth, requiring Grove City College to comply with title IX does not violate the first amendment rights of the college or its students. It is High Court's recognition that Federal student aid is aid to the col\u00ad lege or university admitting a student with a Pell grant or guaranteed stu\u00ad dent loan, but the limitation it then places on the \"program or activity\" language that is problematical. The Court accepted a tortured interpreta\u00ad tion of the facts-urged on the Court by the Reagan Justice Department-that the student aid was Federal fi\u00ad nancial assistance to the student aid office only, not to the entire institu\u00ad tion! As former Education Department Secretary Ted Bell has written in the 13th man-a Reagan Cabinet memoir, \"Much to my surprise and disappoint\u00ad ment, the Court handed down a deci\u00ad sion that was almost fully in support of Brad Reynolds position.\" It is almost impossible to conceive how the Justices could understand that Feder\u00ad al student assistance which pays for tuition, dormitory expenses, and other fees could stop at the college's student financial aid office. If all student pay\u00ad ments to a college or university were held in the bursar's or the business office-the institution would cease to function. The same is true with Feder\u00ad al student aid. What has happened since the 1984 decision? According to the Depart\u00ad ment of Education's own account-834 cases committed to the administrative enforcement process have been affect\u00ad ed during fiscal years 1984-86, for ex\u00ad ample, closed in whole or in part, dropped or narrowed. A total of 67 4 complaints have been closed or nar\u00ad rowed, including 468 third-party com\u00ad plaints alleging sex discrimination in college health insurance plans involv\u00ad ing hundreds of individuals. A total of 88 compliance reviews have been dropped, and 72 others have been nar\u00ad rowed. What does the Grove City decision really mean? Let's begin by looking at the facts. Grove City College is a pri\u00ad vate educational institution of higher learning which accepts no direct as\u00ad sistance from the Federal Govern\u00ad ment. However, the college did enroll students who received federally funded Pell grants and guaranteed student loans. In fact, between 1974 and 1984, students financed their Grove City College educations with more than $1.8 million in Pell grant funds. In 1976, the Department of Educa\u00ad tion attempted to obtain an assurance of compliance with title IX from the college. The Department requires such assurances from educational institu\u00ad tions which receive Federal financial assistance. The college refused to exe\u00ad cute the assurance and argued that they received no Federal financial as\u00ad sistance. The Department of Educa\u00ad tion initiated administrative proceed\u00ad ings to terminate the grants and loans to Grove City College students be\u00ad cause of the college's refusal to exe\u00ad cute an assurance of compliance. The Supreme Court, on February 28, 1984, unanimously held that Grove City College was a recipient of Federal financial assistance. However, by a 6- to-3 majority vote, the Court held that Federal financial assistance does not create institution-wide coverage under title IX. Title IX governs only the 376 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 \"program or activity\" which receives the Federal funds. Thus, Pell grant funding triggered title IX coverage only of the college's financial aid pro\u00ad gram. The financial aid department was required to execute a program\u00ad specific assurance of compliance with title IX. Failure to execute such a compliance could result in termination of Federal assistance to the financial aid program. Grove City College re\u00ad mained free to sexually discriminate in its remaining \"programs and activi\u00ad ties,\" including course offerings and extracurricular activities, while receiv\u00ad ing large amounts of Federal aid in the form of Pell grants and GSL's. The impact of Grove City is not lim\u00ad ited to title IX. Title IX is only one of the four major civil rights laws which prohibit recipients of Federal funds from discriminating. All four statutes incorporate the same \"program or ac\u00ad tivity\" language. The narrow construc\u00ad tion of that language in Grove City, with respect to title IX, equally limits the applicability of title VI, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Age Discrimination Act. Thus, Federal funds may be used to subsidize dis\u00ad crimination on the basis of race, hand\u00ad icap and age, as well as sex. The debate on S. 557 inevitably leads to controversy and debate in several areas. The element of fear and the un\u00ad known which has surrounded debate on restoring the most basic of civil rights protections tends to have clouded the real issue. This debate must focus on restoration-returning the protected groups to exactly where they were on February 28, 1984-noth\u00ad ing more and nothing less. We must, in essence, \"keep our eyes on the prize.\" We do not enact this bill to protect hospitals or church-affiliated colleges or private schools. We are seeking to continue this Nation's commitment to its black, brown and native Americans, to women of all races, to the elderly and to those with disabilities. We have tended, in the last few years, to spend far too much time worrying about how this bill will impact those who may have to comply with it, the rights of those who need its civil rights protec\u00ad tions have been ignored. I want to explain my views on these important issues. Religious tenets-this issue has been a difficult one. Title IX already con\u00ad tains an exemption for those schools and colleges which qualify for it. The exemption permits those educational institutions \"controlled by a religious organization\" and permits noncompli\u00ad ance with title IX if doing so \"would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization.\" A reli\u00ad gious tenet exemption applies if the organization satisfies one or more of the following criteria established by the Department of Education: First, the applicant institution is a school or department of divinity; second, it re-quires its faculty, students or staff to espouse a particular religious belief; or third, its official written material con\u00ad tain an explicit statement that it is controlled by a religious organization, the members of the governing board are appointed by the religious organi\u00ad zation, and it receives significant fi\u00ad nancial support from the religious or\u00ad ganization. There is little or no evi\u00ad dence that there is a problem with the existing criteria. Since 1975, 227 insti\u00ad tutions have sought an exemption and 150 have been granted. The amend\u00ad ment offered in committee, and reject\u00ad ed overwhelmingly, seeks an unjusti\u00ad fied and unwarranted expansion of the exemption by permitting any institu\u00ad tion \"closely identified with the tenet of\" to qualify for an exemption. I don't think the current exemption is broken and it certainly does not need to be fixed. Colleges and universities which can justify their need for an exemption can get one. It is interesting to note that there are no such applications pending. The existing tests are appro\u00ad priate because they state legitimate criteria for assessing whether a school or college which receives Federal aid can be exempted from complying with title IX. Abortion-perhaps the abortion amendment most clearly presents the tension between those of us who seek to do nothing more than restore the full protection of title IX and the other major civil rights protections as they existed prior to the decision in Grove City College versus Bell, and those who see this as an opportunity to expand current restrictions on the use of Federal funds to pay for abor\u00ad tions. Abortion language has no real place in the Civil Rights Restoration Act. Prior to the Grove City decision, no re\u00ad ligiously controlled institution was re\u00ad quired to perform abortions. The bill now before us continues this protec\u00ad tion for religious institutions opposed to abortion-protections that have re\u00ad sulted in over 90 percent of those insti\u00ad tutions applying for such exemptions being granted them. Religious institu\u00ad tions will continue to apply for, and be granted, these exemptions with enact\u00ad ment of S. 557. We cannot and should not let this bill become the vehicle for turning our backs on the basic civil rights of women, minorities, the aged, and the handicapped because we are unable to move it through the lOOth Congress. And we cannot let this bill be the vehi\u00ad cle for attempting to limit a woman's right to abortion beyond the scope of the law as it existed prior to Grove City. Those who label S. 557 expansive are wrong. The real reason for the so\u00ad called abortion neutral amendment is to repeal the 1975 HEW title IX regu\u00ad lations. Abortion neutrality in the con\u00ad text of S. 557, requires us to return to February 28, 1984, not all the way back to 1975 in order to eliminate a regulation in effect before the Grove City decision. Contagious diseases-I was one of several Members of Congress who signed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court Arline case, a brief which argued that persons with contagious diseases are covered by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The Court, by a 7-to-2 majority, affirmed that a person with the contagious disease of tuberculosis may be a \"handicapped individual\" within the meaning of sec\u00ad tion 504. There are several reasons why I oppose any changes to this coverage. First, there is no need to change the law in order to protect the public health. Current law does not guaran\u00ad tee to any person with a contagious disease the right to participate in any specific job or program. It does give the individual the right to show that he or she is an \"otherwise qualified\" handicapped individual, and as such, must not be discriminated against. In any job or other setting where the in\u00ad dividual could not, with reasonable ac\u00ad commodation, do the job or partici\u00ad pate without significant risk to others, that individual would not be \"other\u00ad wise qualified.\" The individual is simply allowed by section 504 to have his or her day in court. Second, as the Supreme Court noted, the purpose of section 504 is to ensure that individuals with handicaps are not denied jobs or other benefits because of the prejudiced attitudes or ignorance of others, and this purpose is not served if persons with conta\u00ad gious diseases are automatically ex\u00ad cluded. As the Court also noted, \"Few aspects of a handicap give rise to the same level of public fear and misap\u00ad prehension as contagiousness\" and \"the fact that some persons who have contagious diseases may pose a health threat to others under certain circum\u00ad stances does not justify excluding from the coverage of the act all per\u00ad sons with actual or preceived conta\u00ad gious diseases.\" If we exclude persons with conta\u00ad gious diseases from coverage of section 504, those who are accused of being contagious will never have the oppor\u00ad tunity to have their condition evaluat\u00ad ed in light of medical evidence and to have reasonable medical judgment de\u00ad termine their risk to others. They will have no opportunity for a determina\u00ad tion as to whether they are \"otherwise qualified\" -whether, with reasonable accommodation, they can do the job without significant risk to others. Fear and prejudice, not reason, will prevail. Small providers-one of the most difficult problems we face in our Nation is making citizens with disabil\u00ad ities true citizens of this Republic. We must bring them into the mainstream January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 377 and help them become a part of every aspect of our national life as full, working, independent partners. They have a right to enjoy the exact same freedoms and opportunities that are available to every other American. Yet, in the context of this bill, the specter of building a ramp to every drug store or grocery store in America has been paraded about to scare small businessmen all around the country. This is unfortunate. The bill includes an exemption for small providers which the committee intends to quiet these fears. I strongly support that language and oppose attempts to broaden it. The benefits of nondiscrimination are realized not only by persons with disabilities, but by society at large. A major study commissioned by the Office for Civil Rights at HEW about 10 years ago estimated that eliminat\u00ad ing discrimination against persons with disabilities within HEW-funded programs would produce $1 billion an\u00ad nually in increased employment and earnings. In addition to increasing the GNP, it was estimated that such an earnings increase by persons with dis\u00ad abilities would result in some $58 bil\u00ad lion in additional revenue for Federal, State, and local governments. I dare say that these revenue estimates would be higher today. Let me conclude by indicating my consistent, strong and unwavering sup\u00ad port for quick passage of S. 557. I lead the fight in the Illinois general assem\u00ad bly for public accommodations, anti\u00ad discrimination in employment and other key civil rights legislation. I did so at a time when it was not popular to do so. I represented an area in south\u00ad ern Illinois which was closer to Missis\u00ad sippi, than it was to Chicago. My stand was not popular. The protection of the rights of our people are too important to be subjected to poll taking and pop\u00ad ular whim before we make a decision. I urge my colleagues to oppose all \"killer amendments\" and vote for this important civil rights bill. Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 557, the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987. \"Res\u00ad toration\" is indeed the purpose and focus of this legislation. It seeks to re\u00ad store rights which were conferred by the Constitution 200 years ago, and which have been in the process of res\u00ad toration ever since. The Constitution guaranteed to every citizen the right to equal treat\u00ad ment under the laws. Despite this, however, there has been widespread discrimination-against the elderly, the handicapped, aliens, against mi\u00ad norities and women, and against those with religious beliefs which are differ\u00ad ent from the mainstream. Congress has recognized that acts of discrimination are inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitu\u00ad tion, and have sought to correct this practice-at least, in federally funded programs. The result has been the en\u00ad actment of major legislation prohibit\u00ad ing discrimination under the threat of of a loss of Federal funds if such dis\u00ad crimination persists. Language to this effect can be found in each of the four major civil rights measures, specifical\u00ad ly, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title IX of the education amend\u00ad ments of 1972, section 504 of the Re\u00ad habilitation Act of 1973, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. The withdrawal of Federal funds for noncompliance with antidiscrimina\u00ad tion directives remains the most effec\u00ad tive sanction which Congress can impose. It emphasizes the intent of Congress, which is, not only to enact civil rights laws, but also, to put some teeth into the statutes so that they would be given the maximum force and effect. In 1974, the Supreme Court greatly weakened the impact of these civil rights laws by its erroneous interpreta\u00ad tion of the congressional intent in the case of Grove City College versus Bell. In that case, the Court ruled that the Federal prohibition against <sex) dis\u00ad crimination extends only to the par\u00ad ticular program or activity which re\u00ad ceives Federal financial assistance, not to the institution as a whole. Grove City College is a private institution which received funds only indirectly by way of Federal grants and loans to the students. While holding that indi\u00ad rect aid was sufficient to bring the col\u00ad lege under compliance requirements, the Supreme Court narrowed the ex\u00ad isting scope of the sanction for non\u00ad compliance. Mr. President, I submit that this holding was erroneous in that it does not reflect the intent of Congress. The Civil Rights Restoration Act is an attempt to set the record straight as to what the actual intent of Con\u00ad gress was in enacting the af oremen\u00ad tioned civil rights statutes. These stat\u00ad utes were enacted to eliminate discrim\u00ad ination in all Federal assistance pro\u00ad grams. The sense of the Congress during the time of enactment of these measures was expressed most clearly by President Kennedy in his call for enactment of the Civil Rights Act: Simple justice requires that public funds, to which taxpayers of all races contribute, not be spent in any fashion which encour\u00ad ages, entrenches, subsidizes or results in racial discrimination. In limiting the sanction to the spe\u00ad cific program directly affected by Fed\u00ad eral funds, the Supreme Court opened the door to the possibility that schools and institutions, such as Grove City College, could receive Federal aid for some programs while discriminating in others. This is not the \"simple justice\" of which President Kennedy spoke. Rather, this is a dangerous precedent which runs completely contrary to this commitment to eliminate discrinii-nation in all Federal assistance pro\u00ad grams. I submit, Mr. President, that the intent of Congress was to close any loopholes which would permit dis\u00ad crimination-not to create them, as the Supreme Court has done. Congress enacted title IX of the Education Act of 1972 to outlaw dis\u00ad crimination on the basis of sex under any education program or activity re\u00ad ceiving Federal financial assistance. In 1973, Congress adopted section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to include the handicapped under the antidiscrimina\u00ad tion rubric, and in 1975, passed the Age Discrimination Act to prohibit dis\u00ad crimination on the basis of age. The language prohibiting discrimination in each of these acts is the same. In each case, it has been our intent to expand the protections of the original Civil Rights Act. Indeed, the legislative his\u00ad tory of these statutes is replete with language urging that the protections provided for be afforded the maximum force applicable under the law. This can only be accomplished by continu\u00ad ing to give these laws the broadest of interpretations. Mr. President, it should be evident to all that our civil rights laws cannot protect all persons equally if they are applied selectively. The bill which we are introducing clarifies the original intent of those laws to deny all Feder\u00ad al funds to any institution which dis\u00ad criminates on the basis of sex, race, national origin, handicap, or age. It re\u00ad stores the broad scope of those laws by carefully defining \"program or activi\u00ad ty\" and by setting standards to deter\u00ad mine their application. Mr. President, the implication of the range of discriminatory practices which would be available through the use of Federal funds unless this legis\u00ad lation is enacted is astounding. Consid\u00ad er, for example, a black child who is refused admission to the privately funded wing of a hospital purely on the basis of race. If that hospital re\u00ad ceives Federal money in each of its other departments, under Grove City, that child could have legally been re\u00ad fused treatment from a facility paid for by his parents' own tax dollars. The Grove City decision, thus, repre\u00ad sents a severe threat to civil rights protections. Women and minorities are looking to us to def end their hard-won opportunities and freedoms; indeed, to protect them from the oblique injus\u00ad tice of having to pay, through taxes, for programs or activities which dis\u00ad criminate against them. I urge my col\u00ad leagues-let us pass this legislation, and let us move boldly toward the day when our Nation's laws effectively re\u00ad flect God's law: That all persons are created equal. MORNING BUSINESS Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, so as to accommodate those who are trying to work out some resolution of the 378 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 amendment that is to be called up at this time, I ask unanimous consent that there be a period for morning business for not to extend beyond 10 minutes and that Senators may speak therein up to 2 minutes each. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded, and then I would like to propound a parlia\u00ad mentary inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the parliamentary situation. As I understand it, we are in a quorum call so that those who are working on a proposed amendment will have time to work it out, and that there has been a unanimous-consent order entered that fallowing the quorum call the Senator from New Hampshire be recognized to offer an amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire is the next order of busi\u00ad ness. Mr. ARMSTRONG. It is my under\u00ad standing further that it would not be in order except by unanimous consent for another Senator to offer an amendment or even indeed to address the Senate at this point. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, it would be my hope that my colleagues would give me unanimous consent to address the Senate at this time, simply as a time expedient, without displac\u00ad ing, of course, the Senator from New Hampshire, so that we can use this time productively rather than continu\u00ad ing with a quorum call. That is my request, that I be permit\u00ad ted to address the Senate at this time. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the Senator indicate how long he would like to address the Senate? Mr. ARMSTRONG. I would think 20 minutes or so, certainly not longer than that or not longer than a half\u00ad hour. It is only my desire to make a few observations at this time and not to delay the Senate. Mr. BYRD. It is my hope, let me say, that the Senate will complete action on this measure today by 6 o'clock, in which case there will not be a session tomorrow. But we cannot go longer than 6 o'clock today. If we do not finish by around 6 o'clock today, we will have to come back tomorrow. There is an event tonight. The press has invited the Members of Congress and their wives to an event, an annual event, which many of us want to attend. I have no objection if the Senator would mind putting a limitation, say, of 20 minutes rather than 30 minutes. Mr. ARMSTRONG. It would seem perfectly fair to me. It is only my desire to use the time productively, and I certainly want to cooperate. Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I do not want to object, is there any chance that if the amend\u00ad ment is worked out, that the time the Senator uses will be considered as part of the time that will be associated with the Humphrey amendment? Mr. ARMSTRONG. That would not be something for me to talk to. I do not have control of that time. Mr. HUMPHREY. If the Senator will yield, I would be reluctant to accede to the request until we see the package that is being worked out. Mr. KENNEDY. I have no objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the leader and my colleagues. THE STATE OF MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE IS CHANGING Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, there was a headline in the Washing\u00ad ton Post that we ought to think about before we act upon the Humphrey amendment or on this bill. In this morning's paper there is an article en\u00ad titled \"First U.S. Case Of Second Form of AIDS Reported.\" That is on page A-9. And another story entitled \"Prompt Screening Of Blood Supply Urged To Detect Leukemia-Causing Virus.\" That is on page A-8. I bring this to the attention of my colleagues to point out that the state of medical knowledge is changing very, very rapidly. When it comes to AIDS, particular\u00ad ly, what we are learning about this dis\u00ad ease every day, every month and every year, is dramatically expanding the horizons of medical knowledge. Three years ago, the most reputable medical authorities in this country were saying do not worry about get\u00ad ting AIDS through blood. That is not the way you get it. People like the American Red Cross and distinguished doctors were issuing public reassurances that you do not get AIDS from blood. That shows how far we have come in just 3 years. What has that to do with the amendment we are going to consider or the whole theory of this bill? Plenty. Under the Arline case, which I guess has been discussed somewhat on the floor, but has been discussed extensively behind the scenes, it ap\u00ad pears that a person who has a conta\u00ad geous disease, such as AIDS, tubercu\u00ad losis, you name it, might suddenly and unexpectedly be considered a handi-capped person for the purposes of this law. Traditionally, employers, both public and private, exercise unlimited discretion as to who they will hire, fire, who they will promote and what jobs they will put them into. Over a period of time society has de\u00ad termined we should temper to some degree that particular discretion on the part of employers. We have deter\u00ad mined long since that as a matter of public policy we do not want employ\u00ad ers, whatever their private feelings might be, to discriminate on the basis of race or sex. More recently, we have determined we do not want employers discriminating or making arbitrary de\u00ad cisions on the grounds of being handi\u00ad capped. In other words, if a person is handicapped, an employer may not discriminate against the handicapped in employment. Now, then the question that is ad\u00ad dressed in Arline and which comes up in the Humphrey amendment is this. Suppose a person has a contagious dis\u00ad ease. Is that person, therefore, enti\u00ad tled to legal protection against being terminated in their employment or being denied employmnent in the first instance? Specifically, let us say you have a person with TB and a school board wants to prevent that person from working on the food service line. May the school board do that? Now, as a matter of public policy, I think it is the height of irresponsibility for the courts or for Congress to say no, the school board may not exercise such discretion. Well, let us not beat around the bush. That is exactly what we are talk\u00ad ing about here, is the right of public and private employers to exercise dis\u00ad cretion in the employment and tenure and assignment of persons who have communicable diseases. Now, why is that important? Be\u00ad cause under Arline and under the amendment that is coming up, if, as and when it comes up, an employer who wants to exercise that discretion will have to go into court and show that such a person who has TB or AIDS or whatever it might be is in fact a direct threat to the health of other persons. How will an employer prove that? By medical testimony. Keep that in mind as you read the ar\u00ad ticle that I mentioned at the outset, that just today there is an item in the paper in which medical science has discovered a new strain of AIDS virus and only a few years ago competent medical authorities were assuring the public, were going out of their way to issue broad-based blanket assurances, which proved to be absolutely 100 per\u00ad cent dead wrong. Under the circum\u00ad stances, to tie the hands of public and private employers just seems to me to be very far-fetched. .... -~~--~--~_.,.... . January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 379 Mr. President, in the epilog from Charles Gregg's book \"A Virus of Love and Other Tales of Medical Detec\u00ad tion,\" Mr. Gregg writes the following: Looking back, then the theme of this book has to be our profound ignorance, 100 years after Pasteur, of the world pathogenic-that is, illness-producing-micro-organisms. The point is we do not know what we are doing and yet we are preparing to enshrine in statute a test which em\u00ad ployers must get passed in order to ex\u00ad ercise their reasonable discretion. Now, I am not saying-and I hope nobody would interpret what I am saying to mean that-someone who has a communicable disease ought to therefore be denied employment or ought to be transferred or ought to be fired or whatever. What I do say is that to tie the hands of employers in making that decision for the protec\u00ad tion of other employees, of students, and the general public is really a far\u00ad f etched idea, in my opinion, and yet that is what we are about to do. It would be far better, in my opinion, to simply restore the law to where it was before Arline, and that is to just flatly say that at least for the time being communicable diseases do not make you a handicapped person for the pur\u00ad poses of this act. That would be a far better solution. I understand that there has been some attempt to work out an amendment along that line, and it simply is not popular. The only reason I can think of why that is the case is because those who are working on it have not thought this through or perhaps because I have thought it through and do not understand what is at issue. I do not believe that to be the case, but I suppose that is a possi\u00ad bility. It seems to me that a good place to start in thinking about this is to review the facts of the Arline case itself. Mrs. Gene Arline was hospitalized for tuberculosis in 1957, when she was 14 years of age. Her disease went into remission for approximately 20 years, during which time Mrs. Arline began teaching elementary school. In 1977, and twice in 1978, she had relapses. In response to these recurrences, Mrs. Arline was first suspended with pay and then discharged after a hearing. Before Mrs. Arline's termination, the superintendent of schools consulted with a medical doctor, who testified that Mrs. Arline's condition posed a threat to the health of the small chil\u00ad dren with whom Mrs. Arline was in constant contact. Mrs. Arline sued, and she claimed that the school board had illegally dis\u00ad criminated against her on the basis of her handicap in violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. On March 3 of 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with Mrs. Arline by hold\u00ad ing in a ruling which surprised me, and I judge surprised a lot of other people as well, that section 504 covers persons who are both contagious and physically impaired by the disease. The Court has sent back to the district court the question of findings of act of whether or not Mrs. Arline is other\u00ad wise qualified to teach, and so on and so on. But the central issue in the case is that so far as I know for the first time the Supreme Court said that a conta\u00ad gious disease could get you into the protected classification of section 504. Well, why not just live up to Arline where it is? After all, the Court did not order tubercular teachers into ele\u00ad mentary classrooms. It just said that sick teachers are entitled to a hearing and to reasonable accommodations so that they will not suffer deprivation based on prejudiced stereotypes or un\u00ad founded fear, an aspiration that none of us could argue against in my opin\u00ad ion. Mr. President, Arline is unacceptable because it will mean that more healthy children and adults will be un\u00ad willingly exposed to persons with com\u00ad municable disease. An increased expo\u00ad sure will mean more sickness among persons who would otherwise be healthy. And if just one of Mrs. Ar\u00ad line's students happens to contract tu\u00ad berculosis, it appears to me that preju\u00ad dice and fear and stereotyping is likely to increase and multiply, not to dimin\u00ad ish. Ironically, therefore, the outcome of the decision of the Court is to make worse the very problem which the Court sought to alleviate. Many of the possible criticisms of Arline were sum\u00ad marized in an article by the distin\u00ad guished scholar, Thomas Sowell, who wrote as follows: The reason this decision is likely to mean more teachers with contagious diseases teaching your children is that no school has unlimited time and unlimited money to put into hearings, medical evidence for hear\u00ad ings, and fighting the inevitable court ap\u00ad peals from hearings, after an employee is found to be dangerously contagious. Professor Sowell might also have mentioned-he did not but he could have mentioned-that schools that lose lawsuits will probably have to pay the teacher's attorney's fees, which is a significant threat to many school districts, especially the small ones. Professor Sowell continues: Somewhere along the way, many schools are going to decide that it is better to give up and hope for the best, rather than con\u00ad tinue a ruinously expensive process. While everyone is looking out for individ\u00ad uals with contagious diseases, who will be looking out for the children? That is Professor Sowell's view, which I share. Schools and other re\u00ad cipients of Federal financial assistance will have better rules about contagious diseases, it seems to me, if we do not enshrine in law a requirement that to any degree school boards or other em\u00ad ployers in question have to prove that a person is a direct or indirect threat to other persons. If they have reason to believe, if a school board acting in its discretionary capacity reaches that conclusion-not to say that everybody who has a contagious disease should be dismissed. Far from it. They should be treated with sympathy and hu\u00ad manely and with a balanced point of view, but if we could just leave it to those who are charged by the voters in their areas with respect to public juris\u00ad diction to make that decision, we will end up, in my opinion, with a more flexible and a far more responsible system than if we simply write into law that in order to give discretion to the school board you have to prove that somebody is a threat. That is hard to prove. It is hard to prove in a disease about which a lot is known, but when you get into those which are on the frontiers of medical knowledge, particularly those that are the most threatening at the present time, such as AIDS, it is impossible, and it is very likely the fact that the proof would end up itself being disproven within a very few years. I remind Senators again that only a few years ago, 3 or 4 years ago, doctors were confidently as\u00ad suring us something which has later proven to be absolutely untrue. The Arline decision extended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to a conta\u00ad gious disease, and I believe to all con\u00ad tagious diseases. AIDS, however, has captured the public attention and much of the energy of litigators around the country and therefore AIDS provides a case study in how the Federal courts are developing pu_blic policy with respect to infectious dis\u00ad eases. In its footnote 16, the Arline court said: A person who poses a significant risk of communicating an infectious disease to others in the workplace will not be other\u00ad wise qualified for his or her job if reasona\u00ad ble accommodation will not eliminate that risk. <Emphasis added.) Under Arline each contagious plain\u00ad tiff is entitled to an individualized in\u00ad quiry to determine whether he or she is a \"significant risk.\" That inquiry will include: [findings of] facts, based on reasonable medical judgments given the state of medi\u00ad cal knowledge, about (a) the nature of the risk <how the disease is transmitted), (b) the duration of the risk (how long is the carrier infectious), (c) the severity of the risk <what is the potential harm to third parties) and (d) the probabilities that the disease will be transmitted and will cause varying degrees of harm. This four-part formulation was sug\u00ad gested to the Court by the American Medical Association; indeed, the Court took it straight from the Association's amicus brief. Consider now how the A.M.A.-U.S. Supreme Court formulation is working 380 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 in practice. I would like to cite some specific instances. A. THE STUDENT WITH AIDS Ryan Thomas became infected with the AIDS virus as a result of a con\u00ad taminated blood transfusion. His two physicians wrote to the school district \"indicating that there is no medical reason\" why Ryan could not attend school. In May 1986 Ryan's school dis\u00ad trict adopted a policy concerning the admission of children with communi\u00ad cable diseases. A committee-estab\u00ad lished pursuant to the policy-recom\u00ad mended that Ryan be admitted; the school board concurred and Ryan was admitted to kindergarten. During the first week of school, \"Ryan was involved in an incident in which another child and Ryan got into a skirmish and Ryan bit the other child's pants leg. No skin was broken.\" Ryan's parents were told to keep him at home until his case was reviewed. A psychologist analyzed Ryan and con\u00ad cluded that Ryan would behave \"ag\u00ad gressively\" in a kindergarten setting because his social and language skills were below those of his peers. The doctor could not predict what form this aggression might take. Based on this evaluation, the committee recom\u00ad mended that Ryan be kept out of school and taught at home. The school board concurred, but agreed to review the case after 3 months. The committee \"took the recommen\u00ad dations of the Centers for Disease Control [CDC] into account in its de\u00ad terminations and recommendations re\u00ad garding Ryan following the biting inci\u00ad dent.\" CDC's recommendations includ\u00ad ed the following: 1. Decisions regarding the type of educa\u00ad tional and care setting for CAIDSHnfected children should be based on the behavior, neurologic development, and physical condi\u00ad tion of the child and the expected type of interaction with others in that setting. 2. For the infected preschool-aged child and for some neurologically handicapped children who lack control of their body se\u00ad cretion or who display behavior, such as biting, . . . a more retricted environment is advisable until more is known about trans\u00ad mission in these settings. (Emphasis added.) Substantially similar guidelines and rec\u00ad ommendations were issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics <AAP) and the Cali\u00ad fornia State Department of Education <SDE). Apologies to my colleagues for taking the time for this much detail, but here is why this is important. However, a Federal district court judge enjoined the school district from excludCing] or preventCing] Ryan Thomas from attending his kindergarten class on the ground that he poses a risk of transmis\u00ad sion of the AIDS virus to his classmates or teachers. The school district was held to have violated section 504, the same section the Arline case turned on. The judge said: Aside from its citation to the recommen\u00ad dations of the CDC, AAP, and SDE, the School District has presented no medical evidence to prove that the AIDS virus can be transmitted by human bites. The infor\u00ad mation and recommendations published by the CDC, AAP, and SDE cite no such medi\u00ad cal evidence and do not, of themselves , prove that transmission by biting is possible. In this particular judicial district of California, evidently, it is impossible for a school district to act cautiously. Here is a case where the board estab\u00ad lished a written policy, the board set up a special review committee, and board admitted an AIDS victims after review. After the child got into a skir\u00ad mish and bit another child, the board sent the victim home but provided home-based education. The board had the child analyzed by a psychologist who concluded that the child would behave aggressively. The board then acted on the recom\u00ad mendations of its own committee which in turn had relied on guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the California Department of Educa\u00ad tion; Relying on expert advice with regard to children who bite, the board adopt\u00ad ed an interim policy of home-based education because-CDC's words-\"a more restricted environment is advisa\u00ad ble until more is known about [AIDS] transmission.\" I would ask my colleagues what in the world could the school board have done that would have been a more thoughtful, responsible, compassion\u00ad ate, balanced approach than this? It sounds to me-I do not know all the facts, but I know this many facts\u00ad that they did exactly what we would expect a group of school directors to do. That is that we would expect the school directors in our own home school districts to do in that circum\u00ad stance. They did not pass the muster of the court. In this case, the judge wants proof, mind you, not reasonable suppo\u00ad sition, not grounds to believe, but proof that you can get AIDS by biting. In other words, the school evidently has a duty to ensure that they can prove it by evidence. Are we going to set up a situation in which school dis\u00ad tricts have to let a student become ex\u00ad hibit A? I just think that is an unten\u00ad able thing for this Congress to do. I am honestly dumbfounded that the Supreme Court took the position it did and for us to go on and make it worse or to fail at this opportunity to make a clear-cut statement that conta\u00ad gious diseases are not a handicap within the meaning of section 504 just boggles my mind. That is exactly where we are going in the post-Arline era. Let me give you case No. 2. This is a teacher with AIDS. Consider the case of Vincent Chalk, a public schoolteacher who has AIDS. Chalk's employer removed him from the classroom but offered a job writ\u00ad ing grant applications at the same rate of pay. Chalk sued. The school board produced a profes\u00ad sor of medicine who testified that AIDS may be transmitted by as-yet undiscovered means, such as tears or saliva. The board admitted that its expert was in a medical minority. I think that is true. I believe that opinion is a medical minority just as the opinion that you could get AIDS from a blood transfusion was not only a medical minority, but a ridiculed medical minority 4 years ago. In any case, the board admitted that the expert was in the minority. By the way, my dentist thinks it is true. I will bet your dentist thinks it is true be\u00ad cause they are all wearing rubber gloves these days. They were not a few years ago. The board admitted its expert was in a medical minority. The board said: The possibility of the transmission of AIDS may be small based on the majority of medical opinion, but it's still a risk. And all the plaintiff's experts can say is that there are no reported cases. * * However, our expert believes that they haven't been studying this long enough. The Federal district court refused Chalk's request for a preliminary in\u00ad junction. The Court said: I do not in any sense mean to be an alarm\u00ad ist.* * * The likelihood is that the medical profession knows exactly what it's talking about. But I think it's too early to draw a definitive conclusion as far as this case is concerned about the extent of the risk. * * CH]ow much of a risk is worth taking to gratify the sensibilities of [Chalk] and allow him to return to the classroom because he deeply wants to do so when * * the results could be so disastrous? I leave it to you, ladies and gentle\u00ad men of the Senate. Did the school board act responsibly? I think so. It appears to me that they took into ac\u00ad count the legitimate concerns, even the anguish of the teacher, and said, \"We are not making you a pariah, we are not firing you, we are not guaran\u00ad teeing anything; we are saying you should not be in the classroom, you should be somewhere else earning the same salary writing grant applica\u00ad tions.\" The court agreed that the board had acted lawfully but the ninth Circuit reversed the finding that the board was discriminating against Chalk in violation of section 504 of the Reha\u00ad bilitation Act. The court of appeals said: Evidence before the district court over\u00ad whelmingly indicates that the casual con\u00ad tact incident to the performance of his teaching duties in the classroom presents no significant risk of harm to others. The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr. DASCHLE). The Chair would inform the Senator from Colorado that his 20 minutes has expired. January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 381 Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, unless the managers are ready with the amendment, I would ask for 10 more minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, of course I shall not object, but because of the fact we may reach final passage, and my last flight to Vermont is in about an hour I will not object. I hope maybe the Senator from Colora\u00ad do may not need to use the whole 10 minutes. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will not object, it is my understanding that those who are preparing a colloquy expect it to be ready in about 10 minutes. So I have no objection. It will probably work out all right. Mr. ARMSTRONG. Let me say to the Senator from Vermont that the reason I am speaking now is that the amendment is not ready, and rather than wait until it was on the floor and use time then, I thought I could share a few thoughts with my colleagues in advance of its arrival. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for an additional 10 minutes. Mr. ARMSTRONG. I thank the ma\u00ad jority leader and my other colleagues. Mr. President, I think we have pretty well got it into perspective, but I want to go back to where I began and document the point I made at the outset. Just a few years ago, health officials were telling us there was no signifi\u00ad cant risk of contracting AIDS from blood transfusions, either as a donor or as a recipient. In July 1983-this is not the Stone Age; this is July of 1983-the New York City Health Department, the Greater New York Hospital Associa\u00ad tion, and the Council of Hospital Blood Bank Directors of the Greater New York Region issued a joint state\u00ad ment asserting: Physicians can reassure their patients that the community's blood supplies are not considered a source of the spread of AIDS. <United Press International, July 14, 1983). On November 2, 1983, Dr. John Bove, a spokesman for the American Association of Blood Banks and a phy\u00ad sician at the Yale School of Medicine, said: The risk of contracting AIDS from a transfusion [is] one out of one million. <As\u00ad sociated Press, November 2, 1983) On October 16, 1983, an Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Edward N. Brandt, Jr., said: Let me make it clear, the blood supply of the nation is safe. I have no concern * * * and would not be afraid of receiving blood anywhere in the country. <Associated Press, October 16, 1983). Dr. Harold Jaffe of the Centers for Disease Control said in December 1982: The risk to the general population is quite small. <Newsweek, Dec. 27, 1982). On September 15, 1983, American Red Cross President Richard F. Schu\u00ad bert defended his agency's blood col\u00ad lection methods by saying the risks of getting AIDS from a blood transfusion are \"infinitesimal,\" according to a United Press International wire report of that date. Of course, we know better today. I am not here to criticize these experts. They were giving their best judgment at that time. What I am saying is that there is a lot we do not know about this, an enormous amount we are learning every day, and to require em\u00ad ployers to go to court based on the present state of medical knowledge and prove that somebody is a direct threat to the health of others is far too tough a test. Medical knowledge is constantly changing, even reversing itself. We have seen it over and over now. Let me read a description of the fight against diphtheria, a disease that ravaged America for generations: Physicians in the 18th and 19th centuries thought more about the nature of disease than physicians in previous eras. There was much casting aside and recasting of older ideas, and much that was new. Because of the prominence of diphtheria, physicians seeking to explain illness had to take diph\u00ad theria into account. Was diphtheria conta\u00ad gious? Its ease in spreading through the communities, especially among children, persuaded many lay members of the popula\u00ad tion. But medical opinion was spread among several points of view. Some thought disease passed along genetic, racial, or constitution\u00ad al lines. Others believed that disease result\u00ad ed from unhealthy environmental condi\u00ad tions, such as inclement weather or filth. Still others pointed to the deleterious influ\u00ad ence of social surroundings, such as poverty, poor diet, crowding, or inadequate clothing. Some doctors believed in contagion. You get the point. They did not know about diphtheria any more than they know about AIDS today. But in the fight against diphtheria, they did not have Congress saying you had to convince a court that you knew some\u00ad thing which medical science did not know. Who should decide about exposure to contagious diseases, and by what standards? Is the threat of serious con\u00ad tagious disease just another legal ele\u00ad ment that judges must weigh equally with all other elements? Is the \"rea\u00ad sonableness\" of judges more reasona\u00ad ble than the \"reasonableness\" of school boards, which, after all, have the duty to safeguard the health of their students and teachers? Are we quite sure that the correct legal stand\u00ad ard for measuring the risk of conta\u00ad gious disease is \"no significant risk\"? Are we willing to risk our children's lives for that standard? I do not think so. Mr. President, here is the dilemma: There is no doubt in my mind, though I have yet to see it, that the Hum\u00ad phrey amendment is better than the underlying bill. It improves the under\u00ad lying bill, and yet it does so in a way which falls so far short of what we ought to be doing by any thoughtful standard that I am in a dilemma whether to vote for it or not. I guess I will, because it appears to be about as far as we can go at this point. But I appeal to my colleagues that we do not have to settle this matter tonight. We could lay it over for a day or two and see if we can come up with a better formula. However, if we adopt the Humphrey amendment and it is signed into law, and that is all we do, we are making a very marginal improvement in a very bad situation. I am honestly not sure, as I stand here today, whether or not by adopting it we delay or advance the date at which we might have a better solution. I am pretty sure I know what we ought to do. What we ought to do is simply make a public policy decision that having a contagious disease is not a protected handicap within the mean\u00ad ing of section 504. That would then leave it to the good sense, responsibil\u00ad ity, and compassion of public and pri\u00ad vate employers to make that decision for themselves, rather than requiring them to go to court. So I am going to wait the advice of the Senator from New Hampshire and others and actually see the amend\u00ad ment before I decide what I am going to do in voting for it. I hope we can do much better than this, because, at least in the version that was floating around earlier, it does not go far enough-not to satisfy me, but to re\u00ad solve a bad decision of the Court in the Arline case. Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, if the unanimous-consent agreement permits, I ask the Senator to yield. Mr. ARMSTRONG. I believe I have time remaining. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has 3 minutes and 45 seconds remaining. Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, the amendment is now available, and the colloquy will be completed soon. First, I commend the Senator for his usual clear presentation of the facts. I agree with him: We ought to be doing far more than the Humphrey amend\u00ad ment will do. I also agree with him in his surmise or opinion that the Humphrey amend\u00ad ment is better than the status quo but that it is not much better. I agree with what the Senator said, and I hope we can do more in the future. I think that, given the mood dis\u00ad played by this body today, if we were to go to what he and I think we should seek, we would fail. In the meantime, 382 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 this is better than the status quo, fol\u00ad lowing the Arline decision. Mr. ARMSTRONG. I do not have the facts completely clear, but I un\u00ad derstand that the Senator from New Hampshire offered an amendment in committee which was of a more sweep\u00ad ing nature, more along the lines that I believe would be in order. Is that cor\u00ad rect, and, if so, what was the vote on it in committee? Mr. HUMPHREY. It was offered, and only two members of the commit\u00ad tee supported it. Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, I do not want anybody who reads the transcript or is in the Chamber to think that any of my observations are intended to criticize my friend from New Hampshire. He is trying to solve this problem, and tried in committee, and he could not get the votes. I sus\u00ad pect the reason is that when this issue has come up before, we handled it by unanimous consent or a short time agreement; but I think we need to ad\u00ad dress this issue. I have little doubt that as more Senators begin to under\u00ad stand the issue, there will be a disposi\u00ad tion to take a far more thoughful and penetrating look at it and adopt some\u00ad thing along the lines of the original Humphrey amendment. Mr. President, since the amendment is here, I think I will now yield the floor and let the process move on. But I hope other Senators will come to the floor and listen to the debate and un\u00ad derstand this issue, because we are going to have to come back to this. I would assume that probably later this year, in one way or another, we will have to address this again; because the way the courts are moving, I predict that within a brief period of time it will be obvious to every Senator, as it is to me and the Senator from New Hampshire, that this is not a satisfac\u00ad tory response to the problem, that this is far too serious and too important to deal with in this way. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleagues. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mr. WILSON. Mr. President, in the interest of time I think that I will pre\u00ad vail upon my colleagues to allow me to anticipate Senator HUMPHREY'S laying down his amendment. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is need for a unanimous-consent request by the Senator. Mr. WILSON. I thank my friend, the majority leader. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent to have 5 minutes for the purpose of addressing and commending those who have crafted the compromise that we will shortly have before us. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. The Senator is recognized for 5 min\u00ad utes. Mr. WILSON. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to view the lan\u00ad guage that has been crafted by those who are attempting to deal with what is a very difficult problem, and the Senator from Colorado, I think, has made that very clear in his eloquent comments that have addressed and made clear as well his concern for what has been a very, very difficult problem or, I should say more accu\u00ad rately, a set of problems. There are two purposes to the legis\u00ad lation that exists now on the books. There is a desire that those who, through no fault of their own, suffer some physical disability, some afflic\u00ad tion or some mental impairment not be deprived of employment or some other benefit if in fact there is no harm to anyone else that flows from their condition. Competing with that concern obvi\u00ad ously has been that enunciated by the Senator from Colorado, the concern for public health, and in the case that he has discussed, the Arline case, the Supreme Court, it seems to me, at\u00ad tempted to mediate those concerns and come to a Solomon-like judgment in which they could see to it that those suffering handicaps were not the subject of discrimination and at the same time obviously create some mechanism that would safeguard from the public health those whose afflic\u00ad tion did or conceivably would pose a threat to public health. I would agree that this may not be perfect language, but I think under the circumstances it deserves commen\u00ad dation because what it does is to state that there will be an adjustment in the definition of the phrase \"handi\u00ad capped person,\" to take into account that someone who is currently afflict\u00ad ed with the contagious disease or an infection and who by reason of that would constitute a threat to public health or to public safety or by reason of that affliction would be unable to perform the duties that person will not have the protection that exists for those who simply suffer a handicap and pose no threat of harm to others. I think what this language will do is to require of the local employer, let us say the local school district, the local park and recreation board, that they seek to get the best possible medical evidence. It is conceivable that under this language in different communities a different result may occur, but even in that, I hope, unlikely event as it begins to work its way up through ju\u00ad dicial appeal at some point hopefully we will achieve not only a legal but a medical consensus, and it is obviously far preferable that we achieve the kind of medical consensus nationally that would impose a uniform national standard so that the application of the law will be the same in all communi\u00ad ties all across the land. I commend those who have come to this compromise, the Senator from New Hampshire, the Senator from Massachusetts, and others who have been involved, because it is obviously of paramount importance that we safeguard public health. It is also of enormous importance that we do ev\u00ad erything humanly and humanely pos\u00ad sible to see to it that those who afflic\u00ad tion does not pose a threat to public health or to public welfare in some other fashion not be the subject of dis\u00ad crimination, and it seems to me that the compromise that they have struck here comes about as close as it is possi\u00ad ble at the present time. Obviously, too, Mr. President, the difficulty of what they have addressed here consists in the fact that the threat will be very different depending upon the disease, depending upon the circumstances of the individual in\u00ad volved. So it is probably not possible to generalize in the law beyond proposing what is a reasonable test and I think that, therfore, this compromise de\u00ad serves support because it does afford to us legal protection for the handi\u00ad capped person and legal protection as well as public health protection for the public in terms of the public health threat that might exist. So my commendation and I rise in support, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. MORNING BUSINESS Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there may be a period for morning business at this time not to exceed 5 minutes and that Senators may speak therein for not to exceed 1 minute each. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, the colloquy which has been under preparation for quite some time is being gone over now and it is expected to be ready for pres\u00ad entation to the Senate briefly. As far as we are able to determine, we know of no other amendments that will be called up once the Humphrey amendment has been disposed of by colloquy or otherwise. It is still hoped that the Senate might be able to com\u00ad plete action on this bill today. And, if I may add one additional hope, it would be that the Senate might be able to finish by 6 o'clock or very shortly thereafter, in which event, if final action is taken on this bill today, the Senate will go over until Monday and will not be in tomorrow. Committees will meet on tomorrow so that commit-January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 383 tee work can be done without inter\u00ad ruption by rollcalls and quorum calls. UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREE- MENT-NOMINATION OF AN\u00ad THONY M. KENNEDY TO BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as in ex\u00ad ecutive session, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that, provided the nomination and report have been filed by the close of business on Monday, February 1, the Senate proceed to executive ses\u00ad sion on Wednesday morning at 9:30 a.m.; that there be 1 hour of debate, to be equally divided and controlled in accordance with the usual form on the nomination of Mr. Kennedy to be As\u00ad sociate Justice of the Supreme Court, the time to be controlled by Mr. BIDEN, and Mr. THURMOND; that the vote on the nomination occur at 10:30 a.m.; provided further, that there be no time for debate on the motion to reconsider and that, upon the disposi\u00ad tion of the nomination, the Senate return to legislative session without further action, motion, or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so ordered. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order to order the yeas and nays at this time to the nomination of Mr. Kennedy. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so ordered. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the nomination as if in executive session. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. MR. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank Mr. ARMSTRONG, who is the acting Re\u00ad publican leader at the moment. UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREE- MENT-ILO CONVENTION <NO. 144) AND ILO CONVENTION <NO. 147) Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have a further request which I believe has been cleared all around. As in executive session, I ask unani\u00ad mous consent that at such time as the Senate considers Executive Calender No. 6, the ILO Convention <No. 144) concerning tripartite consultations to promote the implementation of inter\u00ad national labor standards, and Execu\u00ad tive Calendar No. 7, the ILO Conven\u00ad tion <No. 147) concerning the mini\u00ad mum standards in merchant ships, there will be 30 minutes, equally divid\u00ad ed between the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Relations, or their designees, on each of the two conventions, and that no amendments or motions to recommit be in order; provided further, that, after all time for debate has been used or yielded back on each of the two conventions, the Senate proceed to vote back to back on the conventions without any intervening action, and that the call for the regular order be automatic at the expiration of 15 min-Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I under\u00ad stand the Senators are ready now to resume consideration of the pending business. I yield the floor. CIVIL RIGHTS RESTORATION ACT utes on both of those rollcalls. The Senate continued with consider- The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is ation of the bill. there objection? Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if the leader will yield, could we know what your plan is on these? Do you intend to call these up on Monday? Mr. BYRD. Yes; I intend to go to these on Monday. Mr. ARMSTRONG. Can you give us an idea of when the vote would occur? Mr. BYRD. I want to talk to Mr. MOYNIHAN, who is handling the mat\u00ad ters on this side of the aisle. I will talk to him on the next rollcall, after which I will be in a position to respond to the Senator's question. Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield? Mr. BYRD. I am happy to yield. Mr. HATCH. I think I will be han\u00ad dling it on this side of the aisle. If that is so, we would like to have the votes so they will be over by 2:30. Mr. BYRD. All right. Mr. HATCH would like to see the votes completed by no later than 2:30, and he is manag\u00ad ing the two conventions on that side of the aisle. When Mr. MOYNIHAN comes to the floor for the next rollcall vote\u00ad and there will be at least one more rollcall vote-I will get an answer to the Senator's question. Mr. ARMSTRONG. I apologize to the leader. My attention was distract\u00ad ed. It is likely that the vote would occur between 2 and 3:30? Mr. BYRD. Well, I hope the vote would occur earlier than that. That would accommodate Mr. HATCH. Mr. ARMSTRONG. Earlier than 2 o'clock? Mr. BYRD. Earlier, I hope. Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, it is a matter of indifference to me, but there is a person on our side of the aisle who expressed great interest that this occur sometime after 2 and I un\u00ad derstand there are others who want it to occur before 3:30. As far as I am concerned, September would be all right. Let me leave it at this, if I may, to just express to the leader-I do not intend to object-that if it is possible for the leader to work it out so the vote occurs between 2 and 3:30, it would be convenient for Members on this side. Mr. BYRD. I will certainly make every effort to do that if Mr. MOYNI\u00ad HAN, the manager on this side, can ac\u00ad commodate himself to that. This does not mean there will not be rollcall votes before 2 o'clock on Monday. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. AMENDMENT NO, 1396 <Purpose: To provide a clarification for oth\u00ad erwise qualified individuals with handi\u00ad caps in the employment context) Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be stated. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. HUMPHREY] for himself and Mr. HARKIN, proposes an amendment numbered 1396. At the end of the bill insert the following: CLARIFICATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH HANDICAPS IN THE EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT SEc. . <a> Section 7(8) of the Rehabilita\u00ad tion Act of 1973 is amended by adding after subparagraph <B> the following: \"<C> for the purpose of sections 503 and 504, as such sections relate to employment, such term does not include an individual who has a currently contagious disease or infection and who, by reason of such disease or infection, would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or who, by reason of the currently conta\u00ad gious disease or infection, is unable to per\u00ad form the duties of the job.\". The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I un\u00ad derstand under the UC agreement there was time set aside for the consid\u00ad eration of a Humphrey amendment. Am I correct? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand the situation at the present time, that there has been an amendment which has just been read which is a Harkin\u00ad Humphrey amendment, and I would ask consent that it be in order for the Senate to consider that measure at this particular time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa and the floor managers and others, the staff involved, for working diligently to come to compromise language and likewise I thank my colleagues not in\u00ad volved for their patience. Mr. President, I would like to ad\u00ad dress several questions to the Senator from Iowa, relative to his understand\u00ad ing of this amendment. Is the Senator prepared? Do I have the attention of the Senator from Iowa? Is it your understanding that this amendment is designed to address an issue comparable to the one faced by 384 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 Congress in 1978 with regard to cover\u00ad age of alcohol and drug abusers under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act? That is, Congress wishes to assure em\u00ad ployers that they are not required to retain or hire individuals with a conta\u00ad gious disease or infection when such individuals pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals, or cannot perform the essential duties of a job. Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator would yield, yes, Senator, that is my under\u00ad standing. Mr. HUMPHREY. I thank the Sena\u00ad tor for that response. Inquiring fur\u00ad ther, is it the Senator's understanding that this amendment does nothing to change the current laws regarding rea\u00ad sonable accommodation as it applies to individuals with handicaps who cannot perform the duties of the job? Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator would yield, there seems to be a bit of a dif\u00ad ference here. On my copy of the com\u00ad promise, which again I would just compliment the Senator from New Hampshire and his staff for working on so diligently to reach a compromise in this, the language that I have here basically has a question mark after the word \"handicaps.\" That is in the third sentence, \"to individuals with handi\u00ad caps.\" That is why I did not under\u00ad stand the last little clause that was added and I would have to have some time to think about that. I am sorry. Mr. HUMPHREY. Somehow we got two different copies here. I would be happy to end my question with the question mark after the word \"handi\u00ad caps.\" Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that. I am not certain that I know what ex\u00ad actly that does, but, if the Senator would, I would appreciate it and I would respond, then, to the Senator's question by saying that: Yes, indeed, that is my understanding. Mr. HUMPHREY. Finally, is it the Senator's understanding, as we stated in 1978 with respect to alcohol and drug abusers, that the two-step proc\u00ad ess in section 504 applies in the situa\u00ad tion under which it was first deter\u00ad mined that a person was handicapped and then it is determined that a person is otherwise qualified? Mr. HARKIN. Yes. I do under\u00ad stand-yes, that is my understanding. Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment would undo the United States Supreme Court's decision in School Board of Nassau County versus Arline, which held that individuals with contagious diseases are handi\u00ad capped within the meaning of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and are therefore protected from dis\u00ad crimination based on their medical condition. The factual question posed in Arline was narrow: Are employees suffering from contagious diseases subject to automatic termination, without regard for any actual incapacity or risk of in\u00ad fection? The Court's answer was corre\u00ad spondingly clear: Groundless fears do not alone justify terminating an em\u00ad ployee with a contagious disease. The question in Arline surfaced in the Supreme Court because, in adopt\u00ad ing the Rehabilitation Act, Congress had given statutory protection to the handicapped without enumerating the specific conditions to which the act would apply. Of course, Congress cus\u00ad tomarily acts by categories; groups are as central to the legislative process as cases are to the courts. Still, it is easier to articulate a general principal than to apply it in a threatening situation or uphold it in a difficult case. The Rehabilitation Act was needed and passed because human beings often harbor an unreasonable dread of diseases and disorders. It is precisely because AIDS is surrounded by this same unreasonable and unwarranted fear and distaste that the Supreme Court's decision was sensible. The logic of the Rehabilitation Act de\u00ad mands that we make no distinctions where no reasonable grounds for dif\u00ad ferentiation exist. In adopting an amendment contrary to the Arline decision, we would embody the prejudices that we over\u00ad came and precluded in the Rehabilita\u00ad tion Act. However, a number of un\u00ad pleasant realities pertaining to AIDS give us additional reasons to reject the proposed amendment. Some of us, and many Americans, seem to feel that we can confront people with AIDS as adversaries or en\u00ad emies and forcibly control the spread of AIDS. I don't believe that would be morally acceptable, but even if it were, it is impossible. We will control AIDS only through cooperation, education, and respect. By September 18, 1987, the Center for Disease Control had reported 51,361 cases of AIDS, and it was clear then that many cases had not been properly diagnosed or reported. The Public Health Service estimates that more than 270,000 cases of AIDS will be diagnosed by 1991. According to the CDC, there may be as many as 100 people who carry HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, for each person with AIDS. An estimated 25-50 percent of those who are HIV positive may devel\u00ad op AIDS within 5 to 10 years. I hope that we will not resort to har\u00ad assing and rejecting people who have been exposed to AIDS. In any event, it is clear that we do not have the capac\u00ad ity to identify and control the millions of people who may become contagious with AIDS, half of whom may never display any symptoms, and most of whom would not be eager to be diag\u00ad nosed and subjected to discrimination. A program of contact tracing, for ex\u00ad ample, would become impossible under such circumstances. A threat of im\u00ad prisonment is not likely to be very ef-f ective against someone who has been diagnosed with AIDS, even if our pris\u00ad ons were equipped to hold numbers of fatally ill individuals. Only with the trust and cooperation of those who suffer from AIDS, can we continue to seek effective treat\u00ad ment for AIDS, and to discover treat\u00ad ments that prevent antibody-positive individuals from developing the dis\u00ad ease. Even if our compassion fails us in the face of AIDS, I hope that our powers of reason will still allow us to recognize the realities that must dic\u00ad tate our response to AIDS. It is futile to call for measures that cannot beef\u00ad fective and simply reflect our most un\u00ad worthy reactions to AIDS, drug users, and homosexuals. Further, we would generate panic and cruelty that we could never extinguish. Instead, we must commit ourselves to a realistic and balanced approach to AIDS. We can begin by rejecting the proposed amendment. Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, the form of agreement is that, at least on the part of the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from New Hampshire, there would be no further debate or discussion at this point. Unless other Senators wish to do so, I think we are ready to dispose of it. A voice vote is acceptable. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, Mr. President, we have a time agree\u00ad ment. Is that correct? The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Mr. KENNEDY. I would be glad to yield back the remainder of the time on our side. Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield back the remainder of ours. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. The ques\u00ad tion is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senators from New Hampshire and Iowa. The amendment <No. 1396) was agreed to. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was agreed to. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this bill would unnecessarily extend four major civil rights statutes far beyond the scope ever intended. Under this bill, we are venturing into unknown areas of coverage for these statutes. It has become obvious that the sponsors don't even know for cer\u00ad tain how far this bill will extend. Cov\u00ad erage under the bill would be limited only by the imagination of special in\u00ad terest advocacy groups and the unf et\u00ad tered discretion of Federal judges. January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 385 One of the problems is that the bill represents a broad attack on religious liberty in America. It would expand coverage over every operation of an entire religious school system where Federal money may only go to one ac\u00ad tivity at one school within the system. It also would cover all of the activities of a church or synagogue in all of its buildings in an area if any program or activity in the area receives any Feder\u00ad al money. Furthermore, it fails to pro\u00ad tect adequately the religious tenets of educational institutions and other in\u00ad stitutions covered under the expansion of title IX. Mr. President, as a result of the ex\u00ad pansion of coverage under the statutes amended by the bill, many more sec\u00ad tors of American society would be sub\u00ad jected to increased Federal paperwork requirements, random on-site compli\u00ad ance reviews, physical accessibility re\u00ad quirements, and affirmative action. Mr. President, I am particularly con\u00ad cerned with the effect this legislation would have on the Nation's farmers. Agriculture is the largest employer in the United States. Growers hire 4 per\u00ad cent of the total U.S. work force\u00ad nearly 5.5 million people-and this payroll costs about $9.5 billion each year. To put this in proper perspec\u00ad tive, labor costs on the farm equal or exceed other costs of production in most cases. Mr. President, our farmers are al\u00ad ready overburdened with Federal laws and regulations regarding employment and other phases of their operations. S. 557 would threaten the Nation's farmers with coverage of additional statutory and regulatory requirements that were never intended to cover them and which are unnecessary. Last year Mr. C.H. Fields, on behalf of the American Farm Bureau Federa\u00ad tion, testified before the Senate Labor Committee in opposition to S. 557. I will ask unanimous consent that a copy of that testimony be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my re\u00ad marks. Mr. President, let me close by quot\u00ad ing a sentence from Mr. Fields' testi\u00ad mony: We have long believed that unnecessary and unwarranted expansion of the power and responsibility of the federal govern\u00ad ment constitutes a serious threat to the fun\u00ad damental principles upon which this nation was founded and prospered among the na\u00ad tions of the world. Mr. President, that captures my feel\u00ad ings precisely, and I urge my col\u00ad leagues to vote against this unwise leg\u00ad islation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the statement of Mr. Fields be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the state\u00ad ment was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: 19-059 0-89-13 (Pt. 1) STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN FARM BUREAU FEDERATION TO THE SENATE LABOR COMMIT\u00ad TEE REGARDING S. 557-\"CIVIL RIGHTS RES\u00ad TORATION ACT OF 1987\" <Presented by C. H. Fields, Assistant Director National Affairs Division) The American Farm Bureau Federation is the nation's largest farm organization with a current voluntary membership in excess of 3.5 million member families who have paid annual dues to nearly 2,800 county Farm Bureaus in 49 states and Puerto Rico. Last January, the voting delegates of the member State Farm Bureau reaffirmed a policy opposed to any legislation that would expand the scope of the existing civil rights statutes to cover those who have not been previously subject to them. The nation's family farms are already struggling for their continued existence as economic enti\u00ad ties, and are overburdened with a myriad of federal regulations affecting employment on farms and many other phases of their operations. They should not be threatened with coverage by additional statutory and regulatory requirements in the area of dis\u00ad crimination and civil rights, particularly when such coverage was never intended by the original sponsors of the original statutes and when there is no need for such cover\u00ad age. No group of people in this country has a stronger belief in the fundamental princi\u00b7 ples of freedom, liberty and justice em\u00ad bodied in our nation's basic charter than this nation's farmers and ranchers. We have long believed that unnecessary and unwar\u00ad ranted expansion of the power and responsi\u00ad bility of the federal government constitutes a serious threat to the fundamental princi\u00ad ples upon which this nation was founded and prospered among the nations of the world. We are mindful of the fact that some 750,000 farmers and ranchers are employers. Any statute or regulation affecting employ\u00ad ment practices could have an impact on ag\u00ad ricultural employers with regard to sex, age or handicap requirements. Several thousand farmers throughout the country operate roadside markets and other direct markets to consumers. The Department of Agricul\u00ad ture administers a number of programs in\u00ad volving federal payments or other assistance to farmers and ranchers. The broad and sometimes vague language in this bill raises serious questions as to what impact anti-dis\u00ad crimination regulations would have on such benefits as loan guarantees, commodity loans, deficiency payments, disaster pay\u00ad ments, price supports, conservation cost\u00ad sharing, etc. Supporters of the bill state that Section 7 provides a \"rule of construction\" which, in effect, exempts farmers as ultimate benefi\u00ad ciaries of federal aid. We find that statement unpersuasive be\u00ad cause: 1. There is no indication in the bill as to which persons or entities are defined as ulti\u00ad mate beneficiaries and under which aid pro\u00ad grams. We are not sure it includes business\u00ad es, such as farms and ranches. 2. Farms appear to be clearly covered by subparagraph (3) of each operative section because farms are business entities or pri\u00ad vate organizations, or both under this bill. 3. Even if Section 7 is constructed to ex\u00ad clude coverage of farmers as ultimate bene\u00ad ficiaries before enactment of S. 557, any farm-aid programs adopted after enactment of S. 557 would not be excluded from cover\u00ad age. It might also be erroneously argued that Section 4(c) exempts farmers from coverage under the Act. We point out, however, that this language applies only to discrimination against handicapped persons under Section 504 and does not reduce compliance burdens under Title VI or age discrimination. Even under Section 504, only some farmers will benefit from this exemption. USDA Section 504 regulations define \"small providers\" as entities \"with fewer than 15 employees.\" Somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 farms employ more than 14 persons. Fur\u00ad ther, even the \"small providers\" are ex\u00ad empted only from the most onerous of Sec\u00ad tion 504 regulatory burdens, such as making structural alterations to existing facilities\u00ad and only \"if alternative means ... are avail\u00ad able.\" The small operations would still be sub\u00ad ject to many onerous requirements, includ\u00ad ing paperwork requirements, requirements to consult with disabled groups and make a record of such consultations; extensive em\u00ad ployment regulations; and a requirement to \"take appropriate steps\" to guarantee that communications with hearing and vision-im\u00ad paired applicants, employees, and customers can be understood. To the extent that S. 557 extends the basic principle that the term \"program or activity\" means all of the operations of the \"entire corporation, partnership, private or\u00ad ganization, or sole proprietorship,\" farms may well fall within the scope of that defi\u00ad nition in several ways. For example, a subsi\u00ad dy to one commodity on a farm would sub\u00ad ject the entire entity to regulation. A farm of contiguous fields could be deemed a \"geo\u00ad graphically separate facility,\" and thus cov\u00ad ered in its entirety. Additionally, farming could be construed as providing a \"social service\" to consumers. Farm Bureau is not opposed to a bill that simply provides coverage under the Civil Rights statutes the same as it was before the Grove City College decision; but our analysis of this bill leads us to the conclu\u00ad sion that it seeks to go much further than that. We believe it would result in a broad expansion of coverage under the Civil Rights statutes, including farmers who were never covered before. For that reason we are opposed to S. 557 as introduced. We favor, instead, a bill such as the one introduced by Senators Dole and Hatch in the last Congress and which we understood will be introduced in both Houses of this Congress. We hope this Com\u00ad mittee will give careful consideration to the concerns we have expressed. We appreciate the opportunity to present our views. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this bill. The issue surrounding Grove City-related legis\u00ad lation has been improperly focused from the beginning. Federal financial assistance should not be allowed to fund discriminatory activities. No one could rationally argue otherwise. How\u00ad ever, the sponsors of S. 557 have chosen to distort this debate by posing the question in simplistic terms under which one is either for their bill or for federally subsidized discrimination. Many have argued during this debate that they want to restore civil rights coverage to what it was before the Grove City decision. There is sub\u00ad stantial evidence that coverage prior 386 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 to Grove City was program specific, not institutionwide. However, this bill goes well beyond institutionwide cov\u00ad erage. It does not restore the reach of the four civil rights laws to their pre\u00ad Grove City status, but expands Feder\u00ad al authority. The broad extension of these four laws goes well beyond what is justifiable. Briefly, I would like to discuss a number of significant instances where the breadth of coverage is simply too broad because one small part of a par\u00ad ticular entity receives Federal funds. I believe strongly that there must be an exception to the institutionwide scheme of coverage-that is when the institution is a church or religious or\u00ad ganization. Many churches participate in federally assisted programs which serve communities across the country. All the federally assisted programs op\u00ad erated by a church should be covered under the statutes addressed by S. 557. However, extension of Federal regula\u00ad tions throughout the whole church as a result of such assistance treads all over first amendment rights. I do not believe that the Federal Government should be interjected into the oper\u00ad ation of our churches . Additionally, this legislation will provide for coverage of entire religious school systems when only one school, or part of one school, in a system re\u00ad ceives Federal financial assistance. Prior to Grove City, only the particu\u00ad lar school that received assistance would have been covered. S. 557 would expand coverage to the entire religious school system instead of just the par\u00ad ticular school that receives the Feder\u00ad al funds. This coverage threatens reli\u00ad gious liberty by placing the religious goals of those schools in a secondary position to the vast regulatory require\u00ad ments of S. 557. As the Constitution guarantees reli\u00ad gious freedom, we must tread lightly when it comes to asserting Federal regulation of religion or its institu\u00ad tions. Additional provisions of S. 557 are ambiguous and unnecessary. For ex\u00ad ample, certain sections mandate blan\u00ad ket coverage by the four statutes of any corporation, partnership, other private organization, or a sole propri\u00ad etorship, which is principally engaged in the business of providing education, health care, housing, social services, or parks and recreation. I can think of no justification for the blanket coverage. Stated simply, there is no reason to treat these so called special purpose businesses any different from other businesses. Coverage for all corpora\u00ad tions should be uniform. In closing, these are some of the issues which make the proposed \"Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987\" unac\u00ad ceptable. The question of whether or not Federal funds should be allowed to subsidize discrimination is not the issue. Clearly, Federal funds should not be used to subsidize discrimina\u00ad tion. The major issue is the need to carefully balance and protect constitu\u00ad tionally guaranteed freedoms and rights against the reach of the Federal Government. A fundamental right\u00ad the freedom of religion-is a guaran\u00ad teed constitutional right. The Federal Government must not get into the reg\u00ad ulation of religion. This bill simply goes too far. It represents a significant increase in Federal jurisdiction over churches and synagogues, private and religious schools, and the private sector. For these reasons, I will vote against s. 557. Mr. DIXON. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of S. 557, the \"Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 ,\" I rise today to solicit my colleagues' support for its approval. Having debated S. 557 for 2 days now, we all know what the issues are. The bill overturns the 1984 Supreme Court decision in Grove City College versus Bell. The decision severely nar\u00ad rows the scope of coverage of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 which bar sex discrmination in f eder\u00ad ally assisted education programs. The Court decision affects three other laws which bar discrimination since they contain similar language. The laws are title VI of the Civil Rights Act, section 504 of the Reha\u00ad bilitation Act, and the Age Discrimina\u00ad tion Act of 1975. Mr. President, I support S. 557 be\u00ad cause I deplore discrimination and strongly feel that the Federal Govern\u00ad ment should not be about the business of subsidizing it. Additionally, I want to very clearly express my reasons for supporting the overturn of this Court decision. First, I do not believe that it is in line with the intent of Congress. Second, S. 557 has 58 cosponsors, more than a simple majority of the Members of this body. And third, I am certain that the people of the State of Illinois do not want the Federal Government to sub\u00ad sidize discrimination. I am pleased that the Senate ap\u00ad proved the Danforth amendment ear\u00ad lier today. During this past year, many hospitals in my own State of Illinois have expressed serious concerns that provisions of S. 557 would force them to perform abortions. Additionally, on behalf of many of its members, the Il\u00ad linois Hospital Association has been in constant contact with my office re\u00ad garding this issue. From where I come in Belleville, IL, Mr. President, there is an old saying that \"where there is smoke, there is fire.\" I am pleased that this body smothered the smoke on the abortion issue by approving the Danforth amendment. Mr. President, I urge immediate ap\u00ad proval of S. 557. Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 557, the proposed Civil Rights Restoration Act. I am proud to be one of the principal spon\u00ad sors of this important legislation to re\u00ad store the effectiveness of our Nation's four basic civil rights statutes which provide that Federal funds may not be used to support invidious discrimina\u00ad tion. Mr. President, in 1984, the Supreme Court dealt a crippling blow to .the en\u00ad forcement of the civil rights statutes\u00ad title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, section 504 of the Rehabilita\u00ad tion Act of 1973, and the Age Discrimi\u00ad nation Act of 1975-which provide that entities which accept Federal fi\u00ad nancial assistance must not discrimi\u00ad nate on the basis of race, color, nation\u00ad al origin, sex, handicap, or age. In the case of Grove City College, the Court held that the obligation to refrain from discrimination was limited only to the specific program which received the Federal funds. Since that decision was handed down, its dire consequences have become apparent. In numerous in\u00ad stances, civil rights complaints have been dismissed because the specific programs involved could not be dem\u00ad onstrated to have received direct Fed\u00ad eral funding. In October 1987 a Feder\u00ad al court of appeals reversed a district court decision holding that the State of Alabama had perpetuated racial segregation in its system of public higher education on the grounds that the Justice Department, which had brought the litigation, had not speci\u00ad fied which programs or activities within the school system had received Federal funds and how those particu\u00ad lar programs were discriminatory. Lit\u00ad erally hundreds of administrative com\u00ad plaints filed with the Department of Education alleging civil rights viola\u00ad tions have been dismissed because of the Grove City ruling. The longer the Grove City decision remains the law of the land, the great\u00ad er its adverse impact will be on civil rights enforcement. Mr. President, during the Senate's consideration of S. 557, we decisively defeated amendments aimed at weak\u00ad ening the legislation expect one: the Danforth amendment relating to abor\u00ad tion. I strongly opposed that amend\u00ad ment which, if enacted, would rewrite title IX so as to overturn regulations promulgated under the Ford adminis\u00ad tration which prohibit educational en\u00ad tities from discriminating against stu\u00ad dents or employees who are seeking or have had an abortion. I regret it was added to this important bill intended to restore rights, not withdraw them. I hope the Danforth amendment does not become law. January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 387 CONCLUSION Mr. President, the proposed Civil Rights Restoration Act is about one issue: Whether the funds of the United States should be allowed to be used to subsidize discrimination. Many of us thought that we had answered that question once and for all with the enactment of the civil rights statutes in the 1960's and 1970's. We must, today, reaffirm that Federal funds will not be used to perpetuate discrimina\u00ad tion. We must reaffirm our continuing and enduring commitment to achiev\u00ad ing a just and a fair society, a society where every individual, regardless of sex, race, age, or disability, enjoys the right to participate and contribute fully. DON'T EXPAND REGULATIONS FOR AGRICULTURE Mr. KARNES. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment to settle the concern that this legislation will expand the scope of the civil rights laws beyond that which existed before the Grove City decision. I share the concern of many of my colleagues about its potential far-reaching effects on farmers and ranchers throughout the country. I am concerned about the possibility of farmers being brought under the civil rights laws by virtue of their par\u00ad ticipation in Federal farm programs. As currently drafted, farmers who re\u00ad ceive loan guarantees, commodity loans, deficiency payments, disaster payments, price supports, and so on, might be forced to comply with the entire range of civil rights statutes. If this circumstance were to come about, it would lay a whole new set of Feder\u00ad al regulations at the doorstep of farm\u00ad ers and ranchers across the land. This does not imply that farmers are opposed to civil rights or want to turn back the clock to the times and the events that necessitated the enact\u00ad ment of these laws. In this case, the issue is not discrimination. The issue is unnecessary Federal interference. If someone feels that complaints have been made or a record has been estab\u00ad lished showing that there are civil rights problems on the American farm that warrant our attention, I would like to hear those arguments and see that record. I do not feel that any such record exists, nor do I feel that there is any basis for such a record. So let's leave them out of the civil rights discussion altogether. I do not know that it is the direct intent of any Senator to include farm\u00ad ers and ranchers in the coverage of S. 557. The problem with the bill is that is leaves open the question of whether farmers and ranchers could be includ\u00ad ed. It creates an \u00b7ambiguity which could ultimately require litigation to resolve unless we deal specifically with the issue here and now. Section 7 of the bill states that none of its provisions shall be construed to extend the application of the civil rights laws to ultimate beneficiaries of Federal financial assistance excluded from coverage before enactment. It is asserted by some that this language is sufficient to lay the farm and ranch issue to rest. It does not, however, make clear which ultimate benefici\u00ad aries are now excluded, nor does it ad\u00ad dress the issue of exclusion of those persons receiving benefits from pro\u00ad grams that may be enacted in the future. Comments in the committee report are not adequate to address these concerns because the bill sub\u00ad stantially rewrites the statutes and adds a new definition of programs and activities covered by the law. The purpose of section 7 may be to generally exempt a number of activi\u00ad ties touched by Government funding. However, I have received an opinion developed by the Justice Department asserting that section 7 is not neces\u00ad sarily sufficient to remove all ambigu\u00ad ities about application to farmers and ranchers. Mr. President, I ask unani\u00ad mous consent that the Justice Depart\u00ad ment opinion that I ref er to be printed in the RECORD immediately following my statement. Farmers have enough problems. They should not have to operate under the gun, knowing that a court may later rule that S. 557 does include farmers and ranchers, triggering un\u00ad necessary, but nonetheless mandatory regulations for them to study and adhere to. They have neither the time, money, nor personnel to attempt to comply with the requirements of bu\u00ad reaucrats who may demand volumes of proof of nondiscrimination even when no complaint has been received. Soon, agribusinessmen are going to feel like they have to call their lawyer before they go out to work in the fields. There is nothing in this bill which specifically assures farmers that they will not be covered by the wide range of civil rights laws. What could happen if a court would construe the law to include farmers and ranchers against our intent? Such an occur\u00ad rence has been known to happen from time to time. The possibilities are mind-boggling and outrageous. Let's consider some. Would farmers have to hire persons with infectious diseases such as TB or AIDS? Perhaps they could be required to restructure jobs, modify facilities or install equip\u00ad ment for handicapped persons. They might have to establish griev\u00ad ance procedures whereby a hearing would have to be held before letting a worker go simply because he doesn't do the job. \u00b7 Even small operations could be sub\u00ad ject to increased Federal paperwork requirements, random on-site compli\u00ad ance reviews and other regulatory bur\u00ad dens. Passage\u00b7 of this bill could make farm\u00ad ing a whole new ball game, a game that I know farmers like my Nebraska constituents do not want to play. The potential impact of this legislation on the average farm operation is devas\u00ad tating. Anyone familiar with farming knows that regulations like these on farms would be utterly ludicrous. Farmers are experiencing a severe crisis. They are overburdened with low commodity prices, excess surplus stocks, and the lack of affordable fi\u00ad nancing. To be faced with additional statutory and regulatory requirements could jeopardize their continued exist\u00ad ence. Mr. President, as the owner of my family's farm, I can tell you how farm\u00ad ers and ranchers would react to ex\u00ad tending new civil rights regulations to the farm. They would shake their heads in disbelief. They would wonder why in the world the U.S. Congress is slapping on controls that have no ra\u00ad tional relationship whatsoever to life on the average family farm. They would sit down in disgust and write to us, pleading \"leave us alone!\"-and they would be completely justified in doing so. Therefore , to be absolutely certain that farmers and ranchers will not be covered by these statutes, I introduced my amendment to clarify the matter. It does nothing more than settle the issue at hand. It states that nothing contained in the statute shall be con\u00ad strued to extend application of the four titles in question to farms, farm\u00ad ers, ranches, or ranchers, based upon participation in any Federal agricul\u00ad tural program unless application is ex\u00ad pressly required. I believe that is the unarticulated intent of the act, but my amendment would remove all uncer\u00ad tainty. I wish to ask the Senator from Mas\u00ad sachusetts, does S. 557 affect the his\u00ad torical exemption of farmers and other persons who receive payments under various agricultural support and marketing programs? Mr. KENNEDY. No. Farmers and other persons who receive Federal grants, loans, or assistance contracts would be \"recipients\". A full discus\u00ad sion of this continuation of present policy is contained in the committee report, Senate Report 100-64, at pages 24-24. Mr. KARNES. With that clarifica\u00ad tion, I withdraw my amendment at this time. I am not certain whether this action will completely resolve the issue altogether, but I feel we have taken a good step toward establishing a record to protect the interests of farmers and other agricultural inter\u00ad ests from onerous and unnecessary added regulation and costs. I yield the floor. Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, there is no subject more important to Amer\u00ad ica than civil rights. Our past failures in guaranteeing equal opportunity to all members of the American commu-388 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 nity have been our badge of shame. Our successes in redressing those in\u00ad equalities have been our greatest pride. But we cannot rest on our laurels. We must not take the inviolability of equal opportunity for granted. For once again civil rights are under siege, and this body must liberate them. Why do I say that civil rights in America are besieged? Because in Feb\u00ad ruary 1984, the Supreme Court, at the instigation of the Department of Jus\u00ad tice, gutted the principle law outlaw\u00ad ing sex discrimination in education. Education-the great equalizer. Educa\u00ad tion-the very essence of equal oppor\u00ad tunity. I can not believe that in 1984, our Supreme Court ruled that it is OK to discriminate against women in fed\u00ad erally assisted educational programs. Hard to believe; yet it's true. That Supreme Court decision, the Grove City case, has left a gaping hole in all our antidiscrimination laws. It has dealt a body blow to the cause of civil rights in America. It cannot be al\u00ad lowed to stand. Grove City jeopardizes the hard won rights of millions of women and mi\u00ad norities. It dashes the hopes that the elderly and the disabled might take their rightful place in our great econo\u00ad my. It makes a mockery of the princi\u00ad ples for which our Nation stands. Unless we bring the Supreme Court's decision in line with the histo\u00ad ry and clear intent of our civil rights laws, there will no longer be an all-in\u00ad clusive prohibition against discrimina\u00ad tion based on race, sex, handicap or age. Schools, hospitals, State and local governments-indeed any entity con\u00ad ducting a federally assisted activity will be empowered to get around the clear intent of our civil rights laws. No Congress that believes in the principle of equal justice under law can permit the Grove City case to stand. That is the purpose the Civil Rights Restoration Act. Support for this legislation is broad and deep. Top ranking civil rights offi\u00ad cials in four administrations have unanimously endorsed it. Women and blacks are solidly behind it. Given the unassailable strengths of this legislation and its broad-based, en\u00ad thusiastic support, who could be against it? Well, sad to say, a small but determined band of people implacably opposed to civil rights are trying to prevent passage of the bill. They argue, disingeniously, that the Civil rights Restoration Act returns the burdensome yoke of Federal intru\u00ad sion on the frail neck of the States and the private sector. Even sadder, they are supported in their claims by the Department of Justice and the White House. These claims are groundless. They are part and parcel of a tactic of delay, designed to prevent passage of this es-sential bill. But the bill's proponents are even more determined. Let me be quite clear about what this act does. It reaffirms an appropri\u00ad ate interpretation of existing law. That's all. It does not add to that law. It does not thrust the Federal Govern\u00ad ment down the throats of the States. And it is not the camel's nose of Fed\u00ad eral intrusion under the tent of civil liberties. It just says that the civil rights law prior to Grove City remains the law today. It reaffirms this Na\u00ad tion's commitment to the principle that all people are created equal. Which is how I, and I believe a large majority of the American people, want it. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I support the Civil Rights Restoration Act. The act is needed to correct the 1984 Supreme Court decision in Grove City College versus Bell which held that recipients of public funds need comply with the civil rights laws only in the particular program or activity to which public funds are directed. The effect of this ruling has been widespread. It has reached far beyond the original confines of the case\u00ad which was brought only on the ques\u00ad tion of whether student aid was a Fed\u00ad eral benefit to the college which the student attended. The Supreme Court ruled that it was. But the Court then went to a question not raised in the case, and found that only the student aid office, which directly handled the funds, had to comply with the antidis\u00ad crimination law. No sooner was this decision handed down than the Department of Justice announced that it would, henceforth, apply this standard to the enforce\u00ad ment of all the major civil rights laws, not merely to the education act amendments on which the ruling was brought. The Justice Department has done precisely that, and as a result, lower court rulings-which are required to follow Supreme Court precedents\u00ad and administrative action have both closed off redress against discrimina\u00ad tion for many Americans. Individuals have been denied hear\u00ad ings when funds could not be traced directly to the salary of a professor ac\u00ad cused of sexual harassment, or to the building in which an individual was denied the right to speak, or to the courtroom in which jurors served. In the Education Department alone, well over 600 cases have been suspended or dismissed because of the Grove City ruling. Four months ago, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the factual findings of a lower court that an entire State's higher educational system had systematically channelled black and white students to separate institutions, not on the grounds that the Government failed to show this occurred, but that it did not show pre-cisely where each Federal dollar of aid was used and how that particular pro\u00ad gram discriminated. In 1954 the Supreme Court finally overturned more than half a century of de jure segregation in its Brown versus Board of Education judgment. But it was not until passage of the 1964 Civil Right Act, with its title VI enforcement powers, that actual progress began to be made against dis\u00ad crimination. The threat of losing Federal funds was finally the incentive before which much segregation gave way. And in the decade of the seventies, black col\u00ad lege enrollment almost doubled. The other statutes affected by the Grove City ruling are all based on that experience. Title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972 extended civil rights protections to women in higher _education facilities. In 1972, when the act was passed, our Nation's medical schools graduated 830 women as physi\u00ad cians out of a total of 9,253. In 1985, 4,874 women physicians were in the graduating class of 16,041. In 1972, the Nation's law schools graduated 1,498 women, out of a total of 21,764. Today's 37,491 graduating lawyers include 14,421 women. There can be no doubt that the dou\u00ad bling of black college enrollment and the increased admissions of women to graduate studies was not a fortuitous outcome. It was the result of enforcing what the law has always demanded, equality of treatment. We should not have to look back to a century of racial turmoil and discrimi\u00ad nation under the 14th amendment to the Constitution to know that a writ\u00ad ten statute, even a constitutional com\u00ad mandment, has no effect unless it is enforced. That understanding guided the Con\u00ad gresses which enacted the four civil rights statutes covered by this bill. Those Congresses moved beyond ex\u00ad hortation and recognized that addi\u00ad tional incentives were necessary to promote equal treatment. There are those who like to charac\u00ad terize the civil rights laws as punitive. That implies that institutions have a prior right to receive Federal funds and that any threat of their loss is unfair. That is not the case. Federal funds are appropriated for programs which the Congress judges to be in the na\u00ad tional interest. And among the many issues that are in the national interest is the vindication of our constitutional promise of equality before the law. As the Supreme Court itself noted in Bob Jones University, any private or\u00ad ganization enjoys the full protection of the first amendment in its beliefs or doctrine. But no private organization may expect preferential Government January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 389 treatment when its beliefs conflict with national policy. So when Congress chose to enforce antidiscrimination efforts through the funding mechanism, it did not detract one iota from the first amendment rights of any group, individual or orga\u00ad nization. It did off er institutions a choice-the choice between accepting Federal funds and abiding by the law or not accepting Federal funds. There is nothing coercive in such a regime. Simply put, if an institution accepts tax funds, that institution may not discriminate. We know we cannot eliminate private prejudices and bigot\u00ad ry by law. But we need not and should not subsidize them. The fundamental issue at stake is that tax dollars raised from all Ameri\u00ad cans should not be used to discrimi\u00ad nate against some Americans, where the issue involves, race, sex, age or handicapping condition. This is a matter of simple justice. The Civil Rights Restoration Act does nothing more than restore through statutory language the reach of the civil rights statutes to the insti\u00ad tutions which chose to benefit from Federal funds. The act does not affect any of the definitions of what constitutes dis\u00ad crimination. It neither expands nor narrows any of the rights that may be asserted under antidiscrimination law. The act does not alter or modify the meaning of \"recipient\", so those who are not now affected by civil rights laws-for instance, grocers accepting food stamps, farmers accepting crop subsidies or individuals rece1vmg Social Security benefits-remain unaf\u00ad fected by the reach of the law, as they were before the Grove City decision. The act preserves exactly the same language as in current law with re\u00ad spect to religious organizations; it nei\u00ad ther narrows nor broadens it. The entire purpose and, I believe, the only effect of the bill as written, will be to restore in practice the un\u00ad derstanding that I and most Ameri\u00ad cans held before the Grove City ruling-namely that when an institu\u00ad tion chooses to benefit from public funds, it must abide by public law, in\u00ad cluding laws which outlaw discrimina\u00ad tion. The repeated claims that the bill un\u00ad acceptably expands civil rights law are untrue. The definitions of unfair treatment which exist in regulations, in case law and in practice are neither broadened nor narrowed by this bill. I very much regret that the Presi\u00ad dent's State of the Union message in\u00ad cluded this misleading and inaccurate claim about the Civil Rights Restora\u00ad tion Act, and I sincerely trust that he will not veto this very simple and straightforward legislation, when it reaches him. We have already waited too long to correct the statutory deficiencies that the Supreme Court found in these four civil rights laws. Over the past 4 years, many cases, some reaching back more than a decade in some instances, have been abandoned, dismissed, and suspended as a result of the congres\u00ad sional failure to act. These cases are not merely statistics. Each one involves a fell ow American whose life has been directly affected. Students have found their study plans delayed and, in some instances, ended. Disabled persons have lost jobs and the chance for independence and per\u00ad sonal self-respect. Women have seen career choices and opportunities fore\u00ad closed. We should end this unfairness now. We should reinstate and reaffirm the 20-year-long struggle to vindicate the civil rights of every American. From 1964 until the earlier years of this decade, there was a bipartisan congressional consensus that civil rights laws must be vigorously en\u00ad forced. That consensus reflected the overwhelming demand of the Ameri\u00ad can people, who were no longer satis\u00ad fied with a status quo which treated some of them unfairly. The effort to give life to the great ideals of our Constitution has always been a struggle against entrenched habit, accepted convention and com\u00ad fortably established inequities. That is as true today as it was in 1964. Over the past three decades, the majority of Americans has concluded that we want a society where equality of treatment is not restricted to men, or to white men, or to the physically capable, or to the young. We have con\u00ad cluded that this is not the American ideal. And we know that we cannot wait passively for a just society to evolve over time. We know that to achieve justice, we must pursue justice. The pending legislation is an essential ele\u00ad ment of that effort. It must be ap\u00ad proved. Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in the 1960's, this Nation made a commit\u00ad ment to civil rights for all of our citi\u00ad zens. Many Americans participated in that struggle. Some sat in at lunch counters. Some demonstrated on col\u00ad lege campuses. Some were Freedom Riders in the South. Some were arrest\u00ad ed and went to jail. Some even gave their lives. As a result of those efforts, we passed a law, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made civil rights a reality in this country. We enshrined those struggles in the law of the land, and by that action we began a process of changing the mentality of a nation, of changing attitudes and age-old preju\u00ad dices. We have come a long way in that struggle in the past 20 years. But the Supreme Court's decision in February 1984 in the case of Grove City College versus Bell was a step backward in the continuing struggle for civil rights in this country. In that decision, the Supreme Court ruled that title IX of the Education Amend\u00ad ments of 1972, which prohibits dis\u00ad crimination on the basis of sex in most education programs and activities re\u00ad ceiving Federal financial assistance, applies only to the particular program receiving Federal aid, not to the entire institution. The effect of this misguid\u00ad ed decision has been to strip away con\u00ad stitutional protections against discrim\u00ad ination for women, minorities, the el\u00ad derly, and the disabled in our society. The time has come for the Congress to correct that injustice, and to restore the full protection of our civil rights laws to all Americans. I am pleased, therefore, to be a cosponsor of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987. This legislation would reverse the Grove City decision, and restore full constitutional and civil rights protec\u00ad tions under title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, title IX of the 1972 Educa\u00ad tion Amendments, section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. AlL_of these laws provide vitally important protection against discrimination for our citizens. We need to pass this legislation now, and pass it in undiluted form, without amendments. We need a clean bill that will make a clear statement to the American people that we still believe in the ideals of the civil rights move\u00ad ment. Mr. President, amendments that deal with abortion, or with \"religious tenets,\" or with AIDS, have no place on this legislation. This is a civil rights bill. This legislation exists for one pur\u00ad pose, and one purpose only-to reverse the Grove City decision, and to make it clear that we still care about civil rights in the U.S. Senate. And I oppose any efforts to alter or distort that message by adding amendments which do not belong on this bill. I am disturbed by the Senate's vote in favor of the Danforth amendment. The effect of this amendment would be to penalize women who choose to have abortions, or who have already made that choice. The right to an abortion is a matter of free choice for women, not a decision made for women by the U.S. Senate. In addition, this legislation is not the appropriate vehicle for such an amendment. This is a civil rights bill, not a referendum on abortion. Howev\u00ad er, because I believe that the good in this bill outweighs the bad, because it expands the scope of title IX protec\u00ad tions for women, I will support the leg\u00ad islation as a whole. I am pleased that a compromise has been reached with respect to provi\u00ad sions concerning the Arline decision and its ramifications. I would object to any effort to add an amendment to this bill which would overturn the Su-390 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 preme Court's decision in the Arline case. The Arline decision, handed down on March 3, 1987, by a 7-to-2 margin, protects the rights of handi\u00ad capped persons. It holds that, under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, a person with a contagious disease like tuberculosis is considered a handi\u00ad capped person. The Supreme Court concluded that all handicapped persons, including those with contagious diseases, have a constitutional right to go to court and have a fair hearing. The Court did not state that all such persons are auto\u00ad matically entitled to a job. Only those persons who do not pose a health or safety risk would be so entitled. There is nothing in Arline which threatens public health or safety. The decision simply protects the constitutional rights of handicapped persons, and it should be respected by the Senate. I am also pleased that the Senate has soundly rejected an attempt to limit the access of handicapped per\u00ad sons to small businesses. I am strongly opposed to any amendment which would limit the applicability of the law regarding access for the handi\u00ad capped to small businesses . As chair\u00ad man of the Subcommittee on Minority and Urban Small Business, I am sensi\u00ad tive to the needs of small businessmen. But I also feel strongly that handi\u00ad capped persons must have rights equal to those of all others in our society. To close off our Nation's small businesses to handicapped citizens would be a grave disservice not only to the handi\u00ad capped, but to small business as well. President John F. Kennedy said: Simple justice requires that public funds, to which all taxpayers of all races contrib\u00b7 ute, not be spent in any fashion which en\u00ad courages, entrenches, subsidizes or results in racial discrimination. That is what this legislation is de\u00ad signed to ensure. The four areas of law covered by this \u00b7bill are laws which were written to assure that Federal funds would always go to prevent dis\u00ad crimination, not to promote it. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin by recipients of Federal financial as\u00ad sistance. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 bans sex discrim\u00ad ination in educational institutions and programs that benefit from Federal funds. Section 504 of the Rehabilita\u00ad tion Act of 1973 protects disabled per\u00ad sons from discrimination by all recipi\u00ad ents of Federal funding. And the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 forbids dis\u00ad crimination on the basis of age by any agency or institution which receives Federal aid. These are laws for which many people have worked and struggled. So.me have even given their lives in the movement for civil rights in this country. And over the past three dec\u00ad ades, since the Supreme Court's land-mark decision in Brown versus Board of Education, this Nation has made great progress toward the goal of equal justice for all. But that progress has been seriously threatened by the Court's regressive decision in the Grove City case. As a result of the Reagan administration's broad interpretation of the ruling in Grove City, the impact of the ruling has been extended to reach corpora\u00ad tions, local governments, hospitals, air\u00ad ports, and many other facilities which receive Federal funds. Ed Meese, Wil\u00ad liam Bradford Reynolds and company have extended the Grove City ruling far beyond the educational institu\u00ad tions to which the actual holding ap\u00ad plied. While the Court's ruling in Grove City was damaging enough, the Reagan administration has made it much worse. As a result of the Reagan-Meese\u00ad Reynolds interpretation of Grove City, Federal civil rights enforcement has been drastically reduced. At each step in the enforcement process, major bar\u00ad riers have been imposed by this admin\u00ad istration. Audits and compliance re\u00ad views of institutions receiving Federal funds have been drastically curtailed. Investigation of civil rights complaints have been put on hold, sometimes for months or years. Compliance plans to end discrimination, even those which were already in place, have been re\u00ad voked. Administrative law judges are refusing to hear cases involving dis\u00ad crimination in federally funded insti\u00ad tutions, and Federal judges are throw\u00ad ing many private law-suits out of court which would vindicate civil rights. This is not just a matter of abstract legalisms. It means that, if this deci\u00ad sion is not reversed, there would be no Federal enforcement mechanism and no adequate legal recourse for many injustices. For example, as a result of the Grove City decision, an elderly couple may be denied immunization by a city clinic which decides to reserve a vaccine for the working-age popula\u00ad tion. It means that an employee with outstanding evaluations may suddenly be fired when his employer learns that he has epilepsy, or other diseases. It means that a high school girl may be put on a waiting list for a science class until all the boys who want to enroll have had a chance to do so. And it means that a public school may decide to hold separate dances for black stu\u00ad dents and white students. Incidents like these should be only memories of a distant past in America. But unfortunately, they are all too real. They can happen even now, in 1988, in cities and towns across the United States. And sadly, they can happen with the protection and bless\u00ad ing of the Reagan Justice Department. That is why we need to pass the Civil Rights Restoration Act, and pass it this year. Too many people have struggled too long, and sacrificed too much, for us to turn our back on civil rights now. Martin Luther King Jr. said, in a letter from the Birmingham jail, that \"injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" Let us once again make American justice a model for all the world. Let us reaf\u00ad firm our national commitment to civil rights in 1988. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President , I rise today in strong support of the Civil Rights Restoration Act. This legisla\u00ad tion is urgently needed to clarify the intent of our civil rights laws. The Civil Rights Restoration Act will ensure that institutions receiving Fed\u00ad eral funds will not be allowed to dis\u00ad criminate against women, minorities, the disabled or the elderly. Since the Supreme Court decision in Grove City College versus Bell, the ability of victims of discrimination in federally funded institutions to pro\u00ad test discriminatory practices has been greatly diminished. For example, female students could be denied the use of school facilities for a women's basketball program, if the athletic program of the school does not direct\u00ad ly receive Federal funds even though other school activities and education programs do. It is simply unfair to the women, minorities, elderly and dis\u00ad abled people that pay Federal taxes to allow Federal funds to subsidize dis\u00ad crimination. I think this bill accomplishes its pur\u00ad pose. Under this legislation, victims of discrimination will have a means of challenging unfair practices within in\u00ad stitutions that receive Federal aid. I strongly support this effort to strengthen enforcement of our anti\u00ad discrimination laws by clarifying the Federal Government's power to cutoff funds. At the same time, I feel that Con\u00ad gress cannot enact legislation that could be interpreted as forcing federal\u00ad ly funded institutions to support abor\u00ad tion against their religious or moral objections. To guard against this possi\u00ad bility, I supported the Danforth amendment. I believe the clarification of congressional intent on this issue is too important to be left to a later date. The Civil Rights Restoration Act is the most important piece of civil rights legislation to come before the Senate in this decade; and I am proud to have this opportunity to voice my strong support for \u00b7 the rights of women, minorities, the elderly, and the disabled to participate freely in all arenas of American life. In this act, Congress assures that, at . the very least, women, minorities, the elderly and the disabled are not denied the chance to participate in programs and activities which receive Federal funds. Mr. DURENBE;RGER. Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, this is indeed an important moment for millions of\u00b7Americans. For 4 years, the four landmark \u00b7 civil rights January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 391 statutes have operated with a judicial tourniquet, the Grove City versus Bell decision of the Supreme Court. Today we make a major step to remove that constraint, and restore our national commitment to the equality and digni\u00ad ty of each of our citizens. As an original cosponsor of this leg\u00ad islation in the 98th, 99th and lOOth Congresses, I can say that this has been a long time coming. I salute the perseverance of my colleagues on the Labor Committee, Mr. KENNEDY and Mr. WEICKER, Mr. PACKWOOD, and many others, who fought this fight to the finish. I am hopeful that the Senate action on this bill, while controversial to many, will speed this bill through the House of Representatives and to the President's desk. It is a bill that de\u00ad serves to be signed into law, as the strong vote on final passage indicates. \"Simple justice,\" President Kennedy said, \"requires that public funds * * * not be spent in any fashion which en\u00ad courages, entrenches, subsidizes or re\u00ad sults in racial discrimination.\" It has not been simple, but justice has been done today. Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 557, the Civil Rights Restoration Act. I am pleased to be an original sponsor of this much needed and long overdue legislation. This is the third Congress in which this vital measure has been intro\u00ad duced. Certainly, this is a bill whose time has come. The operative word in this Act is res\u00ad toration. Unfortunately, we are fight\u00ad ing to restore lost ground, rather than pursuing new legislative initiatives. Our purpose is to restore the protec\u00ad tion of the rights of individuals which existed prior to the Court's 1984 deci\u00ad sion in Grove City versus Bell. At this time, the intent is not to expand but only to restore. It is my hope that sub\u00ad sequent interpretations of this act will honor that purpose. In Grove City, the Court held that the prohibition on sex discrimination under title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 applied only to the particular education program or activity receiving Federal funds, rather than to the entire institution. While Grove City on its face only dealt with title IX of the education amendments which bars sex discrimi\u00ad nation in education programs, the case had a far broader impact-diminishing the protections against discrimination provided by the Civil Rights Act of 1965, the Education Amendments of 1972, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. To fully understand the impact of this, we must turn to history-the his\u00ad tory of the struggle for equal rights under the law. To do so, one must look to the period immediately after the Civil War, when the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution were enacted. The 13th amendment outlawed slavery in 1865, the 14th, en\u00ad acted in 1868, sought to guarantee blacks full citizenship in this country, and the 15th, enacted in 1870, sought to guarantee that the right to vote would not be denied under any circum\u00ad stances. But history shows that it took another century before the 14th and 15th amendments could be said to have truly guaranteed those rights to blacks. The first obstacles were of course, the infamous \"Jim Crow\" laws. Al\u00ad though it is difficult to pinpoint the first of these State laws forbidding blacks and whites from using the same public facilities-trains, schools and particularly interracial marriage\u00ad from 1870 to 1885, most, if not all, of the rights the 14th and 15th amend\u00ad ments sought to protect were denied for blacks-completely and seemingly irrevocably. In 1896, the crushing blow was dealt to equal rights at the Federal level: the Supreme Court formally upheld \"Jim Crow\" laws in its decision, Plessy versus Ferguson. This decision held that \"separate but equal\" did not vio\u00ad late the fundamental guarantees of the Constitution. But in fact, both \"Jim Crow\" and Plessy versus Fergu\u00ad son did violate the Constitution, as the Supreme Court ruled 58 years later, 58 years too late. The Brown decision, which effective\u00ad ly reversed the Plessy decision, marked the beginning of both judicial and legislative action to guarantee the protection of civil rights. In 1963, President Kennedy sent the Civil Rights Act to Congress and in doing so said: Simple justice requires that public funds, to which all taxpayers of all races contrib\u00ad ute, not be spent in any fashion which en\u00ad courages, entrenches, subsidizes, or results in racial discrimination. Direct discrimina\u00ad tion by Federal, state or local governments is prohibited by the Constitution. But indi\u00ad rect discrimination, through the use of Fed\u00ad eral funds, is just as invidious . Title VI of the Civil Rights Act at\u00ad tacked this indirect discrimination by prohibiting discrimination based on race, color or national origin in a \"pro\u00ad gram or activity\" that receives Federal aid. The Education Amendments of 1972 prohibited sex discrimination in educational programs or activities re\u00ad ceiving Federal aid, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 did the same for handi\u00ad capped individuals and the Age Dis\u00ad crimination Act of 1975 did the same for the elderly. During debate of these measures, a number of Members of Congress stated their belief that protection from discrimination should indeed be comprehensive. In the words of former Senator Birch Bayh, \"Nothing else would have made any sense if our goal was meaningful coverage and effective enforcement.\" Clearly, we have a record of congres\u00ad sional intent. The question is what re\u00ad course belongs to Congress and, indeed, many citizens of this Nation in the face of a Supreme Court decision which contradicts the intent of Con\u00ad gress and to which many of us would not choose to consent. In a speech at Tulane University in October of last year, Attorney General Meese ad\u00ad dressed this very dilemma. He quoted President Abraham Lincoln on the impact of the Dred Scott decision: We nevertheless do oppose [Dred Scott] ... as a political rule which shall be binding on the voter, to vote for nobody who thinks it wrong, which shall be binding on the members of Congress or the President to favor no measure that does not actually concur with the principles of that decision. Attorney General Meese went on to say that \"the constitutional interpre\u00ad tation is not the business of the Court only, but also, and properly, the busi\u00ad ness of all branches of Government. Agreed. Yet, this power can be abused. Reacting to the Supreme Court decision in Engel versus Vitale which forbade school prayer, the Senate tried two times in 1979 to deny the Supreme Court appellate jurisdic\u00ad tion in such cases. Although they did not ultimately succeed, this was clear\u00ad ly an abuse of legislative power in the face of the prohibition of State en\u00ad couraged \"establishment of religion\" written in the Constitution. Still, the legislature is surely within its constitu\u00ad tional bounds to try to remedy a deci\u00ad sion rendered by the Court to which it does not consent. The legislation we consider today does exactly that. But is there evidence that Grove City has indeed diminished the en\u00ad forcement of civil rights? Yes; for ex\u00ad ample, the Department of Education reports that enforcement actions brought by its Office for Civil Rights have decreased considerably. As of September 1986, 674 complaints filed with the Department of Education have been closed or scaled back be\u00ad cause of this decision. Another 88 com\u00ad pliance reviews have been dropped and another 72 have been narrowed. Simi\u00ad lar findings have been reported in all of the offices responsible for enforce\u00ad ment of our civil rights statutes. In ad\u00ad dition, many court cases have been dis\u00ad missed for lack of jurisdiction when Federal funds cannot be traced to the specific program where the alleged dis\u00ad crimination occurred. The deterrent effect on potential complainants cannot be measured, but undoubtedly grows as more time passes without rec\u00ad tifying this shameful state of affairs. Mr. President, I have no doubt that the Congress in crafting these civil rights laws intended an expansive in\u00ad terpretation. We need only look to the words of former Senator Hubert Hum\u00ad phrey during debates on the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the model of subsequent antidiscrimination laws, that \"the pur-392 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 pose of title VI is to make sure the funds of the United States are not used to support racial discrimination.\" Unless Grove City is not overturned, that goal will not be realized. The Civil Rights Restoration Act is simple and straightforward. The act would amend each of the four civil rights laws by defining the phrase \"program or activity\" to mean that discrimination is prohibited through\u00ad out entire agencies or institutions if any part therein receives Federal as\u00ad sistance. Mr. President, too much critical time has already been wasted. Over the past 4 years, our civil rights laws have been eroded. We have before us the opportunity to reverse this trend and return to full enforcement of our civil rights laws to protect the rights of all citizens. It is imperative that we act now. I urge my colleagues to vote for this crucial legislation. Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have been a cosponsor of legislation to overturn the Grove City decision since it was handed down by the Supreme Court because I am opposed to any discrimination, and federally subsi\u00ad dized discrimination is the worst situa\u00ad tion because it makes us all a party to this travesty. In the 1984 case of Grove City College versus Bell, the Su\u00ad preme Court said that Congress in\u00ad tended to allow an educational institu\u00ad tion to discriminate on the basis of sex in any program which did not receive Federal aid directly. For example, if the English department at a university received Federal funds, it could not discriminate on the basis of sex. The business school, however, assuming it did not receive direct Federal funding, could refuse to allow women to partici\u00ad pate in any of their programs. As a Member of the Congress that passed title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, let me assure you that Con\u00ad gress intended nothing of the sort; what was intended was that artificial barriers like sex discrimination be re\u00ad moved so that men and women would have the chance to go as far as their ability and drive could carry them. Mr. President, a lot has been said about the evil that this bill seeks to eradicate, and by and large, the Senate is in agreement about what needs to be done to eliminate federally subsi\u00ad dized discrimination. Unfortunately, a lot of falsehoods have also been spread about this bill. Let me set the record straight. This bill merely returns the law to what it was before the Grove City decision was handed down. There are no provisions which will allow the Federal big brother in the backdoor where Federal funds are not accepted. I support this legislation because I believe that everyone should have a fair shot, and this bill ensures that where the Federal Government is in\u00ad volved, they will get that fair shot. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is open to further amendment. If there be no further amendment to be proposed, the question is on agreeing to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to. The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read the third time. Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield in 1 minute, but I need to make some final remarks before the vote. Mr. BYRD. If the Senator will yield and if the Senator from Nebraska will allow me, all Senators need to know what time the vote will occur. Can we set a time? Mr. HATCH. I think we can set it right at 6, if you would like. I will try to finish before then. Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that a vote on final passage occur at 6 o'clock p.m. today and that paragraph IV of the Standing Rules be waived. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so ordered. Mr. BYRD. I thank all Senators. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah retains the floor. Does the Senator from Utah yield the floor? Mr. HATCH. I yield for a minute to the Senator from Nebraska. Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the State motto of Nebraska is \"Equality Before the Law.\" That principle is deeply en\u00ad grained in the aspirations of that great State and our great Nation. I have been a consistent supporter of the Civil Rights Restoration Act be\u00ad cause it embodies the spirit of the words of my State's motto. The princi\u00ad ple of this legislation is simple. Insti\u00ad tutions which chose to accept Federal funds also accept the responsibility of not discriminating against individuals on the basis of sex, race, age, religion, or creed. Congress passed the Education Amendments Act of 1972 to prohibit educational institutions receiving Fed\u00ad eral funds from employing sex-based discriminatory practices. Since its en\u00ad actment, Democratic and Republican administrations, conservatives and lib\u00ad erals alike interpreted this law and three other civil rights laws with simi\u00ad lar language to apply broadly to entire institutions receiving Federal funds. In 1984, the Supreme Court narrow\u00ad ly interpreted title IX in the Grove City College case. The Court ruled that an institution, receiving Federal support in the form of student aid, need only meet title !X's antidiscrimi\u00ad nation requirements in its student aid office. Under this restrictive ruling, in\u00ad stitutions receiving Federal funds are now free to discriminate in other pro-grams not specifically receiving Feder\u00ad al aid. This unfortunate decision overturns many years of practice and jeopardizes the effectiveness of other civil rights statutes. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, barring racial, religious, and ethnic discrimination; the Age Discrimination Act of 1972; and the Rehabilitation Act of 1974, which prohibits discrimi\u00ad nation against the handicapped, all have language similar to that inter\u00ad preted by the Supreme Court in the Grove City College case. I am of the firm belief that Federal funds should not be used to encourage, facilitate or promote discrimination. If enacted, this legislation is intend\u00ad ed to only restore the status of the law prior to the Grove City College case. The legislation is not intended to expand the application of Federal law into new areas. This is a narrowly drafted bill with careful consideration given to accom\u00ad modate the special needs of religious institutions. In this regard, title IX and the Civil Rights Restoration Act contains a time tested system of waiv\u00ad ers. To date, no religious institution which has applied for a waiver has been denied a waiver. Over 140 institu\u00ad tions have been granted religious waiv\u00ad ers under title IX. Early drafts of the Civil Rights Res\u00ad toration Act did merit criticism for in\u00ad stances of imprecise language, but the bill before the Senate today is tightly drawn and has adequately addressed the concerns of farmers and small businesses. I realize special interest groups have kicked up a lot of dust with regard to this legislation. As in the past many fundraising letters have gone out with alarmist language. Given the fact that the Reagan administration applauded the Grove City case, it is no surprise that some zealots in the Department of Justice have participated in this or\u00ad ganized cry of wolf. It is unfortunate that some in this body will panic and succumb to those cries. Those of us who have been in the public life long enough recognize many of the organized opponents of the Civil Rights Restoration Act as the same groups who have opposed civil rights and equal opportunity for decades. The United States is a land of oppor\u00ad tunity. Our Federal Government should not condone, facilitate, or en\u00ad courage discrimination. If an institu\u00ad tion should choose to engage in dis\u00ad crimination, it should not receive the financial assistance of the Federal Government. Our Nation is a better place since we have broken down the barriers of dis\u00ad crimination. The Civil Rights Restora\u00ad tion Act returns the law to its status prior to the Grove City court decision. Once again, I want to emphasize that January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 393 the record is replete with assurances that this legislation will not expand into new areas of regulation. As a cosponsor of the Danforth amendment to clarify concerns about abortion, I am pleased that the Senate did add language to address concerns about abortion. This is a positive step. I am hopeful that the final version of this legislation will include language acceptable to all sides of this contro\u00ad versial and emotional issue. Mr. President, I have supported the reversal of the Grove City decision for a number of years and am pleased to join with my colleagues to support this much needed legislation. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think the debate over the last few days has helped make clear the serious prob\u00ad lems involved in S. 557. I think we have established quite clearly that S. 557 is not a simple piece of legislation that restores the law to what it was the day before the Supreme Court issued its decision in the Grove City case. We have established already that the law the day before the Grove City decision was far from settled. There was a split in the circuits and when the Supreme Court decided that title IX should be applied on a program specific basis, it was siding with the majority, that's right, the majority of the lower court decisions. So, does S. 557 return the law to what it was? Of course not. S. 557 changes the law to the interpretation the proponents seek, the very inter\u00ad pretation rejected by the Supreme Court in the Grove City decision. S. 557 authorizes a dramatic, radical increase in the jurisdiction of the Fed\u00ad eral Government. Moreover, it trammels the first amendment's guarantee of freedom of religion by forcing churches and syna\u00ad gogues to bow under the heavy hand of Federal regulations just because they run a social service program in their basement which receives but $1 of Federal money. It tells religious schools and universities that if one of their religious beliefs runs afoul of a single Federal regulation, then the re\u00ad ligious belief must always be compro\u00ad mised. The proponents have never made clear why we must assault religious be\u00ad liefs in order to have an effective civil rights policy. We do not have to. The Senate has chosen to address one of the key prob\u00ad lems with this legislation, the abortion issue, by adopting the Danforth amendment. This is an excellent first step, but I regret it is not enough. I hoped we would be able to vote out of the Senate a Grove City bill I could support. We got part of the way there, but we failed to address the problems posed for religious institutions by S. 557. Without language that will guarantee religious liberty, I cannot support S. 557. If my concerns with this bill were of a different nature, perhaps the prob\u00ad lems could have been worked out. But one can't chip away constitutional rights, constitutional protections. Once the Federal Government is al\u00ad lowed to regulate churches, once it is allowed to dominate synagogues, once Federal bureaucrats can control reli\u00ad gious schools and universities, we no longer have freedom of religion. Con\u00ad sequently, I cannot support S. 557, a position I regret. For the record, S. 557 is a different bill than its predecessors. The propo\u00ad nents did change the language to ad\u00ad dress one or two glaring mistakes, but they still have failed to resolve the critical issue for me-why can't we protect all civil rights, including reli\u00ad gious rights. We must not be forced to choose between the two. Mr. President, I think this is impor\u00ad tant before we finally vote. This should only take a minute or so more. I would announce to all Senators I think I would be finished in just a minute or two. I should read a letter from the Presi\u00ad dent with regard to this bill. DEAR ORRIN: I greatly appreciate your ef\u00ad forts on behalf of the Administration's legis\u00ad lation to overturn the Grove City College decision. This legislation that you are offer\u00ad ing as an alternative to S. 557, the so-called \"Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987,\" ac\u00ad the stated intention of propo\u00ad nents of S. 557. At the same time, it avoids the vastly overreaching scope of S. 557. As you know, our proposal would provide institution-wide coverage for educational in\u00ad stitutions receiving Federal aid, under all four cross-cutting civil rights statutes at issue as a result of the Grove City College decision. In all other areas this measure re\u00ad tains the scope of coverage as it existed without regard to the Supreme Court's deci\u00ad sions in the Grove City College and North Haven Board of Education v. Bell cases. Moreover, our proposal assures that Title IX is abortion-neutral and adequately pro\u00ad tects the religious tenets of institutions under Title IX. A measure such as S. 557 is unacceptable to me. It dramatically expands the scope of Federal jurisdiction over state and local gov\u00ad ernments and the private sector, from churches and synagogues to farmers, gro\u00ad cery stores, and businesses of all sizes. Addi\u00ad tionally, S. 557 inadequately protects reli\u00ad gious tenets under Title IX and, even as amended by the Weicker Amendment , com\u00ad pels covered institutions, such as hospitals, to pay for or perform abortions as a condi\u00ad tion of the receipt of Federal aid. We can address legitimate concerns about the Grove City College decision with the simple override of that decision as reflected in the measure you have introduced in the Senate. Sincerely, RONALD REAGAN. Mr. President, I have to admit that my amendment was defeated and I have been informed in chatting with the White House that when he says in his letter, \"measures such as S. 557 are unacceptable to me,\" that that means that this measure, as it presently exists, even with the Danforth amend\u00ad ment on it, will be vetoed if it comes fi\u00ad nally through both Houses of Con\u00ad gress. I think everybody should under\u00ad stand that. I hope our colleagues will vote against this bill because of the overreaching nature of this bill. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am prepared to vote. Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there will be no session tomorrow. The Senate will have concluded its work on this bill. I want to compliment all of those who were responsible for the good work that has been done; those who managed the bill, Mr. KENNEDY and Mr. HATCH; those who had amend\u00ad ments, Mr. HARKIN, Mr. HUMPHREY, Mr. METZENBAUM, and others. There will be no votes, of course, after this vote today, but there will be votes on Monday. I do not know when the votes will occur on the conventions. Mr. HATCH is managing the conventions on his side of the aisle. Mr. MOYNIHAN is handling the conventions on this side of the aisle. So I will see in a little while what time the managers can dispose of the handling of those conventions. Senators should not feel that there will not necessarily be votes prior to the votes on the convention. I just want to make clear on the RECORD that we are coming in at 10 o'clock on Monday and, as we have already agreed, there will be 5 full days of work for 3 weeks and then 1 week to work back in our States and in com\u00ad mittees or in our offices. So Senators should expect votes at any time beginning with the time the Senate comes in at 10 o'clock on Monday. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a few moments. Mr. President, today the Senate ap\u00ad proves a major civil rights bill which restores protections from discrimina\u00ad tion to millions of men and women, older Americans and disabled Ameri\u00ad cans. The Civil Rights Restoration Act closes a major loophole in our civil rights laws. The bill eliminates the extremely costly and burdensome requirement that funds be traced to a particular discriminatory program before a claim of discrimination can be made, and re\u00ad affirms the broad coverage of our civil rights laws which existed prior to the Grove City decision. Mr. President, the acceptance of the Danforth amendment was unf ortu\u00ad nate. I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to return 394 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 this bill to one that simply affects the scope of coverage of our civil rights laws and does not make substantive amendments to any of those laws. I commend Senator WEICKER, the principal Republican cosponsor, for his tireless efforts to bring this bill to completion. I commend Senator HATCH for his ef\u00ad forts. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to the members of my staff and the staff of the other Sena\u00ad tors. Though I will mention their names after we complete the vote, it does not lessen my appreciation to them for the outstanding work they have done. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to compliment the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership on the floor, along with the Senator from Connecticut and others, Senators DOMENIC! and THURMOND. I thank the distinguished majority leader for his cooperation and that of the distinguished Republican leader. Above all, I would like to thank every\u00ad body on this side. It has been a hard\u00ad fought issue. There are two sides to it. I think everybody has acted with a good deal of fairness throughout the process. In particular I thank Senator DANFORTH for his leadership on the Danforth amendment. With that, Mr. President, we will add anything further that we have for the record. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, the last amendment was a Harkin-Humphrey amendment. Am I correct? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. Mr. EXON. Mr. President, could I in\u00ad quire of the leader? There was to be a colloquy between Senator KENNEDY and my colleague from Nebraska with regard to farmers' exemptions. Was that included? Mr. KENNEDY. That has been com\u00ad pleted. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on final passage may occur beginning now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall it pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.

Mr. KENNEDY. I move to reconsid\u00ad er the vote by which the bill was passed. Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. KENNEDY. Could we have order, Mr. President? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Will Senators please retire to the Cloakrooms with their conversations? The Senate will be in order. The Senator from Massachusetts. COMMENDATIONS Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to just take a moment, but it is a moment important to me and I would think to the Senate and to all of those who have been working on this issue for a very considerable period of time, actually since April 1984. I thank the majority leader, Senator BYRD, for his leadership on this criti\u00ad cal issue, and for his willingness to schedule this legislation as the first order of business of this session. This legislation has been long overdue. The leader is very familiar with the com\u00ad plexities and the challenges that the issue presented, and I want to express my own personal appreciation, and I know I speak for the 58 cosponsors of this legislation in thanking him for his support. I thank the Republican lead\u00ad ership as well for their willingness to work with our leader in scheduling this measure. We know it takes the co\u00ad operation of both leaders. But I want to thank especially Senator BYRD and Senator CRANSTON, and Senator INOUYE, all of our leadership who have been a part of this effort. I also again want to thank Senator WEICKER for his tireless efforts on this bill. We spent not only hours in the markup in committee, but we went through long evenings in the consider\u00ad ation of this bill, well into the night and I believe the early morning, before completing our final markup in the Labor and Human Resources Commit\u00ad tee. And I want to thank the other Senators who worked on this measure, 396 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 Senator MIKULSKI who worked closely with us to clarify the important issues of coverage of religious institutions, Senator METZENBAUM, who is so impor\u00ad tant and involved in the floor debate but also was critical to our success in the committee; Senator HARKIN, who has provided strong leadership in deal\u00ad ing with section 504 and disability dis\u00ad crimination; Senator SIMON himself was active in the committee, and made the long trip back from Texas to be here at the critical times in the consid\u00ad eration of this measure. On our other side, Senator STAF\u00ad FORD'S involvement in the whole range of education issues is well known to the Members of this body. He is really unsurpassed in terms of his knowledge and understanding of the implications of this measure as it applies to educa\u00ad tion, and he and Senator PELL have worked closely with us. Senator STAF\u00ad FORD has been active in the floor debate. Senator MATSUNAGA was on the floor and active in our committee con\u00ad siderations, as were Senator ADAMS and Senator DODD. All of their staffs were very much in\u00ad volved in our markups. These meas\u00ad ures have been complicated. Words make very profound differences as we saw in the Supreme Court's decision on this measure. So it really required extraordinary craftsmanship and all of the Members, both the majority as well as the mi\u00ad nority, were very much involved. We have worked many months in the Human Resources Committee on S. 557 and the Senate has spent 3 days on its passage. But our real concern goes out to the women, the minorities, the handicapped, the elderly, who have waited 4 long years for the Senate to speak on this issue. I want to thank particularly the members of my staff, Carolyn Oso\u00ad linik, who has been working on this issue for some 4 years. Those of us who go back over the Senate consider\u00ad ation remember not only the debates but the many hours off the floor that we spent with Brad Reynolds and other members of the Justice Depart\u00ad ment when we were attempting to find some common ground. We were unable to do so a few years ago. But her ef\u00ad forts have been invaluable. Michael Epstein, Michael Iskowitz, Mona Sarfaty have been invaluable to us. The general counsel and committee staff director, Tom Rollins, was of great assistance and help all through the consideration and all through the debate. I want to express my appreciation also to the staff members of our col\u00ad leagues. I know they would want me to remember them. Terry Muilenberg, who has worked for Senator WEICKER; Al Cacozza, and Linda Greene and Eddie Correia, for Senator METZ\u00ad ENBAUM; Bob Silverstein and Kay Cas\u00ad stevens for Senator HARKIN, Diane Thompson for Senator MIKULSKI, Wil\u00ad liam Blakey for Senator SIMON, Ellen Nolan for Senator STAFFORD, Kathy Shine and Diane Pollack for Senator PACKWOOD, Suzanne Matinez for Sena\u00ad tor CRANSTON. I also pay tribute to Senator PACK\u00ad WOOD for all his efforts. We worked closely together on the previous Civil Rights Restoration Act. He was the prime cosponsor at that time and spent a great deal of time on this bill as well as in floor debate. There are far too many groups and individuals in the Leadership Confer\u00ad ence on Civil Rights and other organi\u00ad zations who worked on this bill to thank them individually. But I thank them all for their hours and years of work to reverse Grove City and reaf\u00ad firm our commitment to civil rights. This vote of 75 to 14 is for all of them and for all the others whose lives will be improved as a result of this action. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the bill, Mr. KENNEDY, for his kind remarks concerning myself and concerning the leadership on the Republican side of the aisle. I have already expressed my appreciation for the good work that has been done by Mr. KENNEDY, Mr. HATCH, and other Senators. I want to express appreciation to the Republican leadership for the coop\u00ad eration that was given in allowing this measure to be called up and for the co\u00ad operation that was given not only by the Republican leadership but also by Mr. HELMS, Mr. HATCH, Mr. GRAMM, and others on the other side of the aisle. There were others who had sev\u00ad eral amendments, and most of those amendments were not called up. I express appreciation to the minori\u00ad ty, because it meant a great deal in our being able to complete action on this measure today. MORNING BUSINESS Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a period for morning business, that Sen\u00ad ators may speak therein for not to exceed 5 minutes each, and that the period for morning business not extend beyond 20 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Several Senators addressed the Chair. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not lose the floor by virtue of making the unanimous consent request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will not impose on the time over the Senators. I know that other Senators wish to speak. THE NARCO-TRAFFICKERS WAR ON SOCIETY Mr. DECONCINI. Mr. President, as a former prosecutor in the mid-1970's in Arizona, I had first-hand experience with the violent and ruthless drug interdiction cases and trying to pros\u00ad ecute them and threats on the lives of deputies as well as my own. Today, it brings me great sorrow to report the cold-blooded murder of an\u00ad other prosecutor, that being the pros\u00ad ecutor in Colombia. It is really a sad day when a govern\u00ad ment is shaken as that government is by the drug lords who have declared war on the civilian government and people. I am hopeful that governments around the world will take notice of Monday's murder of Colombian Attor\u00ad ney General Carlos Mauro Hoyos, and will better understand the growing power and brutality of illegal drug traffickers. The bullet ridden body of Attorney General Hoyos Jimenez was found in the city of Medellin hours after his car was ambushed by half a dozen armed men who kidnaped Hoyos after murdering two of his body guards. There is a brutal attempt to intimi\u00ad date a government and law enforce\u00ad ment, and I think it is very sad that this has happened. I hope that the people of Colombia will take heed that we recognize the severity of the prob\u00ad lem they face, that fair government officials will not relent and that we as a nation here will stand with such leadership that wants to take on these types of people. The attorney general was in Medel\u00ad lin to investigate several government officials and judges who were involved in the release from prison last month of one of the largest drug traffickers in the world, Jorge Luis Ochoa Vas\u00ad quez. The United States was seeking extradition of Ochoa for drug-related charges when he reportedly bribed his way out of prison. I have been told narco-traffickers paid about $3.5 mil\u00ad lion to get Ochoa out of prison, and were ready to spend as much as $20 million. After Ochoa's release, the Co\u00ad lombians announced that arrest war\u00ad rants had been issued for five major traffickers, including Ochoa, and the head of the Medellin cocaine cartel, Pablo Escobar. On Sunday, however, the traffickers declared total war on Colombian officials who would at\u00ad tempt to extradite them to the United States. The individual who gave au\u00ad thorities the location of Attorney Gen\u00ad eral Hoyos' body ended the call by saying \"the war continues.\" The citizens of Colombia can tell you firsthand about the war. The country has witnessed the murder of thousands of courageous public offi\u00ad cials, law enforcement officers, and journalists who attempted to stand up January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 397 to the drug traf ficers. It is reported that the Medellin cocaine cartel con\u00ad trols approximately 75 percent of the U.S. market-earning as much as a $6 billion a year. The enormous profits and resources accumulated from ille\u00ad gal drugs have made the drug traf\u00ad ficers in Colombia the largest capital\u00ad ists and landowners. The former Presi\u00ad dent of Colombia, Belisaro Betancur, has said, \"We are before an organiza\u00ad tion stronger than the state.\" Mr. President, the United States cannot ignore the traffickers ' message of war. Last year after Colombia ex\u00ad tradited drug kingpin Carlos Lehder to the United States, the Washington Post reported that intelligence inter\u00ad cepts in the possession of United States officials said that Colombian traffickers had made plans to dispatch two teams of assassins to murder United States officials. Our good neighbor to the south\u00ad Mexico-which is now the No. 1 source of marijuana and heroin coming into the United States must also take notice. I have been told by law en\u00ad forcement officers working on the southwest border that it is now common to intercept individuals smug\u00ad gling drugs across the border that are armed with semiautomatic and auto\u00ad matic weapons. According to a Sep\u00ad tember 1987 story in Tucson magazine, drug-related violence near our own southwest border is escalating at an astounding rate. That story cited a local newspaper in the border city of Nogales, Sonora, which has reported that 140 killings took place during the first 8 months of last year. Another re\u00ad porter listed 29 murders for the month of May alone. If the Mexican Govern\u00ad ment does not get control of the drug production and transshippment orga\u00ad nizations, the problems of Colombia could be their own. I commend the Colombian Govern\u00ad ment officials, military personnel, police officers, and private citizens who are attempting to wage a war on drugs. They have suffered greatly, but if they give up the fight the traffick\u00ad ers and terrorists will not hesitate to take total control. The drug traffickers are doing their best to increase the availability of drugs and so far have been very suc\u00ad cessful. I urge President Reagan to re\u00ad affirm his commitment to fighting drugs when he produces his fiscal year 1989 budget-and not abandon the fight as he did in the 1988 budget. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska. Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my friend from that great State where he served with such great distinction as the attorney general. I listened with great interest to the comments that he has made and I wish to associate myself with those remarks. It is a sad time indeed for the world when these things continue to happen. RESPONSE OF SENATOR BYRD AND SPEAKER WRIGHT TO THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on last Monday evening, January 25, 1988, the President of the United States delivered to the Congress a message on the State of the Union. By tradition, the party not occupying the White House is afforded the priviledge to respond to the President's address. It was with great pride that I watched, as did other West Virginians, the Democratic view of the State of the Union. Along with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, JIM WRIGHT, my distinguished and able senior colleague, the majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Senator ROBERT C. BYRD, stated their view of the State of the Union to America. Mr. President, I commend the leader, and Speaker WRIGHT, for their fine remarks to the people of this country. I ask unanimous consent that Sena\u00ad tor BYRD'S and Speaker WRIGHT'S re\u00ad marks be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the re\u00ad marks were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: SENATE MAJORITY LEADER ROBERT c. BYRD\u00ad DEMOCRATIC VIEW OF THE STATE OF THE UNION The state of the union has changed dra\u00ad matically since my boyhood in the coal fields of West Virigina. I grew up in the De\u00ad pression years-and came to Washington as Harry Truman was leaving office. I've seen America in distress. And I've seen us at our best-inno vative, forceful, generous. I've learned a thing or two about the greatness of America and what holds us to\u00ad gether. I've learned how quickly adversity strikes-the stock market crash of '29, Pearl Harbor, the death of John Kennedy-and how our country struggled back each time to renewed vision and strength . I've also learned that predictions of the future more often bear the glitter of hope than the tarnish of reality. Tonight House Speaker Jim Wright and I will take a look at the state of the union from a different perspective . We will ex\u00ad plore what government has done-and what it must do in the future. Our assessment of America will be tougher than the Presi\u00ad dent's. But it's anchored to the same faith in our people-and the same hopes for the future. I'm a Democrat whose politics were shaped in an era of hard times-from the small world of coal mines and company stores. Back then my foster father earned two dollars a day as a miner. Our life was as spare as it was close-knit. As a small commu\u00ad nity we hung together-and endured. We had our disappointments and our sorrows. There was no such thing as unemploy\u00ad ment compensation , or social security. Our horizons were limited-and our choices few. I graduated as valedictorian of my high school and was lucky to get a job pumping gas at $50 a month. But out of that grim time came a Presi\u00ad dent and a government that lifted the spirit of America . Never before-or since-has this nation been galvanized by such force. We came out of World War II with a new confidence-and a new promise. For the first time my people-working people-had some security against deep poverty. We had better working conditions in the mines. The elderly didn't have to turn to their children to take them in. Looking back, we did the obvious. We rose to the crises of our time. Yet, for me, the images remain-and with them the truth that government is best measured by how well it responds to the peoples' needs. Since then I have watched this nation\u00ad and its government-seek its way through a changing maze of economic and political cir\u00ad cumstances-from Medicare to the Great Society. The anguish that was Vietnam. The arrogance that was Watergate. The promise that was Camp David. Then dawned the Reagan years-and the profound experiment. If the Roosevelt and Truman presidencies were born of necessity, the presidency of Ronald Reagan was born of ideology-and a technicolor view of America and our people. It opened with the promise to get govern\u00ad ment off our backs. It offered the mystical formula of \"supply side\" economics which claimed that a huge buildup of military spending and enormous tax cuts for corpo\u00ad rations and the rich would lead to a bal\u00ad anced budget in three years. It was an Ad\u00ad ministration that sought to make us feel good with images of \"morning in America. \" It was a time when the President and his presidency became separated in our minds. As a man, Ronald Reagan has withstood physical pain with grace. He has carried the nation's grief at times of loss. He has always been at ease with his beliefs. A man who can touch the nation's humor-and make us feel better than we sometimes should. As President, his greatest victory has come at the negotiating table. The arms re\u00ad duction treaty, though limited is a mile\u00ad stone on the road to a safer world. But his political victories have not always been national triumphs . The dark side of the Reagan years has only begun to loom. Instead of a balanced budget, he has presided over a doubling of the national debt in seven years. Our record budget and trade deficits-once just abstract numbers-have now forced the government to default on its most fundamental prom\u00ad ises-like education and health. We have surrendered economic leadership in markets around the world. Our nation has been sharply divided on the question of Central America. The secret arms-for-hostages deals stand in direct con\u00ad tradiction to our given word not to deal with terrorists. The cases of cronyism and abuses of power for personal gain continue to mount in Washington 's courtrooms. We've come to the end of an era. The \"feel good\" slogans have gone flat with time. We've learned that bravado is not leadership -that ideology is no substitute for common sense. The time has finally come for us all to face the hard truths that once gave us our self-reliance and world leadership. Hard work-on the job and in the classroom. Pay as you go-no free lunches, no running away from the bills due. Helping those in need\u00ad but not those with greed. It was right here on the Senate Floor that Congress worked with Franklin Roosevelt to help end the Depression-and to win a war. 398 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 It was right here that Harry Truman's re\u00ad quest for the Marshall Plan was answered\u00ad where John Kennedy's space program became a reality-and Lyndon Johnson led the campaign for equal rights. It is right here that government has had some of its finest moments. This is where we've faced crisis head on-where the insti\u00ad tution rose with the nation-together. We've done it before. And now we've got to do it again. We've got to educate our children better than we do. We must have a system that not only launches the most gifted-but lifts the horizon for the least well off. More than the number of missiles and tanks, the number of well-educated children is a truer measure of our national strength-and our potential. Every moment we wait is a fraction of our future lost. We've got to pay as we go. We can't go on borrowing-especially from foreigners. They're after short term gain for them\u00ad selves-not a long term investment in Amer\u00ad ica. We've got to depend on ourselves to work out a sensible balance between spend\u00ad ing and income. The President has to work with Congress-not wait until three weeks after the fiscal year deadline and a stock market crash to sit down with us. The recent budget summit should have been called seven years ago. We've long under\u00ad stood that line-item vetos and balanced budget amendments are no substitute for national will. To palm off our debts to the next generation must not be an option for our own. We've got to make America free from fear-the fear of a lifetime of savings wiped out by illness-or the dread of foreclosure on a mortgage-or the shame of having an able child cut off from college. Too many of our people are still slipping through the safety net-unknown and unprotected. We must reduce the incidence of killer dis\u00ad eases-like AIDS and cancer-by multiply\u00ad ing the nation's research. And we ought to demand safe passage-on our streets and in the air. And we've got to sharpen our competitive edge. It's a shock to be told that America is no longer number one around the world\u00ad that our products are increasingly outsold\u00ad that our manufacturing jobs are shipped overseas. Regaining our leadership rank among nations presents our people with an enormous challenge. And government has a big role-not to subsidize industry, but to give American producers and exporters the best advantge we can. To improve our high\u00ad ways and our ports. To encourage produc\u00ad tive investment. The face of my hometown in West Virgin\u00ad ia has changed a great deal since the De\u00ad pression. The little house where I was raise is gone. A lot of the mines are closed. But we still hold to the old values born to this country long ago. And we still remember well when govern\u00ad ment acted to give us the leadership and the hope and the tools to rebuild. We still marvel at what we've achieved when govern\u00ad ment has been both America's sail and her keel. When we have driven ahead-but stayed clear of the shoals. When we've been guided by common sense and simple trust and vision. We've done it before. And now we've got to do it again. As Speaker Jim Wright will explain, we've already made a strong start. REMARKS OF SPEAKER JIM WRIGHT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION, JANUARY 25, 1988 We have indeed made a strong start, and I'll tell you a bit about it. But first I want to say congratulations to President Reagan for having successfully negotiated the INF treaty with the Soviet Union. We pledge him our support in that endeavor. Six months ago, President Reagan and I joined together in calling for a new peace plan for Central America. A few days later, the five Central American Presidents agreed to move that peace process forward. They are still actively pursuing it. Mr. President, so long as there is any measurable progress toward solving that conflict at the table, I think you and I should give peace a chance. In national security and the pursuit of peace, there ought not to be Democrats and Republicans-just Americans. Congress has supported those goals. We provided some $300 billion last year for our military defenses. But we know that no democracy can be a first rate military power if it becomes a second rate economic power. As important as our commitments abroad may be, our first obligation is to the Ameri\u00ad can people-and to their future. Today is the day America looks at itself in the mirror and asks how we are doing. Consider the State of our Union with me as we reflect upon five major steps the lOOth Congress is taking to build America's future. House bill number 1, our first legislative act, was the clean water bill, to protect the one precious resource upon which all human life depends. Because nearly one out of every five public water systems are now contaminated by toxic wastes, we cannot delay the clean-up no longer. Yet President Reagan vetoed this bill. He insisted that we cut back sharply on Ameri\u00ad ca's commitment to clean water and a safe environment. Fortunately, Congress over\u00ad rode that veto. House bill number 2 was the highway bill, to improve and upgrade the network of highways and bridges on which Americans depend. Twenty percent of the bridges in this country are unsafe-thousands of them built more than 100 years ago. President Reagan vetoed this highway bill also. He mistakenly called it a \"budget buster.\" That was absolutely incorrect. This bill doesn't add a penny to the national debt. We pay for these highways with our gasoline taxes that make up the Highway Trust Fund, where billions of dollars lie idle. And so we overrode that veto as well. House bill number 3 is the trade and jobs bill. Mr. Reagan said a few days ago in Cleve\u00ad land not to worry about the trade deficit\u00ad that it was a sign of strength. But just ask the local people who worked at Dalton In\u00ad dustries or at the General Motors Plant near Cleveland, both of which just closed. Those people just lost their jobs to the trade deficit-as millions of other Ameri\u00ad cans have done. In spite of what the President says, the trade gap has risen sharply every year for the past seven years, and was higher last year than ever in our history. This has made America the number one debtor coun\u00ad try in the world. That isn't a sign of strength! Our bill does two things. It provides incen\u00ad tives for other countries to abandon unfair practices which discriminate against Ameri-can goods-like deliberate red tape which keeps American import applications perma\u00ad nently \"under study\" and never acted upon, or like unloading a shipload of 200 Ameri\u00ad can automobiles-just one car a day. We simply require in this bill that other nations treat our American products on their markets just exactly as we treat their goods on our markets. No better and no worse. The bill also strengthens our ability to compete. Tools and schools. It will improve our research and development, modernize America's aging industrial plants, and equip America's work force with the skills and knowledge we need-so that unemployed in\u00ad dustrial workers aren't forced to settle for lower paying jobs. We can't build a vibrant economy by just delivering pizzas to each other. So while this Administration has crossed its fingers and hoped for the best, the Con\u00ad gress has acted. We'll send a bill to the President shortly, and we earnestly hope he signs it. House bill number 4 is the housing bill. In the last few years the hope of home owner\u00ad ship has become a fading illusion for too many American families. President Reagan asked that we abolish the Federal Housing Administration and in\u00ad crease the price of housing by charging hidden user fees. But we saved the FHA out\u00ad lawed user fees, and protected home owner\u00ad ship, not just for an affluent few, but for Americans of average and modest means. We also passed a farm credit bill to stop epidemic of family farm foreclosures. And, for the growing number of men, women and children who have fallen victim to the sad new phenomenon of homeless\u00ad ness, our bill reflects our belief that there is no excuse for any American to be aban\u00ad doned by his country to die of starvation or exposure to the weather. I have always believed in an eleventh com\u00ad mandment-Thou shalt pass on to your chil\u00ad dren a better world than you received from your parents-and it is to them, American's children, that the great thrust of our legis\u00ad lative program is dedicated. House bill number 5 is an education bill. Five years ago, the Administration's own commission produced a chilling report on the sagging quality of American education. The report was called \"A Nation at Risk.\" The President ignored the warning. In each year of his Presidency, he has called for major cuts in education. Last year he called for a 28% cut. This goes beyond fool\u00ad hardy. In an age when our children will have to cope with semi-conductors, super\u00ad colliders and international competition, America will not survive unless they are better educated than we were. Education must be our first priority, so our bill in\u00ad creases our commitment to quality educa\u00ad tion for the first time in seven years. And if it is disastrous to equip our young with inadequate learning, it is immoral to burden them with our financial debts. The policies of this administration have added more to the national debt in seven years than all its predecessors added in almost 200 years. A great nation like ours should not be forced to borrow from foreigners to pay our bills, or to lose twenty-four cents from every one of your tax dollars just to pay interest on the National Debt. In the year ahead your national Congress will complete this secure America. And if the President will help, we can do it all on a January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 399 pay as we go basis, and not just keep adding to the debt. Mr. President, we all have to work on this together. The ancient scribes wrote, \"not thine to finish the task, but neither art thou free to exempt thyself from it.\" We cannot solve all our problems by January 1989. But that doesn't mean we don't have to try. Mr. BYRD. The Speaker is right. We must work together. These are the times when we must take our measure and gather our strength. These are the times when we must reach for the steel that has been ours for generations and sharpen it. There are the predictions that we've flat\u00ad tened out-that we've lost the fire. But we've been tested before. And each time we've come back stronger. Over the last year, the course of America has begun to change-right on this very floor. Each of you-in your own way, from your own neighborhood-has adjusted our direction by a fraction. You've become a consensus for openness-and caring and bal\u00ad ance. You have asked government to build-and not tear down. And we have begun. The laws that we have passed in this chamber are not just promises. They are not just the rhetoric of what might be. They are the building blocks for what is to be. They are the working parts of our society that have been ham\u00ad mered by compromise and consensus. And each of you has left a mark on the books. Together we have committed government to help rebuild America. Together we have begun the job. Together we will finish it. Good night. May God bless you and may He continue to bless our great country. RESPONSE OF SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD AND SPEAK\u00ad ER JIM WRIGHT TO STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, on Monday evening following President Reagan's State of the Union Address, our distinguished majority leader, Senator ROBERT c. BYRD, and the dis\u00ad tinguished Speaker of the House, JIM WRIGHT, delivered the Democratic reply. I believe all my Democratic col\u00ad leagues will join me in saying that our party was well served by their replies. Individually, each spoke to what is best about our political heritage. To\u00ad gether, they spoke directly to Ameri\u00ad ca's future. In their response to the President, they spoke with a sensitivity to the past and with an acute awareness about what America needs to do to prepare for the coming times. As the majority leader pointed out, \"We've come to an end of an era.\" And so we have. The Reagan experiment, an experiment in ideology is coming to an end. America must have a governing phi\u00ad losophy appropriate for the 21st cen\u00ad tury. A philosophy grounded in reality yet one that recognizes the hopes of our people: That their needs, aspira\u00ad tions, and their best intentions be re-fleeted in their Government here in Washington. The majority leader, in particular, spoke with great eloquence and per\u00ad sonal insight about the deeper purpose of our Government: To build up rather than tear down; that govern\u00ad ment can \"give us the leadership and the hope and the tools to rebuild.\" And rebuild we must after the years of neglect on the part of the administra\u00ad tion. The Speaker, Mr. WRIGHT, spoke with directness about those legislative initiaties passed last year by this Con\u00ad gress that now mean something tangi\u00ad ble to our constituents-the clean water bill, the highway bill, the hous\u00ad ing bill, and the trade bill that we will soon send to the President. Both the majority leader and the Speaker spoke with forcefulness about our need to return excellence to edu\u00ad cation. And so we shall. As the majori\u00ad ty leader so eloquently stated, \"we must have\" [an education system] \"that not only launches the most gifted-but lifts the horizon for the least well off.\" I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to re-read these thought\u00ad ful statements. I commend the majori\u00ad ty leader for his sureness of word, his profound sense of history, and his def\u00ad inition of the role of government in our times. He has pointed the way to a better future for America. GRASSROOTS SUPPORT FOR INF TREATY Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty now before the Senate has re\u00ad ceived widespread support from the public, in Congress, and in the arms control community. Recently 111 major organizations re\u00ad leased a statement strongly endorsing the INF Treaty for advancing the mutual security interests of both the United States and the Soviet Union. The signers of this statement in\u00ad clude a broad segment of major reli\u00ad gious, labor, environmental, citizen, and arm control organizations repre\u00ad senting millions of Americans. The joint statement reflects virtually unanimous grassroots support for this major nuclear arms agreement. Those with long memories will recall that other treaties, including the 1979 SALT II agreement, lacked such wide\u00ad spread backing. While the rightwing movement in this country is clearly working to whip up sentiment against the INF Treaty, it is heartwarming to see that there will be strong majority backing from the treaty from around the country. I ask unanimous consent that the statement and list of signers be print\u00ad ed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the mate\u00ad rial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: SUPPORT FOR INF AGREEMENT We strongly endorse the Reagan Adminis\u00ad tration's agreement with the Soviet Union to eliminate land-based nuclear missiles with a range of 300 to 3,500 miles. The re\u00ad sulting treaty, which will eliminate all inter\u00ad mediate range nuclear missiles, advances the mutual security interests of the United States and the Soviet Union. We applaud the precedent that this agree\u00ad ment will create-a treaty signed by the Reagan Administration, certified by that Administration as mutually advantageous and adequately verifiable, and approved by a Democratic-led Senate. Such a treaty will enhance the prospects for future and more significant agreements that would substan\u00ad tially reduce the huge stockpiles of strategic nuclear weapons. We intend to mobilize public and congressional support for the treaty. Even as we endorse the INF agreement, we will work to ensure that this treaty not be used as a smokescreen for abandoning existing U.S.-Soviet agreements on strategic weapons, particularly the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, for moving towards deploy\u00ad ment of a Star Wars system or for slacken\u00ad ing the endeavor to complete successfully the negotiations on the central strategic nu\u00ad clear arms systems that gravely threaten the world. Without limits on strategic offensive and defensive weapons, an INF agreement can be easily circumvented by replacing the de\u00ad stroyed weapons with new strategic weap\u00ad ons. We urge therefore that the administra\u00ad tion utilize the INF Treaty as a step toward agreement on strategic nuclear weapons and space weaponry.

Mr. President, I call to the attention of my colleagues that last evening, the Reserve Officers As\u00ad sociation of the United States, at its 1988 national council midwinter ban\u00ad quet, presented the distinguished former Secretary of Defense, Caspar W. Weinberger, with the 1988 \"Minute Man of the Year\" Award. This award is presented annually by the ROA to \"the citizen who has contributed most to national security in these times.\" Mr. President, previous recipients of the ROA's annual \"Minute Man of the Year Award\" include Presidents Ford and Reagan; Senators STENNIS, Jack\u00ad son, THURMOND, NUNN, and STEVENS; and Representatives CHAPPELL, Vinson, Rivers, Sikes, Hebert, McCormack, Laird, Albert, Mahon, MONTGOMERY, and others. Mr. President, I offer my congratula\u00ad tions to the former Secretary of De\u00ad fense and wish him all the best in the years to come. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a list of previ\u00ad ous recipients of ROA's annual Minute Man of the Year Award. There being no objection, the list was. ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: PREVIOUS RECIPIENTS OF ROA's ANNUAL MINUTE MAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 1958-Brig. Gen. David Sarnoff. 1959-Senator Richard B. Russell. 1960-Col. Bryce N. Harlow. 1961-The Honorable Hugh M. Milton, II. 1962-The Honorable Carl Vinson. 1963-The Honorable Dennis Chavez (posthumously).

Dickin- son 1986-The Honorable Ted Stevens 1987-The Honorable Bill Chappell , Jr. TRIBUTE TO DONALD L. ROGERS Mr. RIEGLE. Mr. President , during the recess a pillar of the Washington banking community died. Donald L. Rogers served as counsel to the Senate Banking Committee from 1953-58 and later became presi\u00ad dent of the Association of Bank Hold\u00ad ing Companies . I think it is fair to say that no one in Washington knew the Bank Holding Company Act and relat\u00ad ed banking statutes better than Don Rogers. As president of the Association of Bank Holding Companies, he brought a certain grace to the job. He was always accessible to those who sought his counsel, and as a former staff member he had an unparalleled un\u00ad derstanding of Congress as an institu\u00ad tion. Don Rogers combined both a super\u00ad lative substantive knowledge of bank\u00ad ing and financial services law with a gentleness and friendliness and integ\u00ad rity of character which all of us who knew him will miss. - The growth and the success of the bank holding company movement over the last 30 years is inextricably linked to the leadership and commitment of Don Rogers. I count myself among the many people who mourn his loss. My deepest condolences to his family, to his staff and to his friends. THE PLIGHT OF SOVIET JEWS Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the plight of the Soviet Jews is a matter of concern for anyone who believes that there are rights that are basic to every human being. This should be of moral and humanitarian concern to all Americans. This statement is part of the coordinated Congressional Call to Conscience for Soviet Jews. I would like to express my appreciation to Sen\u00ad ator ALAN CRANSTON and Senator JOHN HEINZ for cochairing this noble effort. There are 2 million Jews who reside in the Soviet Union. It is estimated that some 400,000 Jews in the Soviet Union are currently seeking the right to emi\u00ad grate. I mention Dr. Vladimir Da\u00ad shevsky as an example of the plight of the Soviet Jews. Dr. Dashevsky wishes to be reunited with his daughter in Israel, but has re\u00ad peatedly been denied his exit visa since 1976. The reasons given for these refusals is that Dr. Dashevsky has not fully demonstrated that he is free from any financial obligations. Since the last refusal, Dashevsky's daughter, Ira, has made a formal declaration that she is fully responsible for the complete payment of any judgment against her father. Thus nullifying any legitimate legal action that the Soviets could claim to take against this citizen. Hopefully, it will be possi\u00ad ble for Dr. Dashevsky to be reunited with his family in Israel soon, in light of renewed Soviet commitment to fa\u00ad cilitate emigration and to improve re\u00ad lations with the United States. Dr. Dashevsky's case is only one of thousands of similar cases. The plight of this man and his family is not an isolated incident. The Soviet Govern\u00ad ment's action in preventing the emi\u00ad gration of Dr. Dashevsky is part of the policy of persecution that they insist on practicing. We, in the Senate, have a duty to raise this issue again and again until the Soviet Union discontin\u00ad ues the inhumane policy of denying Jewish citizens the right to emigrate. TRIBUTE TO THE ''CHALLENGER' ' ASTRONAUTS Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today marks the second anniversary of the tragic explosion of the space shut\u00ad tle, Challenger , and the death of the seven astronauts. Around the country, many groups are participating in com\u00ad memorations of the brave space ex\u00ad plorers. I would like to share with my colleagues a description of a slide pres\u00ad entation about the astronauts which was prepared by fourth grade students at the Bangs Avenue School in Asbury Park, NJ. I wish they could all view the video tape of this impressive show which I received from their teacher, Barbara J. Hurley. I ask unanimous consent that the description be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the mate\u00ad rial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: ASBURY PARK SCHOOL DISTRICT WINS AWARD OF MERIT FOR SLIDE PRESENTATION DEDI\u00ad CATED TO ASTRONAUTS An award of merit was presented to the Asbury Park School District at the New Jersey School Board's Convention , for the slide presentation , \"A Salute to the Spirit of America. \" The slide presentation originated as a project in one of the fourth grade class\u00ad rooms at the Bangs Avenue School. The stu\u00ad dents had witnessed on television, the disas\u00ad ter of the space shuttle, \"Challenger\", and were so stunned and moved by the tragedy that they wanted to do something to honor these brave Americans. The students had been currently studying the poem, \"America The Beautiful\" in their choral reading class. They decided to com\u00ad bine the theme of the beauty and spirit of America with a dedication and tribute to these special astronauts who personified that spirit. The students corresponded with NASA and requested pictures and information re\u00ad lating to the astronauts. They also wrote to the Chamber of Commerce in Washington , D.C. and other sources to obtain scenes and symbols of America. As a musical back\u00ad ground for their pictures, the students se\u00ad lected Ray Charles' unusual and moving version of \"America The Beautiful.\" As a final and very emotional touch, the students added their sweet voices to that of Ray Charles as they sang together in praise of America. The slide production was presented in honor of all astronauts from the \"Challeng \u00ad er\" with a special tribute to Mrs. Christa McAuliffe, the first teacher in space. The presentation was produced by Mrs. Barbara Hurley, Reading Specialist and Mr. Allen Ogaard, Media Specialist. It has been shown in other school districts and is avail\u00ad able upon request. SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE \"CHALLENGER\" ACCIDENT Mr. GLENN. Mr. President , 2 years ago today, the space shuttle Challeng\u00ad er exploded in the skies over Florida. It's been 2 years since America shared the grief of the families whose men and women perished in that tragedy. And it's been 2 years since the U.S. Space Program was gripped by uncer\u00ad tainty and inertia. What lessons have we learned since then? And how should we approach the future of space exploration? Perhaps the biggest lesson we've learned is that we shouldn't allow our past success in space to lull us into complacency. Complacency about the nature of space exploration-it's not a refined science, but a continuous ex\u00ad periment. Complacency about the ben\u00ad efits of a Space Program-our invest\u00ad ment produces a rate of return of 7 to 1 in spinoff technology that we can use right here on Earth. And compla\u00ad cency about America's preeminence in space-we can't rest on past lau\u00ad rels to sustain our lead in space; if we falter, other nations will pass us by. And as we work toward rebuilding our Space Program, we should set our sights on some priorities for the 402 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 future. The Challenger accident cre\u00ad ated a backlog of military satellites waiting to be put into orbit. For the sake of our national security-when verification of the proposed INF Treaty will be paramount-those satel\u00ad lites must be launched as soon as pos\u00ad sible. In the wake of the Challenger, our civilian Space Science Program has slowed down; it must proceed and be increased. The Soviets currently have two orbiting space stations, but we don't have even one; if we're to reap the full benefits of space, plans for an American space station must go forward. And while the Soviets active\u00ad ly plan a mission to Mars, we must also begin the preliminary studies and planning for such a journey sometime in the next century. In order to reach these goals, we need an administration that is willing to support a Space Program for dec\u00ad ades into the future, not just in fits and starts. Even though Americans are always fascinated with space \"spec\u00ad taculars\" and \"firsts,\" it's our steady investment in basic research and de\u00ad velopment that lays the foundation for these successes. Solid research must be able to build upon itself. Long-term support for our Space Pro\u00ad gram requires steadfast leadership from the top-as well as the constant backing of Congress and the American people. The race for space is a mara\u00ad thon, not a sprint, and we must make a commitment to it for the long haul. I can't overstate the importance of maintaining a strong program of basic research and development in space. America got to be No. 1 because of our commitment to providing education for everyone-not just the rich or po\u00ad litically powerful. From this educated population, America has produced the scientific innovations that gave us an advantage over every other country. And it's that technological leadership which has drawn other nations to us, making the United States a political leader in the international community. If we lose our lead in technology, then we'll lose our edge in world politics, too. And we cannot afford to lose either. We owe it to the Challenger astro\u00ad nauts to pursue an aggressive space program. Their sacrifice will have meaning only if we learn from it and move forward. On this second anniver\u00ad sary of the Challenger disaster, we must renew our commitment to re\u00ad search in space, which will, in turn, de\u00ad termine our leadership here on Earth. In fact, I believe that the words \"Go at throttle up\" -the final four words spoken by Comdr. Dick Scobee just seconds before the Challenger ex\u00ad ploded-are nothing less than an ex\u00ad pression of America's spirit. And as we pause for reflection on this anniversa\u00ad ry, I hope that all of us will recognize that the words \"Go at throttle up\" were far more than just a courageous epitaph. They are America's history, has been called \"spectacularly demo\u00ad and they are America's destiny. And cratic,\" female, male, black, white, they will turn tragedy into triumph Japanese American, Catholic, Jewish, once again. Protestant. Our gratitude for their BICENTENNIAL MINUTE JANUARY 28, 1913: SENATOR ELECTED BY 89- VOTE MARGIN Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, 75 years ago today, on January 28, 1913, the Nevada State Legislature elected Key Pittman to the U.S. Senate. This event-three quarters of a century in the past-is worth noting for two rea\u00ad sons. It marked the passing of the system under which State legislature elected Senators and it was based on the closest popular vote margin of vic\u00ad tory for a Senator in the history of this institution. The Constitution of 1787 gave to the individual State legislatures the power to elect U.S. Senators. Beginning in the 1890's, reform advocates regularly introduced constitutional amendments to provide for the election of Senators directly by the people. Although the House of Representatives routinely passed those amendments, the Senate routinely rejected them. In the early years of the 20th century several States-particularly the newer West\u00ad ern States-devised plans that essen\u00ad tially jectives. In those States, the legisla\u00ad tures made a commitment to follow the voters' will by electing the candi\u00ad date who won a popular referendum. Nevada by 1910 had adopted this two\u00ad track plan. In November of that year, Republi\u00ad can incumbent Senator George Nixon defeated Democrat Key Pittman in a referendum by 1,100 votes. Although control of the Nevada Legislature shifted to the Democrats as a result of the 1910 election, its new majority agreed to follow the referendum and Nixon was reelected. In 1912, Key Pittman ran again. This time he succeeded, but by the narrowest electoral margin in Senate history. Pittman's election established two Senate records. He won his four\u00ad way race with the smallest total number of votes-7,942 and he won by the smallest margin ever-a mere 89 votes. THE ''CHALLENGER'' ASTRONAUTS Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and honor the seven brave American astronauts who died in the Challenger tragedy 2 years ago today, Francis Scobie, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Michael Smith, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. They were the best of us. They were distinguished in their careers and dedi\u00ad cated to this Nation's Space Program and its future. The Challenger crew sacrifice and the sacrifice of their fam\u00ad ilies is eternal. While the sadness and tragedy of that day will never be fully behind us, it is imperative that we also note the success of this Nation's Space Pro\u00ad gram. We have flown 55 missions suc\u00ad cessfully over the last 25 years, sent men to the Moon and returned them safely, opened a new world of commu\u00ad nications and pushed back the limits of science in every field. That progress will continue. The 2-year grounding of our Space Program reminds us that space flight is not ordinary. The risks and chal\u00ad lenges of breaking gravity's hold are grave. But we will return to reliable, safe manned flight and continue the work Challenger's crew set about 2 years ago. I would like to conclude by quoting President Reagan's remarks at memo\u00ad rial services for those we remember today: The sacrifice of your loved ones has stirred the soul of our Nation, and, through the pain, our hearts have been opened to a profound truth. The future is not free; the story of all human progress is one of a struggle against all odds. We learned again that this America was built on heroism and noble sacrifice. It was built by men and women like our seven star voyagers, who an\u00ad swered a call beyond duty ... your families and your country mourn your passing. We bid you goodbye, but we will never forget you. REBECCA THATCHER REPORTS FROM NICARAGUA Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as Congress begins the countdown in the critical debate over President Reagan's request for additional aid to the Con\u00ad tras and the impact it will have on the issue of war or peace in Central Amer\u00ad ica, we must all remember that those with the biggest stake in the outcome of the debate are the people of Nicara\u00ad gua themselves. It is their sons and daughters and fathers and mothers who are being maimed and killed in the murderous crossfire of the con\u00ad tinuing conflict, and it is their villages and farms that are being used as the bloody battleground. The people of Massachusetts know this, and they are trying in the best way they can to alleviate some of the suffering and destruction and disloca\u00ad tion that the conflict has generated. Recently, a journalist for the Springfield Sunday Republican went to Nicaragua to report firsthand on some of these efforts. The journalist, Rebecca Thatcher, visited La Paz Centro, a small city of 20,000 people which has been designated a sister city of Amherst, MA. In an excellent arti\u00ad cle published last month, Ms. Thatch-January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 403 er reported on the people of La Paz Centro and how they are fighting an uphill battle to cope with the effects of the war. Ms. Thatcher also traveled to Con\u00ad dega, Nicaragua, and in a companion article she describes the efforts of a group of women from Northampton, MA, and other communities in the Pioneer Valley, who are working with the women of Condega to build three schools in that war-torn border city. In the course of this volunteer construc\u00ad tion brigade's day-to-day work, Ms. Thatcher reports, they often hear the gunfire of skirmishes nearby. I commend Rebecca Thatcher's arti\u00ad cles to the attention of the Senate, and I ask unanimous consent that they may be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the mate\u00ad rial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the Springfield Sunday Republican, Dec. 20, 1987] AMHERST'S SISTER CITY FEELS WAR'S EF\u00ad FECTS-NICARAGUAN CONFLICT ENDS IN DEATH TO SONS OF LA PAZ CENTRO <Northampton bureau reported Rebecca Thatcher recently visited Nicaragua where she toured Amherst's sister city, La Paz Centro. and in another town observed a con\u00ad struction project that had its roots in a pro\u00ad gram that began in Northampton.) <By Rebecca Thatcher) LA PAZ CENTRO, NICARAGUA.-Though this town is far from the conflict zones to the north and east of this war-torn country, the 20,000 residents of Amherst's sister city here acutely feel the effects of the six-year conflict. The high levels of inflation and currency devaluation that are affecting all of Nicara\u00ad gua are present here. and on a regular basis one of the town's native sons comes home in a coffin. \"It's a very difficult situation,\" said Father Enrique Martinez, the Catholic priest of La Paz Centro. \"It is sad to see the number of young boys that have fallen. The death of young people is very frequent.\" And on a recent Thursday afternoon, there was a palpable silence in the commu\u00ad nity as roughly 200 people marched in a fu\u00ad neral for 18-year-old Domingo Guadelope. Angela Quezada is the secretary of the Committee of Mothers of Heroes and Mar\u00ad tyrs, a group that works on behalf of those who have lost their children in the war. The next day, inside the organization's office, Quezada echoed a familiar refrain: \"We don't want any more of our children dying.\" The Nicaraguan embassy here estimates that 50,000 Nicaraguans died in the 1979 revolution that ousted Anastasia Somoza. Another 40,000 have died in the past six years of fighting the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras. With a strongly-worded resolution con\u00ad demning the war, the Amherst town meet\u00ad ing voted on May 11, 1987, to adopt La Paz Centro as a sister city. \"The United States government since 1981 has waged an illegal war against Nicaragua by means of the Contra rebels, which vio\u00ad lates the charters of the United Nations, and the Organization of American States, and consequently Article 6 of the U.S. Con\u00ad stitution,\" stated the resolution. Irwin Spiegelman, a member of the com\u00ad mittee, said the goal of the sister city project is to promote educational and cul\u00ad tural exchanges between the two communi\u00ad ties as a way of improving the prospects of peace. \"We want to make the Nicaraguan people more immediate and real to the people of Amherst. We thought this would be a sys\u00ad tematic kind of support,\" Spiegelman said. According to residents and officials of this town, La Paz Centro is a typical medium\u00ad sized Nicaraguan community whose resi\u00ad dents are struggling to survive, and in some cases \"advance the revolution,\" in the face of real economic troubles. \"There is no rice, nothing works, our only hope is Jesus Christ,\" said Angela Garcia, an elderly woman interviewed near the center of the town. The economic crisis that is gripping all of Nicaragua has caused an astronomical de\u00ad valuation of the cordoba, the basic unit of currency. In 1981, the exchange rate was 10 cordo\u00ad bas for $1. In late November, the rate changed again to 15,700 cordobas for $1, and the black market rate is almost twice that. A teacher in La Paz Centro earns 200,000 cordobas per month, or $12.74. The failure of wages to keep pace with inflation has led to a vast \"informal economy\" in which people of all ages, mostly women and chil\u00ad dren, sell everything from bags of ice water to sugar cane in the streets. Still, the people improvise. Justina Montano Martinez is the director of the town's pre-school. The building they use is old and dilapidated, and the school lacks such basic supplies as paints, crayons and scissors. But Martinez holds up a handmade doll and says, \"If we don't have a doll we can make one.\" Brenda Alburto, a senior in high school, was part of the Sandinistas' literacy pro\u00ad gram when she was 10 years old. She spent six months with an isolated peasant family teaching them to read and write. She called it a good experience, noting, \"All the wisdom they have ... we taught Velasquez Coutreras is in\u00ad terim mayor, the government. Velasquez was optimistic about the \"her\u00ad manamiento\" or matching between his town and Amherst. He spoke enthusiastically about last sum\u00ad mer's week-long visit by a representative of the sister-city committee in Amherst. Walking through the town in an old yellow shirt and dungarees, it seems as though almost everybody knows the 47- year-old Sandinista. People call out greetings or pull him aside to discuss problems. He is obviously proud of the new pre-school that is almost fin\u00ad ished, (Pre-school goes up to six years of age in Nicaragua), and the health center, which has a main facility in the town's center and five satellite offices. There is also a small library with 5,000 books. Except for the books by Marx and Lenin donated by the Soviet Union, nothing has been added to the collection recently, according to the woman in charge of the li\u00ad brary, Auxiliadora Saavedra. \"There are some that have read all the books and they come in and ask if there are any new ones,\" Saavedra said. Valasquez said the town's economy is pri\u00ad marily agricultural, with one large state farm, a state-sponsored milk project, eight cooperatives and several private farms. According to Velasquez. the eight coopera\u00ad tives represent land that was given to peas\u00ad ants after the revolution. He said the gov\u00ad ernment provides the cooperatives with technical assistance, loans, and supplies such as fertilizer. The principal crops are cotton, corn, soy beans, sorghum, and vegetables, he said. Townspeople also produce crafts and there is one privately-owned brick factory. A few small businesses, such as beauty parlors, are intermingled in what could be called the downtown. The center also has a monument to the 40 residents of La Paz Centro who died in the 1979 revolution, a park, and a Catholic Church. Next year, there are plans to have munici\u00ad pal elections, and \"the Frente\" (people here always refer to the Sandinistas as \"the Frente,\" or \"the Front\") will run a slate of candidates for the city council and the mayor's office. Velasquez says he expects participation from as many as five other parties. Velasquez, and the other members of the Frente who run the town, seem remarkably upbeat. Carlos Edmundo Morales is a 58-year-old Sandinista who works in the Mayor's office. He joined the Sandinistas 25 years ago and personally knows the nine members of the party's directorate. From 1970 to 1979 he traveled throughout Nicaragua and Central America. organizing political, economic, and military support for the revolutionaries. \"As you can see, what characterizes La Paz Centro is the development of the revo\u00ad lution,\" Morales said one afternoon. In Amherst, a sister city committee has been meeting regularly, and plans to raise money for medical supplies and possibly an ambulance, according to committee member Margery Bancroft. The committee will sponsor a benefit dinner this winter. and plans to organize a fund-raising drive that will request one dollar from every resident of the town in the spring, she said. Bancroft spent a week in La Paz Centro last summer and returned anxious to build a strong relationship between the two towns. \"They're very happy about it. It gave them some hope,\" she said. [From the Springfield Sunday Republican, Dec. 20, 19871 AREA WOMEN HELPING IN NICARAGUA <By Rebecca Thatcher) CONDEGA, NICARAGUA.-The women in this town are often forced to wait for many things as they attempt to build three school buildings here. But the one thing they are not waiting for is for the men to arrive. \"We want to be independent. They <the men) think that we are not capable of con\u00ad structing ... but this is an example that we are strong,\" said Francesca Ponce-Lira, a spokeswoman for the eight Nicaraguan women who are working with the financial, technical, and physical aid of an organiza\u00ad tion that was started in Northampton, Mass. Here in this town of 6,000, about three hours drive north of the capital city of Ma\u00ad nagua, a women's construction brigade project that was born in Northampton, is proceeding steadily. Eight Nicaraguan women, with the help of between 7 and 14 American women at a time, are building three, three-room school buildings and learning construction skills as they go along. 404 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 From the beginning, this project had two objectives , according to the Pioneer Valley women involved. They wanted to express solidarity with the people of Nicaragua, and they wanted in particular to \"empower \" Nicaraguan women. Anne Perkins of Wendell has taught car\u00ad pentry at the Pathfinder Vocational and Technical School in Palmer, and the Putnam Vocational and Technical School in Sprinfield. A long-time peace activist, Per\u00ad kins said she became involved in the women's construction brigade called Brigade Companeras, because she saw a need to counteract the millions of dollars the United States government has spent on the contras, a U.S.-supported rebel army in Nicaragua. \"We wanted to use American dollars to re\u00ad build what American dollars are destroy\u00ad ing,\" she said. As feminists, the women also saw a need to help Nicaraguan women aquire skills such as carpentry . \"It's important that women have the confidence and skills to shape our environment, especially in Nicara\u00ad gua where they are trying to reconstruct so much,\" said Aja Rose of Amherst . Perkins added that she sees the project as an expression of a certain type of femi\u00ad nism-a feminism that goes beyond the needs of women in the United States. \"To be a feminist who struggles only for a better place for white women in a white world is denying what feminism is, it's a very shallow kind of feminism,\" Perkins said. Also a carpenter, Rose said she has not been very involved in the peace movement in the United States and speaks little Span\u00ad ish. Nevertheless, she said working for a month on the construction brigade had been a very important experience. It was stressful and difficult, but it also felt very right, she said. Unlike towns closer to the capital city of Managua , Condego is located close to the conflict and could almost be considered a war zone, she said. \"We could hear bombs and guns shooting often. To have that as a constant presence is hard to integrate,\" she said. Recently the contras attacked a civilian bus on the Pan-American Highway very near Condega, she said. They killed one woman on the bus, forced everyone else off, and machine-gunned the bus, she said. She said that despite the danger, building a school in Nicaragua was a very special ex\u00ad perience. \"I can't explain the feeling of just know\u00ad ing that what you're doing is the right thing to do,\" she said. Brigada Campaneras began in Northamp\u00ad ton a year and half ago, the brainchild of a group of activist women, some of whom had participated in an earlier construction bri\u00ad gade with men. Later on, the idea received support from women from New York City and Boston, who also became involved in the fundraising and organizing. Through dances, dinners, tee-shirt sales, raffles and other fundraising events, a total of $21,000 was raised between the three cities. Working through a Nicaraguan govern\u00ad ment agency, the group was assigned the project in Condega, and began working in August. And Ponce-Lira says it is only the begin\u00ad ning. \"After this is done we want to continue constructing . . . We look for a place to build a carpentry school for women,\" she said. NATIONAL DAY OF EXCELLENCE Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise on this National Day of Excellence to recognize the commitment of the Challenger astronauts, whose memory this special day honors. These astro\u00ad nauts-as well as the scores of other astronauts who have flown into space for America's space program-symbol\u00ad ize the pioneering spirit of adventure that our great Nation cherishes. This pioneering spirit is evidenced in young and old Americans. After the Chal\u00ad lenger accident, the news media con\u00ad ducted polls of schoolchildren across America. Those children said that, even in the face of such a tragedy, the space program must move foreward, exploring the Heavens and more close\u00ad ly studying our Earth. The 2 years since Challenger have al\u00ad lowed time for close examination of our space program, its hardware, its workers and managers , its goals. We have come to appreciate even more the importance of safety and the dis\u00ad astrous effects of slavish adherence to schedules at all costs. A scientist for Morton Thiokol will receive the Scien\u00ad tific Freedom and Responsibility Award next month for his warning about 0-ring seals and cold weather. The warning came the night before the Challenger launch. Thiokol offi\u00ad cials recommended that the launch be put off; NASA objected and Thiokol acquiesced. It is time now to put those mistakes behind us and to truly honor the Chal\u00ad lenger crew and get our space program off the launch pad. A report by a Na\u00ad tional Academy of Sciences and Na\u00ad tional Research Council team has found that NASA is \"no longer a strong technical organization\" and must more than double work on ad\u00ad vanced space technology to fulfill its mandate to support civil and defense needs under the National Space Act. The Congress and White House must work together to give NASA the fund\u00ad ing necessary to undertake this vital research. The research council found the most serious area of deficiency is rocket propulsion development. They warn that any further delays in pro\u00ad gram expansion will \"translate to the loss of United States space leadership to the European, Asian, and Soviet programs,\" with \"considerable impact on the United States economy, pres\u00ad tige, and security.\" We cannot afford to let this happen. ZENON HANSEN-THE FIRST DISTINGUISHED EAGLE SCOUT Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am confident my colleagues will agree on the tremendous contribution to na\u00ad tional leadership that has been provid\u00ad ed by the Boy Scouts of America. I am happy to report that a fine example of one such contributor comes from my home State of Iowa-Mr. Zenon C.R. Hansen. An article appearing in this month's Scouting magazine chronicles the in\u00ad spiring story of Mr. Hansen, the founder and original recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Award. Mr. Hansen grew up in Sioux City, IA, and has been an active supporter of scout\u00ad ing since first earning his Eagle badge at age 16. Throughout his highly suc\u00ad cessful career, Mr. Hansen has sup\u00ad ported the Boy Scouts of America and credited his remarkable success to Eagle Scout training. The prestige and honor of receiving the Distinguished Eagle Award is worthy of our highest regards. It is presented to adult Eagle Scouts who, having risen to important posts in business, education, or public life, have remained dedicated to the high ideals and principles of the scouting tradition and who have continued to provide leadership for the organiza\u00ad tion. I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Hansen, who, at age 77, remains active today as a member of the na\u00ad tional advisory council. I am confident that the people of Iowa share in my pride in the outstanding achievements in industry and scouting of Mr. Hansen. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Scouting article be entered in the RECORD as testament to my respect for Mr. Hansen. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: THE FIRST DISTINGUISHED EAGLE CBy Dick Pryce) In 1986, 62 men received the Distin\u00ad guished Eagle Award, one of the most covet\u00ad ed of Scouting's honors. They were men who in their adult life had achieved signifi\u00ad cance in business, education , or public life. In each case the recipients felt deeply hon\u00ad ored to receive this award, available only to men who had been Eagle Scouts as boys. What was the origin of the Distinguished Eagle Award? And who was the author of the idea? It began with Zenon C.R. Hansen, one of the nation's leading business executives and a lifelong, dedicated Scout and Scouter. His Scouting story deserves to be told for, in ad\u00ad dition to creating the Distinguished Eagle program, he began making contributions to Scouting in the 1920s, when the movement was still in its infancy. Life was good for 17-year-old Zenon c. R. Hansen in the spring of 1927. He had just been graduated from high school in Sioux City, Iowa, and his immediate future was all mapped out. An excellent student, young Hansen expected to enroll in the fall on an academic scholarship at the University of Iowa. He would earn his degree in four years, perhaps less, for he was recognized by his teachers as a hard-working, able student. His background was Swedish, and Swedish\u00ad Americans believed that hard work would take a man to the heights. Then came a call from his high school principal , a man he admired. \"The manager \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7~\u00b7-~ January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 405 of International Harvester wants to talk to you,\" the principal told him. \"What about?\" asked Zenon. \"I think he wants to hire you.\" The young man's achievements in high school and Scouting were common knowl\u00ad edge in the small Iowa town. Zenon had four Silver Palms to go with the Eagle badge he had earned in Troop 17 at age 16. Businessmen in Sioux City recognized him as a dynamo destined to continue achieving. He was flattered when the manager did offer him a job. He thanked the manager politely and told him of his desire to go to the university on a scholarship. But the man refused to take no for an answer. He convinced Zenon that he would get ahead quicker by working for International Har\u00ad vester. The manager was right. At the age of 18, while his peers were pursuing educations, Zenon Hansen was immersed in manage\u00ad ment training at International Harvester 's main office in Chicago. He completed the course with high marks and was dispatched to Europe where he embarked on a personal program to educate himself. He learned German, Italian, and French, and he stud\u00ad ied business management , automotive engi\u00ad neering, auditing, and accounting . By the time the Great Depression cast a pall over the United States, Hansen was 21 and comptroller of his company's Swiss af\u00ad filiate. A lot of his high school classmates who went on to college weren't doing so well. He remained overseas until 1936, then re\u00ad turned to the main office in Chicago. In 1941 he was named manager of !H's truck branch in Portland, Ore. He was on a path that was to lead to the board rooms of in\u00ad dustrial America . Other opportunities arose, and in 1944 he left International Harvester for a vice-presidency with Automotive Equipment in Portland . Continuing to climb the business trail, he became president and director of the Dia\u00ad mond T Motor Truck Company and, after that, in 1972 chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Mack Trucks, Inc., in Allentown, Pa. A rags-to-riches story? That's a fairly ac\u00ad curate description , for his grandmother and two aunts had reared him, and there cer\u00ad tainly never had been any extra money around. But don't call it luck because Zenon Hansen has always known the source of his good fortune in life. Scouting! When I interviewed him at his home in Sebring, Fla., Zenon Hansen, a powerful\u00ad looking white-haired man of 77, who is still a member of the National Advisory Council, emphasized that the discipline he learned as a Boy Scout and his belief in the Scout Oath and Law served him well in his busi\u00ad ness career. \"I was raised as an orphan boy and, frank\u00ad ly, I don't know what would have happened to me if I hadn't been in Scouting,\" said Hansen. \"Even my first job with Interna\u00ad tional Harvester came as a result of my Boy Scout work.\" That job offer came as no surprise to Scouter Henry A. Hoskins, who was recruit\u00ad ed by Hansen to serve as Scoutmaster of Troop 1 that Hansen had organized. Since Hansen was not old enough to be Scoutmas\u00ad ter, he promised to be the assistant and do all the work if Hoskins would serve as Scoutmaster. \"I'd been active in Scouting some years before I became Scoutmaster, \" Hoskins said in 1969 when he visited Hansen, who was by then Mack Trucks' top executive. \"I was chairman of the court of honor of the Sioux City Boy Scout Council and Hansen kept appearing for more merit badges beyond the 21 required for Eagle Scout-a total of 81 merit badges! That's more than any other Scout I've ever known or heard about. \"When I found out that he was being raised by an aunt and grandmother, \" Hos\u00ad kins said, \"I figured he could use some fa\u00ad therly advice from time to time. So my wife and I invited him to our house for dinner each Sunday. We had three boys and one girl, and he became just like one of the family.\" In fact, Hansen called his Scoutmaster \"Uncle Henry,\" and Hoskins became the man he could pattern his own life after. And the BSA brought this remarkable man into an impressionable young Scout's life. Little wonder that Scouting became so important to him. As Hansen recognized, the Scouting door swings both ways. Hansen the Scout became Hansen the Scoutmaster, then Hansen the itinerant Scouter, moving from town to town and corporation to corporation while continuing to serve the movement in an in\u00ad credible number of positions in many coun\u00ad cils. He was president in two-Portland Area in Portland, Ore., and Thatcher Woods Area in Oak Park, Ill. He sat on executive boards in seven councils, on executive committees in three regions, and was executive commit\u00ad tee chairman of Old Region Seven. Hansen had many jobs at the national level-chairman of the National Advisory Council, the National Finance Committee , the National Civic Relations Committee, the National Employee Benefits Committee, and the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award Committee. To each he added the mark of his great abilities. He is also the man who sold to the Boy Scouts of America the concept of the Distin\u00ad guished Eagle Scout Award. \"The idea for it was born in the mind of Zenon C.R. Hansen approximately 25 years ago,\" remembers William Harrison Fetridge , who knew Han\u00ad sen's views well. \"He was then National Treasurer and I was National Vice President of the BSA. He came to see me with the recommendation to create the Distinguished Eagle A ward and outlined what he considered would be the necessary qualifications, including 25 years as an Eagle plus a distinguished record in business or public service.\" Councils were in desperate need of what Hansen calls \"appreciative leadership, \" men like himself who had profited by their expe\u00ad riences as Eagles and could appreciate what it meant. At first he found little support for both ideas from Scouting's top hierarchy. \"They all thought the Distinguished Eagle Award was a great idea, but nobody wanted to do anything about it,\" Hansen said. Among Hansen's supporters was William Fetridge. \"He also thought there should be a roster of all Eagle Scouts,\" said Fetridge. \"But I convinced him this would be impossi\u00ad ble to do. Finally Mr. Hansen presented his idea to the National Court of Honor, which approved it-as did, I believe, the National Executive Board.\" The Boy Scouts of America did sanction the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 1969, incorporating Hansen's ideas-includ\u00ad ing his basic design for the award. And in 1970 Zenon C.R. Hansen, a very distin\u00ad guished Eagle from Sioux City, Iowa, was deservedly the first person the BSA hon\u00ad ored with the award. Hansen and many of the other earliest re\u00ad cipients-Neil Armstrong, Gerald Ford, Ross Perot-gave money that eventually was used to start the National Eagle Scout Associa\u00ad tion. The basic point of the Distinguished Eagle Award, as envisioned by Hansen, is to bring back into Scouting, Eagles who have been out of Scouting but want to give some\u00ad thing back. \"You have got to give these people the opportunity to participate in Scouting,\" he insists. \"They become the future board members and future council contributors. \"If they're like me, they'll admit they never would have gotten anywhere in this world if they hadn't been an Eagle Scout.\" URBAN DEVELOPMENT ACTION GRANTS Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to do two things. First of all, I want to congratulate Senator PROXMIRE, chairman, and Senator GARN, the ranking member, and their staff of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Last year Congress passed a new housing bill. This is the first time we have had a housing bill since 1980. The members of the Housing Subcom\u00ad mittee and their staffs are also to be congratulated for their hard work in putting together a bill that we hope the administration will sign. This brings me to my second point and one I want to bring to the atten\u00ad tion of the Senate today. In this bill yet to be signed, a new formula for the Urban Development Action Grant Program is included. The Senate passed that provision about six different times over the last 4 years only to have the House reject it because they wanted a complete housing bill. A number of Senators from States on both side of the aisle realized that the UDAG Program would not survive without a change in the formula that would allow it to be a national pro\u00ad gram again. That group worked hard to come up with a formula that we hoped would be a fair one. The current system used by HUD has favored for over 4 years now, only about eight States in the Northeastern part of the country, shutting out the rest of the country. This area of the country has received over 80 percent of all the UDAG funds because of this unfair, unjust formula. I feel compelled today to inform my fell ow Senator's of a blatant, unfair attempt by these same few privileged States to again take the bulk of the UDAG funds during the currently scheduled round of funding to be an\u00ad nounced before the first of the month. Let me explain the problem. Congress, so concerned with the un\u00ad fairness of the formula now being used, placed a requirement in the new law that the new UDAG formula be immediately implemented by the Sec\u00ad retary upon the signing of the bill. 406 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 Everyone felt this bill would have been signed by now. In fact, a bill sign\u00ad ing ceremony was scheduled for the 20th of this month. Then the date was moved-I understand at least two other times-to accommodate schedul\u00ad ing problems. It currently is scheduled on the 5th of February. Because this date is after January 30, HUD's published date for announc\u00ad ing the UDAG's, HUD feels they are forced to use the old formula. This means those few States that have been receiving all the funds will again soak up all the funds this round. I might add: I understand these States felt this would be the last \"gravy train round\" they would have so they gathered every UDAG applica\u00ad tion they could muster and applied. They have lobbied and have, as of now, convinced HUD to use the old formula for this current round. We have been working hard these last few days to resolve this issue so the new formula would be used imme\u00ad diately. HUD had been planning to use the new formula. They too felt the bill would be signed prior to the funding announcement date and their staff has been working on placing the new provisions in their considerations as they worked with the cities during their negotiations on these projects. They were so confident this law would be in place they implemented the $10 million cap on the amount of funds any one UDAG could receive. One of the privileged cities has a number of request in, one of which was for over $15 million, and then in\u00ad dicated that, yes, they could do the project for the $10 million. After they heard the law would not be signed, they went back to HUD and tried to say they really needed the $15 million. Remember, the UDAG funds are only to fill the gap to complete a project. This city has continually been funded no matter what type of application they submitted or how many they ap\u00ad plied for, while States like Iowa and three-fourths of the rest of the coun\u00ad try were completely shut out. I say to my fell ow Senators, enough is enough. We have until noon today to get this unfair, unjust, down right wrong deci\u00ad sion reversed. There are three things that can be done. First, the chairman and ranking member of the Banking and Housing Committee can send a letter to the Secretary requesting him to ask for a waiver of a provision in the current housing law that requires the Secre\u00ad tary to send to Congress all proposed HUD rules 30 days before they are published in the Federal Register. This would allow the Secretary to pub\u00ad lish tomorrow in the Federal Register a recission of the January 30 an-nouncement date of this round of UDAG's. This is the easiest and fastest way to get this program solved. The second option would be for the President to go ahead and sign the new housing bill, regardless of Mem\u00ad bers of Congress wanting a bill signing ceremony. Third, the Secretary would, under current law, just not hold the round and wait until the next large city round in May and use this round's $57 million with the May round's money and hold one large round. There are good points and bad ones for this option. Some projects cannot wait until May and some of their com\u00ad mitments will have to be renegotiated. I pref er the first option that would reschedule the date of this round until the President signs the new legislation which is currently scheduled for Feb\u00ad ruary 5, only 1 week from tomorrow. But if this cannot happen, then I would favor the Secretary canceling this round and using this round's funds with May's round. This would allow all projects to have the same op\u00ad portunity that only those few States that now get the funds to finally have to face the same review that we have to face with our projects. I want to encourage Senators from the following States to contact HUD and Chairman PROXMIRE and Senator GARN before noon today to encourage them to act immediately by working with their counterparts on the House side to send to Secretary Pierce the letter I have provided their offices. The States that have UDAG's that will probably not be funded this round are: Virginia, West Virginia, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississip\u00ad pi, Tennessee, Illinois, Michigan, Lou- 1s1ana, Oklahoma, Texas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Arizona, California, Washington, and North Dakota. I encourage Senators from those States, and other States from the South, Midwest, and West that under\u00ad stand how unfair this action is to im\u00ad mediately take action because if you wait until after noon today it will be too late. If Senate staffs need more informa\u00ad tion they can contact my office and we will be happy to provide it to them. INF VERIFICATION AND SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Sunday's edition of the Washington Post carried an excellent article on verification technology. The article, entitled \"Verification: Keeping Ivan Honest,\" by John A. Adam, highlights the work done by Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, in support of our INF Treaty negotiators. The article details the techniques which Sandia has developed for onsite inspection of a Soviet missile assembly plant. The system had to be sufficient\u00ad ly intrusive to guarantee that any sig\u00ad nificant cheating by the Soviets at such missile assembly plants would be detected, yet not be an invitation to es\u00ad pionage when reciprocally applied to our own facilities. The article mentions the work of Gus Simmons and Roger Hagengruber in support of a Department of Defense contract on verification. I might note that many other Sandians have played important roles in the treaty negotia\u00ad tion process. Stan Fraley spent 6 months last year in Geneva and there headed a subgroup that defined the in\u00ad spection protocol to the treaty. In Al\u00ad buquerque, Don Bauder, John Taylor, and Pauline Bennett, under the super\u00ad vision of John Holovka, all helped pro\u00ad vide information to back-stop the veri\u00ad fication subgroup's negotiations. The article also notes that Richard Perle was primarily responsible for ini\u00ad tiating this verification research effort at Sandia in support of the INF nego\u00ad tiations. I want to commend Mr. Perle for this. He and I are not often in agreement on strategic weapons and arms control issues, but we are in total agreement on the need for greater at\u00ad tention to be focused on verification technologies. I have been pointing out since coming to the Senate that we need a solidly funded forward-looking research program on verification tech\u00ad nologies to provide options and an\u00ad swers to our negotiators when they need them. Too often in the past, the development of verification options has not kept up with the development of new weapons technologies. Last year, as a result of an amend\u00ad ment I offered to the Defense Author\u00ad ization Act, the Congress increased au\u00ad thorized funding for verification re\u00ad search in the Department of Energy and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency by almost $30 million. The Appropriations Subcommittees on Energy and Defense later included ap\u00ad propriations for almost $26 million of this addition in the final continuing resolution. These actions testify to the strong support in the Congress for ver\u00ad ification research, even when budget constraints forced cuts in many other defense programs. I hope that we will continue that support this year. Mr. President, we have at Sandia and its sister DOE weapons laborato\u00ad ries a unique national resource. For over 40 years they have played a cen\u00ad tral role in providing our nuclear de\u00ad terrent. But increasingly they are di\u00ad versifying into research on verification technologies and advanced convention\u00ad al munitions technologies, and thus they are becoming national security laboratories in the broadest sense, not simply nuclear weapons laboratories. Sandia, for example, last year in just a couple of mopths came up with a tech-January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 407 nology to limit use of the Stinger mis\u00ad sile in response to Senator DECON\u00ad crNr's concerns about this antiaircraft missile falling into the hands of ter\u00ad rorists. This involved a simple spinoff from the much more complex use con\u00ad trols embodied in our nuclear weap\u00ad ons. We need to continue to encourage this diversification of the laboratories. Especially at a time of overall budget constraints, we need to make better use of the broad technology base which the laboratories have developed and sustained over the past 40 years. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the article from yesterday's Post be printed here at the end of my statement. There being no objection, the mate\u00ad rial was ordered to abe printed in the RECORD, as follows: VERIFICATION: KEEPING IVAN HONEST <By John A. Adam) When the Senate begins hearings Monday on the INF arms-control treaty, a crucial issue will be whether-and how-the United States can detect potential Soviet violations. The subject is critical because both the INF accord and the Strategic Arms Reduc\u00ad tion Treaty <START) now being negotiated in Geneva will require unprecedented verifi\u00ad cation technologies. Unlike previous arms accords, which involved watching large structures such as fixed missile silos and bombers, INF and START would restrict in\u00ad dividual small missiles. Consequently, America's traditional moni\u00ad and electronic intelligence-will not be suffi\u00ad cient. Extensive cooperative measures will be needed. Trucks and railroad cars must be inspected; plant gates, grounds and fences watched; small weapons examined for nucle\u00ad ar content. And the INF pact requires new systems for continuous monitoring of mis\u00ad sile-production facilities. Exactly what kind of sensors the United States will place on Soviet soil is still being decided. But U.S. research on on-site inspec\u00ad tion systems-involving tamper-resistant fiber-optic systems, infrared surveillance arrays and more-is already well underway, much of it at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, which AT&T runs for the Department of Energy. OVERCOMING MUTUAL MISTRUST Problems abound when working in an ad\u00ad versary's territory. The verification system must ensure that each side can trust the au\u00ad thenticity of the on-site data, producing a paradox: The Soviets must be assured that information gathered is for verification only-not espionage-and that it agrees with the facts. Thus, data cannot be en\u00ad crypted. But the United States must be con\u00ad fident that streams of data, traveling through open channels in Soviet territory , are not forgeries. Thus some form of en\u00ad crypted authentication code must be used. Cracking that puzzle falls to Sandia's Gus\u00ad tavus J. Simmons, a mathematician with a foot-long beard and a flattop coif who has been solving such brainteasers for 20 years. Simmons and his colleagues are perfecting a data system that guarantees integrity. The technique that the United States will pro\u00ad pose to the Soviets is the least sophisticated of Simmons' schemes. But it has already passed the scrutiny of codebreakers at the National Security Agency and was discussed with the Soviets in the '70s during the Com\u00ad prehensive Test Ban Treaty talks. More\u00ad over, it has proven reliable at remote U.S. seismic stations in Norway and glean data from Soviet underground nuclear tests. The system works by automatically at\u00ad taching an authentication \"word\" to the output of a monitoring device such as a camera. The output, in the form of a long binary sequence <strings of Os and ls), is fed into a computer, which breaks the data up into small blocks of, say, 64 bits. The first block is encrypted with a secret key which produces a 64-bit cipher held in the comput\u00ad er's memory. As the second block of data ar\u00ad rives, each element in the cipher is matched with its corresponding element in the second data block. If the two elements are alike, a 0 is recorded; if different, a 1. This produces a new 64-bit number, which re\u00ad places the first cipher and is in turn en\u00ad crypted with the key. This new cipher is then matched against the contents of the third block of data, which begets yet an\u00ad other new cipher and so forth. The end result, after processing an entire data stream thousands of bits long, is a final 64- bit cipher incorporating information about each bit of data in the whole stream. This final cipher, or authentication word, is ap\u00ad pended to the unencrypted monitor output and sent. Nothing in the process prevents the Sovi\u00ad ets from scrutinizing the data while it is sent. And the United States can verify the result by running the received data through the same encrypting procedure using a copy of the secret key. If the final cipher gener\u00ad ated matches the one that was appended to the original monitor output, then the data are genuine. Just as increasing the number of grooves in a housekey makes it harder to pick the lock, the more variables there are in a cipher key, the less the likelihood of cracking the code. ON-SITE AND ON GUARD Shortly before the 1986 summit in Rey\u00ad kjavik where the Soviets agreed to U.S. pro\u00ad posals regarding on-site INF monitoring, Roger L. Hagengruber, vice president of sys\u00ad tems analysis at Sandia, got a phone call from the Pentagon. DOD wanted a full\u00ad scale test facility built to examine schemes for continuous monitoring of a Soviet weap\u00ad ons-production plant. It also wanted a work\u00ad ing model of the site. The project was given top priority. - Within two months, the Sandia team pro\u00ad duced a table-top model showing the section of a typical Soviet missile factory which in\u00ad cludes the main portal. The Pentagon dis\u00ad played the model to officials from the White House, State Department and Con\u00ad gress, demonstrating how a missile-carrying truck triggers a suite of sensors to record weight and other data. One U.S. official called it a \"good marketing tool\" that helped policymakers visualize potential problems. Both the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed that INF monitoring sys\u00ad tems exist which will include \"weight sen\u00ad sors, vehicle sensors, surveillance systems and vehicle dimensional measuring equip\u00ad ment.\" In addition, \"non-damaging image\u00ad producing\" gear will be installed to examine contents of shipping containers and launch canisters. The goal is to devise a system that automatically collects and records data 24 hours a day. The monitoring system must be accurate enough to detect potential viola\u00ad tions but work fast enough so traffic flow is not unduly impeded. And because deploy\u00ad ment within Soviet borders precludes use of trade-secret equipment, engineers must create highly reliable systems composed mainly of commercially available gear. One such device is a vertical and horizon\u00ad tal array of infrared sensors to measure rap\u00ad idly the length and profile of various vehi\u00ad cles leaving the plant. Like radar, the system would send out its own energy beam to sense objects day or night and in adverse weather. For weighing, Hagengruber says commercial scales can be modified to assess a moving truck or to weigh loads on freight trains. Railroad cars in some respects are easy to monitor because they are con\u00ad strained to tracks, have a fixed geometry and uniform velocities. But they also pose special problems because they may weigh much more than their freight and the cars may come in a mix of gondolas and box cars. To skirt this problem, Hagengruber says they may negotiate that only certain types of train cars are allowed into the plant. If a vehicle is large and heavy enough to be carrying a prohibited missile, its cargo will be examined by nondestructive imaging, most likely by X-ray sensors tuned to appro\u00ad priate intensities. X-rays can take measure\u00ad ments and determine material composition and are generally hard to deceive. Manufac\u00ad turers of rockets routinely use them to in\u00ad spect solid propellants for cracks. For verifi\u00ad cation, however , the scans must occur faster than industrial applications, and probably be less intrusive too, says Hagengruber. Sandia is also examining tamper-resistant seals that would reliably indicate if enclo\u00ad sures had been breached. In one such device, a loop of multistrand plastic fiber\u00ad optic cable is cut to desired length in the field. Its ends are put into a one-piece seal body which contains a serrated blade that randomly severs a portion of the cable fibers. The result is a unique \"signature\" of the uncut fibers. That pattern is photo\u00ad graphed. If the fiber-optic loop is later re\u00ad leased, the blade is designed to cut addition\u00ad al fibers and change the signature. During inspection, a second Polaroid shot is taken for immediate comparison with the original signature. WARHEADS AND HOLOGRAMS Authorities note that it is much easier to verify a ban than a residual force of, say, 100 missiles. Consequently the START pact, because it seeks to halve levels of strategic warheads, will require more strict measures. In addition, the two superpowers are dis\u00ad cussing in Geneva how to limit nuclear\u00ad tipped cruise missiles on ships and subma\u00ad rines. Such controls pose special monitoring problems because the missiles are much smaller than other strategic weapons and because some are fitted with conventional warheads. Researchers have been examining tech\u00ad niques to \"tag\" concealable mobile nuclear weaponry . The challenge is to design a system that permits counting for verifica\u00ad tion but does not allow targeting by the military. Fred Holzer, deputy leader of verification at Lawrence Livermore National Laborato\u00ad ry, outlined further constraints during a 1986 interview. The tags must be tamper\u00ad proof and impossible to duplicate; and they must in no way interfere with the missile's operation, he explained. Moreover they must be designed so they cannot be used-or even be perceived to be usable-as a homing device. Numerous schemes exist. For new mis\u00ad siles, tags might be installed at the produc\u00ad tion line. One possibility is to make a special 408 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 mold with an intricate surface pattern for producing a tag. After the required number were produced, Holzer said, the mold could be broken. Another possibility, for new or existing weaponry, is to make a photomicro\u00ad graph or acoustic hologram of a small patch on the missile. Each weapon examined could then be checked against a database of the fiber patterns of \"legitimate\" missiles. Yet another option is to use a microchip tag that could be queried on inspection. The basic technologies that might be used are being employed by auto manufacturers in\u00ad cluding BMW, Fiat and Honda. BMW's as\u00ad sembly line uses chips coded to contain such information as paint color, options to be in\u00ad stalled and so forth for each chassis. The chip is queried during assembly stages and the specified actions taken. Honda uses an intrinsic property, like fiber grains, to guard against piracy in spare auto parts. Other scenarios are akin to existing methods of satellite tracking of caribou. A U.S. satellite monitors free-roaming herds fitted with radio transmitters in northwestern Alaska to an accuracy of 0.8 kilometers. Holzer says that \"these kinds of techniques are being developed rather rapidly.\" A senior adminis\u00ad tration official observes, however, that de\u00ad spite all the studies no practical tagging schemes have yet emerged. START verification might include a plan to designate assembly areas to make missile production more transparent to surveillance satellites. But satellites cannot provide the sort of information that Soviet leader Mik\u00ad hail Gorbachev mentioned in his summit farewell speech, when he shocked many ob\u00ad servers by declaring that the Soviets had a technique that would remotely \"identify not only the presence but also the capacity of the nuclear warheads\" aboard mobile ves\u00ad sels. If it exists, such a device probably emits a pulse of high-energy neutrons to induce a small amount of fission in any nuclear war\u00ad head. The pulse would have to be weak enough to prevent the degradation in the reliability of the nuclear weapons but strong enough to produce a recognizable sig\u00ad nature of gamma rays or neutrons. But be\u00ad cause of the rapid degradation of this signa\u00ad ture in the atmosphere, such measurements must be made from close range. Moreover, shielding by lead or water could foil the in\u00ad spection. More detailed schemes must be fielded for effective ST ART verification. A November 1987 report by the House In\u00ad telligence Committee was unanimous in saying that the Executive Branch provides \"no central direction and prioritization of research and development to improve arms control monitoring capabilities.\" It placed the blame largely on the intelligence com\u00ad munity. Indeed many technologies for use in the INF treaty were developed for other pur\u00ad poses. Participants say some analyses, such as whether inspections of suspect sites should be allowed, were done hastily. Although INF negotiations began in No\u00ad vember 1981, money for the major INF monitoring program started flowing several years later. The Department of Defense was the surprising source, including the interna\u00ad tional security policy branch formerly headed by Richard N. Perle, popularly known as a bete noire of arms control. In spite of budget constraints, Congress supplemented administration requests for verification research for fiscal 1988. Wheth\u00ad er that results in innovative techniques for monitoring the strategically sensitive START pact remains to be seen. SECRETS AND CIPHERS <By John A. Adam) The Drawback in the simplest version of Gus Simmons' scheme is that the Soviets would not know everything being sent. But the secret key used to authenticate old mes\u00ad sages would be periodically supplied to the Soviets who could then exactly reconstruct the a~thentication words to determine whether espionage information existed. The Soviets could also dismantle a similar piece of authentication gear to discern its intelli\u00ad gence potential. In that simple approach, the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt a message. In 1986 however, a different method emerged. Call~d public-key cryptography, it uses one key to scramble a message and a different key to unscramble it. Hence the ability to decrypt a message does not also permit one to make forgeries. Such a scheme is ideal for verification work, for it allows authentication without secrecy, and it can prevent some convoluted ways of cheating. The United States would encrypt the entire message and share the decrypt key with the Soviets and any other third party. All parties could decipher the data as it was transmitted. Simmons' group at Sandia uses the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm where the encrypting party bases its key on a pair of prime numbers P and Q that are kept secret and are so large that factoring N = PQ is beyond all projected ca\u00ad pabilities of computers. The United States would be confident that the data were genu\u00ad ine because it would be practically impossi\u00ad ble, even with supercomputers, to determine the encryption key in time to alter the data. But under the scheme, the party doing the encryption could send a forgery. Be\u00ad cause of that ability, the Soviets could dis\u00ad avow any incriminating message, telling the United Nations, for example, that U.S. da~a indicating a trainload of illegal SS-20 mis\u00ad siles was a fabrication. So in 1980, Simmons' group devised a method whereby the United States and the Soviet Union would collabo\u00ad rate in the encryption. But several years ago, it was realized that unilateral action of either party-saying its secret encryption key had been compro\u00ad mised, for instance-would circumvent the system. So Simmons, in his fourth iteration, proposed that a third party do on-site en\u00ad cryption using the public-key technique. With at least three parties contributing to the message-scrambling, the system was immune to impeachment by unilateral ac\u00ad tions. \"Each time you solve one problem and peel off that layer of difficulty,\" says Sim\u00ad mons, \"you find a more subtle one inside.\" But for now at least, he thinks the problem is finally solved. If the Soviets do not agree on his first-generation system, there are many alternatives.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. SHELBY: S. 2013. A bill to prevent distortions in the reapportionment of the House of Representatives caused by the use of census population figures which in\u00ad clude illegal aliens; referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs. PREVENTING DISTORTIONS IN THE REAPPOR\u00ad TIONMENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTA\u00ad TIVES CAUSED BY CENSUS FIGURES INCLUDING ILLEGAL ALIENS Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that pre\u00ad vents the use of census figures which include illegal aliens for apportion\u00ad ment of the House of Representatives. This legislation will direct the Secre\u00ad tary of Commerce to ensure that ille\u00ad gal aliens shall not be counted for ap\u00ad portionment purposes. Does it make sense that illegal aliens who are here without the consent of the governed be given representation in Congress? In 1980, the Census Bureau counted 2 million illegal aliens and included them in the numbers used to apportion the 435 seats in the House of Representatives. According to a Congressional Re\u00ad search Service study, including illegal aliens in the 1980 census awarded an extra seat in Congress to California and New York at the expense of Indi\u00ad ana and Georgia. In 1990, Pennsylva\u00ad nia, Connecticut, Michigan, North Carolina, and Alabama could lose con\u00ad gressional seats if the Census Bureau continues to include illegal aliens. This problem is relatively new, since prior to the 1970 census the number of illegal aliens in the United States was fairly negligible. To the extent illegal aliens were enumerated at all, their in\u00ad cidental inclusion in the census count was not an issue. But today the situa\u00ad tion has changed and the inclusion of illegal aliens is affecting congressional district reapportionment. The decision to include persons un\u00ad lawfully present is not the product of years of agency practice, but rather is simply the failure to respond to a recent massive escalation in illegal mi\u00ad gration. The Census Bureau estimates that the permanent stock of illegal aliens coming to the United States rises by 200,000 to 300,000 each year, and brings the total illegal alien popula\u00ad tion in the United States to as many as 12 million; 12 million people trans\u00ad lates into roughly 6 seats in the House of Representatives. The method cur\u00ad rently used by the Census Bureau will cause some unknown number of for\u00ad eign visitors, temporary workers, and foreign students to be included as well. To avoid this problem in the future, the Census Bureau should add ques\u00ad tions to its long and short forms which will identify illegal aliens. This inclu\u00ad sion of illegal aliens in the apportion\u00ad ment base dilutes the representation of several States and violates the equal representation principle. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: s. 2013 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Congress finds that- O > in recent years millions of aliens have entered the United States in violation of im\u00ad migration laws and are now residing in the United States in an illegal status and are subject to deportation; (2) the established policy of the Bureau of the Census is to make a concerted effort to count such aliens during the 1990 census without making a separate computation for such illegal aliens; and (3) by including the millions of illegal aliens in the reapportionment base for the House of Representatives, many States will lose congressional representation which such States would not have otherwise lost, 410 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 thereby violating the constitutional princi\u00ad ple of \"one man, one vote\". SEc. 2. Section 141 of title 13, United States Code, is amended by redesignating subsection (g) as subsection (h), and by in\u00ad serting after subsection (f) the following new subsection: \"(g) The Secretary shall make such ad\u00ad justments in total population figures as may be necessary, using such methods and proce\u00ad dures as the Secretary determines appropri\u00ad ate, in order that aliens in the United States in violation of the immigration laws shall not be counted in tabulating population for purposes of subsection (b) of this section.\".

A bill to establish certain grant programs relating to acquired immune deficiency syndrome among intravenous substance abusers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. INTRAVENOUS SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND AIDS PREVENTION ACT e Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, since June 1981, over 28,000 people have died of AIDS. One-quarter of these deaths, 7 ,000 people, have result\u00ad ed from intravenous drug use. Accord\u00ad ing to the Centers for Disease Control, between 50 and 60 percent of intrave\u00ad nous drug users, as many as 335,000, are infected with the AIDS virus. The AIDS virus is spread through the interaction of bodily fluids. This occurs when a needle used to inject heroin is used by another individual to do the same. That needle has the blood of the first user, which the second user is exposed to when using the same needle. This is the primary way in which AIDS is spread among intravenous drug users. It is not only the intravenous drug users themselves that are contracting AIDS. They are spreading AIDS to their sexual partners and children. All these people will die; 53 percent of all AID-related deaths in New York City occur among intravenous drug users. As many as 350 children have died al\u00ad ready from the AIDS virus contracted from their mother, and the number of children born with the AIDS virus is growing daily. According to a study conducted by Dr. Lloyd Novick, 1 out of every 60 newborns in New York City are born with the AIDS virus. Children are dying. Mothers and fa\u00ad thers are dying. We are witness to this and seem powerless to stop it. But we are not powerless. We have the means to reach these people, break their habit, and stop the spread of AIDS. This is not the first time intravenous drug use has threatened to wipe out a good number of people in our society. In 1969, when I was a Special Assist\u00ad ant for Urban Affairs for President Nixon, the crisis was heroin, a narcotic derived from the poppy plant. At that time, poppy plants were grown primar\u00ad ily in Turkey, processed into heroin in Marseilles, and then smuggled into New York. In order to cut off the supply of heroin, I persuaded the President to provide financial assistance to help Turkish farmers make the transition from a poppy-based to a more general agricultural economy. With our help, the program to eradicate illicit poppy production succeeded and the French Connection collapsed, creating a severe shortage of heroin in every major drug center in the country. It worked. Heroin use in all our cities went down. Crime went down. But now poppy production has moved to Pakistan, Burma, and Thailand. Iran and Syria have replaced France as heroin processing centers. We have had some cooperation with these coun\u00ad tries to stop poppy production but not enough. In the last decade, heroin use has reemerged, and with the onset of AIDS, has become even more destruc\u00ad tive. Just last year, in an effort to control the growing problem, Congress en\u00ad acted a major antidrug abuse law. It authorized $1.7 billion for prevention and treatment of illicit drug use and research into ways of breaking drug addiction, most notably with sub\u00ad stances known as narcotic antagonists which block nerve endings so that the effects of narcotics cannot be felt by the user. But the Reagan administra\u00ad tion, less than 4 months after the en\u00ad actment of this much touted piece of legislation, proposed a $900 million cut in antidrug abuse programs. Fortu\u00ad nately, Congress was able to restore some of this money, but not nearly enough. The bill I introduce today, the Intra\u00ad venous Drug Abuse and AIDS Preven\u00ad tion Act, was introduced by Congress\u00ad man RANGEL on September 16, 1987. As chairman of the House Select Commit\u00ad tee on Narcotics, Congressman RANGEL has led the long and difficult battle against drug abuse. I have been privi\u00ad leged to work with him in the past and am proud to do so again. This bill seeks to attack this problem where it lives. It provides $100 million for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants for nonprofit organizations for treatment services to intravenous drug users; 75 percent of these funds will go to areas with a high incidence of drug use and AIDS. The remaining 25 percent of funds will go to areas which have a low incidence of AIDS but a high inci\u00ad dence of drug use and therefore have the potential for widespread AIDS in\u00ad fection. In addition, $50 million is authorized for demonstration projects to reduce the incidence of AIDS in infants and to care for infants infected with AIDS. These funds could be used to provide prenatal care for women who are in\u00ad travenous drug users, services to par\u00ad ents of infected children, foster care for children with AIDS, counseling, education and testing services for women at risk for AIDS by virtue of drug use or sexual contact with drug users, and pregnant women infected with the AIDS virus. Lastly, $50 million is provided for grants for outreach and counseling programs to prevent intravenous drug use among minority groups. We have appropriated $14 million specifically for outreach AIDS education to mi\u00ad nority communities. Too little. The responsibility is clear: If we don't inform our citizens of the dan\u00ad gers of drug use in and of itself and its direct link to the spread of AIDS, we fail in our duty as public officials and as fellow human beings. I ask unanimous consent that an edi\u00ad torial in the January 23, 1988, New York Times entitled, \"Contain AIDS by Treating Addicts\" be printed in the RECORD. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and ask unanimous consent that the text be printed in the RECORD in full. There being no objection, the bill and the letter were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: s. 2014 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION J. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Intravenous Substance Abuse and AIDS Prevention Act of 1988\". SEC. 2. FINDINGS . Congress finds that: < 1) More than 38,000 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome <AIDS) have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control, and more than 270,000 such cases are expected to be reported by 1991. (2) Intravenous substance abusers are the second largest group in the United States that has AIDS. Of the cases of AIDS report\u00ad ed to the Centers for Disease Control, 17 percent are attributable to intravenous sub\u00ad stance abuse and such abuse was a risk factor in an additional 8 percent. (3) HIV <the virus causing AIDS) is trans\u00ad mitted among intravenous substance abus\u00ad ers through the use and sharing of needles, syringes, swabs, or other drug-related imple\u00ad ments that are contaminated with blood in\u00ad fected with HIV. < 4) HIV can be transmitted rapidly among intravenous substance abusers in a given ge\u00ad ographic area. Once a group of intravenous substance abusers becomes exposed to HIV, such abusers become the primary source for heterosexual transmission and perinatal transmission of HIV. January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 411 (5) A disproportionate number of cases of AIDS has occurred among members of mi\u00ad nority groups. More than 80 percent of such cases attributable to intravenous substance abuse have occurred among Blacks and His\u00ad panics and more than 90 percent of hetero\u00ad sexual and perinatal transmission AIDS cases related to such abuse have occurred among Blacks and Hispanics. (6) More than 50 percent of women in the United States who have AIDS developed the disease as a result of intravenous substance abuse. The second largest group of women who are at risk with respect to infection with HIV are women who are the sexual partners of intravenous substance abusers. (7) Most women with AIDS are in their child-bearing years, and women infected with HIV may transmit HIV to any of their children born subsequent to the mother's infection. In July 1987, the Centers for Dis\u00ad ease Control reported a cumulative total of 460 cases of AIDS among children under 5 years of age at the time of diagnosis. Ap\u00ad proximately 80 percent of children with AIDS who were infected through perinatal transmission were children of intravenous substance abusers. (8) Preventing or reducing the transmis\u00ad sion of HIV among intravenous substance abusers is essential with respect to prevent\u00ad ing or reducing the heterosexual and peri\u00ad natal transmission of HIV in the United States. <9> To reduce and prevent the spread of AIDS related to intravenous substance abuse, additional Federal leadership and support is urgently needed to expand treat\u00ad ment for intravenous substance abusers, to promote efforts to prevent pediatric AIDS and provide better care for infants with AIDS, and to establish effective school and community-based AIDS prevention pro\u00ad grams.

[From the New York Times, Jan. 23, 1988] CONTAIN AIDS BY TREATING ADDICTS New York City has long had to cope with crimes committed by its 200,000 heroin ad\u00ad dicts to finance drug purchases. Now they pose a new danger. By sharing the needles they use to shoot up, they spread AIDS. Mayor Koch deserves praise for recognizing the need to increase the city's drug treat\u00ad ment capacity. State officials, already taking steps to boost drug treatment, would earn more credit by finding the funds for the Mayor's plan. City officials recently made the alarming discovery that 53 percent of AIDS-related deaths in the city occur among intravenous drug abusers, a figure that far exceeds the percentage among gay and bisexual men. While the authorities despair of curbing the drug problem through law enforcement, treatment offers some hope. Most addicts eventually seek help; many more would if more help were freely available. But residential drug treatment programs offer fewer than 5,000 spaces in the city; ex\u00ad pansion would require heavy investments to acquire and staff new facilities. Methadone, a drug that blocks heroin craving and per\u00ad mits a normal life, offers more promise. It is now dispensed on an outpatient basis to about 29,000. Tens of thousands more could be accommodated in city hospitals and clin\u00ad ics with only modest increases in resources and an easing of legal requirements for counseling. Governor Cuomo recently approved state funding for 5,000 more methadone treat\u00ad ment \"slots.\" Mayor Koch now would extend hours of drug treatment centers to add an additional 3,000 addicts. He also would set up new drug treatment programs in city-owned buildings. He estimates an ini\u00ad tial added cost of $5 million and asks the state to come up with the money. That's appropriate. The state has paid for drug treatment in the city since the fiscal crisis of the 70's. And Mayor Koch offers more than just time and space. He pledges to face down any community objections. A prompt state response could hold him to that pledge and help contain the AIDS epi\u00ad demic.e By Mr. KENNEDY <for himself, Mr. SIMON, and Mr. MOYNI\u00ad HAN): S. 2015. A bill to amend the Immi\u00ad gration and Nationality Act to extend for 1 year the application period under the legalization program; ref erred to the Committee on the Judiciary. IMMIGRATION LEGALIZATION DEADLINE e Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am joining Senator SIMON, Senator CRANSTON. and Senator MOY\u00ad NIHAN in introducing legislation to extend the application period for the immigration legalization program for an additional 12 months. The applica\u00ad tion deadline set by statute is May 4, 1988, but all indications are that the program may well need some addition\u00ad al time for those eligible to apply. I propose this extension because I believe the program has been a success to date. Immigration officers in the field have exhibited extraordinary dedication to this program, along with the hard-working staff of churches and community groups around the country. And this dedication has over\u00ad come many of the monumental obsta\u00ad cles faced in getting the program un\u00ad derway. The result is that, to date, some 1.2 million persons have applied for legal\u00ad ization. But reports I have received suggest that there are still hurdles ahead\u00ad that there are still pockets of eligible illegal aliens who have not yet come forward for the amnesty. I believe even more can be done with this popu\u00ad lation with more time. Public education and information has been slow. Word of the program's achievements-that illegal aliens can apply without fear of deportation\u00ad has not yet adequately reached undoc\u00ad umented alien communities. And the Immigration Service has made some commendable midcourse adjustments in the regulations governing the pro\u00ad gram which need time to take full effect. Like many others, I personally have tried to contribute to the public educa\u00ad tion campaign by taping public service announcements for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. But now, fully 6 weeks after the taping, the Im\u00ad migration Service has only now pre\u00ad pared these announcements for airing. I am confident that this situation will be corrected soon, but nonetheless it illustrates the fact that public educa\u00ad tion of this magnitude is tedious and slow. The Immigration Reform and Con\u00ad trol Act envisioned a 6-month period of public education before the legaliza\u00ad tion program began. However, the first advertising for the amnesty followed, rather than preceded, the start of the amnesty. Mr. President, some of the blame for the slow start on public education lies with Congress. The immigration reform law was enacted in November 1986, after we had already wrapped up appropriations for the 1987 fiscal year. And we did not pass a supplemental appropriations bill until July 11-well after the legalization program had al\u00ad ready begun. On this point, Mr. President, we can afford to be generous. We can afford to give the program the benefit of the doubt. For the legalization program has proceeded to date at little or no expense to the taxpayer. As mandated by statute, it is funded through appli\u00ad cation fees. So, too, would an extended applica\u00ad tion period be self-funded. An extension would in no way alter the requirements for legalization. In other words, only those already quali\u00ad fied for legalization would benefit from extension of the application period. Hopefully, Mr. President, this legis\u00ad lation in the end will not be necessary. Hopefully, we can take stock of the le\u00ad galization program in a few weeks and find that the last-ditch public educa\u00ad tion efforts by the Immigration Serv\u00ad ice and church and community groups are paying off. But I believe it is important not to lay the groundwork for an extension of the application period, should it be necessary. Throughout the debate over the Im\u00ad migration Reform and Control Act we in this Chamber stated repeatedly that this legalization was a one-shot deal. If this is indeed to be a one-time effort, we need to be sure that the job is complete before we close the books on this humane and important pro\u00ad gram. I ask, Mr. President, that the text of my bill be printed at this point in the RECORD, as well as relevant articles from the press. There being no objection, the mate\u00ad rial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: S.2015 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. t-YEAR EXTENSION OF APPLICATION PERIOD UNDER THE LEGALIZATION PROGRAM.

[From the Boston Globe, Nov. 6, 1987] AMNESTY DEADLINE EXTENSION URGED <By Andrew Blake) Cardinal Bernard Law and Mayor Flynn, saying the federal amnesty program for aliens has been a failure, joined with the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Ad\u00ad vocacy Coalition yesterday in calling for an extension of the amnesty deadline next May. ---... --.:\"\"'. . -.. January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 413 \"The promise of the amnesty bill has not been fulfilled,\" Law said at a news confer\u00ad ence in the Haitian Multi-Service Center in Dorchester. Fear, he added, is keeping thou\u00ad sands from applying to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for legal status. \"The termination date should be extended for six months to fulfill the original int_~nt of the law. The bill took six months just to get off the ground,\" he explained. -- Congress last year established an amnesty period for aliens who have lived continuous\u00ad ly in this country since Jan. 1, 1982. The program expires on May 4, 1988. Law, Flynn and the coalition also called on Congress for new legislation to cover aliens who entered the country after the Jan 1, 1982 cutoff date. Although the INS estimates that 3.9 mil\u00ad lion undocumented aliens nationwide would benefit from the program, only 733,700 have applied. Locally, of about 60,000 who could achieve legal status, only 4,200 have applied, according to the immigrant coalition. \"This law was a reform that never hap\u00ad pened. It needs to be revised. It needs to be more open,\" said Flynn. Last month, Flynn established an outreach program for aliens regardless of their legal status. The pro\u00ad gram, the first of its kind in the nation, offers free medical and legal assistance. Earlier in the week, Kitty Dukakis, the governor's wife, urged illegal immigrants to apply for amnesty before the federal pro\u00ad gram expires in May. \"I realize that many of you have not ap\u00ad plied because you are afraid you will be de\u00ad ported or your family will be separated,\" she said Wednesday at a State House news conference. \"Please be aware that the infor\u00ad mation in your application cannot be used to deport you or your family.\" The state's Executive Office of Human Services, recognizing the growing popula\u00ad tion of legal and illegal immigrants in Mas\u00ad sachusetts, Wednesday expanded its refugee assistance program to include all immi\u00ad grants. The program primarily operates as a re\u00ad ferral service for aid such as legal advice, medical help and information on the amnes\u00ad ty offer for illegal aliens. In a 17-page report, the immigrant coali\u00ad tion found that aliens are not coming for\u00ad ward in large numbers because they fear the INS, have little knowledge about the amnes\u00ad ty program, are put off by excessive docu\u00ad mentation requirements and are concerned about being separated from other members of their family. Muriel Heiberger, executive director of the immigrant coalition, said the INS should liberalize its policies on the national level rather than follow the most strict in\u00ad terpretation of the amnesty law. Local INS offices, she added, have been courteous and cooperative but must follow policies dictated in Washington. Cardinal Law said some 3,500 people in the Archdiocese of Boston have asked about amnesty in recent months and some 130 ap\u00ad plicants, aided by the church, are being processed by the INS with \"another 100 in the pipeline.\" \"This does not begin to address the poten\u00ad tial number of people who could benefit from this bill,\" said Law. [From the New York Times, Nov. 3, 1987) DON'T LET THE AMNESTY DOOR SLAM Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act last year to make it harder for new illegal aliens to stay in this coun\u00ad try-and easier for old ones. The act provid-ed amnesty for aliens who had been here since at least 1982. But they were given only 12 months to apply, and even that time has been constricted. Fairness alone would impel Congress to keep the legalization door open an additional year, to May 4, 1989. The first goal was to deter illegal immi\u00ad grants by forbidding employers to hire them. Early evidence indicates that this goal is being met. The second goal was to bring out of the shadows hundreds of thou\u00ad sands of aliens who have lived in this coun\u00ad try illegally, and furtively, for years. This goal has been less well met. Many of the eligible aliens need more time to apply. The immigration and Naturaliza\u00ad tion Service did not start taking applications until May 5. So far, across the nation, less than a million illegals have applied for le\u00ad galized status; less than 50,000 are from the New York area. I.N.S. legalization offices are operating at 50 percent capacity in the West and only 20 percent in the East. If these rates continue, the program will legalize far fewer aliens than anticipated. Also, the approval process has been painful\u00ad ly slow. Only 75,000 amnesty requests have been granted. The most effective way to spur applications is to decide cases and let beneficiaries spread the word. It comes as no surprise that the Immigra\u00ad tion Service is still ironing the wrinkles out of this massive effort. There have been com\u00ad puter problems. National and regional infor\u00ad mation campaigns take time to develop. Outreach and networking have been inad\u00ad equate: it takes vast effort to penetrate thousands of aliens enclaves. In addition, clarification is needed for regulations about length of continuous residence, proof of em\u00ad ployment and policies regarding the protec\u00ad tion of family members. Aliens, some daunted by language, have hung back. Some don't understand the new law. Some fear, incorrectly, that even if one member of a family is eligible for amnesty, a spouse, parents or children could be deport\u00ad ed based on information on the application form. There must be time for accurate in\u00ad formation to be disseminated and digested, and for understanding and trust to develop. The Immigration Service is, after all, the agency that deports people. The Service has worked hard to make the amnesty program work. By extending legal\u00ad ization to May 4, 1989, Congress would insure that it does. [From the Dallas Times Herald, Dec. 20, 1987] GIVE AMNESTY MORE TIME No single law has had more impact on Texas during the past year than the Immi\u00ad gration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which provides amnesty for undocumented aliens who have lived in the United States continuously since Jan. 1, 1982. After years of wrangling, Congress passed the act to help control the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States. It was signed into law on Nov. 6, 1986. Implementation of the law required a deli\u00ad cate touch, but the responsible organization, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, has proceeded with a heavy hand. Still, the INS was the only government agency that could do the job. Suddenly, by the stroke of the presiden\u00ad tial pen, the INS was told to switch gears: from the agency that tenaciously hunted down illegals and deported them to a kind\u00ad hearted agency extending the olive branch of amnesty. Little wonder illegal aliens reacted with fear and suspicion. While the INS originally projected that about 4 million undocumented aliens would apply for amnesty, only about 1 million have surfaced. Yet the backlog on process\u00ad ing applications is huge-only about 15 per\u00ad cent of the applications have reached a final determination. And many experts feel the INS is letting other business go to deal with the amnesty overload. Granted, the INS was given a massive task in establishing 107 amnesty centers around the country and publicizing the new law. But imagine how overloaded the system would be if the expected number of illegals had applied. Distrust of the INS is not the only reason for the slow rate of amnesty applications. Lack of knowledge is another key factor. That's why the Dallas Times Herald has made this story a top priority-publishing information in Spanish as well as English. But in New York, for instance, where only about one-fifty of illegals believed to be there had applied for amnesty a year after the law was passed, efforts to publicize the new law have only recently begun to pick up steam. It's unfortunate that public service an\u00ad nouncements about amnesty are rarely shown on television during prime time. Still, given time, the public education pro\u00ad gram will be successful. Eventually, the word will spread and most illegals will un\u00ad derstand the opportunity they are being of\u00ad fered. That, however, is only part of the remedy. A Times Herald survey being published today indicates as many as 40 percent of those eligible for the legalization program are not applying-not because they aren't aware of the program, _but because they cannot meet the rigorous documentation re\u00ad quirements, fear the government and are afraid they will be separated from their families. The question of family unity is critical. Splitting up homes is hardly the American way, and illegal aliens must be treated by American standards. Legal or not, they are here. It demeans us to use totalitarian methods to cure our immigration problems. Congress has been unwilling to deal with the question of spouses and children. In Oc\u00ad tober the lawmakers voted down an amend\u00ad ment to extend amnesty to members of a qualified illegal's nuclear family. Last week, by one vote, House-Senate conferees killed a comparable amendment that was to be at\u00ad tached to the omnibus spending bill. Congress should reconsider. While split\u00ad ting up families may be justified on ab\u00ad struse, technical grounds, we find it distaste\u00ad ful to force people to trade their spouses and children for a chance at U.S. citizen\u00ad ship. The INS has said children won't be de\u00ad ported, which leaves spouses at risk. It seems the INS is having a difficult time adapting to its new role. The agency cannot resist playing hardball with illegals, with continuing raids and the recent directive that illegals better not be foolish enough to return home for Christmas without U.S. government permission-granted only for medical emergencies. That's a wonderful way to encourage people to come forward. Until either the INS or Congress finds the courage and compassion to assure illegals they can apply for amnesty without jeop\u00ad ardizing their families, the application rate will remain to low. 414 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 For immigration reform to work as planned, those eligible for amnesty must re\u00ad ceive it. Sanctions against employers who hire undocumented aliens, which had to be delayed because of the INS' faulty educa\u00ad tion program, are now rumbling into action. That's essential. It cuts off the primary at\u00ad traction of the United States to illegals\u00ad jobs. But there are problems with employer sanctions as well. Fraud has surfaced in many cases, especially in the Special Agri\u00ad culture Worker program. In Florida, for in\u00ad stance, as many as half of the 42,000 SAW applicants are suspected of using bogus doc\u00ad uments to back up their claims. The INS has also had a problem of dis\u00ad tricts using different guidelines. This cre\u00ad ates confusion and encourages illegals to \"shop\" for a district to suit their needs. Clearly, all illegals should meet the same standards. Guaging the effectiveness of immigration reform is difficult. Its ultimate goal is to bring U.S. borders under control. But the only quantitative tool available to measure its success is the number of apprehensions. Although border arrests have dropped by 30 percent since the law's implementation, there's no way to tell if this means fewer il\u00ad legals are crossing the border or if it is simply the result of less stringent enforce\u00ad ment. Given the numerous problems, it seems apparent that the May 4, 1988, deadline for amnesty applications must be extended. Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is ready to introduce a bill for a one-year extension, and Congress should approve it. Extending the arbitrary deadline only en\u00ad ables more qualified illegals to apply for am\u00ad nesty; it does not alter the qualification re\u00ad quirements. While some deadline must be kept to encourage illegals to act quickly, there is no reason not to extend it long enough for the INS and Congress to get their act together. [From the New York Times, Jan. 3, 1988] AMNESTY REQUESTS BY ALIENS DECLINE <By Peter Applebome) The number of aliens applying for legal status under the new immigration law has dropped steadily in recent months, raising serious questions about whether the pro\u00ad gram will reach its envisioned total of two million applicants before it ends May 4. Requests have been made that the one\u00ad year program be extended. The situation is also contributing to a debate about the ef\u00ad fectiveness of the immigration law and to calls for expanding the number of aliens eli\u00ad gible for amnesty. The law led to the largest amnesty program in history. MANY CASES NOT FULLY REVIEWED Thus far 1.2 million aliens have applied for legal status under the terms of the Im\u00ad migration Reform and Control Act, passed by Congress in November 1986. The number includes 240,000 seasonal agricultural work\u00ad ers and 904,000 aliens applying under the measure's provision for general amnesty. Fewer than a quarter of the applications have been fully reviewed, with 92 percent of the 1.2 million, or 249,000 people, approved to be issued cards that prove their lawful status. Applications have .been steadily declining since September. At that rate, they would fall below the Immigration and Naturaliza\u00ad tion Service's estimate of. 2 million and the total would not approach the 3.9 million figure that immigration officials used as the most optimistic estimate of potential appli\u00ad cants. Immigration officials attribute part of the decline to the holiday season. They also say they expect a deluge of applicants in the final month, noting that such programs elsewhere have seen a frantic rush as they wound up. While immigration officials oppose an ex\u00ad tension, they concede that the turnout con\u00ad tinues to be disappointing in some parts of the country, particularly Northeastern cities like New York and Boston. The slow pace and relatively low number of applications that have been reviewed have led to calls for extension. Representa\u00ad tive Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, introduced a bill in December calling for a one-year extension of the appli\u00ad cation period until May 1989. Members of Congress returning from the holiday recess will find the bill in committee. \"OUT OF THE SHADOWS\" \"The original intent of this program was to get the underclass out of the shadows and into the mainstream,\" said Muzaffar Chisti, who heads the legalization program for the International Ladies Garment Work\u00ad ers Union in New York. \"That is not hap\u00ad pening. We need more time.\" Immigration officials are not alone in op\u00ad posing extension. \"I think there's some\u00ad thing un-American about breaking a deal, and that's how people will see extending or expanding the program,\" said Patrick Burns, assistant director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a non\u00ad governmental, nonprofit organization that opposes efforts to liberalize immigration policies. \"Instead of being thanked for an act of beneficence,\" Mr. Burns went on, \"we're hearing the whining of the ungrateful. It's patently obvious this is a bottomless pit. They'll be damned lucky if amnesty isn't re\u00ad pealed altogether if they push this too far.\" The immigration law offers legal status or amnesty to illegal aliens who can prove they have resided continuously in the United States before Jan. 1, 1982. More liberal am\u00ad nesty provisions are included for seasonal agricultural workers. The amnesty program is part of an ap\u00ad proach that includes sanctions against em\u00ad ployers who hire illegal aliens and stepped\u00ad up Border Patrol and immigration service enforcement agents. The goal is to deter further illegal immigration while offering the protection of legal status to aliens who have lived here since the beginning of 1982. The amnesty program began slowly last May, amid criticism that the immigration service and counseling agencies set up to assist aliens were not prepared to take up their tasks at the beginning. But applica\u00ad tions picked up in July and August, culmi\u00ad nating in a record 64,574 in a week at the end of August. Aliens applying for jobs had to apply for amnesty by the end of August to be hired to work, but applications dipped below 40,000 a week in mid-September for the first time since the beginning of July. They have con\u00ad tinued to plunge since then, running below 30,000 a week since the beginning of Novem\u00ad ber. PROBLEMS ARE CROPPING UP Interviews with counseling agencies across the nation and reports by groups involved with the matter in Boston, San Franscisco and New York suggest that the program has a number of nagging problems: inadequate publicity, overly strict interpretation of some parts of the law, fear of the immigra\u00ad tion service and difficulties in documenting residence. Most people involved agree, however, that the biggest barrier to broader participation is a failure to clarify the status of family members who are ineligible for amnesty on their own. The issue has raised fears that families will be split up if one member is eli\u00ad gible for amnesty but a spouse or child is not. \"We've found that a lot of people are simply disqualifying themselves because of the family unity question,\" said Lavinia Limon, executive director of the Interna\u00ad tional Institute of Los Angeles. \"It's very clear the law is not resulting in the balanced approach that Congress had in mind.\" But Duke Austin, a spokesman for the Im\u00ad migration and Naturalization Service, said Congress had voted down proposals last year to clarify and broaden the family unity provisions. \"It's time to get that issue off the I.N.S.'s back,\" he said. \"It was brought up in Congress and voted down. They couldn't pass it. It's totally unfair to keep carping at I.N.S. when Congress has made its intend clear.'' HARDSHIP FOR THE HELPERS The decline in applicants has caused par\u00ad ticular hardship to the church and counsel\u00ad ing groups established to aid aliens in apply\u00ad ing. The low turnout, coupled with a lower than expected percentage of applicants using the counseling groups, have resulted in strains on the groups' resources. Many of the agencies, which receive fees for process\u00ad ing the applications, say they are losing money because they established costly oper\u00ad ations that are not bringing in as much income as had been projected. Many agen\u00ad cies have radically cut back their services. In Los Angeles, Catholic Charities has cut back from 14 legalization offices to 5. Ms. Lemon said her organization had been re\u00ad duced from 20 to 6 legalization workers. \"THREATS TO SMALL BUSINESSES\" There is a fear that the applicants still to come are the weakest cases that will need the most help, and that the agencies will not be prepared to offer it by the time the program ends. Most of the support for ex\u00ad tension is from groups that work with aliens. These groups range from organiza\u00ad tions working with Hispanic people to Irish organizations in Boston that help Irish aliens. Some business groups question the pro\u00ad gram's effectiveness. \"This law is not work\u00ad ing,\" said Tom Rowland, executive vice president of the 1,200-member Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington. \"There are jobs which are going unfilled. If we are going to get extra attention for em\u00ad ployer sanctions, then we want extra atten\u00ad tion for amnesty. We are saying this is not a temporary discomfort but a serious threat to small businesses.\" But beyond the issue of extension, which critics and proponents alike agree has a good chance of passage, is all assessment of the amnesty program as a whole. Amnesty was the most disputed element of the immigration legislation. Even those who wanted to see the applicant pool ex\u00ad panded by setting a later eligibility date admit they faced long \u00b7odds. But some famil\u00ad iar with the matter say that so many aliens entered the United States after. 1982-or do not apply under the current law-that the program will still leave a huge residue of il\u00ad legal aliens. That appears most likely in the January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 415 Northeast, where the turnout for applica\u00ad tions for legal status is the worst. In a report on the program in New York state, Dr. Josh DeWind, director of the Im\u00ad migration Research Program of the Center for the Social Sciences at Columbia Univer\u00ad sity, concluded: \"A major implication of the low legalization application rate for New York will be the continued existence of a large undocumented population, probably 80 percent of those currently here, which will be even more vulnerable to poverty and exploitation than in the past.\" In an interview, he said: \"The real prob\u00ad lem is not in the program's time period or in the public education program, but in the bill itself and who it restricts. I would advo\u00ad cate a real amnesty to a recent date.\" Groups like FAIR say extending or ex\u00ad panding the program would send out the worst possible signal. \"It would make a mockery of the immigra\u00ad tion law and encourage illegal immigration to the United States,\" said Mr. Burns, the assistant director of FAIR, \"There are a lot of folks in El Salvador and Mexico and Korea and the Philippines looking at us and asking, are we serious about enforcing the law? If we extend or expand it, not only are we telling them we're not serious-we're telling the 2 million people waiting to come here legally they were fools to believe in the American system.\" [From the New York Times, Jan. 6, 19881 THE MASSES: STILL HUDDLED (By Jay Mazur> A union official recently overheard a Hai\u00ad tian-born worker listening to a radio station broadcasting in Creole. Every word was in the man's native tongue, with one glaring exception: The Immigration and Naturaliza\u00ad tion Service's announcement about the am\u00ad nesty program for undocumented workers was in English! This illustrates one reason why, with four months to go in the yearlong amnesty period, perhaps one-quarter of the estimat\u00ad ed 3.9 million \"illegal aliens\" eligible for am\u00ad nesty have come forward. In the New York area alone, 80 percent or more of those eligi\u00ad ble have failed to apply. If the program falters, the United States risks perpetuating a threat to its social and economic stability as serious as any external menace: a vast underground society populat\u00ad ed by millions of men, women and children who live furtively and fearfully, often at the mercy of unscrupulous employers. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 was a carefully crafted compromise. It sought to control illegal immigration by penalizing employers who hire \"illegals.\" It also offered legal residency to some, though by no means all. undocumented workers al\u00ad ready in America. Unfortunately , the amnesty provisions of the act are very restrictive. Only immi\u00ad grants who arrived before Jan. 1, 1982, are eligible, insuring that an enormous pool of immigrants will remain ineligible and con\u00ad stantly subject to deportation. Even those eligible have only a year to apply and to complete an extremely difficult process of documenting their claims. Problems with the law have been obvious since it took effect. People who came to America legally before Jan. 1, 1982, but later became illegal-say, because their tem\u00ad porary visas expired-are excluded from the amnesty. Eligible immigrants fear coming forward because their spouses or children are ineligible. Moreover, the extensive documentation required by the Immigration and Natural\u00ad ization Service to prove residency is over\u00ad whelming. For people who have gone to great lengths to conceal their true status, proving it becomes a formidable obstacle. Most import, I.N.S. publicity efforts have been inadequate: The message has not gotten through to millons of eligible people. And now to overcome the distrust of people accustomed to avoiding the I.N.S.? To be sure, the I.N.S. has mounted a sig\u00ad nificant amnesty effort. Some 1.2 million people have entered the legalization process and most of them are likely to become resi\u00ad dent legal aliens, eligible for citizenship. But the immigrants who have applied generally are those who are better educated, speak English well or work in unionized industries. The three million who have not applied\u00ad the large majority-tend to be the less edu\u00ad cated, speak little or no English and work in marginal jobs. Thus. the amnesty program has not and will not reach the most vulnera\u00ad ble and exploited. If the major immigration reform of this generation is to work, it must be liberalized. Unwisely, Congress failed to include in the law a guarantee of family unity, and should correct this mistake. Meanwhile, the I.N.S. can insure that no family will be separated as a result of one family member's applying for amnesty . First, the amnesty period must be ex\u00ad tended for a year; three or four million people cannot be legalized in a few months. Second, the I.N.S. must use the longer period to launch an effective information campaign: Immigrants should learn about amnesty through the ethnic media and in their own languages. To help establish trust. the I.N.S. should spotlight the work of trade union, religious and community or\u00ad ganizations that offer help. The employers of undocumented workers should play a larger role in educating eligible immigrants. Third, the I.N.S. must simplify its burden\u00ad some documentation requirement and other rules. Congress declared an amnesty, and the I.N.S.'s job is to find eligible workers and legalize them, not to make legalization difficult. The fears of some members of Congress that new immigrants would overburden public services are unfounded . Congress should extend the 1982 cutoff date and make a larger number of undocumented workers eligible for amnesty.e Mr. SIMON. I wish to join Senator KENNEDY, chairman of the Immigra\u00ad tion Subcommittee, in sponsoring this measure to extend the time period to apply for legalization . This bill, when enacted, will go far to ensure congres\u00ad sional intent that aliens who meet the eligibility standards for amnesty be permitted to apply. As a member of the Immigration Subcommittee, I have been very con\u00ad cerned with the success of the legaliza\u00ad tion program. To be sure, uncertainty regarding new administrative require\u00ad ments for applying for legalization were to be expected, particularly in an undertaking as large as this one. The task of overcoming the historic fear and mistrust of the Immigration Serv\u00ad ice among the undocumented popula\u00ad tion just 6 months after the new law passed would have been difficult in the best of circumstances. So it is not to be critical of the INS or to point a finger at the agency when I cosponsor this bill. I support this bill simply in order for the law to have full opportu\u00ad nity and time to work. The Immigration Service originally estimated that at least 200,000 aliens could be legalized in the Chicago area. As of January 12, however, only 65,323 applications had been accepted. In other words, fewer than one-third of those expected to be eligible have ap\u00ad plied after two-thirds of the time to apply has elapsed. Worse, the trend in the numbers of applications-both in Chicago and nationwide-indicates a steady drop each month. Applications for all of November and December in Chicago were fewer than for the month of September. Nationally, the November figures were slightly more than half of the applications received in August. Most of these applications are still under consideration and have not been finally approved. The INS can rightfully be proud of making pos\u00ad sible the new futures awaiting these individuals. But we can do better. Our bill will give the Immigration Service more time to publicize the pro\u00ad gram-its requirements and its bene\u00ad fits-and will enable the community agencies, religious institutions and other interested parties to work with the INS to increase the number of par\u00ad ticipants in the legalization program. Legalization under the Immigration Reform and Control Act is a once in a lifetime proposition. Let's make sure that all of those who meet the eligibil\u00ad ity standards set down by Congress and the INS have the full opportunity to take part in America. Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of the Archdiocese of Chicago has recently called upon Congress to extend the le\u00ad galization period and make other changes in the immigration law. I com\u00ad mend this statement to my colleagues and ask that it be entered into the RECORD with an article from the Chi\u00ad cago Tribune. There being no objection, the mate\u00ad rial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: STATEMENT OF JOSEPH CARDINAL BERNARDIN ON LEGALIZATION ISSUES When the Immigration and Reform Act of November 1986 was passed, I shared the joy of many immigrants in Chicago. This was to be the opportunity of a lifetime, a chance to realize their hopes and dreams of becoming part of this country which they had come to call home. Now, a year later, I hear their fears and concerns, for this law is funda\u00ad mentally flawed and simply is not doing what it was established to do. First: I would add my voice to those who complain that the law is indifferent to keep\u00ad ing a family together. Under the present regulations, for example , a father who came here in December , 1981, could apply for temporary residency and then permanent residency; but his wife and children who may have come a year later could be deport\u00ad ed. There are others who could be excluded 416 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 because their children are developmentally or physically disabled. Have we created a law that allows for the destruction of the family? Second: The amount of documentation re\u00ad quired to make application should be great\u00ad ly simplified. For example, proof of living here seems to duplicate proof of working here. Because of the fear of being appre\u00ad hended, many have destroyed the very evi\u00ad dence that they now need. As the son of an immigrant couple, I know how confusing the laws and regulations of a new country can be. Third: To qualify for legalization at the present time, one must prove residency in the United States since January 1, 1982, and applications must be filed before May 5, 1988. These dates should be changed be\u00ad cause they contradict the intent of the law. To insist on a date of January 1, 1982 ig\u00ad nores the many people who have come to this country because of political and eco\u00ad nomic problems in Europe and Latin Amer\u00ad ica during the past 5 years. I would urge an extension of the present law to lengthen the application period. Furthermore, I believe that the law should be amended to include all who have been here since November 6, 1986. Those who minister to immigrants experi\u00ad ence the hopes and fears of their people most directly. I am aware that a number of them, specifically the members of the His\u00ad panic Caucus, are addressing this matter in a public way, I share their concern. For my part, while continuing our efforts to assist those who currently qualify for legal status, we must seek to correct the fundamental flaws in the legislation. Moreover, I recom\u00ad mit the Archdiocese of Chicago to work with all those who bring their fears, needs and hopes to the Church. I believe we can effectively appeal for changes in this law and in the ways it is being interpreted and enforced. Further, I believe we must work within democratic processes to change the law, so that as many people as possible will truly benefit from the legalization process. [From the Chicago Tribune, Jan. 19, 1988] GROUPS URGE EASIER, BROADER AMNESTY FOR ALIENS <By Constanza Montana) The number of immigrants applying for legalization has been steadily declining in recent months, and state, city and private agencies are pushing for fundamental changes in the new immigration law to make amnesty easier. Two-thirds of the way into the one-year legalization program, the number of immi\u00ad grants who have applied is far below the original expectation of the U.S. Immigra\u00ad tion and Naturalization Service. As of Jan. 12, only 65,323 people have ap\u00ad plied for legalization at the four Chicago of\u00ad fices, far below the 200,000 to 300,000 ini\u00ad tially estimated to be eligible. And 1.2 mil\u00ad lion have applied nationally, below the 2 million to 4 million estimated to be eligible. The numbers of immigrants applying also have dropped steadily in recent months. At a recent hearing, the Illinois Human Rights Commission, the Mayor's Advisory Commission on Latino Affairs and several private advocacy groups attacked the law and offered recommendations to amend it. These recommendations include allowing illegal immigrants who have entered the country before Nov. 6, 1986, to apply; ex\u00ad tending the application period to May 4, 1989; expanding the law to include ineligible family members of qualified immigrants; pe\u00ad nalizing employers who fail to sign employ\u00ad ment verification forms; standardizing and easing application procedures; and stength\u00ad ening the public information campaign. Under the Immigration Reform and Con\u00ad trol Act of 1986, immigrants who can prove they have lived in the United States since Jan. 1, 1982, without prolonged absences, felony criminal activity or dependence on government cash assistance are eligible to apply for legalization until May 4. Under the law, those who entered the country after Jan. 1, 1982, are not eligible. The Chicago Committee on Immigrant Protection, a coalition of 40 local organiza\u00ad tions serving immigrant needs, called for ex\u00ad tending legalization to immigrants who have entered this country illegally before Nov. 6, 1986, the date the law was enacted, and for prolonging the application period by one year. \"The burdensomeness of [the law], need\u00ad ing fi\u00ad nancial responsibility and trouble-free exist\u00ad in the USA, is overwhelming,\" said Sister Bernardine Karge, an attorney with the Archdiocese of Chicago Catholic Char\u00ad ities legalization program, at a hearing sponsored by the Governor's Inter-depart\u00ad ment Task Force on Immigration and the Il\u00ad linois House Speaker's Task Force on Immi\u00ad gration Reform. \"By extending the qualifying entry date beyond Jan. 1, 1982, the family unity issue ... and many thorny aspects of document retrieval ... will be more easily defused,\" she said. \"By expanding the application date beyond May 4, 1988, for at least one more year . . . more eligible aliens will be able to apply.\" But last Wednesday, Commissioner Alan Nelson of the Immigration and Naturaliza\u00ad tion Service said he was opposed to extend\u00ad ing the amnesty deadline, and he warned that legislation and even proposals to pro\u00ad long the year-long program could cause con\u00ad fusion among illegal immigrants and make them miss the application deadline. A.D. Moyer, director of the INS Chicago district, said he would consider any extensions \"bad government.\" Sister Karge and others contend that the difficulty of documenting residence in this country, fear that family members who do not qualify for the law will be deported and a poor public information campaign are re\u00ad sponsible for the lower-than-expected number of immigrants applying for legaliza\u00ad tion in Chicago and nationwide. But Moyer said he expects the INS legal\u00ad ization offices \"to be flooded the last 30 days\" of the application period. He conced\u00ad ed that the difficulty of gathering documen\u00ad tation and \"apathy\" are keeping most of the eligible immigrants from applying. \"The majority who haven't applied and are eligible appear to be the group that can't get sufficient documentation,\" he said. \"I would be petitioning the commissioner to get an extension of time, but these individ\u00ad uals haven't been able to get their paper\u00ad work together in eight months,\" often be\u00ad cause they cannot locate their former em\u00ad ployer or that person is unwilling to sign a work verification form, which is necessary to apply for legalization, he said. David Strauss, executive director of the Il\u00ad linois Human Rights Commission, said Con\u00ad gress could amend the immigration law \"by making it a violation to fail to fill out a veri\u00ad fication letter.\" Moyer also said that 6 to 10 percent of eli\u00ad gible immigrants have not applied \"because of concerns of family unity.\" The INS's \"family fairness\" policy states that if both parents qualify for legalization, the INS will not deport children if they are apprehend\u00ad ed. Moyer said he would release this week a \"format to start dealing with the spouses and minor children of legal applicants.\" But that position is small comfort to im\u00ad migrants still suspicious of the process, said Esther Nieves, executive director of the Mayor's Advisory Commission on Latino Af\u00ad fairs. She said Congress must be pressured to pass a law that addresses the needs of families with only one member qualified to apply for legalization, she said. David Marzahl, coordinator of the Chica\u00ad go Committee on Immigrant Protection, said the low application figures \"clearly point to the failure of the amnesty program to bring out of the shadows the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who have been living underground for years.\" Marzahl and other immigrant advocates say the INS's inconsistent policies hinder the program. For example, the INS's Belmont and Pu\u00ad laski legalization offices require photo iden\u00ad tifications in each application, though the regulations stipulate that a birth certificate should be sufficient, said Cecelia Munoz, di\u00ad rector of the Catholic Charities' legalization program. Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend from Massachusetts [Mr. KENNEDY] in introducing this bill today that will extend the application period for le\u00ad galization under the new immigration law for 1 year. The extension of the application period until May 4, 1989, is a reasonable and necessary step to assure that all undocumented persons who have arrived in the United States prior to January 1, 1982, will have the opportunity to legalize their status. My colleagues may recall that on the first year anniversary of the Presi\u00ad dent's signing of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 into law I expressed my concern that the legalization program may not achieve the goals we intended because many people who appear to qualify for legal\u00ad ization are not coming forward to apply. For a State such as California, where an estimated half of the undoc\u00ad umented population of the country reside, the failure of the legalization programs-for persons who have ar\u00ad rived in the United States prior to Jan\u00ad uary 1, 1982, as well as for farmwork\u00ad ers who could apply for legalization under the Special Agricultural Work\u00ad ers Program-could have a significant negative social and economic impact. In my remarks on November 6, 1987, I specifically noted that many undocu\u00ad mented immigrants who appear to meet the legalization criteria are not applying for legalization because they fear that their ineligible family mem\u00ad bers will be deported. I pointed out\u00ad that the policy announced by the Im\u00ad migration and Naturalization Service [INS] last fall to address this situation did not resolve the problem because it did not provide adequate assurance that families will not be separated. Al-January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 417 though I joined eight other Senators in urging INS to change its policy, as of this date INS has refused to do so. In addition to the fear of family sep\u00ad aration, I have been informed that many apparently eligible individuals are not applying for legalization be\u00ad cause of the cost of the application process, the difficulty of gathering the necessary documentation, and the lack of information regarding the legaliza\u00ad tion program. A number of groups and individuals have complained that the legalization program got off to a slow start, and that many undocumented people are still confused as to whether they qualify for legalization. The fact that INS has changed and modified its regulations pertaining to eligibility for legalization has contributed to this confusion. I am especially concerned about the failure of the Asian Pacific community to participate in the legalization pro\u00ad gram. In an editorial which appeared in the Los Angeles Times, November 17, 1987, entitled \"Circumstances of Asians Call for Amnesty Extension,\" the author pointed out that: It is estimated that in Southern California alone, there are 100,000 to 150,000 undocu\u00ad mented Asian Pacifies. Yet in the INS' entire Western Region <Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada) only 29,000 Asian Pacif\u00ad ic applications have been filed. The author goes on to make a point which has been stressed to me over and over again by State government agencies, church organizations, unions, employers, and the undocu\u00ad mented themselves: The INS has already reached the easy-to\u00ad reach immigrant; it is the underground im\u00ad migrants-those suffering the most-who have yet to apply. It takes time and effort to get the word out to these people. Simply to suggest that a year has passed since the act was passed does not satisfactorily re\u00ad solve problems of communication, policy and documentation. Mr. President, I ask that the full text of this editorial be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my re\u00ad marks. In sum, Mr. President, I believe that there is ample evidence indicating that an extension of the application period for the legalization program is war\u00ad ranted. I am not persuaded by the ar\u00ad guments put forth by the INS that the legalization program is successful given the number of applications it has received to date. While INS hopes to receive 2 million applications by the May 4, 1988, deadline, there is no guar\u00ad antee that in fact that number of ap\u00ad plications will be filed. Moreover, there are some estimates that twice that number could qualify for legaliza\u00ad tion if the program were to be admin\u00ad istered in a manner consistent with congressional intent. When we passed the immigration reform legislation in 1986 we realized that the task of legalizing this coun\u00ad try's undocumented population was 19--059 0-89-14 (Pt. 1) indeed monumental. We must not leave that task half done. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 12, 1987] CIRCUMSTANCES OF ASIANS CALL FOR AMNESTY EXTENSION <By Stewart Kwoh and Andrew Cushnir) The U.S. immigration amnesty program, designed to bring into the mainstream mil\u00ad lions of undocumented immigrants who have been living in the shadows of Ameri\u00ad can society, needs to be given a fair chance to fulfill its purpose. Without an extension of the May 4, 1988, deadline, hundreds of thousands of those eligible may remain for\u00ad ever trapped in our underground culture and economy. A year ago, President Reagan signed this significant immigration reform legislation\u00ad The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. One provision of the complicated and controversial act created the amnesty program. To qualify for the program, an individual must satisfy a long list of requirements. Most important, he must be able to prove that he has continuously lived in this coun\u00ad try illegally for at least five years. Qualified people have just one year-from May 5, 1987, to May 4, 1988-to compile the neces\u00ad sary documentation and apply. The first problem is that many eligible ap\u00ad plicants, conditioned for years to fear the Immigration and Naturalization Service, are reluctant to come out of hiding and trust the INS. Also, INS officials are still revising eligibil\u00ad ity regulations. But many people, previously rejected by the INS under the old rules, are unaware of favorable changes. There has not been enough publicity to let them know that they are now eligible. Although we generally think of the un\u00ad documented Latinos when we think of the amnesty program, the undocumented Asian Pacific community, which is having a par\u00ad ticularly difficult time with the program, il\u00ad lustrates how much work still needs to be done. The INS' appointment of three Asian Americans this week to help set up outreach programs is a step in the right direction. To immigrants who speak little or no Eng\u00ad lish and are fearful of government officials, coming forward to apply for amnesty is an intimidating process. Consequently, relative\u00ad ly few Asian Pacifies have applied. It is esti\u00ad mated that in Southern California alone, there are 100,000-150,000 undocumented Asian Pacifies. Yet in the INS' entire West\u00ad ern Region <Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada) only 29,000 Asian Pacific applica\u00ad tions have been filed. In a typical example, an eligible Asian woman decided not to file a legalization ap\u00ad plication because her husband and children did not qualify. She feared that the infor\u00ad mation in her application would be used against her family and lead to their deporta\u00ad tion. She did not understand that all appli\u00ad cations are confidential. The INS recently increased its focus on this outreach issue and has taken some con\u00ad structive steps. Through several meetings the agency expanded the role of the Asian Pacific Liaison Committee to solicit the help of community leaders in publicizing the pro\u00ad gram, and last month application docu\u00ad ments were released in the eight major Asian Pacific languages. Given time, these initiatives and current intensive outreach campaigns by several Asian Pacific Ameri\u00ad can organizations will help bridge this com-munication and trust gap, but they are ex\u00ad panding when the amnesty year is half fin\u00ad ished. Initially, the INS estimated that it would process up to 4 million to 5 million amnesty applications nationally. Now they say they hope to reach 2 million people. Many agen\u00ad cies and community organizations believe that the original figures were accruate. If so, what will happen to the other 3 mil\u00ad lion people? They will not simply go away. The undocumented are here because they are independent, creative, ambitious and sometimes, in the case of refugees fleeing war-torn countries, desperate people. Those who qualify for amnesty deserve a chance to participate in the program. Despite all of these problems, the INS and Congress seem unwilling to extend the am\u00ad nesty deadline. It is argued, based on new figures showing a decline in amnesty appli\u00ad cations, that no more time is needed. Not true-the decline is simply a product of the law of diminishing return. The INS has al\u00ad ready reached the easy-to-reach immigrant; it is the underground immigrants-those suffering the most-who have yet to apply. It takes time and effort to get the word out to these people. Simply to suggest that a year has passed since the act was passed does not satisfactorily resolve problems of communication, policy and documentation. By extending the amnesty program just six months we can integrate hundreds of thou\u00ad sands cif additional eligible immigrants into American society. As a nation we have a choice to make. Do we resign ourselves to the creation of two classes of Americans-the unprotected citi\u00ad zen and the vulnerable undocumented immi\u00ad grant? Or do we extend the amnesty pro\u00ad gram and work toward a humane, fair and consistent policy that offers the promise of America to all responsible, long-time resi\u00ad dents who live within our borders? The choice is clear and Congress should act im\u00ad mediately to extend the amnesty program. By Mr. D'AMATO: S. 2016. A bill to impose a legislative ban on and require a rulemaking with respect to, certain all-terrain vehicles, and for other purposes; to the Com\u00ad mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. EMERGENCY ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLE SAFETY ACT Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Emergency All-Ter\u00ad rain Vehicle Safety Act. The December 30, 1987, settlement of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's imminent hazard case against the manufacturers of all-ter\u00ad rain vehicles [A TV's] is likely to become final by February 13, 1988. Today I testified before the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Con\u00ad sumer, and Monetary Affairs to ex\u00ad press my strong opposition to the set\u00ad tlement. The bill I am introducing today will correct the glaring inad\u00ad equacies contained in the settlement. Since 1982, ATV accidents have claimed at least 59 lives in New York State-we are second only to Califor\u00ad nia. Nationwide, ATV's have been re\u00ad sponsible for more than 900 deaths and over 330,000 serious injuries re-418 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 quiring hospital emergency room treatment. If I could believe that the Federal Government's ATV settlement would help to reduce the imminent hazard that ATV's pose to consumers, espe\u00ad cially to children, I would not be intro\u00ad ducing this bill today. If I were con\u00ad vinced that the CPSC and the Justice Department had fought a tough legal battle or had engaged in serious nego\u00ad tiations to achieve the greatest degree of consumer protection possible with\u00ad out years of litigation, I would not in\u00ad troduce this bill. Unfortunately, this settlement is a sham and the American public deserve to know it. It is nothing less than a bill of rights for the Japanese-based ATV manufacturers and an insult to Ameri\u00ad can consumers. This settlement is an embarrassment to the American public. It is the worst example of how a government agency has acted on behalf of the foreign Jap\u00ad anese manufacturers at the expense of American consumers. The manufac\u00ad turers have waltzed away with a pack\u00ad age that will provide them with litiga\u00ad tion insurance for the years of individ\u00ad ual court battles that are ahead. There were no real negotiations here. The settlement is virtually identical to the first offer made by the Japanese manufacturers in a letter to CPSC on December 3, 1987. In fact, the settle\u00ad ment contains less than what the American ATV manufacturer, Polaris of Minnesota, offered in a separate letter on that same date. It is a stun\u00ad ning victory for the Japanese-based ATV companies. Let's look at the facts. The settle\u00ad ment does not include consumer re\u00ad funds for three-wheeled ATV's and the adult-sized A TV's bought for use by children under age 16. It falls far short of the relief authorized by the Commission in December of 1986, and the complaint filed by the Justice De\u00ad partment last December. It does not even match what the only American ATV manufacturer has offered. Con\u00ad sumer refunds are the only effective means for keeping children off adult\u00ad sized A TV's: 90 percent of A TV riders aged 12 to 15 ride adult size ATV's. Nearly half of the ATV injuries and deaths are to children under age 16. This story settlement does nothing for the thousands of American chil\u00ad dren who are going to be killed and maimed by these products. CPSC's own data show that if there were only four-wheeled ATV's operated by driv\u00ad ers age 16 or older, this could save nearly 100 lives and 60,000 injuries per year. The consumer refunds, dropped from this settlement, would have gone a long way toward making this happen. Chairman Scanlon has indicated his concerns that refunds wouldn't have worked because used ATV's returned for refunds could still be sold to un-trained purchasers. Nothing in this settlement prevents the sale of used ATV's. Supporters of the settlement also claim that if after 1 year this set\u00ad tlement does not reduce ATV deaths and injuries that CPSC can go back and seek refunds. That will be a monu\u00ad mental job. The settlement requires that a \"go back\" be based on new and substantial evidence-if the current statistics of 20 ATV deaths per month do not increase, or even if they do, is this \"new\" evidence? Industry is likely to argue that proof of a product defect is that type of new evidence required to reopen the case. Dropping the demand for refunds is outrageous when the only major American manufacturer-Polaris-had agreed to provide refunds. Here we have an American company willing to take responsible action, while the Jap\u00ad anese-based companies whose ATV's constitute the lion's share of products in the United States are unwilling to do this. Perhaps more shocking is that the Federal agencies charged with pro\u00ad tecting consumers were unwilling to fight for them. Instead of assuming responsibility for tackling the enormous concerns raised by A TV death and injury data the CPSC majority-with the excep\u00ad tion of Commissioner Anne Graham\u00ad shirked their duty by running to give the industry the keys to the store. This settlement is a bigger giveaway than the Publishers' Clearinghouse sweepstakes. Def enders of this settlement claim that refunds are too expensive. Really? Each year, since 1985, we have spent over a billion dollars on A TV deaths and injuries. Last year A TV companies sold about 500,000 new ATV's at an average price of $2,000. Instead of refunds, Chairman Scanlon says that \"hardheaded negotiations\" resulted in a settlement that is in the public interest. What did the public get? Let's look. The settlement requires consumers to sign what amounts to a manufac\u00ad turers' and dealers' liability release form when they purchase an ATV. It provides for a watered-down form notice from the manufacturers to deal\u00ad ers and consumers that does not em\u00ad phasize the hazards to kids. It includes a public awareness campaign that is not spelled out to indicate if it will ap\u00ad proach the type of expensive, world series prime-time hype that induced millions of consumers to buy ATV's for family fun. 1 Training courses pro\u00ad vided for are unlikely to attract suffi\u00ad cient numbers of riders because no in\u00ad centives are provided to induce them to take the courses. And the crowning achievement of the settlement-the \"stop sale\" of three wheelers-is not a stop sale, it is at best a brief moratori\u00ad um. One day after the settlement was filed, American Honda stated that it would store the three wheelers re-turned by dealers and expected to be able to sell them again in several months. Supporters of the settlement say that it represents the only alternative to years of protracted, costly litigation and that it is the most protection that could be obtained for the least amount of time and money. This is nonsense. This settlement is not the most for the least, but the least for the longest amount of time. The CPSC has been analyzing the ATV problem since 1984. Since that time there have been 20 deaths and 7,000 injuries per month on ATV's. CPSC's imminent hazard case lan\u00ad guished at Justice from February 1987 until December 11, 1987 when Justice declared that it was prepared to imme\u00ad diately file suit seeking all the relief authorized by the CPSC including con\u00ad sumer refunds. Scanlon, through such actions as removing the two lead attor\u00ad neys familiar with the case, made sure that there would be no quick move\u00ad ment on the litigation until a deal suit\u00ad able to the industry could be worked out. Meanwhile, the ATV industry continued to push their ATV invento\u00ad ries on unsuspecting consumers. The emergency all-terrain vehicle safety bill bans future sales of three\u00ad wheeled ATV's and designed for use by children under age 16. It provides for reasonable refunds to consumers who purchased three-wheeled ATV's, adult-sized ATV's intended for use by children under age 16, and child-size ATV's. Free hands-on training courses coupled with incentives to encourage A TV owners actually to take the courses are required, as well as, an ex\u00ad tensive public notice and warning cam\u00ad paign. Moreover, CPSC is barred from requiring consumers to execute writ\u00ad ten promises as to their use of A TV's. If CPSC failes to issue an emergency rule within 60 days to implement the refunds, notice, warning, and training, then the sale of all A TV's would be prohibited. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this urgent safety legisla\u00ad tion.e By Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. SIMPSON, Mr. STEVENS, Mr. McCAIN, Mr. HOLLINGS, Mr. BENTSEN, Mr. SHELBY, and Mr. STENNIS) (by request): S.J. Res. 243. Joint resolution relat\u00ad ing to Central America pursuant to House Joint Resolution 395 of the lOOth Congress; to the Committee on Foreign Relations. CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF PROPOSED AID TO NICARAGUAN DEMOCRATIC RESISTANCE Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today, at President Reagan's request and be\u00ad cause of my own strong conviction that this is the right thing to do, I am introducing the joint resolution of congressional approval for the Presi-~....,..~-...,.\u00b7--~-~?-- 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 419 dent's proposed aid package to the freedom fighters in Nicaragua-the so\u00ad called Contras. This joint resolution will enjoy the expedited procedures laid out in House Joint Resolution 395-the fiscal year 1988 continuing resolution. The Senate will vote on this matter Febru\u00ad ary 4. It is a crucial vote; a vote we must win, to preserve the chance for real peace, and true democracy, in Central America. It is a vote we cannot duck-no matter how many \"fig leafs\" and \"smokescreens\" the House Democratic leadership dream up. The cry we hear today is: Give peace a chance. The problem is: The only place we hear that cry is in Washing\u00ad ton. But this war didn't start in Wash\u00ad ington; isn't being sustained from Washington; and is not going to be ended in Washington. I don't know of anyone in Washing\u00ad ton who isn't ready to give peace a chance. Ronald Reagan is-as he has made clear, in every word and deed since the Arias plan was signed in Guatemala City. Ronald Reagan is giving peace a chance. But what about Mikhail Gorbachev? What about Fidel Castro? What about Daniel Ortega? Are we demanding that they, too, give peace a chance? Are we demanding that Gorbachev and Castro stop sending military aid and military advisers to the Sandinis\u00ad tas? Are we demanding that Ortega refuse such aid? The excuse we hear is: Well, Ortega needs the aid, because we support the Contras. Hogwash. I'll make this deal today, with any opponent of Contra aid who wants to make it: Have the CIA report to Con\u00ad gress on Communist bloc military aid to the Sandinistas; and the American aid to the Contras directly to what's in that report-for every dollar the Com\u00ad munist bloc gives to the Sandinistas in military aid, we'll give just a quarter to the Contras. So if Gorbachev and Castro want us to end Contra aid, they can just cut off Managua. If Ortega wants us to end Contra aid, he can just refuse the largesse of his Communist mentors\u00ad go cold turkey. Let's just see if Gorbachev, and Castro, and Ortega are willing to give peace a chance. Or how about this? I keep hearing Contra aid opponents demanding that we \"heed the voices of the Presidents of the Central American democracies.\" A good suggestion. Why don't we ask each of those Presidents to send to us in the Congress a confidential, two\u00ad sentence report. The first sentence would be: \"The Sandinistas are-or are not-supporting an insurgency and terrorism in my country.\" The second sentence would be: \"The Sandinistas are-or are not-in full, repeat full, compliance with the Guatemala City accords.\" That's all we need-those reports every month. And the first month we get four reports saying: \"The Sandinis\u00ad tas are not supporting an insurgency and terrorism, and are in full compli\u00ad ance with the peace accords\"-the first month we get that report from each of the four Presidents: We cut off military aid to the Contras. So if Ortega wants to stop our mili\u00ad tary aid, all he has to do is stop his aid to the insurgents; and stop his oppres\u00ad sion of the Nicaraguan people. Let's see if Daniel Ortega and his Sandinista cronies are really interest\u00ad ed in giving peace a chance. There won't be any takers for either of these offers. And I'll tell you why. Because opponents of Contra aid know-if we make our decision on Contra aid on the basis of the real in\u00ad tentions, actions, and good faith of the Communists in Managua, Havana, and Moscow-if that's what determines our decision, then Contra aid will contin\u00ad ue. Mr. President, why don't we demand of Gorbachev and Castro and Ortega at least as much as we demand of our\u00ad selves? Why do we insist on always putting the monkey on our own back? The suggestion that the United States is perpetuating a war in Nicara\u00ad gua is hogwash. Sandinista oppression is perpetuat\u00ad ing the war. Sandinista aggression against its neighbors is perpetuating the war. Sandinista noncompliance with the Guatemala City accord is perpetuating the war. Soviet and Cuban militarization of Nicaragua is perpetuating the war. Mr. President, let's give peace a chance. But let's make sure Gorbachev, and Castro, and Ortega are willing to give it a chance, too. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the joint resolution be print\u00ad ed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: S.J.

Res. 244. Joint resolution to des\u00ad ignate the month of April 1988, as \"National Know Your Cholesterol Month;\" ref erred to the Committee on the Judiciary. NATIONAL KNOW YOUR CHOLESTEROL MONTH Mr. EXON. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of myself, my colleague from Nebraska, Senator KARNES and more than 50 other Members of the Senate to introduce a resolution desig\u00ad nating the month of April 1988, as \"Know Your Cholesterol Month.\" As many of you may recall, a resolu\u00ad tion of this nature was the last legisla\u00ad tive act of my very good friend and colleague, Senator Ed Zorinsky. I am introducing this resolution in memory of Ed. I know he would want this to be passed. Health, most particularly, car\u00ad diovascular health, was very impor\u00ad tant to Ed. It is an irrefutable fact that choles\u00ad terol is a mass killer. Worldwide stud\u00ad ies provide documented proof. The higher a person's cholesterol, the greater his risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke. The National Institutes of Health has launched a multimillion-dollar campaign, the National Cholesterol Education Program, designed to fight this devastating disease. The goal of this program is to reduce the preva\u00ad lence of elevated blood cholesteral in the United States, thereby reducing coronary heart disease mortality. According to a recent survey done by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, only 8 percent of American citizens know their cholesterol levels. This resolution can help create broad\u00ad based public awareness of this issue, and the deadly importance of knowing your cholesterol levels. As was the case last year, the Nebraska-based Na\u00ad tional Heart Savers Association, under the leadership of Mr. Phil Sokolof, will conduct free cholesterol checks for all Members of Congress and Cap\u00ad itol Hill Staff in conjunction with the observance of this special month. The exact dates for those tests have not been worked out yet, however, I will pass along that information when the details are finalized. Last year, over 9,000 people were tested during the 420 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENA TE January 28, 1988 congressional observance of \"Know Your Cholesterol Week.\" Almost 30 percent of the nearly 2 million deaths in this country each year are the result of coronary heart disease. Most coronary heart disease is due to blockages in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This block\u00ad age can be controlled. Elevated blood cholesterol is one of the three main controllable risk factors for coronary heart disease. The other two factors are high blood pressure and cigarette smoking. Any one of these risk factors increases an individual's chance of de\u00ad veloping heart disease. The chances of developing heart disease increase in proportion to the amount of cholester\u00ad ol in an individual's system. However, studies also show that people who have elevated blood cholesterol and who take steps to reduce it also reduce their risk of having a heart attack. Every adult American should know their cholesterol level. This is a life\u00ad saving issue. Mr. President, I urge swift passage of this resolution. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: S.J. RES. 244 Whereas heart attacks struck an estimat\u00ad ed 1,500,000 Americans in 1987, a third of whom died immediately; Whereas scientific data indicates that ef\u00ad fective measures to lower serum cholesterol are capable of decreasing occurrences of heart disease; Whereas only 8 per centum of Americans know their cholesterol level; and Whereas as many as 250,000 lives could be saved each year if Americans were tested for and took action to reduce high levels of cho\u00ad lesterol: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep\u00ad resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the month of April, 1988, is designated as \"National Know Your Cholesterol Month\", and the Presi\u00ad dent of the United States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to ob\u00ad serve such month with appropriate pro\u00ad grams and activities. Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation intro\u00ad duced by my distinguished colleague, Senator EXON, to designate the month of April 1988, as \"National Know Your Cholesterol Month.\" I believe this effort will encourage individuals not only to learn their cholesterol levels, but, more importantly, will lead them to take steps to lower elevated levels. The dangers associated with high cholesterol are well documented. Years of scientific research have proven that individuals with even modestly elevated serum cholesterol levels run a higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke. The more ele\u00ad vated a person's cholesterol level, the greater are his chances of developing heart disease. Heart disease is presently the No. 1 killer in America. Last year alone, heart attacks struck an estimated 1.5 million Americans, a third of whom died immediately. More than 43 mil\u00ad lion Americans suffer from some form of heart or blood vessel disease. In 1985, the cost of providing health care to those suffering from heart disease reached $72.1 billion. Yet, in spite of the well-established connection between higher than rec\u00ad ommended cholesterol levels and heart disease, very few Americans\u00ad only 8 percent according to a recent survey-know their own cholesterol levels. This deficiency must be ad\u00ad dressed if we are to combat effectively heart disease in America. Therefore, I am pleased that my col\u00ad league has taken the initiative to en\u00ad courage individuals to become more aware of their cholesterol levels. I commend my colleague from Nebraska for his commitment to this cause, and I ask my colleagues who have not al\u00ad ready done so to lend their support to this resolution.

Res. 245. Joint resolution to des\u00ad ignate April 21, 1988, as \"John Muir Day\"; to the Committee on the Judici\u00ad ary. JOHN MUIR DAY Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, I introduce for appropriate reference a joint resolution to designate April 21, 1988, as John Muir Day. I'm very pleased that Senators WILSON, ADAMS, BAUCUS, BINGAMAN, BRADLEY, BREAUX, BUMPERS, BURDICK, CHAFEE, CHILES, DECON\u00ad CINI, DODD, DOLE, DOMENIC!, DUREN\u00ad BERGER, EVANS, EXON, FOWLER, GARN, GORE, GRAHAM, GRASSLEY, HECHT, HEFLIN, HEINZ, HOLLINGS, HUMPHREY, JOHNSTON, KASTEN, KENNEDY, LEAHY, LUGAR, METZENBAUM, MOYNIHAN, MUR\u00ad KOWSKI, PACKWOOD, PELL, PROXMIRE, PRYOR, REID, RIEGLE, ROCKEFELLER, ROTH, SANFORD, SARBANES, SASSER, STAFFORD, STENNIS, WARNER, and WIRTH are joining as cosponsors. John Muir is one of America's great conservationists. Often called the father of our national park system, Muir helped preserve some of our first national parks, including Yosemite, Sequoia, and the Grand Canyon. He also championed the preservation of our forest lands and through his writ\u00ad ings and work influenced U.S. Presi\u00ad dents to set aside forest reserves, lead\u00ad ing to the establishment of our nation\u00ad al forest system. Muir's articles extol\u00ad ling the natural wonders of Alaska also changed public opinion about this magnificent area. Not only did Muir's writings of his travels and opinions on man's relation\u00ad ship with nature influence his own generation, but they continue to teach us about the beauty of our country and the value of protecting our wild lands. Today, because of Muir's vision and those who followed him, millions of Americans enjoy billions of acres of national park and forest lands and better understand and appreciate the value of conservation. In September, the World Wilderness Conference, with representatives from 60 nations, unanimously passed a reso\u00ad lution calling for the commemoration of Muir's birthday. April 21, 1988 marks John Muir's 150th anniversary. I believe this is an appropriate occa\u00ad sion to celebrate the legacy of this great American who helped spawn the modern conservation movement. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the text of the joint resolu\u00ad tion be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: S.J. RES. 245 Whereas April 21, 1988, marks the 150th birthday of the great American conserva\u00ad tionist John Muir, heralded worldwide for his dedication to the preservation of wilder\u00ad ness in this country; Whereas generations of Americans have reveled in the wonders of Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, and other parklands set aside by past Presidents and Congresses at the urging of the Scottish-born naturalist; Whereas a system of natural, cultural, his\u00ad torical, and recreational national parks which John Muir helped pioneer has grown in size to almost 80 million acres symboliz\u00ad ing the stewardship Americans demonstrate for their precious public resources; Whereas John Muir was the cofounder and first president of the Sierra Club, an or\u00ad ganization which contributes in making this nation a leader in the global environmental movement; Whereas the John Muir National Historic Site, in Martinez, California, one of 337 units of the National Park Service, was set aside by Congress in 1964 as a monument to the wild lands crusader and was the site from which Muir wrote books celebrating the natural beauty and wildlife of the January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 421 United States, books that are still widely read and treasured by people of all ages; and Whereas the important role of an ecologi\u00ad cally sound environment in the quality of life for all people was proselytised by the tireless voice and pen of John Muir; Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep\u00ad resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That April 21, 1988, is designated as \"John Muir Day\", and the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. By Mr. DECONCINI (for himself and Mr. DODD): S.J. Res. 246. Joint resolution to des\u00ad ignate the month of April 1988, as \"National Child Abuse Prevention Month\"; to the Committee on the Ju\u00ad diciary. NATIONAL CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MONTH e Mr. DECONCINI. Mr. President, I am introducing today, together with my colleague from the great State of Connecticut, Senator DODD, a joint res\u00ad olution to declare the month of April 1988 as \"National Child Abuse Preven\u00ad tion Month.\" I am hopeful that a great number of my distinguished col\u00ad leagues will join us in this important effort. Mr. President, despite the fact that agencies and organizations serving our children have made notable contribu\u00ad tions over the past few years in im\u00ad proving the lives of our youth-by re\u00ad vamping rules and regulations, pin\u00ad pointing issues, disseminating informa\u00ad tion and increasing public awareness\u00ad child abuse is still on the increase. Recent data makes it abundantly clear that our Nation's poor children are the high-risk victims for abuse, ne\u00ad glect, and other poverty-related prob\u00ad lems. The families of these children are caught in a web of strife, stress, and strain in their attempt to merely survive from day to day. Their strug\u00ad gle is compounded by lack of re\u00ad sources, both spiritual and physical, to reduce the burden imposed by their state of proverty. Mr. President, America's child-abuse problem does not stop there. It ap\u00ad pears in every State in the Union and cuts across all socioeconomic groups. From the impoverished ghettos of our urban centers to the stately manors across the Nation, millions of Ameri\u00ad ca's children are not getting a fair chance to grow into productive adults. Many children in the United States are growing up in wholesome, nurtur\u00ad ing environments. However, millions more are not blessed with that good fortune. Every child in the world needs and deserves food, shelter, and love in order to survive and prosper. The evidence of child abuse and ne\u00ad glect is both alarming and overwhelm\u00ad ing. The best available statistics esti\u00ad mate that 3 of every 4 cases of child abuse go unreported and the actual number of incidences is on the rise. The data collected by the Child Help U.S.A. organization and others show that over 1 million cases of child abuse is repoprted, so as many as 4 million of our Nation's children are being trag\u00ad ically abused. When I introduced this resolution in 1986, I cited national sta\u00ad tistics which stated that reports of child abuse and neglect were up 39.8 percent from 1981. Today, I regret to report that the incidence rate is not declining. And all experts agree that the numbers will escalate further since victims in turn, will likely victim\u00ad ize their own children and others. Mr. President, despite the best ef\u00ad forts of the social service providers, like Child Help U.S.A., Parents Anony\u00ad mous, and other members of the Na\u00ad tional Child Abuse Coalition, the entire Nation is threatened by the con\u00ad tinued growth in child abuse and ne\u00ad glect. The only all day, every day, na\u00ad tional crisis counseling hotline staffed totally by medical and clinical prof es\u00ad sionals received over 126,000 calls in 1986 compared with only 8,600 calls when it was established in 1982. The Child Help U.S.A. phone system was at capacity in 1986. Since then, it has had to expand to accomodate an in\u00ad creasing number of calls. As I have stated previously, Mem\u00ad bers of Congress have an opportunity to assist the many individuals, organi\u00ad zations, and agencies that are striving to rid our Nation of the epidemic of child abuse and to assist the victims as well. We can help focus public atten\u00ad tion on goals and objectives of these agencies and improve the general wel\u00ad fare of our children. The declaration of April 1988 as \"National Child Abuse Prevention Month\" is a significant way in which we in Congress can emphasize the im\u00ad portance of increasing public aware\u00ad ness and education for the benefit of our troubled families and suffering children. There is help available in communities throughout the Nation, but we need to get the message out to the abused as well as the abusers. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join Senator DODD and myself in this effort to have April 1988 designated as \"National Child Abuse Prevention Month.\" Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the text of the resolution be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD following my statement. There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: S.J. RES. 246 Whereas the incidence and prevalence of child abuse and neglect have reached alarm\u00ad ing proportions in the United States; Whereas an estimated four million chil\u00ad dren become victims of child abuse in this Nation each year; Whereas an estimated five thousand of these children die as a result of such abuse each year; Whereas the Nation faces a continuing need to support innovative programs to pre\u00ad vent child abuse and assist parents and family members in which child abuse occurs; Whereas Congress has expressed its com\u00ad mitment to seeking and applying solutions to this problem by enacting the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1974; Whereas many dedicated individuals and private organizations, including Child Help U.S.A., Parents Anonymous, the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse, the American Humane Association, and other members of the National Child Abuse Coalition, are working to counter the ravages and abuse and neglect and to help child abusers break this destructive pattern of behavior; Whereas the average cost for a public wel\u00ad fare agency to serve a family through a child abuse program is twenty times greater than self-help programs administered by private organizations; Whereas organizations such as Parents Anonymous, and other members of the Na\u00ad tional Child Abuse Coalition, are expediting efforts to prevent child abuse in the next generation through special programs for abused children; and Whereas it is appropriate to focus the at\u00ad tention of the Nation upon the problem of child abuse: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep\u00ad resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the month of April, 1988, is designated as \"National Child Abuse Prevention Month\", and the Presi\u00ad dent is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon all Government agencies and the people of the United States to observe such month with appropri\u00ad ate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

Mr. President, on De\u00ad cember 26, 1987, there appeared in the New York Times an article featuring Illinois's largest exporter, Caterpillar, Inc., about their efforts in selling to the debt-ridden countries of Latin America. I believe that the sale described in the opening paragraphs graphically demonstrates the lengths that our companies are going to now in order to sell to Latin American countries, and the lengths to which manufacturers eager to make export sales will go. I ask that the article be printed in the RECORD, and I urge my colleagues to read it. The article follows: [From the New York Times, Dec. 26, 19871 DEBTS OF LATINS MAKING TRADE LINKS TORTUOUS <By Clyde H. Farnsworth) WASHINGTON, December 25.-In 1985 Ven\u00ad ezuela wanted to buy a fleet of construction vehicles called wheel loaders from the Cat\u00ad erpillar Tractor Company. Because the country's crushing debt burden was forcing it to curtail imports, Caterpillar was asked to take Venezuelan iron ore in payment . Caterpillar agreed, then found a buyer for the ore in Rumania, but for payment it had to accept men's suits, which it eventually sold in London for dollars. \"Better to have gone through all that than to have lost a sale,\" said William F. Canis, Caterpillar's Washington manager for government affairs. The ingenuity of Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., shows what it sometimes takes to sell to Latin America because of the gen\u00ad eralized contraction of business brought on by the five-and-a-half-year international debt crisis. ASSISTANCE CALLED ESSENTIAL A number of experts contend that in\u00ad creased foreign capital and other assistance to the debtor nations, aimed at bolstering their economies , is essential to reverse the situation. While exports by the United States to most other areas of the world are rising, shipments to Latin America have tumbled, falling by 26 percent in 1986, to $31.l bil\u00ad lion, from $42.1 billion in 1981. From 1981 to 1986, imports of the four largest debtors\u00ad Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela\u00ad fell by one-third to one-half. To finance payments to creditors, one debtor country after another has embarked on varying degrees of austerity, curbing con\u00ad sumption and imports and channeling more resources into dollar-earning exports. Many analysts are now citing the prob\u00ad lems of the debtor nations as among the reasons for the intractably huge United States trade deficit. Some warn that the American trade position will not improve until growth returns to the debtor coun\u00ad tries. \"Demand from Europe and Japan won't be enough,\" said Stuart K. Tucker, a fellow at the Overseas Development Council. \"Debtor countries have to help.\" The council, a research organization spe\u00ad cializing in third world issues, takes the po\u00ad sition that growth will not resume in these countries until they are again on the receiv\u00ad ing end of world resources. Largely because of interest payments on $1 trillion of third world debt, the flow of resources in recent years has gone from the third world to the developed countries. William R. Cline, a senior fellow at the In\u00ad stitute for International Economics, a public-policy research organization, con\u00ad tends that the debtor countries need more private capital and more loans from the World Bank. But he stresses that these flows must be linked to improved economic policies in those nations. John A. Bohn Jr., president of the Export\u00ad Import Bank, has proposed that the United States, Western Europe and Japan put up $3 billion in long-term export credits to the major debtors to help them finance pur\u00ad chases from industrial countries. Presum\u00ad ably, the United States could get much of this business, since the dollar's decline in value has helped make the prices of manu\u00ad factured goods more competitive on world markets. The need to do something more is also an issue in Congress. Both the House and Senate trade bills envision creation of an international debt management agency to buy third world debt at discounted market prices. Freed of some of its debt burden, the third world would then play a major role in the growth of world demand, in the view of two backers of the idea, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes , Democrat of Maryland, and Rep\u00ad resentative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d op\u00ad poses such an arrangement as unworkable, although he supports greater resources for the World Bank to recycle into third world growth. He is expected to ask Congress next year to approve an American contribution for what is expected to be an increase of 60 to 80 percent in World Bank capital. The American share of the overall increase would be one-fifth. Meanwhile, the debt crisis continues to have a severe impact on American export\u00ad ers. Some of the story is dramatically told in Caterpillar 's sales. In 1981, the company shipped $903 million of wheel loaders, bulldozers , off-highway trucks and other such equipment to Latin America . Its exports to Western Europe amounted to a bit more, at $992 million. In 1983, exports collapsed to $266 million in Latin America, but fell more modestly, to $771 million, in Europe. By 1986, sales to Europe, at $1.1 billion, were even greater than in 1981, but sales to debt-saddled Latin America were $543 million, only half the 1981 total. For other leading exporters, the pattern is not much different. Latin American ship\u00ad ments by Dresser Industries of Dallas, a di\u00ad versified maker of products for the energy and natural resource industries, amounted to $165 million in 1981 and fell to $109 mil\u00ad lion in 1983 before recovering to $130 mil\u00ad lion in 1986. The debt crisis has not only caused a shrinkage in the Latin American and other third world markets, but has also acceler\u00ad ated a rush of goods to the United States and intensified competition for American exporters outside Latin America. In 1981 the United States took one-third of exports from developing countries but, by 1986, the figure had risen to 60 percent. \"The United States was the only expand\u00ad ing market in the world,\" said Stephen -=--\u00b7 January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 427 ment and finance of the National Associa\u00ad tion of Manufacturers. \"The surplus coun\u00ad tries, mainly West Germany and Japan, were taking advantage of Latin America as a cheap commodity provider, but had no in\u00ad terest in increasing trade in manufactures and used their formal and informal barriers to keep the Latin products out.\" PRICES OF EXPORTS DEPRESSED Fighting desperately for their own export markets, debtor countries, meanwhile, were both producing more and competing more fiercely with American producers elsewhere around the globe, ironically, the increased production and competition has hurt the debtor nations by pushing down the prices of their exports, according to a staff study by the Joint Economic Committee of Con\u00ad gress. Although falling oil prices have received the bulk of public attention during most of this decade, prices have fallen for nearly every major commodity exported by debtor nations. \"Since the beginning of this decade, the external debt grew faster than export reve\u00ad nues,\" the study noted, \"but the lag in export receipts cannot be attributed to an unwillingness of the debtors to boost their export volume. Rather, the failure of export revenues to keep pace is due almost entirely to falling commodity prices.\" Falling commodity prices, in turn, made it more difficult for American farmers, who are big exporters, to continue servicing their debt, and pushed many of them into bank\u00ad ruptcy.e HERBERT HOOVER AND THE BAY BRIDGE e Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the European voyagers who came to this continent, and the pioneers who ex\u00ad plored it, found amazing natural won\u00ad ders: Niagara Falls, Half Dome in Yo\u00ad semite, the Columbia River Gorge, the Grand Canyon, Crater Lake. While incapable of building on God's grand scale, the American people, nev\u00ad ertheless, have added magnificent man-made wonders to the landscape: Bonneville Dam, the interstate high\u00ad way system, the Brooklyn Bridge, and two that bear the unmistakable im\u00ad print of our 31st President: the Hoover Dam and the San Francisco Bay Bridge. It takes uncommon greatness to en\u00ad vision great public works. And it takes uncommon leadership to marshal the resources and public support to bring them into existence. But one's vision often is not appreciated by one's con\u00ad temporaries. President Hoover's bold vision of a bay bridge was criticized, but with its construction his vision was vindicated by the jobs generated, the industry stimulated and the general prosperity brought to the Bay Area. The bridge paid for itself within its first decade, with a handsome rate of return on the initial loan. Yet President Hoover's deserved rep\u00ad utation for vision and leadership was buried in the false blame for the Great Depression placed upon him by the succeeding administration. This is a great injustice in our history books. Robert Hessen, senior research fell ow and deputy archivist at Stan\u00ad ford University, has commemorated Herbert Hoover's leadership in envi\u00ad sioning and building the bay bridge in his essay, \"Herbert Hoover and the Bay Bridge.\" In an effort to correct history's verdict of this remarkable man and his achievements, I ask that Mr. Hessen's essay be printed in the RECORD. The essay follows: HERBERT HOOVER AND THE BAY BRIDGE A COMMEMORATIVE ESSAY <By Robert Hessen) The San Francisco Bay Bridge opened to traffic on November 12, 1936, and was hailed as the eighth wonder of the world. It cost more than any bridge ever built; it had the longest span over navigable water; and its foundations were the deepest ever sunk. But the Bay Bridge was much more than a great feat of engineering: it was and is indis\u00ad pensable to traffic between San Francisco and the East Bay cities. Only old-timers can recall the pre-bridge era, when people who lived in Marin and Al\u00ad ameda counties spent a couple of hours on ferry boats commuting to work in San Fran\u00ad cisco. Today, on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary, most people take the Bay Bridge's existence for granted. So it is timely to recall the long struggle that pre\u00ad ceded the building of the bridge and the crucial role that Herbert Hoover played in its creation. It is no exaggeration to say that if Herbert Hoover had not exerted his power as president on behalf of the bridge, it would not have been build until many years later. Shortly after the gold rush, William Walker, a San Francisco newspaper editor, made the first recorded suggestion to build a transbay bridge. Leland Stanford raised the idea twice, once in 1859, two years before he was elected governor of Califor\u00ad nia, and again in 1867, four years after he left office. No action was taken on either oc\u00ad casion. In 1869 a third advocate, the self\u00ad proclaimed emperor of the United States, Joshua A. Norton, commanded a bridge be built across the bay-but reality stubbornly defied his decree. At the end of the nineteenth century, the bay bridge proposal was a good idea waiting for someone to come along with the deter\u00ad mination to surmount all obstacles. A candi\u00ad date for that role emerged in 1914: a San Francisco engineer, F. E. Fowler, designed a cantilevered bridge to span the Bay. But Fowler had underestimated the army and navy's opposition to any bay bridge. Both departments strenuously opposed the build\u00ad ing of a bridge, fearing it would be an ob\u00ad struction to commercial vessels in peacetime and military vessels in wartime-and no bridge could be built without their consent and cooperation. Herbert Hoover revived the bay bridge idea in 1922, while serving as secretary of commerce. At Hoover's urging, President Warren G. Harding agreeed to appoint a new army-navy commission to study the question. But their findings did not please Hoover: the army recommended a less desir\u00ad able route than the one he favored, and the navy opposed the bridge altogether. Hoover later wrote in his memoirs: \"I attempted to conciliate the military and engineering conflicts; but my authority, without the backing of the President, was insufficient. Also, opinion in the Bay cities concerning the proper and feasible route was divided, and much acrimonious debate was going on. At that time there seemed to be no way of financing a project so ambi\u00ad tious as this.\" Years later, Leland Cutler <a key figure in the creation of the Bay Bridge) recalled how strongly the army and navy had op\u00ad posed the whole idea. While serving as a di\u00ad rector of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce in 1927, Cutler was chosen to present the case for the bridge to Secretary of the Navy Curtis D. Wilbur. Cutler wrote: \"I knew Curtris Wilbur well but made no headway on the bridge presentation. The Navy just wouldn't have it. The Army, whose permission had to be obtained for anything affecting navigable waters, was ad\u00ad amant and it looked as though there would be no bridge.\" Herbert Hoover's election as president in 1929 finally gave him the political leverage to offset the army and navy's opposition. During a 1928 campaign speech in San Francisco, he pledged his active support for a bay bridge, and he quickly made good on his promise. In August 1929, after consult\u00ad ing with Governor Clement C. Young of California, Hoover announced the creation of a new commission to reopen the bay bridge question. At his press conference on August 13, 1929, Hoover declared: \"There can be no question as to the neces\u00ad sity for such a bridge for the economic de\u00ad velopment of these communities. In addi\u00ad tion to the cities of San Francisco, Oakland and Alameda, the Governor of California through recent legislation has recently taken an interest in this problem. In order that we may have an exhaustive investiga\u00ad tion with a view to final determination which I hope will be acceptable to all par\u00ad ties, I have consulted the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy as well as Mr. [Bert B.J Meek, the representative of Gov\u00ad ernor Young, and I shall appoint a Commis\u00ad sion comprising two representatives from the Navy, two from the Army, and I shall ask the authorities of San Francisco to ap\u00ad point one member, the authorities of the east side of the Bay to appoint another member. I shall ask the Governor to ap\u00ad point one or two members and I shall ap\u00ad point a leading citizen, Mr. Mark Requa if he will undertake it, in the hope that we may arrive at a determination of the common interest.\" Hoover's deep commitment to the bay bridge idea is best seen in his choice of the man to head the commission. Mark L. Requa, a fellow mining engineer, had been Hoover's close friend since they first met in 1905. He had been Hoover's assistant in the U.S. Food Administration (1917-1918) and had served as general di'rector of the oil divi\u00ad sion of the U.S. Fuel Administration (1918- 1919). Requa was precisely the sort of man Hoover could count on, someone accus\u00ad tomed to circumventing obstacles and cut\u00ad ting through bureaucratic delays. To the nine-member group that soon became known as the Hoover-Young Com\u00ad mission, Hoover also appointed Professor Charles D. Marx, his former teacher and re\u00ad tired head of engineering at Stanford Uni\u00ad versity. By choosing Requa and Marx, Hoover clearly signaled the army and navy that their representatives on the commis\u00ad sion must be open-minded and not tied to traditional prejudices against a transbay bridge. The Hoover-Young Commission under\u00ad took a comprehensive survey of the bay bridge issue, confronting for the first time 428 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 the claims that the whole idea was impossi\u00ad ble. The skeptics said the water was too deep, that there was insufficient bedrock on which to build the bridge's piers, and that the cost of construction would be prohibi\u00ad tively high. The commission's engineering survey ad\u00ad dressed the physical obstacles first. The finding were encouraging: on May 27, 1930, Mark Requa advised Lawrence Richey, the president's secretary, that \"they have found high bed-rock on a line between Rincon Hill . . . and Goat Island. The only feasible route seems to be from Rincon Hill in a northeasterly direction to Goat Island, and from thence easterly to the Oakland shore.\" Hoover and others had favored a route from Oakland Point to Telegraph Hill via Yerba Buena Island, but the geological surveys forced a shift of route: the bridge eventually built begins at Emeryville and ends at Rincon Hill Commuter convenience had to be sacrificed to geological necessities, yet Hoover had won a crucial victory. On August 12, 1930, the commission returned a unanimous report favoring construction on a bay bridge. The next major hurdles were financial. A year earlier, the California legislature had created the California Toll Bridge Author\u00ad ity, empowering it to create and operate a transbay bridge, and giving the Department of Public Works the job of designing and building the bridge. Soon after the Hoover\u00ad Young Commission issued its report, the California legislature appropriated $650,000 to prepare plans for the bridge. But to build the bridge required more than a hundred times that amount, and California lacked the money to finance the project. If the bridge were to be built during the Great Depression, the Bridge Authority had to find a buyer for $62 million in bonds. Given the fact that banks and other finan\u00ad cial institutions throughout the country were verging on bankruptcy, it quickly became evident that the most solvent buyer was the federal government, through the newly created Reconstruction Finance Cor\u00ad poration <RFC>. The RFC had been Hoover's creation: he had proposed it in December 1930 to lend funds to financial institutions, especially banks and insurance companies, that were in danger of collapse. At the same time, Hoover also had sought to use the RFC as a job-creating mechanism, by enabling it to lend capital for what he called \"reproduc\u00ad tive public works,\" such as the Bay Bridge. But when Congress voted in January 1932 to create the RFC, it deleted the provision relating to public works. Hoover refused to accept defeat on this measure and contin\u00ad ued to push for its passage. Two men from California-Leland Cutler, president of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, and Charles H. Purcell, chief engineer of the California State Highway Commission\u00ad began a campaign of tireless lobbying in Washington on behalf of the amendment. Their efforts, openly endorsed by Hoover, proved successful: on July 16, 1932, Con\u00ad gress amended the Emergency Relief and Construction Act, authorizing the RFC to make available up to a billion and a half dollars in loans to finance \"self-liquidating\" projects, that is, public works whose toll revenues would retire their original bonded debt. But even then it was uncertain that the bay bridge project would be endorsed by the RFC. The process would involve approv\u00ad al on two levels: engineering and finance. A few days after the amendment passed, Hoover urged the California Toll Bridge Au-thority to send its board of engineers <headed by his former teacher, C.D. Marx> to meet with the RFC's newly created board of engineers. A month later, when no progress had been made, a delegation from the financial advisory committee headed for Washington, hoping to expedite the approv\u00ad al process through personal salesmanship. Leland Cutler expected that the biggest obstacle would be Harvey Couch, an Arkan\u00ad sas Democrat, who was in charge of self-liq\u00ad uidating loans. When Cutler arrived in Washington in September to see Couch, he found a message saying that the president wanted to see him immediately. At their White House meeting, Cutler later recalled, he found Hoover impatient for results: \"He made it clear that he would help us in every way but that the President of the United States had quite a few things to do and wasn't an errand boy and that we would have to do our own work.\" Cutler enlisted the aid of Merle Thorpe, editor and publisher of the Nation's Busi\u00ad ness, who was a close friend of Couch. Ac\u00ad companied by Thrope, Cutler immediately went to see Couch, requesting an opportuni\u00ad ty to present the case for the Bay Bridge to the directors of the RFC. To Cutler's sur\u00ad prise, Couch simply said, \"How about to\u00ad morrow morning at eleven o'clock?\" The next morning, Cutler recalls, the first question posed by Judge Wilson McCarthy, a Utah Democrat, \"was one none of us wanted to answer and couldn't answer be\u00ad cause it was fatal to our bridge. The ques\u00ad tion was, 'What was the total revenue from the ferryboats last year?' The answer, of course, would have to be, 'Not enough to amortize the amount we are asking for.' \" Cutler realized that to argue that a bridge would cut down commuter time across the Bay would carry no weight with the RFC. He was at a loss as to how to proceed and Harvey Couch took him aside and whis\u00ad pered, \"Cutler, did you ever play football in replied. \"What did you play?\" \"I played quarterback.\" \"Did you ever take time out when you got into trouble? You're in trouble now, Son; take time out.\" Another hearing was scheduled for two weeks later. Meanwhile, Cutler conferred with individual RFC directors and staff, seeking to persuade them that a bridge would stimulate transbay traffic, so that bridge tolls would far exceed existing ferry revenues. To Cutler's surprise, the least re\u00ad ceptive RFC director was a newly appointed Republican, Gardner Cowles, Sr., the Iowa publisher. He suspected that the Bay Bridge was only a make-work scheme, a boondoggle for an area hard hit by the depression. He wanted the California delegation to head home and never return. Cutler tried to arrange a meeting with Hoover to discuss Cowles's recalcitrance, but he was unsuccessful. He turned for help to Ray Lyman Wilbur, who was on leave from the presidency of Stanford University to serve as secretary of the interior. Cutler hoped that Wilbur, Hoover's closest friend, could get him into the White House. Wilbur succeeded, and Cutler delivered his gloomy report. Hoover, determined that the Bay Bridge would not be blocked by anyone, least of all by a Republican whom he had nominated to the RFC, agreed to persuade Cowles to change his position. Hoover later told Cutler that he had spent several un\u00ad pleasant hours arguing with Cowles. The next day, yielding to the president's person-al pressure, Cowles voted to approve the RFC's purchase of bay bridge bonds. Newspapers throughout California hailed the good news from Washington, and they singled out Hoover for special praise. But outside of California, the news was not as cordially received. Reflecting the fact that sectional rivalries sometimes transcend party loyalties, a fiercely Republican news\u00ad paper, the Chicago Tribune, wrote two angry editorials questioning the RFC's deci\u00ad sion: \"It is significant that no banking syndi\u00ad cate in boom times when any kind of securi\u00ad ty was salable had the nerve to finance San Francisco's bridge with its staggering over\u00ad head. Uncle Sam, for motives which are purely political corruption, has now under\u00ad taken to sink 62 millions of the taxpayers' money in this scheme, which would prob\u00ad ably land a professional promoter in the penitentiary if he tried to sell it to the public ... If there are any honest men in the region of the Bay, they have not been heard from at this distance.\" Such sharp-tongued criticism was less im\u00ad portant than the fact that the RFC's vote was only conditional. Before it made a firm bid to buy the bridge bonds in June 1933, more than fifty amendments to the laws of California had to be enacted. This feat was accomplished largely due to the efforts of Senator Thomas A. Maloney, the speaker pro tern of the state assembly. Even so, it wasn't certain that California banks would be the repositories of the RFC money. An attorney for RFC exclaimed: \"This money ... will not be put in Califor\u00ad nia banks; it will be put in New York banks where it will be safe.\" This remark infuriated Florence McAu\u00ad liffe, who had worked closely with Leland Cutler to sway the RFC vote. Hearing this slur on California and its banks, McAuliffe shouted back: \"my name maybe Florence but I wear a 171/2 collar. Out in California, we are not Liberia or France, we are a part of this great commonwealth. The money will be put in California banks!\" It was, and it proved a great stimulus to California's economy. The banks were not the only ones to profit; the bridge created job opportunities for 6,500 engineers and bridgeworkers during the three-and-a-half years of its construction. The bridge con\u00ad sumed 1.2 percent of all the steel produced in America in 1933, and other manufactur\u00ad ers and suppliers received sorely needed contracts. Clearly, the Bay Area profited greatly, but so did the RFC. The increased traffic across the Bay Bridge produced suffi\u00ad cient revenues to yield the RFC several mil\u00ad lion dollars profit on its investment within a decade. Twenty years later, when he was writing his memoirs, Leland Cutler wrote that Hoover had been the key figure responsible for the building of the Bay Bridge: \"I gave Mr. Hoover the greatest credit, for he cut all red tape and formed the Hoover\u00ad Young Commission to find a way of doing it. Mr. Hoover conceived the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, agreed to an agree\u00ad ment to fit the case of the San Francisco\u00ad Oakland Bay Ridge, and during our first on\u00ad slaught on Washington, used his power with the RFC to help us at every turn. President Hoover also stayed up late at night and re\u00ad ceived me when I needed help and at any hour telephoned friends who might be needed. I think he knew he would not be re\u00ad elected and he wanted the bridge on its way before he was out, because he believed in it January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 429 and in its part in the progress of the nation.\" Hoover, characteristically, stressed the role others had played in the bridge's cre\u00ad ation. Speaking at the opening ceremonies of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Ridge on November 12, 1936, he said: \"This bridge stands for far more than even its convenience and its economic worth. It stands as a monument to unity in community action. It stands for American genius and accomplishment. It is the real\u00ad ization of the dream of two generations . . . That this is the greatest bridge yet con\u00ad structed in the world requires no repetition from me. Its construction spans not alone this great bay but also the whole advance in industrial civilization-our discoveries in sci\u00ad ence, our inventions, our increasing skill. It is the product of hundreds of years of accu\u00ad mulated knowledge ... But above them all in our tributes are the engineers and work\u00ad men right here who combined all those cen\u00ad turies of knowledge with courage and imagi\u00ad nation ... Deserving high credit with them are the manufacturers, the contractors. But not the least was the part of those coura\u00ad geous men who daily risked their lives in construction. This bridge will be here giving service to these communities for another hundred years. By that time the nation may have discovered something else that will do the job better. But it will remember that the community courage, and its spirit of co\u00ad operation did a great thing here.\" As Hoover spoke, generously praising twenty-one individuals by name for their role in building the bridge, those who heard him were probably aware that he had played the preeminent role. If subsequent generations have forgotten his contribution, the Bay Bridge's fifieth anniversary is an appropriate occasion to recall it.

Mr. President today in Alabama, from across the State, men and women are gathering to talk about a problem that is close to the hearts of all Alabamians, infant mor\u00ad tality. Indeed, Alabama is no stranger to the high costs infant mortality can place on a State. And so it is fitting that members of the business commu\u00ad nity are joining with government offi\u00ad cials and health care professionals in our State capitol to try and put an end to this shameful tragedy. Due to my schedule here in the Senate, I was not able to attend this symposium. However, I have asked that the following message be deliv\u00ad ered to Governor Hunt and the atten\u00ad dees of the meeting. I ask that this letter be inserted in the RECORD. Mr. President, I look forward to re\u00ad viewing the information that is gener\u00ad ated by this meeting of minds in my home State. I also look forward to sharing this information with my col\u00ad leagues in the Senate, as we continue to tackle the serious health care prob\u00ad lems facing our Nation. The letter follows: U.S. SENATE, Washington, DC, January 27, 1988. Hon. Guy HUNT, c/o Mrs. Jean Blackmon, Alabama Depart\u00ad ment of Human Resources, Montgomery, AL. DEAR GOVERNOR HUNT AND ATTENDEES TO THE FIRST GOVERNOR'S SYMPOSIUM ON INFANT MORTALITY: I would like to take this opportunity to commend you on the organi\u00ad zation of the First Governor's Symposium on Infant Mortality in Alabama. Unfortu\u00ad nately, due to the recovering of the lOOth Congress, I am unable to be with you for this most worthy meeting. Alabamians are no strangers to the high claim infant mortality makes on a state. Indeed, we have the dubious distinction of being one of the country's leaders in the number of child mortalities each year. But as this issue makes headlines throughout the country, the people, parents, and policy\u00ad makers of this country are not going to remain silent any longer. You have gathered here today to give of your time, your energy and your knowledge to help galvanize Alabama's response to the tragedy of infant mortality. You are here today to strategize and plan, educate and learn, participate and partake of the vast amount of information available on the crisis that is facing our state. But mostly, you are here today to do something about this problem. Many of you are leaders of industry and business from across our great state. You bring to this Symposium a special perspec\u00ad tive and an important edge. We can not beat this problem alone, we need your input, your guidance-we need your help. It's that simple. I commend each and every one of you for being here today and I look forward to working with the Governor and with you to help implement a first rate plan that will attack the infant mortality problem in the most comprehensive and effective way possi\u00ad ble. We come from a state that is blessed with bright minds, prestigious educational insti\u00ad tutions, exceptional medical resources, and a thriving business community. I am confi\u00ad dent that together, we can win the war against infant mortality. With best wishes for a successful and ef\u00ad fective Symposium, I am, Sincerely, RICHARD SHELBY.e JUSTIN DART Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I was saddened by the forced resignation of Justin Dart as Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administra\u00ad tion. I have been impressed with his commitment and I admire his courage. He is a remarkable person- just how remarkable is indicated in an article from the Los Angeles Times of Decem\u00ad ber 10. We need Justin Dart's voice as an advocate for people with disabilities, and we need his leadership as an advo\u00ad cate for democratic processes and par\u00ad ticipation in Government. I am pleased that he intends to continue to speak out and provide this leadership. I urge my colleagues to read the Times article about this unusual man. The article follows: CFrom the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 10, 19871 DART'S DEFIANCE-TAKING ON THE BUREAUC\u00ad RACY, JUSTIN DART, JR., LOST A JOB BUT GAINED A FOLLOWING <By Lee May) WASHINGTON.-Blue-blazered and white\u00ad shirted, wearing a blue tie with tiny Ameri\u00ad can flags, Justin Dart, Jr. seems more the patriotic professor than the combative advo\u00ad cate for the handicapped. Forced late last month to resign as com\u00ad missioner of rehabilitation services after harshly criticizing Education Department management, he seems more like a man who just got liberated than one who just got fired. He wheels his chair next to a flag that dominates a wall in his apartment near the Education Department Building in South\u00ad west Washington, obliging a photographer, then tells a visitor of an outpouring of calls and letters from people who are angry that he was fired. \"Many have called to indicate their moral support and want to know what they can do,\" he said. Others have written and tele\u00ad phoned Congress, the White House and the department. Thus, in losing the job to which he was appointed in September, 1986, Dart has gained a cause. His firing is focusing on un\u00ad precedented attention on problems in the Education Department and on his personal 20-year battle for the rights of the nation's estimated 35 million handicapped. Such is the contradiction woven through the life of Justin Whitlock Dart, Jr. His father, the late Justin Dart Sr., was the wealthy California industrialist who raised huge sums of money for the Republi\u00ad can Party and helped persuade Ronald Reagan to enter politics, in the process be\u00ad coming a charter member of Reagan's Cali\u00ad fornia \"kitchen cabinet.\" But until he switched parties in 1972, the younger Dart, who is 57 years old, strongly supported Democrats, attending the inaugu\u00ad rations of both John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Baines Johnson. \"There were some years we didn't meet at all,\" Dart said of his father, who died in January, 1984. \"He was so intense about his politics, and I was so intense about mine.\" Despite their early political differences, Dart said, his father-known for his blunt views in unrefined language-\"never tried to intimidate me to support his ideas.\" He called his father \"a great man,\" adding: \"He taught me a lot. He was straightforward. He was a person who held very high standards for himself and for me and others. He ex\u00ad pected us to do whatever we did with a pas\u00ad sion and with a conscience.\" Dart said, \"We did agree on one thing: the importance of democracy and the democrat\u00ad ic process. He told me to participate in the democratic process as if your life depended on it because it does.\" They became closer toward the end of his father's life, said Dart, who has been con\u00ad fined to a wheelchair since suffering polio in 1948. He has a brother-also a polio victim\u00ad three half-brothers and a half-sister . Explaining his rejection of the Democrat\u00ad ic Party, he said: \"I gradually came to ap\u00ad preciate the importance of independence 430 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 and liberation from too much paternalistic central government.\" Yet it was his charge of Republican pater\u00ad nalism that drove the Reagan Administra\u00ad tion to demand his resignation, which he submitted Nov. 25. It becomes effective Dec. 15. The simmering problem boiled over at a congressional hearing on Nov. 18, when Dart set aside testimony the Education De\u00ad partment had approved, delivering instead what he called a \"statement of conscience,\" a stinging condemnation of the system in which he worked-a system he said was characterized by \"paternalistic central con\u00ad trol.\" Paternalism was so bad, Dart told The Times later, that whenever he wanted to send anything by Federal Express, he was required to get advance approval from his boss, Madeleine Will, or a \"high member of her staff.\" In his testimony before the House Educa\u00ad tion and Labor subcommittee on select edu\u00ad cation, Dart said his program, the Rehabili\u00ad tation Service Administration, was \"afflict\u00ad ed ... by profound problems in areas such as management, personnel and resource uti\u00ad lization.\" The program, budgeted at $1.5 bil\u00ad lion a year, makes grants to states, helping them provide training and education that will make handicapped people employable. Dart's remarks were too much for the Ad\u00ad ministration to swallow. Choosing between Dart and Will, the wife of conservative col\u00ad umnist and Reagan ally George Will, the Administration asked Dart to leave. Loye Miller, spokesman for Education Secretary William J. Bennett, said Dart was fired from his $72,500-a-year job \"because he stood up and attacked his boss in a hear\u00ad ing. When he attacked Madeleine Will, he attacked Bill Bennett. And that was the end of Justin Dart.\" Not quite. On the first of this month, Dart made public his resignation. Then, the letters to President Reagan began. \"We were shocked, profoundly saddened, and even angry at this great loss of opportu\u00ad nity and waste of talent,\" wrote the Council of State Administrators of Vocational Reha\u00ad bilitation. The National Rehabilitation Assn. wrote: \"The unwise decision to force Justin Dart to resign was not in the best interest of the re\u00ad habilitation program, the Rehabilitation Services Administration. When Reagan appointed him last year, Dart had come to Washington from his home in Fort Davis, Tex., to work for three months on the National Council on the Handicapped, an independent federal agency that analyzes federal laws and rec\u00ad ommends policies to the government. A CRUSHING WORKLOAD The Education Department appointment was so sudden and the workload so crush\u00ad ing, Dart said, that he and his wife never went back to Texas to move. They bought most of the furnishings for their two-bed\u00ad room apartment from the Door Store, he said. Dart still wears cowboy boots, and over his kitchen door hangs a sign the credo: \"Lead, Follow or Get the Hell Out of the Way.\" While he wears boots and claims a Texas temperament, Dart appears unwilling to get down in the political mud, an activity that many in the nation's capital seem to relish. \"Justin's too nice for Washington,\" one ac\u00ad quaintance said. Dart said, \"I don't like to criticize anyone personally; it's against my principles.\" As a Reagan-appointee family, the Darts have always been somewhat unusual, show\u00ad ing up at black-tie events in their 3-year-old beige Nissan pick-up. But by all accounts, he was a hard worker, conducting research in all 50 states and five Indian nations. Working from his wheel\u00ad chair, Dart inspired people with disabilities and encouraged their advocates in the strug\u00ad gle for handicapped people's rights. His firing, said Charlotte Bly-Magee, di\u00ad rector of the Southern California Projects With Industry, is \"going to look like the Ad\u00ad ministration is letting the handicapped down.\" In Seattle, Paul Dziedzic, president of the Council of State Administrators of Voca\u00ad tional Rehabilitation, declared that Dart has \"amplified the problems\" of the handi\u00ad capped, adding. \"If people thought they were going to muffle him by firing him, then it backfired.\" Both views are accurate. Many people are complaining that Dart's firing made the Administration look villain\u00ad ous. But Dart certainly has not been muf\u00ad fled. Winding down his chores at the Education Department , Dart still goes to the office, but his work at home has intensified since he resigned. Rising by 7 a.m., sometimes as early as 5, he churns out letters on a com\u00ad puter and conducts telephone conferences across the nation. In the future, he said, he will help orga\u00ad nize efforts to broaden civil rights laws cov\u00ad ering handicapped people in areas like em\u00ad ployment, public transportation and hous\u00ad ing. Currently, he said, such laws apply mostly to federal activities and those sup\u00ad ported by federal funds. RIGHTS, RESPONSIBILITIES \"We will never accomplish any of our goals fully until we can communicate [to] this nation and [in] law and everyday life that people with disabilities have the same rights and responsibilities as other people and that disability is a normal characteristic of the human process,\" Dart said. He likened his own efforts to those of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Mahatma Gandhi, speaking passionately of the world's estimated 500 million handicapped people, whom he called \"the largest disad\u00ad vantaged minority. \" Often, Dart seems a man tugging against himself. Even as he skewered Will's administration of the program he headed, he praised her as his \"distinguished colleague advocate .\" Similarly, in his resignation letter to Reagan, who presumably acquiesced in his firing, Dart declared that he remained \"pro\u00ad foundly respectful of your personal endorse\u00ad ment\" of the idea that handicapped people should have independence and equality. One long-time associate said, \"I watched him struggle with divided loyalties. He has come out unfettered.\" But not uncriticised. It is bad enough to be a former Democrat, but even worse to battle so openly with Re\u00ad publican bosses. In addition to the embar\u00ad rassment he has caused it, the Education Department may be investigated by the General Accounting Office because of Dart's charges. All this has angered some Republicans. Said Dart, \"I've heard that people have sug\u00ad gested that I might be happier in the other party, but nobody said that to my face.\" He said he is not going to switch back, noting that both Reagan and Education Secretary Bennett are former Democrats. \"I believe people with disabilities need to be strong in both parties,\" he said. \"There are good people in both parties.\" Dart is enjoying his new freedom of speech and the attention his dismissal has brought to handicapped people. 'Tm not proud that I got fired,\" he said, \"but this is the work that I've dedicated my life to\u00ad quality opportunities backed up by quality services.'' NORTH KOREA: TERRORIST STATE e Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, just as South Korea has demon\u00ad strated extraordinary resilience and maturity in its current transition to democratic rule, its neighbor to the north has once again stunned civilized people everywhere with the sheer bar\u00ad barity of its international behavior. I am referring to the wanton North Korea-directed destruction of a Korean Air passenger plane en route from Bahrain to Seoul on November 29, 1987. One hundred fifteen people perished as KAL 858 disintegrated over Adaman Bay near the Thai-Bur\u00ad mese border. It is now known that two North Korean agents were ordered by the North Korean leader's ambitious son, Kim Jong-Il, to destroy the KAL flight in order to discourage attend\u00ad ance at the 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul. Posing as Japanese father and daughter, Kim Sung-Il and Kim Hyun\u00ad Hee boarded KAL 858 in Baghdad, placed a radio time bomb with liquid explosives in the overhead storage compartment, and disembarked when the passenger plane made a scheduled stopover in Abu Dhabi. Nine hours later, 115 innocent people, mostly South Korean construction workers returning home, died. Regrettably, Mr. President, this North Korean action is not unique. On October 9, North Korean agents suc\u00ad ceeded in killing 15 South Korean Government officials in Rangoon on the occasion of President Chun's state visit to Burma. Four cabinet ministers perished in that vicious attack, includ\u00ad ing Foreign Minister Lee. President Park Chung Hee was similarly the at\u00ad tempted target of a North Korean as\u00ad sassination attack in 1968 in which his wife was killed. Following the KAL attack, Bahrain agreed to extradite Kim Hyon Hui to South Korea where she underwent questioning by Korean, American, and Japanese authorities. There is no doubt that she and her accomplice were under the direct control of Pyon\u00ad gyang. Last week, our Government an\u00ad nounced that North Korea was to be placed on the list of terrorist coun\u00ad tries-thus, giving them the same status as Libya, Iraq, and others. Just this week the Japanese Government cut off all diplomatic contact with January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 431 North Korea citing \"organized terror\u00ad ism\" directed by Pyongyang. Mr. President, I was in Seoul on the day when the testimony of Kim Hyun Hee was announced. The purpose of my visit was to congratulate President\u00ad elect Roh Tae Woo on his election and to express my admiration for the democratic direction in which he is leading Korea. I was deeply impressed with the calm manner in which Roh Tae Woo, the South Korean people, and their Government reacted to this terrible act of state-sponsored terror\u00ad ism. There were no threats or destabi\u00ad lizing actions- just the calm assurance of a vibrant and increasingly self-con\u00ad fident nation. This contrast with the state-sponsored, barbaric actions of North Korea is obvious for all to see.e THE IMPACT OF LIABILITY CRISIS ON VOLUNTEERS e Mr. MELCHER. Mr. President, today, I had the pleasure of announc\u00ad ing the results of a Gallup survey to determine the impact of the liability crisis on volunteers. This survey, funded by the Gannett Foundation and the American Society of Associa\u00ad tion Executives Foundation, confirms what we have suspected-volunteers are getting harder to find because they are afraid of being sued. This country was built by volun\u00ad teers, and it's volunteers who make it work today. But today we learned that almost 20 percent of our volunteers are no longer willing to volunteer. Now, that's a serious problem-a prob\u00ad lem that is so serious that we need Federal action to help see volunteers are not scared off. That's why I introduced S. 929. This bill simply encourages States to exempt volunteers of tax-exempt orga\u00ad nizations from personal civil liability if their actions are within the scope of their duties as a volunteer. More than 30 States have passed leg\u00ad islation offering some protection to volunteers, but there is a great deal of difference in the protection. Some is limited to sports volunteers; some is limited to board members of tax exempt organizations, and some is for all volunteers. We need to have legisla\u00ad tion in all the States protecting all our volunteers. Mr. President, I ask that the results of the Gallup survey be inserted in the RECORD. The material follows: THE LIABILITY CRISIS AND THE USE OF VOLUNTEERS BY NoN-PROFIT Assoc1ATIONs INTRODUCTION This report has been prepared by The Gallup Organization, Inc., for the Founda\u00ad tion of the ASAE. The report summarizes the findings of a survey of non-profit orga\u00ad nization executives and volunteer board members concerning liability risk. The survey covered the following areas: Survey of association executives: 1. Incidence of carrying director and offi\u00ad cers liability insurance coverage; 2. Change in cost of liability coverage since 1984; 3. Changes resulting from concern for ex\u00ad posure to liability risk; 4. Practices used by non-profit organiza\u00ad tions to minimize liability risks; 5. Incidence of suits over liability issues; 6. Effects of liability coverage on relations with association chapters; 7. Indemnification of directors or volun\u00ad teers; 8. Perceived effect of liability exposure on volunteers. Survey of board members: 1. Effect of liability crisis on participation in not-for-profit organizations; 2. Extent to which volunteers inquire into liability coverage and issues prior to accept\u00ad ing board membership; 3. Perceived effect of liability crisis on vol\u00ad unteers; 4. Incidence of refusing to serve due to \u00b7 fear of liability; 5. Experience with lawsuits; 6. Extent of insurance coverage. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS Given the concern for liability it is some\u00ad what surprising that only about two-thirds of the organizations report carrying director and officer liability insurance. However, it may be noted that seven in ten board mem\u00ad bers report they are insured either by their company or by a personal liability policy. Volunteer board members are also likely to report the biggest effect of the liability situ\u00ad ation is a concern for insurance coverage. Most voluntary organizations report the cost of liability insurance has increased. In fact, the average reported increase in the past three years is 155%, and one in eight organizations report an increase of over 300%, roughly the equivalent of a 100% in\u00ad crease over 1984 rates per year. The risk of being sued or being held liable has lead organizations, in some instances, to make changes. About one in twenty report changing the structure of their board of di\u00ad rectors, and as many eliminated committees due to the potential exposure to liability risk. A larger proportion 04%) have elimi\u00ad nated programs they believed would expose the organization to risk. From the volunteer board member's per\u00ad spective the fear of exposure to liability is seen as resulting in fewer individuals willing to serve as volunteers. About half of the active board members report a decline in volunteers in the past few years. In fact, 16% of the board members report they have withheld their services to an organization out of fear of liability. More common, seven in ten report volunteers are more careful in what they do or say as board members. Re\u00ad lated to the greater caution expressed by board members, organizations report estab\u00ad lishing policies concerning volunteer activi\u00ad ties. Eight in ten organizations have a policy regarding who may speak for the organiza\u00ad tion and nine in ten give their committees and boards specific charges and authoriza\u00ad tion and monitor compliance. While there is a great deal of concern for the risk of liability, only one in twenty orga\u00ad nizations report being sued on a directors and officers liability questions in the past five years. However, the response says noth\u00ad ing about the organizations which may have adopted more cautious policies to avoid such situations nor does it indicate the extent to which potential suits may have been averted before filing with the courts. It is of note that almost as many board members as or-ganizations report being sued. It may also be noted that while only about 5% were sued within the past five years, one in four organizations have been sued at some time in the past. Thus, while the number of organizations reporting problems with liability risk is not great, concern for liability is common. Orga\u00ad nizations have taken steps to alter their op\u00ad erations or activities to minimize liability in the face of ever increasing insurance rates and potential risk. Volunteer board mem\u00ad bers approach the request to serve on an or\u00ad ganization's board with caution, investigat\u00ad ing the organization's history of lawsuits and its potential for liability risk. Finally, volunteers are more likely than organiza\u00ad tion executives to express concern and see a problem affecting the number and quality of volunteers resulting from the liability crisis. <The following pages summarize the find\u00ad ings of interviews with association execu\u00ad tives) Carrying of Director and Officer Liability Insurance: The Questions: To begin, does your orga\u00ad nization currently carry director and officer liability insurance coverage? Does your coverage include exclusions for any of the following? Ethics committee; Standards committee; Peer review; Employee discrimination. When were these exclusions added? Approximately two-thirds (64 percent) of all associations surveyed report carrying D&O liability insurance coverage. Among those with liability coverage one in eight < 13 percent) report their insurance has exclu\u00ad sions for ethics or standards committee, peer review or employee discrimination. Typically such exclusions appear to have been imposed on the association's coverage since 1985.

Most associations with D&O coverage report an increase in their premiums since 1984. On average, the reported increase is 155%, and the median increase is 54%. Among associations carrying D&O liability insurance about one in four (26%) report their premiums have increased by 100% or more since 1984. Another one in four <23%) have seen their premiums rise by twenty to eighty percent in the past three years. Only 432 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 one in seven 04%) report no increase.

Has your organization eliminated any pro\u00ad grams due to potential exposure to liability risk? Has your organization eliminated any committees due to potential exposure to li\u00ad ability risk? Relatively few associations <5%> report making changes in the structure of their board of directors as a result of concern for problems of liability. However, a larger pro\u00ad portion 04%> have eliminated programs due to potential exposure to liability risk. The elimination of committees is less common, only 5 percent report potential exposure to liability risk has lead to the elimination of committees. While the number of executives reporting liability issues have affected the organiza\u00ad tion's leadership is relatively small it is noteworthy that such organizations are more likely than others to report changes in board structure or elimination of programs or committees.

Have any volunteer leaders resigned due to concern over the liability situation? Has the number of volunteers actively participating in the leadership of your organization declined as a result of the liability situation in the past three years? Review of Organization Documents The Question: Are the governing docu\u00ad ments of your organization periodically re\u00ad viewed to make them current and consistent with present interpretation of association law?

Do committees and boards have specific charges and authorizations and are they monitored to insure compliance? A large majority of organizations (80%) have policies concerning communication of the association's views outside the organiza\u00ad tion. The same proportions report prohibi\u00ad tions on the use of official letterhead except for authorized use. Nine in ten association executives <90%> also report committees and boards have spe\u00ad cific charges and authorizations and are monitored for compliance.

How many times? When was the last time your organization was sued? How many suits, if any, have you settled out court within the past five years? How many suits, if any, have you success\u00ad fully defended in the past 5 years? How seriously has your liability coverage been affected by these suits? Approximately one association in twenty <5%> has been sued, within the past five years, on a directors and officers liability question. The majority of organizations have been sued once, but one in four have experienced multiple suits. In addition, it may be noted that about one in four organi\u00ad zations have been sued for some reason at some point in time, including 6 percent who were sued within the past five years for some reason other than D&O liability. The numbers reporting any involvement in suits is too small to base definite conclu\u00ad sions upon; however, it would appear that about half the suits are settled out of court and most are successfully defended.

About one in four association executives report having incurred a bias on underwrit\u00ad ers due to the technical nature of their pro\u00ad fession. Those who report the liability situa\u00ad tion has had an effect on leadership are more likely than the norm to report incur\u00ad ring an underwriters bias.

While the number is small it may be of value to look at the changes reported. A third report initiating programs or monitoring to reduce the risk of liability.

Do you indemnify your volunteers as well? A majority of associations (58%) indemni\u00ad fy their board of directors. However, less than half <32%> indemnify volunteers. Orga\u00ad nizations with D&O insurance are more likely than others to indemnify board mem\u00ad bers and volunteers.

Have any volunteer leaders resigned due to concern over the liability situation? Has the number of volunteers actively participating in the leadership of your orga\u00ad nization declined as a result of the liability situation in the past three years? Association executives were asked a series of questions concerning the possible effects of the liability crisis on volunteer leaders. About one in five executives <20%) perceive some change as a result of the potential ex\u00ad posure to liability. The most common effect is the withholding of services to the associa\u00ad tion. Eighteen percent report that, due to concern over liability exposure , potential leaders withheld their services to the orga\u00ad nization. A little less than one in ten <8%> report resignations as a result of concern over liability issues. Related to the reported resignation six percent have seen a decline in the number of volunteers in the past three years related to the liability situation. Finally, seven percent believe the quality of volunteers in their organization has suf\u00ad fered due to liability questions.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH VOLUNTEER BOARD MEMBERS Affect of Liability Crisis The Question: Overall, how would you say the liability crisis has affected your partici\u00ad pation in not-for-profit organizations? One in five board members <21 %> report the liability situation facing voluntary orga\u00ad nizations had made them more concerned about serving on boards of directors. One in ten <10%> either carry insurance or verify that the organization carries liability insur\u00ad ance. A small proportion <3%) have become more selective in their participation and 2% have resigned or refused to serve on a board as a consequence of their concern. However, seven in ten <69%) report no negative effect. LIABILITY CRISIS AFFECT More concerned (net) ......................................................... .

Inquiries Concerning Liability Coverage The Questions: When asked to volunteer as a board member, do you inquire into the organization's liability coverage before making a decision to serve? Do you research the organizat ion's history of lawsuits before volunteering? Nearly half <48%> the board members question the organization's liability cover\u00ad age before making a decision to sit on a board. Perhaps because of their greater ex\u00ad perience, or greater potential exposure to suits, those who have been board members for a long period of time or have member\u00ad ship on more than one board are more likely to raise questions about liability before ac\u00ad cepting a seat on the board. Approximately one in four directors <23%) report researhing the organiztion's history of lawsuits prior to volunteering. Again, it is the volunteer with more years of experience or multiple board membership who is most likely to look into the organization's past history.

Almost as many consider the stability of the organization (22%). Slightly less than one in five <17%) consider the quality of the current board members and as many consider the organi\u00ad zation's current insurance coverage.

Perceived changes in volunteer board members 81 The Questions: In the past few years have you noticed any of the following regarding volunteer board members ... fewer willing to volunteer or serve? volunteers are more cautious about what they do or say? About half the volunteer board members (49%> report that they see fewer willing to volunteer to serve on boards of directors . As much larger proportion <72%> report volun\u00ad teers are more cautious in what they do or say.

One in six board members <16%> report withholding their services due to fear of li\u00ad ability. Those who serve on several boards, as one might expect, are more likely to report such an experience. It should also be noted that since the survey is of currently active board members there is no measure of the proportion of board members who have completely withdrawn from volunteer activity due to concern for liability.

Relatively few board members (2%) report having been sued as a volunteer for a not\u00ad for-profit organization. As one might antici\u00ad pate, board members who have served a long time or who serve on several boards are more likely than the less experienced to report being sued.

Do you carry personal coverage for liabil\u00ad ity? Seven in ten board members (72%) carry some type of liability coverage. Slightly more than one in four volunteer board members <27%) report their employer pro\u00ad vides liability coverage for their volunteer service. This is particularly true of volun\u00ad teers who serve on several boards or who have served for a long period of time. Many more volunteers C62%) report carry\u00ad ing personal liability coverage.

The size of such sam\u00ad pling errors depends largely on the number of interviews. The following tables may be used in esti\u00ad mating the sampling error of any percent\u00ad age in this report. The computed allowances have taken into account the effect of the sample design upon sampling error. They may be interpreted as indicating the range (plus or minus the figure shown) within which the results of repeated samplings in the same time period could be expected to vary, 95 percent of the time, assuming the same sampling procedures, the same inter\u00ad viewers, and the same questionnaire. The first table shows how much allowance should be made for the sampling error of a percentage: RECOMMENDED ALLOWANCE FOR SAMPLING ERROR OF A PERCENTAGE [In percentage points (at 95 in 100 confidence level 1)] Sample size 350 250 125 100 75 50 25 Percentages near 10 ........ 6 7 8 12 Percentages near 20 .... 8 9 11 16 Percentages near 30 .. 9 10 13 18 Percentages near 40 .. 10 11 14 19 Percentages near 50 ........ 10 11 14 20 Percentages near 60 .... 10 11 14 19 Percentages near 70 9 10 13 18 Percentages near 80 ...... 8 9 11 16 Percentages near 90 ... 6 7 8 12 The chances are 95 in 100 that the sampling error is not larger than the figures shown. The table would be used in the following manner: Let us say a reported percentage is 33 for a group which includes 350 respond\u00ad ents. Then we go .to row \"percentages near 30\" in the table and go across to the column headed \"350\". The number at this point is 5, which means that the 33 percent obtained in the sample is subject to a sampling error of plus or minus 5 points. Another way of saying it is that very probably (95 chances of 100) the true figure would be somewhere between 28 and 38, with the most likely figure the 33 obtained. In comparing survey results in two sam\u00ad ples, such as, for example, men and women, the question arise as to how large a differ\u00ad ence between them must be before one can be reasonably sure that it reflects a real dif\u00ad ference. In the tables below, the number of points which must be allowed for in such comparisons is indicated. Two tables are provided. One is for per\u00ad centages near 20 or 80; the other for per\u00ad centages near 50. For percentages in be\u00ad tween, the error to be allowed for is between those shown in the two tables. RECOMMENDED ALLOWANCE FOR SAMPLING ERROR OF THE DIFFERENCE [In percentage points (at 95 in 100 confidence level 1 )] Size of sample Table A (percentages near 20 or 80): 175.. . 125 100 50 .. 25 .. 175 125 100 75 50 25 8 ... lo 9 ... ii 10 11 11 11 12 13 .... 16 .. ::::\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 12 13 14 14 17 17 18 18 19 22 10 . 11 12. 12 13 14 ......................... 14 14 15 16 .... 20\u00b7: ....... 16 16 17 18 21 21 22 23 24 28 1 The chances are 95 in 100 that the sampling error is not larger than the figures shown. Here is an example of how the tables would be used: Let us say that 55 percent of men responded a certain way and 40 percent of women respond that way also, for a dif\u00ad ference of 15 percentage points between them. Can we say with any assurance that the 10-point difference reflects a real differ\u00ad ence between men and women on the ques\u00ad tion? Let us consider a sample which con\u00ad tains approximately 125 men and 125 women. Since the percentages are near 50, we con\u00ad sult Table B, and since the two samples are 125 persons each, we look for the number 12 here. This means that the allowance for error should be 12 points, and that in con\u00ad cluding that the percentage among men is somewhere between 3 and 27 points higher than the percentage among women we should be wrong only about 5 percent of the time. In other words, we can conclude with considerable confidence that a difference exists in the direction observed and that it amounts to at least 3 percentage points. If, in another case, men's responses amount to 22 percent, say, and women's 24 percent, we consult Table A because these\u00b7 percentages are near 20. We look for the number in the column headed \"125\" which is also in the row designated \"125\" and see that the number is 10. Obviously, then, the two-point difference is inconclusive. A SELF-RELIANT COUNTRY Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, on Octo\u00ad ber 27, 1987, Congresswoman MARCY KAPTUR spoke before the 17th conven\u00ad tion of the AFL-CIO in Miami. A week after the dramatic Wall Street plunge, Congresswoman KAPTUR addressed problems such as our dependence on foreign credit, and our need to balance the books. Congresswoman KAPTUR offers a sound analysis of the problems we are facing and the need to move on such important issues as education and health care in an effort to build a stronger more self-reliant country. I ask that Congresswoman KAPTUR's remarks be printed in the RECORD. The remarks follow: REMARKS OF CONGRESSWOMAN MARCY KAPTUR BEFORE THE 17TH CONVENTION OF THEAFL-CIO Thank you President Kirkland, Secretary\u00ad Treasurer Donahue, members of the Execu\u00ad tive Council, delegates, distinguished guests, Brothers and Sisters, Toledo delegates. It is an honor for me to address you, the repre\u00ad sentatives of the freest, most socially pro\u00ad gressive trade union movement on earth. More than 200 years ago, our forebears captured our nation's spirit of independence and freedom in writing the Declaration of Independence. This grant document de\u00ad clares our nation's right to be free and inde\u00ad pendent of foreign governments. Today, we are the most free of nations. Individual rights are the cornerstone of American de\u00ad mocracy. In the last century our freedoms have been expanded. We have created a so\u00ad ciety with a broad middle class, the envy of the world. We must, and will, do more. Our system of government has withstood the po\u00ad litical turmoil of unpopular wars, public cor\u00ad ruption, and assassination of our top lead-436 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 ers. As a people, we admire self-reliance, in\u00ad dependence, and opportunity for all. We remain the most pluralistic and socially di\u00ad verse nation on earth. Our diversity is the source of our democratic strength. But there is another dimension to our her\u00ad itage of freedom and independence-an eco\u00ad nomic dimension. This was dramatically brought home last week with the first con\u00ad vulsion on Wall Street and the subsequent ups and downs we have witnessed. At the center of the storm is our nation's depend\u00ad ence on foreign credit. No one is sure how much America is worth anymore. New York Times headlines on Monday, 10/19: \"For\u00ad eigners Called Key to Rates-Markets Fear Cut in Flow of Capital to U.S.\" How long can we truly remain free and in\u00ad dependent when we borrow from foreign creditors to subsidize our national income because we. as a nation, spend more than we earn? As astounding as it sounds, we are borrowing money from abroad to pay for goods we insist on importing from abroad. We as a nation are engaged in a dangerous credit binge which is deepening our reliance on foreign capital. Our government is run\u00ad ning the largest deficit in history. During the first five years of the Reagan Adminis\u00ad tration, more debt was added to the federal ledger than by all previous Administra\u00ad tions-Democratic and Republican-com\u00ad bined! The interest we are paying on this debt is astounding-$137 billion for 1987 alone! This amounts to 16.6 cents of every tax dollar you pay. I ask you, how long can the United States truly remain free and independent while we are challenged by aggressive foreign com\u00ad petitors who send a flood of money as well as foreign goods-both industrial and agri\u00ad cultural-to capture larger shares of our marketplace? Our own productive capacities are suffering from erosion and displace\u00ad ment. We have witnessed over 4 million jobs move offshore. Industries vital to our nation's defense are being sold to foreign interests-machine tools, metal fasteners, steel, autos, bearings, electronics and textiles. While U.S. exports abroad are struggling, international invest\u00ad ment in the U.S. is booming. I am a vocal supporter of \"Buy American\" in a world which is rapidly buying America. Think about it. Where are jobs and profits going when: 25% of our machine tool industry is for\u00ad eign owned. 112 the value of all autos in the U.S. market are made outside the U.S. 112 of all the textiles we buy are from for\u00ad eign sources. Steel imports are 22% of the U.S. market, and imports from countries not restricted under VRAs are rising. We import nearly half of the oil we con\u00ad sume. In 1986 the U.S. imported nearly 115 of its agricultural products as farmers in Iowa, South Dakota. Minnesota, Oklahoma and elsewhere went bankrupt. Did you see the recent Wall Street Jour\u00ad nal rankings of the world's largest compa\u00ad nies and financial institutions? Of the world's ten largest public compa\u00ad nies, 8 are Japanese. Only two, IBM and Exxon, are U.S. owned. Of the world's ten largest banks, only one is U.S., Citicorp. Seven are Japanese. Two are French. As a nation, we must reclaim America. We must learn to live within our capacity to earn. We must invest our dollars wisely in our own productive ventures. We must again assert our economic muscle in manu\u00ad facturing, mining, and agriculture. For if America loses its industrial and agricultural muscle, all the social programs which we rely upon to improve our standard of living are threatened-health care, social security, education, housing. What are the answers? First, the public pocket book must be put in order. The President was wise to accept the invitation of our Speaker, Jim Wright, to sit down with Congress to balance the books. This is for the good of the nation. The President has nothing to lose in this last year of his administration. I believe the next President of the U.S. should submit pay-as-you-go\u00ad budgets. Congress should accept no less. This means programs must have the means to pay for them built in prior to passage. As individuals, we must wean ourselves off the borrowing binge and get our private checkbooks under control. Working men and women of this nation know how to save. I've seen it firsthand in my own community. Most recently I attended the 50th anniver\u00ad sary celebration of the credit union at GM's Hydra-matic plant in Toledo. It has $20 mil\u00ad lion in assets. Shortly thereafter, new ground was broken for another multi-mil\u00ad lion dollar credit union next to the Jeep fa\u00ad cility in my District. You and the people you represent understand the meaning of thrift. Your pension funds are one of the largest sources of capital in America\u00ad earned by the workers and saved for the workers. As my Dad used to say, \"It's not how much you make, it's how much you save.\" We need a President to launch our nation on a major campaign to sell U.S. Savings Bonds to provide dollars for investment here at home-call them \"Independence Bonds.\" The American people must be called upon to rebuild our nation's financial independence. We have the ability to fi\u00ad nance our own spending. We have an obliga\u00ad tion to future generations to pay our own way. Our initial goal should be to displace all foreign purchases of U.S. bonds, an amount nearing $270 billion. In fact, when you buy holiday presents this year, buy sav\u00ad ings bonds. It's the best investment you can make in America's future. The federal gov\u00ad ernment must make it financially advanta\u00ad geous for Americans to save. It's no secret domestic savings fuel domestic investment. A dollar saved helps create a job in America. We also need a President who will sign the Trade Bill. And we need a President who will enforce it. And we need a President who will appoint respected negotiators in the international trade arena. We have people negotiating for our country who don't know a car from a truck, a machine tool from a baseball bat, or a slab of steel from a soy\u00ad bean. How I would love some of the mem\u00ad bers of this Executive Council to negotiate for America! The goal for America should no longer be free trade, but mutually bene\u00ad ficial trade-trade that expands markets, trade that raises the standard of living for all countries, trade that does not demand that concessions come from one side only. Not only do we need competence among our trade negotiators, we need integrity. Two weeks ago, it was revealed that the Reagan Administration's top official for auto trade policy, Robert Watkins, was using his official position to solicit a job with top Japanese auto firms. He was doing this at the same time as he was involved in the most important auto trade negotiations with Japan in decades. He is a national dis\u00ad grace. Members of Congress like myself forced his resignation. Now I am certain why he achieved such weak-kneed results in those negotiations. This Administration's record is filled with far too many examples of this type of breach of the public trust. Michael Deaver is only the tip of the iceberg. It's happened in machine tools. It's happened in textiles. It's happened in autos. Citizens of this country who go to work for the government of the United States in top trade positions should not be allowed to leave these posi\u00ad tions and then immediately go to work on behalf of a foreign country or company. Congressman Howard Wolpe of Michigan and I have introduced the Foreign Agents Compulsory Ethics in Trade Act, FACE IT, H.R. 1231 to put an end to this type of des\u00ad picable activity. We need your help in get\u00ad ting the legislation passed. When you go home, ask your member of Congress to sign on to our bill. The battle for fair trade is tough enough. America doesn't need trai\u00ad tors in her own camp. Let's move to another key measure to re\u00ad claim America. We can modernize the public fact of America through the establishment of a \"Build America Trust Fund.\" We can revitalize our cities by modernizing our mass transit systems and our water, sewage and drainage facilities. We can rehabilitate our schools, our fire stations, our libraries and other public buildings. We can rebuild our major county and state roads and bridges. We can improve our ports and inland water\u00ad ways. In short, we can put in place all of the public works that create and sustain jobs. This means we must tap the talent, creativi\u00ad ty, and dedication of our public sector work force. The Speaker of the House Jim Wright has proposed such a Trust Fund predicated upon the highly successful Highway Trust Fund, a pay as you go method of financing that is fair and fiscally responsible. It has not added one penny to the national debt. We can do the same to set in motion an American public renaissance to repair and upgrade this nation from coast to coast. Labor too can play a vital role in this en\u00ad deavor. Pension funds are labor's source of economic power. They are the largest source of capital investment in the U.S. By cre\u00ad atively using pension funds, the building trades in my hometown. Toledo, have helped rebuild our downtown. At the same time they have put thousands of union men and women to work. This should be done all across America. The private face of America needs to be modernized too. It is unconscionable that our nation has lost its shipbuilding capacity, that our steel mills are not state-of-the-art technology, and that U.S. made tractors are becoming a rare commodity. It is unaccept\u00ad able that Japan is quickly catching the U.S. auto industry in world market share. And it is unacceptable that, last year, almost half the patents approved by the U.S. govern\u00ad ment were granted to foreigners. The next President of this country must revisit the tax code of this land. We must reform Tax Reform to invest in America! We must stamp out hostile takeovers that make financiers rich on Wall Street but de\u00ad stroy jobs on Main Street. We must close the loopholes in the tax laws that move jobs overseas. Our tax laws must encourage U.S. industry to retool, rebuild and emphasize re\u00ad search and development here at home. To help, we must enlist the help of our own Department of Defense to use its mighty resources, purchases of over $150 billion per year, to help retool and modern-January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 437 ize U.S. industry. The national security of this nation is a function of the strength of our manufacturing industries. We must no longer tolerate the offshore migration of manufacturing capabilities in forging, cast\u00ad ings, ball bearings, machine tools, semicon\u00ad ductors, steel, electronics, refining, metals, ceramics, and composite fibers. Cutting edge technologies are essential to our defense base. We must invest in them. Reclaiming an independent America also means committing ourselves to a first-rate educational system. I have always believed education is this nation's first line of de\u00ad fense. We must reverse the trend where nearly one-third of each entering high school class drops out before earning diplo\u00ad mas. And we must make it easy for currrent workers to learn new skills in order to keep pace with technology. There is a dangerous trend in higher edu\u00ad cation as well. Japan, with only half the population of the U.S., graduates five times as many engineers as the U.S. Foreign na\u00ad tionals make up nearly half of the enroll\u00ad ment in our graduate schools in engineer\u00ad ing, mathematics and computer sciences. There is something wrong with our system which makes it more glamorous and finan\u00ad cially rewarding for our best graduates to work on Wall Street than in the factories and on the farms of America. We need an educational system and a business communi\u00ad ty which encourage America's young to make a commitment to careers vital to our nation's future. We must spark an American educational renaissance. For those students who do not have the financial means to continue their education, I propose a new type of student aid-a national program of Voluntary Serv\u00ad ice for America, that would reward partici\u00ad pants with educational benefits similar to the GI Bill. Finally, one of the most difficult issues facing the next administration will be af\u00ad fordable health care for all Americans. Today, 37 million Americans lack any type of health care coverage. One third of them are children. Many of the rest are workers who have lost their health care benefits due to lay offs and unemployment. By 1990, these numbers are expected to double. We must confront the health care chal\u00ad lenge head on. The next President of the United States, within 90 days of assuming office, should appoint a blue ribbon commis\u00ad sion comprised of labor and business, health experts, and government officials to formu\u00ad late a new program of health insurance. It worked for Social Security: it can work for comprehensive health care. Congressmen Don Pease <OH>, Martin Sabo <MN), and Ed Roybal <CA> should be part of that Commis\u00ad sion. They have already introduced forward looking legislative proposals which would make health care available to all our people. Of course, this proposal has a price tag. But cost-sharing by insurance purchasers ac\u00ad cording to ability to pay, requiring State matching funds, and saving some money through use of HMOs. I also suggest we place a tax on earnings from rapid stock transfers and the unproductive paper shuf\u00ad fling taking place on Wall Street, and target that money productively for health care for all our people. In 1776 we were a young confederation fighting for our political independence. In 1987, we are a mature nation waging an\u00ad other fight-to sustain our economic inde\u00ad pendence. Mutually beneficial trade, high education\u00ad al standards, health-care, self-reliance in fi-nance, and the rebuilding of our country. These goals can reclaim America. \"Made in the U.S.A.\" will again be a standard of ex\u00ad cellence and dependability. We can do this by investing in ourselves, in our future, and in the independence of America. David Halberstam, in his recent best-sell\u00ad ing book about the auto industry entitled The Reckoning, professes that this may be the end of the American century. I believe differently. Our country is going to regain its preeminence because of the essential strength of our democratic system. I believe this is the time to reclaim and recapture America for the 21st Century. Our task is to turn America to the next generation in better condition than we found it. As Carl Sandburg wrote- \"! see America not in the setting sun of a black night- ! see America in the crimson light of a risingsun- 1 see great days ahead, great days possible to men and women of will and vision.\" NAUM MEIMAN Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, as many of you know, I have been inserting statements in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD for the past 1 V2 years on behalf of Naum and Inna Meiman. Last January 1987 we witnessed with relief the occasion of Inna arriving in the United States to receive much needed cancer treatment. Sadly, her release came too late. Inna died 3 weeks after she entered the United States. This year, I am pleased to announce that Naum Meiman has received per\u00ad mission to leave the Soviet Union. Naum received official confirmation from OVIR on Tuesday, January 26. I am sure that many share my delight in the news; however, it is a delight which is tempered by caution. Naum is old, sick, and alone. Unfortunately, he now has to go through the formal pro\u00ad cedure alone. For someone of Naum's age, this procedure can be exhausting. I am pleased that Naum has received the news for which he has been wait\u00ad ing so long. I am pleased for Naum and I am pleased for the Soviet Union. However, I urge that the Soviet au\u00ad thorities expedite the departure proce\u00ad dure so that Naum can leave in good health and avoid his wife's fate. THE lOOTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EPIPHANY SCHOOL Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the lOOth anni\u00ad versary of the Epiphany School in New York City. Since 1888, the Epiph\u00ad any School has been providing its stu\u00ad dents with the finest in Catholic edu\u00ad cation. One hundred years ago, Epiphany opened as a Catholic grade school by Rt. Rev. Msgr. Richard Burtsell. At the time, New York City's population was increasing at an astonishing rate and a complete Catholic grade school was needed. From the outset, Epiphany's educa\u00ad tional program was conducted by the Sisters of Charity. From 1900 to 1935 they were joined by the Christian Brothers. Every pastor has been in active charge over the years and to\u00ad gether they continue to improve the school and its facilities. Today, the academic achievements at Epiphany rank it among the finest parish schools in the city-as well as one of the oldest. There is now a lay principal, James L. Hayes, and faculty teaching a highly expanded curricu\u00ad lum to approximately 360 students. More students than can be accommo\u00ad dated are continually attracted to the school. The Epiphany School rejoices in their rich history. They have a proud past and may look forward to an even brighter future. Thank you, Mr. President.e INFORMED CONSENT: NEW JERSEY e Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, abortion on demand claims the lives of nearly 4,000 unborn childen every day. Beyond this tragedy, many women suffer mental anguish and develop severe psychological problems as a result of their abortions. S. 272 and S. 273 would require informed consent by making abortionists supply women with basic information on abortion procedures, risks, and alternatives. I am convinced that if this legislation were passed, many of the abortions that are routinely and needlessly per\u00ad formed would be avoided. I ask unani\u00ad mous consent that a letter from a woman in New Jersey who supports these bills be entered into the CON\u00ad GRESSIONAL RECORD. The letter follows: FEBRUARY 1987. DEAR MR. HUMPHREY: I am a member of Concerned Women of America. In 1977 and 1978 I had two abortions. I was single, in my early twenties, and living in New York City. I went to the \"Eastern Women's Clinic\" in Manhattan. Both times my treatment was the same. After testing my urine and discov\u00ad ering that I was pregnant, they politely sat me down and told me the results of the test. After I calmed down and had a minute to understand my predicament, I told them I wanted the abortion. They quickly set up an appointment for me. They told me what to avoid eating or drinking, to bring a friend to help me home afterwards, and that was it! They never went into any detail of what was involved in the procedure. They never told of the possible consequences to me if any\u00ad thing went wrong, or even what could go wrong. They never talked about the possi\u00ad bility of excess bleeding or of possible injury to my cervix, or of the increase of miscar\u00ad riages to those women who have undergone multiple abortions * * * Nothing! I was convinced that there was no child inside of me at the time that I had these abortions. I have since learned that there were two little children living inside of me who I will never get to know. Two little people, that if I had only known about their 438 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 growth and development, they might be with me today. Do not believe the abortionists who say that there are ho psychological effects on\u00b7 the women after their abortions. I will never be able to read about, or see on television anything about abortions without my heart breaking for 'those children that I had killed. And that is exactly what I did to them. Praise God for His forgiveness and love. I know that if it was mandatory for clinics to counsel and to fully inform these women, there would be fewer abortions and fewer guilt-ridden and heartbroken women later on. Most sincerely, MRS. E. RODERED, Raritan, NJ.e WELFARE REFORM e Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy, I rise to welcome and to praise the ex\u00ad ceptional emphasis President Reagan gave to family policy in his State of the Union Address Monday evening, and in particular, his summons to make this at long last the year of true welfare\u00b7 reform. The President commented: My friends, some years ago, the Federal Government declared war on poverty, and poverty won. . .. Too often it has only made poverty harder to escape. Federal welfare programs have created a massive social problem. With the best of intentions, Government created a poverty trap that wreaks havoc on the very support system the poor need most to lift themselves out of poverty-the family. De\u00ad pendency has become the one enduring heirloom, passed from one generation to the next, of too many fragmented families. It is time-this may be the most radical thing I've said in 7 years in this office-it is time for Washington to show a little humil\u00ad ity. There are a thousand sparks of genius in 50 States and a thousand communities around the Nation. It is time to nurture them and see which ones can catch fire and become guiding lights. States have begun to show us the way. They have demonstrated that successful welfare programs can be built around more effective child support enforcement prac\u00ad tices and innovative programs requiring wel\u00ad fare recipients to work or prepare for work. The President is quite correct in call\u00ad ing attention to the energy and crea\u00ad tivity with which State governments have addressed the issue of welfare de\u00ad pendency in recent years. As Senators will know, last year the National Gov\u00ad ernors Association made welfare reform its No. 1 issue. Governor Clin\u00ad ton of Arkansas, then chairman of the association, and Governor Castle of Delaware brought their proposal to the Finance Committee, and we fash\u00ad ioned our bill <S. 1511) after their model. Time and again I have referred to it as the Governors' bill. I emphasize my agreement with the President in this large matter, as I would beg to differ on the lesser point with which he opened his discussion. Which is to say that in the War on Poverty, \"poverty won.\" It happens I was present in the Rose Garden at midmorning of August 20, 1964, on the occasion President John\u00ad son signed the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. These were his opening remarks: On this occasion the American people and our American system are making history. For so long as man has lived on this earth poverty has been his curse. On every continent in every age men have sought escape from poverty's oppression. Today for the first time in all the history of the human race, a great nation is able to make and is willing to make a commitment to eradicate poverty among its people. At no point in his remarks that day did he use the term \"war on poverty,\" but that usage became common and President Reagan surely reflects a widespread judgment that as a nation we failed in that great undertaking . Not long ago, a cover story in U.S. News & World Report, by the able young scholar David Whitman, noted that Tom Fletcher, the impoverished coal miner President Johnson visited in a vastly publicized tour of eastern Kentucky, is still poor, still living in the same cabin. Just this week an edi\u00ad torial in the New Republic, comment\u00ad ing on a decline in the quality of American civic culture, notes: One of the causes is the frustration of grinding poverty, particularly in the wake of both insincere promises and oafish efforts to end it. Indeed, some of the more eccentric programs of the time aroused consid\u00ad erable opposition. Osborn Elliott re\u00ad cently noted that in his final State of Union message, President Johnson did not even mention the Great Society and antipoverty programs. There were, you could say, auguries. I sat beside Sargent Shriver on March 17, 1964, as he presented the opening testimony on the Economic Opportu\u00ad nity Act before the House Committee on Education and Labor. When at length Chairman Powell invited the comment of a senior Republican member, the hapless legislator could only offet us a reading from John 12:18: \"For the poor always ye have with you.\" In the near quarter century since, this prophecy appears to have been borne out. About one American in six was poor in 1964. About one in six is poor today. However, Mr. President, I would off er the thought that this seeming intractable proportion is the result of two quite opposite movements. In 1964, poverty was essentially a problem of the aged. More than a quarter of the aged were poor. But programs enacted under Presi\u00ad dent Johnson and President Nixon, primarily within the Social Security area, greatly reduced poverty among the elderly. I refer especially to Medi\u00ad care, to SSI, and to the increase and subsequent indexing of Old Age Insur\u00ad ance benefits. PERCENTAGE BELOW POVERTY LEVEL 1966 1986 65 and over .......................................... ...................... . 28.5 12.4 Source: U.S. Census Bureau. This is a wholly unacceptable level of poverty among the aged. Even so it is a much reduced level, and this was anticipated. By contrast, of a sudden we look up to find there are more poor Americans today than a quarter century ago, and that the poorest group in our popula\u00ad tion are children. Moreover, in actual numbers and as a proportion of the age group-one in five-poverty is greater among chil\u00ad dren today than it was a quarter cen\u00ad tury ago. As we approach the end of the 20th century, a child in America is almost twice as likely to be poor as an adult. This is a condition that has never before existed in our history. Most probably, it has never before existed in the history of the human species.

How has this come about? At one level the answer is simple. It is, as Samuel H. Preston put it in the 1984 Presidential Address to the Population Association of America: \"the earth\u00ad quake that shuddered through the American family in the past 20 years.\" The 20 years, that is, from the begin\u00ad ning of the poverty program. Which is to say a new poverty prob\u00ad lem has emerged. As the Census has just reported, in 1986, nearly 1 in every 4-23.5 per\u00ad cent-children lived with only one parent, 21/2 times the proportion in 1960. The vast majority-89 percent\u00ad of these 14.8 million children lived with their mothers. These include 18.3 percent of all white children, 53.l per\u00ad cent of all black children, and 30.4 per\u00ad cent of all Hispanic children.

Estimates of the number of children who will live with a single parent at some point during childhood are yet more striking. Arthur Norton of the U.S. Bureau of the Census predicts that 61 percent of children born in January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 439 1987 will live for some time with only one biological parent before reaching 18. Inevitably, large numbers of these children require some form of public assistance. Further, Mr. President, in providing such assistance, we have created an extraordinary institutional bias against minority children. The Social Security Act has two pro\u00ad visions for the care of children in single parent families. The first is Aid to Families with Dependent Children, enacted into law as part of the original 1935 Social Security Act. The second is Survivors Insurance, added to the act in 1939. The characteristics of these two populations are quite different. The majority of the children receiving SI benefits are white. The majority of the children receiving AFDC are black or Hispanic.

Mr. President, in the past few days the Nation has been shocked by the reports of the conduct of FBI agents against one of their col\u00ad leagues, Donald Rochon. -So-ur-ce-: S-oc-ia-1 Se-c-ur-ity-A-dm-in-is-tra-tio-n -an-d-Fa-m-ily-S-up_po_rt_Ad_m_ini-str-at-ion; Surely, if someone in that Rose AFDC data are tor 1986; SI data are estimated for 1985.

We have cut the benefits of AFDC children by 13 percent The U.S. Government, the American people, now provide a child receiving SI benefits almost three times what we provide a child on AFDC. To those who say we don't care about children in our country, may I note that the average provision for children under SI has been rising five times as fast as average family income since 1970. We do care about some children. Ma\u00ad jority children. It is minority children-not only but mostly-who are left behind.

In terms of the present emphasis on education in the President's State of the Union, consider this table of the proportion of children in major urban school districts who are now on wel\u00ad fare. <Consider how much greater that dicted we would treat our children so, the rest of us would have predicted the troubles the children now have. Why has this come about? Why this institutional bias? I believe we know why. Welfare has become a stigmatized program. Chil\u00ad dren dependent on it-as many as one child in three before reaching 18-are stigmatized as well. That surely is what institutional bias means. Our legislation, with 56 cosponsors, is designed to get rid of that stigma by emphasizing child support and the education and training adults need to get off welfare. There has been a great deal of talk about both, but the Feder\u00ad al Government has really never backed either. Once that stigma is gone, or diminished, States will once again feel the moral obligation to maintain and even increase AFDC payments to dependent children. They are free to do so now. They do not. We want to change this. Let me declare my own conviction in this matter. AFDC should be a nation\u00ad al program, with national benefits that keep pace with inflation, in exact\u00ad ly the same way that Survivors Insur\u00ad ance is a national program with na\u00ad tional benefits. Had the Family Assistance Plan been enacted, we would now have a na\u00ad tional program. Had President Carter's Program for Better Jobs and Income been enacted, we would have a national program. As a White House aide, I helped fashion the first for President Nixon. I supported the FBI special agent Rochon has sued the FBI for racial harassment and pranks committed against him since 1983. The acts complained of are almost unspeakable-taping the faces of apes over his children 's pictures on his office desk, leaving notes on his desk threatening sexual and physical attacks against him and his wife, and forging his signature to a death and dismemberment insurance policy. All of these acts were attributed to his fell ow FBI agents. According to EEOC and Justice Department findings, agent Rochon's supervisors failed to respond when he complained of these actions against him. In fact, when Mr. Rochon complained of discrimination, the FBI tried to make him the culprit. I first learned of the abuses against Mr. Rochon in May 1986 when he was stationed in the Chicago FBI office. I convened a meeting between then-FBI Director Webster and the head of the Chicago NAACP to discuss the allega\u00ad tions. I was not satisfied that the FBI has adequately addressed Mr. Ro\u00ad chon's situation so I raised my con\u00ad cerns about it at the confirmation hearings of Judge William Sessions last September. Judge Sessions re\u00ad sponded that \"the kind of behavior de\u00ad scribed is in total contradiction to FBI policy and practice.\" To a followup question, he indicated that he would be alert to this important issue and implement appropriate changes. I am pleased that Senator JosEPH BIDEN, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has acted upon my re\u00ad quest for an investigation of the Rochon matter. I have been assured 440 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 that the committee will hold hearings on this and perhaps other instances of harassment within the agency by fell ow agents. I was also pleased to learn that, yesterday, the President was reported to have taken personal interest in this case. There is no room for the type of conduct suffered by Mr. Rochon. It is intolerable. The days are long gone when the FBI can be seen by the American people to be insensitive or above the law. The Rochon matter is an embarrassment to responsible law enforcement officials everywhere as it shakes the Nation's confidence in the Bureau and makes it that much harder for the Bureau to attain the co\u00ad operation critical to perform its work. Mr. President, I ask that the New York Times editorial on the Rochon matter and Judge Sessions' testimony be printed in the RECORD following my remarks. The material follows: QUESTION FROM SENATOR SIMON Question on Rochon v. FBI. Question: Judge Sessions, I am concerned both about the hiring practices of the Bureau in view of the low number of minori\u00ad ty and women special agents, and about the treatment and working conditions of the special agents once they join the Bureau. I want to relate to you an incident which my Chicago staff has been following for some time relating to the Omaha FBI office. A Black special agent was subjected to continued racial harassment by one or more of his colleagues in that office. In what the EEO Hearing Officer and Justice Department called \"overall, racially deplor\u00ad able treatment\", the local Omaha FBI office failed to stop the harassment after being informed of its existence, transferred the complaining black agent to an offce he did not request by applying rules to his transfer it did not apply to white agents, and eventually censured the complaining black agent for not coming forward earlier about housing discrimination he and he alone may have faced in Omaha. I might add that the Omaha office had been the subject of a prior complaint of racial harassment of one agent by others which was upheld by the Justice Depart\u00ad ment. My question is this: Can the Bureau function effectively and gain the necessary cooperation in the com\u00ad munities it serves if this type of racial at\u00ad mosphere in violation of the law exists? Answer: Of course, the FBI must not tol\u00ad erate racial discrimination in its ranks in any form. I have no personal knowledge of the incidents related in your question and I have been advised by the FBI that the kind of behavior described is in total contradic\u00ad tion to FBI policy and practice. To be sure, I would not tolerate discrimination by FBI employees in any form. In my view, the FBI significantly benefits from the inclusion of both minorities and women in the Special Agent ranks. The per\u00ad sonnel complement of the FBI should re\u00ad flect the makeup of the country. I have been advised that the FBI's current policies and initiatives in the area of minority re\u00ad cruitment and retention are in line with my own views. Be assured I will make it clear to all FBI personnel that this area is one of significant importance. Question: What steps will you take as Di\u00ad rector to ascertain whether this type of situ\u00ad ation exists in other offices, and, where it does exist, to order remedial action to per\u00ad sonnel involved and preventive action to im\u00ad prove race relations within the Bureau? Answer: As previously stated, I have no personal knowledge of the incidents de\u00ad scribed in your question and the FBI has ad\u00ad vised me that any such conduct is not con\u00ad sistent with FBI policy or practice. I have been advised that the FBI already provides EEO training to all its new Special Agents as well as to FBI management personnel during mandatory and elective courses of in\u00ad struction. Moreover, EEO counselors are as\u00ad signed to every FBI division to resolve prob\u00ad lems and alert FBIHQ to pertinent EEO matters. I have been advised further that the FBI strictly adheres to established EEO complaint procedures <i.e., Title 29, Code of Federal Regulation, Section 1613.201 et seq.> and that each FBI division's EEO program is reviewed during routine inspections con\u00ad ducted by FBIHQ. I will certainly be alert to this important issue, and to the extent that agency policy or practice in the area of EEO relations need to be enhanced or augmented appro\u00ad priate changes would be implemented. [From the New York Times, Jan. 28, 19881 BIGOTRY AND THE FBl's ANSWERS If Donald Rochon's experience typifies that of blacks in the F.B.I., then the new Director, William Sessions, has a catastro\u00ad phe on his hands. Even if it's atypical Mr. Sessions has a problem, because the han\u00ad dling of the Rochon case has sent all the wrong signals to his agents and to the public about the F.B.I.'s attitudes on race. Mr. Sessions needs to send a different signal, forcefully. And Congress needs to in\u00ad vestigate, to insure that this case does not reflect deeper racial problems in an agency that the public ought to be able to respect. Mr. Rochon is a 37-year-old F.B.I. agent who endured a vicious campaign of racial harassment by fellow agents. It started in Omaha in January 1983. A photograph of his family was defaced by someone who taped a picture of an ape's head over his son's face. A photograph of a black man's bruised, beaten face was placed in his mail slot. According to the Equal Employment Op\u00ad portunity Commission, the Special Agent-in\u00ad Charge of the Omaha office described these and other incidents as \"pranks\" that were \"healthy\" and a sign of \"esprit de corps.\" Things got worse after Mr. Rochon was transferred to Chicago in 1984. His family received obscene late-night calls and he got anonymous letters threatening him with death and his wife with sexual assault. He also received a bill for a death and dismem\u00ad berment insurance policy he hadn't request\u00ad ed. An internal F.B.I. investigation found that another agent had forged Mr. Rochon's name to the insurance application. The agent was given a two-week suspension with\u00ad out pay, but other white agents chipped in to replace his salary. There are indications that Mr. Rochon was treated especially badly because his wife is white. But other blacks say that dis\u00ad crimination is part of the F.B.I. culture, in\u00ad fecting every aspect of their employment. Like Mr. Rochon, several others have filed complaints and a majority of the agency's 400 Hispanci agents have joined in a class\u00ad action suit charging discrimination. All this has attracted attention in Congress, and a House subcommittee plans hearings shortly. They'll come none too soon. But in the first instance, it's up to Mr. Sessions to restore confidence in the F.B.I's approach to race, particularly in view of the historic cloud over its role in enforcing the civil rights laws. The public is entitled to an\u00ad swers to some reverberating questions: What does the bureau consider to be merely a prank? Does it believe that a pain\u00ad less two-week suspension is appropriate pun\u00ad ishment for an agent who commits forgery and implicitly makes a death threat against another agent? And how does it explain al\u00ad lowing a criminal investigation into these matters to languish for months, even years? A spokesman says the Rochon case was one of the first times on Mr. Sessions' agenda when he took over the F.B.I. in No\u00ad vember. That's encouraging. It's also en\u00ad couraging that President Reagan yesterday announced his personal interest in the case. It would be more encouraging still if Mr. Sessions made his findings public and, where appropriate, made heads roll.e \"48 HOURS\" WORTHLESS Mr. HECHT. Mr. President, it seems somewhat ironic that only 24 hours after Dan Rather was \"only doing his job\" on the Vice President, he did an\u00ad other job on a program ironically called \"48 Hours.\" His latest target was Las Vegas, my hometown, and Mr. Rather neglected to tell the whole story. Those who watched the CBS profile of Las Vegas might have thought they were watching the travel channel. There were neon lights, blackjack players, show girls, 24-hour wedding chapels, and therapy sessions with compulsive gamblers. I can understand why a news organi\u00ad zation would focus on the Las Vegas strip and downtown casinos, but there's so much the program missed. In all fairness, CBS is not the first news organization to stress only one aspect of Las Vegas, which is very much like other cities of comparable size. Of course, there are bright lights and show girls. But there are church\u00ad es, all types of recreational opportuni\u00ad ties at nearby Hoover Dam and Mount Charleston, and a growing high-tech\u00ad nology industry. We have the free world's largest lab\u00ad oratory in the Nevada test site, and Nellis Air Force Base provides the finest training available for our pilots and those of our allies. Mr. President, as a long-time resi\u00ad dent of Las Vegas, I understand why my constituents feel the national news media seems to always take a superfi\u00ad cial look at our fine community. I wonder if Dan Rather were to profile New York City, whether he would only focus his cameras on Times Square for an hour? Surely New Yorkers would wonder why CBS would not also include a look at Wall Street, Rockefeller Center, the Statue of Lib\u00ad erty, or Central Park. January 28, 1988 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 441 \"48 Hours\" should spend a little more time to provide the entire pic\u00ad ture. For Dan Rather it seems to be either hit or myth. Mr. President, I ask that an article entitled \" '48 Hours' Worthless\" which appeared in today's Las Vegas Review Journal by John L. Smith be printed in the RECORD. The article follows: [From the Las Vegas Review, Jan. 28, 19881 \"48 HOURS\" WORTHLESS <By John L. Smith> Television journalism smeared another pie in its face Tuesday night when CBS news aired \"48 Hours in Las Vegas.\" Imagine col\u00ad lecting all those cliches in two days or less. It must have been difficult. Why, rumor has it that next week \"48 Hours\" and Dan \"Seven Minutes\" Rather will go undercover at Disneyland to find out whether Mickey and Minnie Mouse are mar\u00ad ried or living in sin. This so-called news program was filled with the stuff usually reserved for television detective shows. In \"Vega$,\" for instance, Dan Tanna drove his convertible up Fre\u00ad mont Street, then turned left and suddenly was halfway up the Strip. The city was far more than the neon and craps tables por\u00ad trayed in \"Vega$,\" but it was fiction and such editing was understandable. To interview a few teen-age ragamuffins in their rebel-without-a-cause mode was in\u00ad accurate and damaging to a city overrun by critics. Las Vegas isn't Mayberry, but every American city has its share of troubled youth. The program missed a great opportunity to do something fresh. This city's many problems, peculiarities and positive qualities could have been illuminated. Instead, it was neon stereotypes and degenerate gamblers. The biggest theme of all-old Las Vegas emerging into corporate Las Vegas-was glossed over with a sad superficiality. Even brief mention of a few news items would have made the picture clearer: The recent trial of three Binion's Horse\u00ad shoe security guards involved in the beating of two blackjack card counters. The Binion family is a Las Vegas institution, and only a few years ago such back-room brutality never would have come to trial. The face of the gaming industry is chang\u00ad ing rapidly, and Japanese investors are a big part of the story. Las Vegas is an atomic boomtown that has grown far faster than even city planners of vision could have anticipated. \"48 Hours\" could not use fictional license as an excuse. Its lack of perspective and re\u00ad porting was shocking. Its credibility is ques\u00ad tionable. The hour-long puzzle included snippets on sports betting, professional gambling, com\u00ad pulsive gambling, troubled teens, wedding chapels and Leroy's book joint downtown. They even did the showgirl-is-really-a-good\u00ad mother-at-heart story. Like many tourists, and the producers of \"Vega$,\" the \"48 Hours\" crew didn't leave the bright lights. That's no sin. But the program 's flawed theme-have camera, will travel for two days-is no excuse for representing the youth of this city as a bunch of misguided party animals. Yes, some gamble, drink and-worst of all\u00ad violate curfew. With the exception of the Gamblers Anonymous and sports betting segments, the program added little more than cliches. The show not only failed to answer basic questions, it failed to ask them. It could have been produced by any tourist. It had all the journalistic rewards of Al Capone's safe. Perhaps it should have been titled, \"Two Nights on the Las Vegas Strip,\" or maybe \"A 49-cent Breakfast in Las Vegas.\" After watching \"48 Hours in Las Vegas,\" one question remains: What did you guys do with all that extra time?e EXCISE TAXES FOR DIESEL FUEL THAT IS USED FOR FARMING PURPOSES e Mr. DOMENIC!. Mr. President, I rise today to add my name as a cospon\u00ad sor of S. 2003, a bill introduced by my colleague, the Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM. This bill reinstates tax\u00ad free treatment for diesel fuel that is used for farming purposes. S. 2003 is a good bill. It is a needed bill. That is why I am cosponsoring the bill. In fact, if the distinguished Senator from Texas had not acted on this matter so quickly, I would have introduced the bill myself. Mr. President, S. 2003 corrects a problem created by a provision in the budget reconciliation law, which was just enacted last month. Under the old system, farmers were exempt from paying the 15-cent-per\u00ad gallon excise tax on diesel that was used for farming purposes. They were simply exempt from this tax. They did not owe the tax. And they did not have to pay excise taxes on any diesel fuel that was used for farming. Under the new system, farmers are still entitled to keep tax-free treat\u00ad ment for off-highway use. But under the recent change, farmers will be forced to pay the tax at the time of purchase. Farmers and ranchers can then apply for a refund at yearend when they file their taxes. The Federal Government will, in es\u00ad sence, have free use of farmers' hard\u00ad earned money for as much as a year, even though these farm families don't owe the tax in the first place. S. 2003 corrects this situation by removing the requirement that farmers pay the tax at the time of purchase. In general, the new law repealed all provisions permitting exempt sales beyond the wholesale level, but provid\u00ad ed four categories of up-front exempt sales, including fuel used for: First, diesel-powered trains; second, aircraft in commercial aviation; third, industri\u00ad al use other than as a motor fuel; and fourth, State and local governments. For some reason, farm use was not provided an up-front exemption. Ad\u00ad mittedly, the four that were provided an up-front exemption are nontaxable uses. But so is diesel that is used to plow a field or run an irrigation pump. Farm use should also be exempt and that is why I support S. 2003. The recently enacted tax change for diesel fuel was undoubtedly aimed at reducing fraud and abuse. But I don't think the change did anything to strengthen enforcement of the tax law. As Senator GRAMM told the Senate when he introduced the bill, this issue is very similar to the recordkeeping re\u00ad quirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Service [IRSJ a few years ago where owners of private vehicles used for business were forced to keep log\u00ad books. Those who abused the system before can continue to do so. All the change does is make life tougher for farmers by piling on more bureaucrat\u00ad ic recordkeeping rules. As far as most farmers and ranchers are concerned, this is just another Government-created hassle, just an\u00ad other instance where they are forced to keep records so the Government won't be inconvenienced while using their money. Mr. President, I for one cannot accept the recent tax change for diesel fuel. Therefore, I hope the Senate will act promptly on this legislation since the new tax requirement becomes ef\u00ad fective on April 1, 1988. Farmers and ranchers in New Mexico and elsewhere should never have to feel the effects of this ill-con\u00ad ceived change in the tax laws. I urge all my colleagues to join me in sup\u00ad porting this bill.e CATHOLIC WAR VETERANS OF NEW JERSEY e Mr. LAUTENBURG. Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, I rise to pay tribute to the Catholic War Veterans of New Jersey. Forty-five years ago, on February 3, \"The Four Chaplains\" survived the near fatal journey on the SS Dorches\u00ad ter off the coast of Greenland. Father John Washington, Rabbi Al\u00ad exander Goode, Minister Clark Poling, and Minister George Fox, \"The Four Chaplains,\" relinquished their life jackets to soldiers on the deck of the troopship which was struck by a torpe\u00ad do. As heroic survivors of this bitter winter nights experience, they were honored with the Distinguished Serv\u00ad ice Cross. On February 7, there will be a Catholic War Veterans Memorial Mass in Kearny, NJ, where we will again recognize these men in rememberance of their heroic and selfless acts. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to honor our war veterans who have given so much of themselves. The Nation should never forget the four chaplains, and the hundreds of thousands of other men and women who have dedicated themselves to pro\u00ad tect our country and our way of lif e.e MOZAMBIQUE Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, during consideration of the continuing resolu-442 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE January 28, 1988 tion, the Senate adopted two amend\u00ad ments by voice vote relating to Mo\u00ad zambique. One, offered by Senator HELMS, extends existing conditions on military assistance to Mozambique. The other, offered by Senator KASTEN, imposes conditions on the provision of both bilateral aid and funds through the Southern African Development Coordination Conference CSADCCl. I am opposed to both amendments. Of particular concern for current policy is the Kasten amendment, which jeopardizes United States assist\u00ad ance to Mozambique. Mozambique has consistently been moving in the right direction and our current policy rightly recognizes that important fact. In an effort to gain re\u00ad gional peace and stability, Mozam\u00ad bique signed the Nkomati accord with the South African Government and, unlike the South Africans, has upheld its commitments. Mozambique has joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The Gov\u00ad ernment has started to privatize land\u00ad ownership and state enterprises. In the face of growing pressure from RENAMO, Mozambique has resisted offers of increased Soviet military as\u00ad sistance and Cuban troop support. Mozambique has clearly taken sig\u00ad nificant steps in the right direction. The United States should encourage that movement not punish it.e ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11:30 A.M.

(JIMMY) QUILLEN OF TENNESSEE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, Hon. Clifford E. Sanders, presiding judge of the eastern sec\u00ad tion Tennessee Court of Appeals, a close per\u00ad sonal friend and one of Tennessee's most outstanding jurists, recently spoke to the Rotary Club of Kingsport, TN and received a standing ovation. Judge Sanders presented a comprehensive and convincing case for the enactment of a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Because of the im\u00ad portance of Judge Sanders' speech, its schol\u00ad arship and its persuasive force, I am inserting it in the RECORD at this point for the informa\u00ad tion and benefit of my colleagues. I wish others would follow Judge Sanders' lead in speaking out for a balanced budget constitu\u00ad tional amendment because the country's recent fiscal history shows we need it. ADDRESS BY HON. CLIFFORD E. SANDERS This year we celebrate the bicentennial of the birth of our great Constitution. In May, 1787, America sent its best and brightest to Philadelphia to a convention called to amend the articles of confederation, the charter under which the States had been governed since the end of the Revolutionary War. They were 55 in all, representing 12 of the 13 States. When the Convention adjourned on Sep\u00ad tember 17, the delegates had exceeded their mandate. They had written and signed a completely new document-the Constitution of the United States-to serve as the legal framework of a new nation. Since its ratification by the several States the Constitution has been amended 26 times. All but one of these amendments re\u00ad sulted in a beneficial impact upon our per\u00ad sonal freedom, our society, our economy, or our Government. Today we are here to talk about the neces\u00ad sity of amending it again to require a bal\u00ad anced budget. Not since the adoption of the Bill of Rights has there been such an urgent need for an amendment. Why is it urgent, you may ask? Because an irresponsible Con\u00ad gress has been unwilling to use restraint even in times of peace and prosperity, and is spending us into bankruptcy. I give you Thomas Jefferson as the father of a balanced-budget amendment. In 1798 he wrote, \"I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our Government to the genuine principals of its Constitution; I mean an additional article taking from the Federal Government the power of borrowing~\" Let us look at the record since those words were written. There has never been any re\u00ad striction on the amount of money the Con-gress could spend or the amount of public debt it could create except by its own resolu\u00ad tion, which it could change at will. However, the Members of Congress, during the 18th and 19th centuries and the first 30 years of this century, considered it to be an unwrit\u00ad ten requirement of the Constitution to have a balanced budget except in time of war. They likewise considered it an unwritten law that Government should pay its public debt from surpluses accumulated in time of peace. Until shortly after the turn of the 20th century, Government financing came primarily from customs duties. Then came large public works projects, such as the building of the Panama Canal, and in\u00ad creased pension benefits, which required more revenue than could be generated from customs duties. The Government needed a new source of revenue. The answer was the 16th amend\u00ad ment to the Constitution-that great money machine known as the income tax was adopted in 1911. This was a revolutionary change in our taxation system. We were now taxing human capital rather than physical capital. The fundamental source of money for the Federal coffers now was not limited to duties on what we imported, but included potentially all wages earned by our citizens. The rules of the game had changed significantly. Congress had gained a new power in its vastly expanded tax generating machine. But there was no countervailing check on this new power. At the time the 16th amendment was adopted, no need for such a check was apparent. Members of Congress at that time still believed a bal\u00ad anced budget was an unwritten part of our Constitution. For the first two decades following the adoption of the income tax amendment there were no abuses by Congress of either our tax system or deficits. Even the enor\u00ad mous deficits resulting from the First World War were reduced more than 36% from the surpluses of the following 11 years of pros\u00ad perity. But the Great Depression of the 1930's started a cycle of deficits followed by more deficits-a pattern which we have not broken in 52 years in spite of the many years of peace and prosperity. Our public debt rose more than 170% in the 1930's and more than 370% during the Second World War. Such deficits are neces\u00ad sary in such emergencies, and had our Con\u00ad gress abided by the unwritten constitutional rule, as recognized by their predecessors, that deficits created in emergencies must be paid by surpluses created in time of peace and prosperity, the public debt would now be insignificant. However, in the last 52 years there have been only seven times that we have had a surplus, and the total of those years was minimal. It was less than $30 billion dollars, and that would not pay six weeks' interest on our present public debt. During the last 5.2 years our Congress has demonstrated a total disregard for the consequences of defi\u00ad cit spending. As a result, our public debt stands at an unbelievable $2 trillion 352 bil\u00ad lion dollars today. Now, a trillio\u00b7n dollars is such an astro\u00ad nomical amount of money that it\u00b7 exceeds the imagination of the human mind on a comparative basis. But let me tell you how long the experts say it would take you to count to a trillion if you were counting dollar bills at the rate of one per second. It would take 17 minutes to count 1,000. It would take 12 days to count one million. But to count to a trillion would take 32,000 years-longer than civilization has been on this Earth! That deficit is increasing every day, but Congress still refuses to act. The last time this country had a justifi\u00ad able deficit was during the war years of 1943, '44, and '45. During those years we had an average deficit of approximately $50 bil\u00ad lion per year. But during the last six years the average deficit each year has far exceed\u00ad ed the total deficit for those three war years. This exists in spite of the fact that during that same period of time the income to our Government has been from 12 to 15 times greater than the income during the war years. Let me give you an example in round figures. In 1944 the Government had an income of $44 billion dollars, and spent $91 billion-in 1986 income was $769 billion dollars, and $990 billion was spent. In 1944 we had a deficit of $47 billion dollars. In 1986 we had a deficit of $220 billion dollars. The interest alone on our public debt in 1986 was $292.5 billion dollars. In 1987 it was $293.7 billion dollars-each year the cost of interest on our public debt is more than% of the total cost of World War II. It is interesting to note that the first pro\u00ad posal for a constitutional amendment to re\u00ad quire a balanced budget was introduced in 1936. This was no accident. Because of our response to the Great Depression, by that year we had incurred five consecutive years of budget deficits. The first time this had happened in the history of our country except in time of war. Economist Henry Simons, writing in 1936, foresaw our post-1930 experience with defi\u00ad cits, saying that without a balanced budget rule \"political control must degenerate into endless concessions to organized minori\u00ad ties.\" How right he was. When those words were written, the Members of Congress were using public funds to buy the patronage of minority groups . instead of using those funds to pay our public debt, and it has been an ongoing thing ever since. You can't balance the budget and also support every pork barrel bill that is intro\u00ad duced just to gain political support. Some hard choices would have to be made and those in Congress who are opposed to a bal\u00ad anced budget amendment don't want to have to make choices. They want to be at liberty to vote for every appropriation, re\u00ad gardless of how wasteful it is, if it will gain patronage for them. They loathe to effect economics that may not be popular with some of their constituents. It matters not to them that it costs 58 times as much to repair a Navy vessel as the same repairs would cost on a merchant ship. In 1983 the President appointed a blue ribbon commission to study waste in our Government. In just one year they discov\u00ad ered $137 billion dollars of waste and recom\u00ad mended its elimination. But not a single e This \"bullet\" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor. 444 move has been made to eliminate such waste. There are those with many years in Con\u00ad gress who have been the strongest advocates of deficit spending who would now have us believe this horrendous deficit is the result of lower taxes and increased defense spend\u00ad ing within the past few years-but nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is, it is simply the total accumu\u00ad lation of the deficits incurred during 45 of the last 52 years, plus % of the deficit car\u00ad ried over from World War I. However, it has been only during the past few years that our general citizenry have become con\u00ad cerned about deficit spending and our hor\u00ad rendous public debt. The framers of our Constitution provided two methods of amending our Constitution. One is by a vote of % of both Houses of Congress proposing an amendment. The other is by application of the legislatures of % of the States to call a convention for the purpose of proposing amendments. Such proposed amendments , whether made by Congress or by a convention called for by the State legislatures, must be rati\u00ad fied by the legislatures of % of the States. Thirty-two of our States, including the State of Tennessee, have approved applica\u00ad tions for a convention to be called to pro\u00ad pose a balanced budget. If only two more States approve such applications, then Con\u00ad gress would have no choice but to call a con\u00ad vention. A Constitutional Convention to propose amendments has never been called and those who are opposed to an amendment use all types of scare tactics to discourage such a convention. In the September issue of the \"American Legion magazine \" the pros and cons of such a convention were dis\u00ad cussed by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina. who is in favor of a con\u00ad vention, and Senator Patrick Leahy, Demo\u00ad crat of Vermont, who is opposed to it. Let me read what Senator Leahy had to say: \"No matter what proponents of such a con\u00ad vention say to allay our fears. once assem\u00ad bled, such a convention would be able to take on any issue it wants and consider any proposal. Every one of our liberties would be up for grabs. Nothing-not even our first amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of religion, nor our rights against search and seizure-none of the rights in our Constitution would be off limits. They would all be subject to revision, and I fear that rights we take for granted could be among the first to go.\" Now that is a United States Senator speaking and you would expect him to know what he is talking about. Such a statement certainly would cause almost any State leg\u00ad islator, who believed that statement, to have misgivings about voting for a call of such a convention. Now let me quote from an editorial which appeared in the Kingsport Times-News on September 17, which was the 200th birth\u00ad day of our Constitution. In addressing the horrifying results which the editor visual\u00ad ized as coming out of such a convention, he said, \"The potential consequences are horri\u00ad fying and represent the most serious chal\u00ad lenge our democratic government could face-the delegates themselves could set their own agenda. And if that happened, Americans could be witness to a 'runaway convention' that could change the Constitu\u00ad tion as it saw fit and unravel American Gov\u00ad ernment in the process.\" Both the statement of Senator Leahy and the editorial of our local newspaper presup-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS pose that once a constitutional convention is convened it could amend the Constitu\u00ad tion, it could repeal any existing amend\u00ad ments, or it could completely rewrite the Constitution at its will and nobody but the delegates to the Convention would have any right to do anything about it. But nothing could be further from the truth. What a shame it is for a United States Senator, using the prestige of his office to author an article in a magazine of national circulation, and for a member of the news media, editorializing in its newspaper for the purpose of persuading public thinking, to be so intellectually dishonest. A Constitutional Convention would have no more power to amend the Constitution than Congress has. It could only propose amendments, as the Congress can. Article 5 of the Constitution which provides for amendments, provides that Congress may propose amendments or, and I quote: \"On the application of the legislatures of % of the several States, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which in either case, shall be valid as to all intents and pur\u00ad poses, as part of the Constitution. when ratified by the legislatures of % of the sev\u00ad eral States.\" Is there anyone within the sound of my voice who would have fears that % <38) of the legislatures of the several States would ever ratify a constitutional amendment that would accomplish any of the things about which the Senator or the newspaper are so fearful? Lobbying by special interest groups op\u00ad posed to an amendment has been intense in the legislatures of the 18 States which have not asked for a convention. and misinforma\u00ad tion such as I have just read to you, has been the main weapon of their battle. If there are those who still have doubts about the propriety of calling a convention, you can take comfort in the fact that all the States which have made applications have limited them to the single purpose of a bal\u00ad anced budget. Congress could, accordingly, in calling the convention. limit it to that single purpose. If the convention exceeded its mandate, Congress could choose not to send other proposals to the States for ratifi\u00ad cation. There have been a number of resolutions offered in the Congress to require a bal\u00ad anced budget. The one that has the most support is H.J. Res. 321. It has 235 co-spon\u00ad sors. It requires both the Congress and the President to agree on a common projection of estimated receipts. Total outlays for the year must not exceed the level of estimated receipts unless % of the membership of both Houses agree by a recall vote. If actual revenues fall short of the estimate, Con\u00ad gress must provide by law for the repay\u00ad ment of the excess in the next fiscal year. The provisions of the article are waived for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect. Congressman Quillen introduced House Joint Resolution 36 requiring a balanced budget which, in my view, is a more effec\u00ad tive amendment than Resolution 321. It could be suspended only in the event of war or the threat of war. It would require a 3/4 vote of both Houses and it requires the re\u00ad payment of the national debt at the rate of at least 10% each 10 years. With 39 of the 50 States having adopted constitutional amendments to their own State constitu\u00ad tions, requiring balanced budgets, and with such amendments having been so effective in those States, and with public opinion being so strong in favor of a constitutional January 28, 1988 amendment to require a balanced Federal budget. it is difficult, indeed, to understand why Congress is so reluctant to act. The Gallop poll, CBS News poll, and New York Times poll all show that, since the middle 1970's, those in favor of a constitutional amendment range above 70%. The highest percentage, however, was 85% in the spring of this year. Mr. Steven Roberts, in the \"New York Times\" on July 16, this year, speaking of President Reagan's call for an amendment, said, \"even Mr. Reagan's most ardent sup\u00ad porters agree that there is no chance that such notions as a line-item veto or a consti\u00ad tutional amendment mandating a balanced budget will become a reality any time soon.\" These prospects might improve if one or two more States were to call for a conven\u00ad tion to propose an amendment. All of the applications made by the States provide for rescinding their application if Congress pro\u00ad poses an amendment. Also, several of the applications delay their effective date until 60 days after receipt of the application of the last required State. The purpose of this is to give Congress time to propose an amendment. For the most part, Members of Congress who have made their positions known through floor debate or committee testimo\u00ad ny, indicate they do not favor calling a Con\u00ad stitutional Convention. However, more than 135 Members of the House and Senate have joined an organization called CLUBB, which stands for \"Congressional Leaders United for a Balanced Budget.\" This organization, in its statement of purpose, declares that CLUBB believes Congress will not propose a balanced budget amendment. Therefore, CLUBB supports the States' drive for a bal\u00ad anced budget Constitutional Convention. The time has come when some restraints must be imposed on an extravagent and ir\u00ad responsible Congress. The time has come when we must realize that, with a deficit of $2 trillion 352 billion dollars, we are on the brink of economic dis\u00ad aster. The time has come when we can no longer permit the snow-ball of public debt to con\u00ad tinue to roll down hill. The time has come when we must realize that we owe a duty to our posterity. The time has come when we must realize that if we continue to travel down the road we are now traveling, the generations to come will inherit such a debt-ridden govern\u00ad ment, they will have a peasant's standard of living. The time has come when we should listen to the observation of Adam Smith, who said, \"What is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom.\" TRIBUTE TO ROBERT M. BISHOP HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR. OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I pay tribute to Mr. Robert M. Bishop of the 17th District of Ohio. Mr. Bishop will soon be named \"Veteran of the Year\" by the United Veterans Council. He began his naval military career in September 1940 aboard the USS Tennessee. He saw his first action as a fire controlman during the January 28, 1988 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Subse\u00ad quently, he was assigned to 13 amphibious operations during major sea battles in the Philippines. He was discharged in 1946 only to be called back into battle during the Korean war. Mr. Bishop served as president of the Ma\u00ad honing Valley Chapter 5 Pearl Harbor Survi\u00ad vor's Association. He is also a lay leader at the First United Methodist Church in West Austintown. It is with great pride and appreciation that I pay tribute Mr. Robert M. Bishop for his patri\u00ad otic contribution to this great country and for his dedication to the people of Ohio. I am proud to represent such an outstanding citi\u00ad zen. THE SACRAMENTO COMMUNITY OLDER AMERICAN VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS HON. ROBERT T. MATSUI OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to pay tribute to the special people of the Sacramento community who are involved with the Older American Vol\u00ad unteer Programs. These programs have been important to the community in many ways. In 197 4, the Foster Grandparent Program was established to aid disadvantaged children and youth with physical, mental, and emotional needs. These Foster Grandparents worked in schools, juvenile detention centers, hospitals, and residential treatment centers providing chil\u00ad dren with additional attention and support serv\u00ad ices. This program has proven to be remarkably successful; last year these Foster Grandparents contributed over 59, 7 46 hours of service in 29 community host agencies throughout the United States. The Senior Companion Program is another notable program that began in 1975 to pro\u00ad vide services to adults with special needs. The Developmental Disabilities Component worked with disabled to achieve their optimum level of functioning. Subsequently, this has challenged many disabled individuals to become more self-reliant. The Skilled Nurs\u00ad ing/ Adult Day Health Care Components aided health care facilities by coordinating activities for their residents. In turn, these residents were able to experience life outside of the fa\u00ad cility's boundaries. The Homebound Compo\u00ad nent provided assistance zens in This support in\u00ad cluded light housekeeping, medical transporta\u00ad tion, shopping, as well as personalized care. Last year over 51, 727 hours were volunteered into this program nationwide. The Retired Senior Volunteer Program also proved to be extremely beneficial to the com\u00ad munity. This program helped unite the time and talents of retired and semiretired individ\u00ad uals by placing them in volunteer positions in public agencies and nonprofit organizations. Last year over 600 volunteers in Sacramento County contributed nearly 140,000 hours of community service. This program gave many EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS the opportunity to learn, share, and provide support toward the community. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Sacramento and the State of California, I want to congratulate the individuals of the Older American Volunteer Program for a job well done. Their dedication to the community is ad\u00ad mirable, and I would like to take this time to offer my warmest wishes to these outstanding individuals and wish them the very best of luck in all of their future endeavors. JEWS AND RIGHTEOUS GEN\u00ad TILES-HAROLD SCHULWEIS DISCUSSES CHRISTIANS WHO RISKED THEIR LIVES TO SAVE JEWS HON. TOM LANTOS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, just a few weeks ago we marked the 43d anniversary of the ab\u00ad duction of the Swedish humanitarian, Raoul Wallenberg . During the darkest hours of World War II, he put his life on the line countless times in order to save the lives of 100,000 people. Though he was a Swedish Christian from a wealthy family living in a country which was neutral in the war, he left the security and comfort of Stockholm to risk his life to save the lives of Hungarian Jews. American Jews are beginning to acknowl\u00ad edge the lifesaving role toward Jews that many non-Jews played during World War II. Still, as Rabbi Harold Schulweis points out in an article in Moment magazine, there is still considerable resistance within the Jewish community toward acknowledging assistance given by gentiles to Jews. I feel that Rabbi Schulweis' arguments are worthy of our con\u00ad sideration. He is the rabbi of Temple Valley Beth Shalom in Encino, CA. WHY JEWS SHOULD RECOGNIZE RIGHTEOUS GENTILES <By Harold Schulweis) My children were young then. Too young, I thought, to be watching that film on the Holocaust. The film depicted the skeletal figures of starving Jews in the camps, men and women, elongated embryos with sunken eyes rather than fully grown adults. My am\u00ad bivalence tore at me. On the one hand, I wanted my children to mature, to know the depth of Jewish tragedy. My father called it oismenschlen zich-to mature, to overcome childlike fantasies, to face reality. On the other hand, I wondered whether the docu\u00ad mentary would lay a stone upon their hearts, make them feel that to be Jewish is to be caught in a leprous circle. I continued to teach the exalted Jewish view of human beings as created in God's image, in contrast to the Christian pessi\u00ad mism that introduces Adam's descendants as creatures born in transmitted sin. I con\u00ad tinued to cite the Psalmist's praise of human beings as \"but lower than God.\" But the overwhelming illustrations of human conduct sustained an image of human venal\u00ad ity, corruption, betrayal, persecution. The Holocaust was, after all, not simply an episode in Jewish history, but a para\u00ad digm of the broken human condition. And, as for its specific Jewish meaning, the 445 Shoah had come to serve as the compelling metaphor of Jewish existence-past, present and future. That view has hard evidence on its side: the collusion against the Jews, the feigned deafness of onlookers, the studied ambiguity of the Church, the self-induced paralysis of the Allies. Was there any empirical evidence to bol\u00ad ster the Jewish outlook? Aside from the des\u00ad perate preaching of Jewish humanism, what evidence was there to support the claim of God's presence in human nature and the Jewish faith in Him and in the crown of His creation? I was sifting the ashes of the Shoah to un\u00ad cover an ember of hope. I was searching for another side to the Holocaust when I came across Philip Friedman's \"Their Brothers' Keepers\". It was a revelation for me. There were tears here, but out of a different well. For here were peasants, priests, farmers, teachers who refused to rationalize complic\u00ad ity with the predators. Here were Christians from all walks of life and in every Nazi-controlled country who forged passports, hid Jewish families, fed the hungry, the hunted. Who were they? What kind of Poles, Germans, Dutch, Bel\u00ad gians, Bulgarians, Christians would risk their lives and those of their families to save people not of their own faith? In the early 1960s I found myself increas\u00ad ingly drawn to this phenomenon, to the rescue of Jews by non-Jews. I spoke to rab\u00ad binic and lay audiences, appealed to nation\u00ad al Jewish organizations and to secular, aca\u00ad demic circles to engage in a serious empiri\u00ad cal study and moral interpretation of these acts of altruism in the midst of the unspeak\u00ad able atrocities of the Holocaust. I founded and chaired the Institute for Righteous Acts, some of whose archives are housed at the Judah Magnes Museum in Berkeley. People listened, nodded assent, some coming forth to volunteer the information that they and others they knew had indeed been rescued by gentiles. But there persist\u00ad ed and persists to this day a near-palpable resistance to the suggestion that the rescu\u00ad ers ought to be studied, their motivations better understood, their lives celebrated. I still find a lack of enthusiasm about the phenomenon of Christian rescue of Jews, and I wonder about the reasons for this odd reserve. I wonder, and I speculate: Undeniably, there are people, pseudo\u00ad scholars, as well as a world superpower, who find it hard to admit the uniqueness and im\u00ad mensity of Jewish suffering. In the name of some perverse notion of universalism, they begrudge Jews the particularity of their an\u00ad guish. They prefer to deracinate the Jewish victims, to bury them anonymously. They play a sickening numbers game-not six, but \"merely\" four or three or two million Jews died. They so twist history that they define the Holocaust as a self-serving manipulation of gullible people for the sake of eliciting favor for the kin of its \"alleged\" victims. There is no limit to their torture of history. In such a hostile environment, it is under\u00ad standable that Jews should guard jealously the treasures of Jewish suffering; and that they grow anxious lest focusing attention upon the behavior of gentile rescuers de\u00ad flect attention from the suffering of those so brutally violated. The light must not be allowed to eclipse the darkness. Some sus\u00ad pect that the evidence of the acts of right\u00ad eous gentiles may be used to whitewash the villainy. Others measure the numbers of rescuers against the numbers of predators and find 446 them so scandalously disproportionate as to mock the effort to study and publicize the good. For them, the stories of the righteous gentiles are minor footnotes that do not enter the text. Inadvertently but inevitably, the memory of the acts of righteous gentiles is thus erased. Ask my children or yours about the names and acts and fate of the heroic Christian collaborators who hid Anne Frank's family. Social scientists have biases of their own. One major prejudice is the a priori convic\u00ad tion that humans are basically ignoble, ex\u00ad ploitive, aggressive, hurtful. The bias is pre\u00ad sented in the name of realism and objectivi\u00ad ty. Tough-minded, hard-nosed scientists insist that the qualities of softness and be\u00ad nevolence are the surface masks people wear to hide their coarser motivations. Scratch a saint and discover a sinner. Be\u00ad neath altruism lies a baser universal egoism. That \"scholarly\" tradition is inherited from Thrasymachus, Machiavelli, Hobbes and Nietzsche, a secular version of original sin. It is presented in full meta-psychologi\u00ad cal dress in the pessimism-realism of Sig\u00ad mund Freud, for whom altruism, at root, is a form of cultural hypocrisy. Who has the courage to dispute the evidence, Freud asked in his Civilization and Its Discontents, that man is to man a wolf-homo homini lupus. Others, philosophers and psychologists, have sought to dismiss the reality of altru\u00ad ism by showing that since self-sacrifice offers egotistic gratification to the helper, it is not for the sake of another. According to this spurious logic, saint and sinner, rescuer and pursuer are reduced to a common egois\u00ad tic denominator. Such a sophisticated prejudice may help explain why there are so few studies on al\u00ad truism in comparison with studies on auth\u00ad oritarianism, why the character and motiva\u00ad tion of evil people are so much better re\u00ad searched than those of good people, why the term \"altruism\" is introduced so late (by August Comte in the 19th century) into the vocabulary of social science. There is something else that keeps the study and celebration of altruism at arm's length. For all the paeans in praise of good\u00ad ness, it presents its own threatening chal\u00ad lenges. Evil men and women may be less of a threat to our sense of self than truly good persons. An extreme case: Compared to Eichmann, we are saints. But measured against a Fritz Graebe, an Alexander Roslan an Andre Trocme, our claim to virtue is shaken. Read\u00ad ing the coroborated stories of their rescue behavior we may wonder: Would you or I hide these hunted families in our homes, feed them, clothe them, offer them sanctu\u00ad ary, knowing that venal informers and sa\u00ad distic predators roam about? Would you or I do this for men, women and children who are strangers to our faith? Despite the rhe\u00ad torical adulation of the righteous rescuers, do we want to raise our children to emulate these moral heroes, so selflessly to taunt death? The challenge in confronting goodness may be further complicated because the heroes are not Jews. That fact shakes the character of \"split thinking.\" There is a lure to divide the world into two parts, a Mani\u00ad chean temptation to divide the world into children of dark and children of light. The schismatic thinking that \"black\u00ad Washes\" outsiders and male\u00ad dictions against the \"others.\" Confronted by righteous gentiles, we are made to face a EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS mottled reality. The outside is not all dark with treachery. The \"split mind\" is frustrat\u00ad ed by exceptions, admixtures, the stuff that challenges generalizations. Righteous gentiles-even Germans, Poles and Ukrainians-upset the certainties of of \"always\" mind\" to ignore the com\u00ad plexity of character that punctures the iron curtains of the mind. In our case, denial and avoidance of gentile altruism are strategies to preserve the barriers of split-thinking judgments. But now, four decades later, some enter the cavern with a small lantern to examine the aftermath, to sift through the ashes of destruction, to find some residue of hope. Slowly a meager literature of scholarly re\u00ad search and popular acknowledgement of the acts of the righteous is emerging. Nechama Tee has just published a pioneer study on Christian rescue of Jews in Nazi\u00ad occupied Poland, When Light Pierced the Darkness <Oxford University Press). Doug\u00ad las K. Huneke's book, the Moses of Rovno <Dodd, Mead and Company), tells the stir\u00ad ring story of Fritz Graebe, a German Chris\u00ad tian who risked his own life and the lives of his family to lead hundreds of Jews to safety during the Holocaust. Professor Samuel Oliner is engaged in wide-ranging research on the altruistic per\u00ad sonality, based on in-depth interviews of gentile rescuers. Pierre Sauvage's documen\u00ad tary of Andre Trocme and the rescuers in the French village of Le Chambon is now available. A film based on Schindler's List is in production. These are hopeful signs that the passive resistance and converging biases against research and publicity of the right\u00ad eous gentile may be changing. On moral grounds alone, the neglect of the phenomenon must be overcome. Jews, who are witness to the capabilities of human beings to torture and destroy, are also witnesses to the human capacities to save and rebuild. That witness is vital for healing the traumatized conscience of hu\u00ad manity. The post-Holocaust generation, the children of those who survived, needs to be helped to trust again. The precarious imbalance that places all weight of evidence on the depressive side of the scale must be corrected by the empirical evidence of human benevolence. The preju\u00ad dice that distorts the character of human nature and confines it to the \"nasty, brutish and short\" must be countered by the testi\u00ad mony of those who in hellish times experi\u00ad enced long-term, self-sacrificing care and concern. Research on altruistic behavior must be supported; greater attention must be paid this repeatedly neglected area of Holocaust studies. I do not fear that the evidence of rescue will trivialize the monstrosity of evil. The inference is inescapable: There are no heroes without villains, no rescue of the hunted without pursuit by the hunters. To the contrary, those Jews and non-Jews who may fear entering the cave lest they be en\u00ad veloped by the despair of no exit-there are many such-may be encouraged to overcome their fear if they know that even there they will behold sacred sparks. Light is needed to illumine the darkness. Moral heroes of flesh and blood are needed to resuscitate our ex\u00ad hausted morale. We are presented with an ironic symme\u00ad try. The denial or denigration of the num\u00ad bers of righteous gentiles who helped is the reverse side of the pernicious denial and minimizing of the numbers of victims who suffered. One cries that there were not so January 28, 1988 many victims, the other cries that there were not so many heroes. There are always too few m9ral heroes, always too few of the righteous whose pres\u00ad ence could have saved Sodom. Does that not make the memory of those there were all the more precious, all the more important? The memory of the righteous must not be swept away together with the wicked\u00ad surely not by heirs to a tradition that de\u00ad clared that for the sake of 36 righteous people the world is preserved. The 36 must be honored. We must retrieve the meaning of their acts, discover their fate and sweeten the re\u00ad mainder of their lives. There are too many reports of rescuers who have fallen on hard times, who are unsung and uncared-for. Theology has dealt with reward and punish\u00ad ment as prerogatives of God both in this and in the next world. But we are not help\u00ad less in this arena. We correctly bring to task the murderers of innocent people, seek them out and seek justice. The world is not helpless. The murder of millions has no statute of limitations. But neither are we powerless to reward. It is not too late for the world Jewish community to form a Foundation to Sustain the Righteous Gentiles, many of whom were tragically ostracized by anti-Se\u00ad mites in their native lands, many of whom are in poor, even desperate economic cir\u00ad cumstances today. The good must be re\u00ad warded in this world, in this time and by our community. Jewish remembering is a sacred task. As important as the mandate to remember what Amalek did is the moral imperative to recall what Shifrah and Puah did <Exodus 1:15-22). Theologians, ethicists, educators-of all faiths-must be enlisted jointly to assimilate and interpret the largely ignored evidence. And we Jews own a testimony of goodness that deserves to be fully heard. \"Ye are My witnesses,\" says the Lord. A celebrated mi\u00ad drash in Pesikta d' Rav Kahana goes on to explain the intent of God's words. \"If ye are My witnesses, then I am God. And if not, then I, as it were, am not God.\" There is godliness in the world-and we Jews have the great good fortune to be, if we permit ourselves to be, its witnesses, wit\u00ad nesses to God's presence in our midst. Not to testify to the spark of human decency in the darkness is to betray our oath. We owe witness to our God and to our grandchil\u00ad dren. PERSPECTIVE ON THE PALESTINIANS HON. JAMES J. FLORIO OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. FLORIO. Mr. Speaker, the events in the last 2 months in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and in Jerusalem in Israel have given many around the world fuel for concern. The situation is not one easily resolved from the safe distance enjoyed by those who are not on the scene. But for those who are per\u00ad sonally involved in the conflict, both the Arabs and the Israelis, the resolution of this conflict will not be achieved through simplifications of the conflict. January 28, 1988 Most recently, one of those simplifications has been the comparison of the State of Israel to the repressive state mechanism of apartheid in South Africa. Yet, the solutions suggested in the recent weeks sometimes overlook the complexity behind the events in the Middle East. It has often become all too simple to attach a label and the corresponding stigma to the players in this crisis. What is ultimately required if peace in the Middle East is to have a chance at succeed\u00ad ing is a balanced perspective on all sides and a little caution before drawing inappropriate comparisons. A recent editorial from the Philadelphia In\u00ad quirer by Donald Kimelman goes a long way toward addressing in a thoughtful and insight\u00ad ful fashion some of the issues at stake in the Middle East. I hope that this editorial will re\u00ad store some of the objectivity that is required for the resolution of the crisis in the interests of Israel's national security and of the free\u00ad doms of all parties concerned in the areas of rioting. The article follows: THE ISRAELI CRISIS: ARE THE MEDIA TO BLAME? <By Donald Kimelman> The New Republic, which has a keen eye for the media's foibles, has an item in its current edition contrasting the play of two stories in the Washington Post: On Jan. 4, the Post's front page carried the headline, \"Israeli Soldier Kills Arab Woman.\" A day earlier, way back on Page 27, the Post ran a two-paragraph news brief about a massacre in Northern Brazil in which state troopers, their guns blazing, rushed a group of protesting gold miners and slaughtered perhaps 100 people. The magazine headlined its pointed little comparison: \"It's not what you do, it's where you do it.\" Such examples of the selective way that the news media cover the world's overabun\u00ad dance of cruelty and misery are inevitably raised every time there is a new flare-up in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Critics ask why Israelis killing Arabs is so much bigger news than Arabs killing Arabs, something that is happening all the time\u00ad though generally out of sight o.f the cam\u00ad era's eye. Most Americans probably weren't even aware that Shiite militiamen has been con\u00ad ducting a three-year siege of Lebanon 's bat\u00ad tered Shatila refugee camp until the kind\u00ad hearted Shiites recently called a halt to the killing in solidarity with the rebellious Pal\u00ad estinians in the West Bank and Gaza. The death toll in the longrunning \"camps war\" has been estimated to exceed 2,000; the death toll in the current uprising in the Is\u00ad raeli-occupied territories is 38. There are some easy arguments to explain why what the Israelis are doing has gotten vastly more attention than what the Shiites were doing. Israel, as a westernized nation, is held to a higher standard; Israel receives huge amounts of American aid; continuing unrest in Israel's occupied territories could force some kind of historic change in the Middle East stalemate. All that said, there is no question that what is happening in the occupied territo\u00ad ries has gotten more coverage because the Israeli authorities allow journalists to wit\u00ad ness the violence and to send back the vivid stories, photos and footage that then domi\u00ad nate the news. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS Israel is thus paying a heavy price for its openness, which seems unfair. Is the daily violence in Afghanistan, for example, any less newsworthy because the Soviets and Af\u00ad ghans have never allowed journalists into any of the war zones? I mention Afghanistan because, in my pre\u00ad vious assignment as a Moscow-based corre\u00ad spondent, it used to gall me that the Soviets were able to maintain their worldwide peace offensive, in part, because they never let anyone get close to their dirty little war. It is easier to appear sincere about wanting to reduce bloodshed around the world, if the nightly news is not carrying footage of your armored regiments destroying Afghan vil\u00ad lages. Lately, however, I have begun to realize that the Soviet advantage was illusory. Muting the war didn't end it. Instead, it al\u00ad lowed the Soviets to continue pursuing a fruitless, destructive and self-destructive policy longer than simple common sense would have allowed. At this writing, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, an eminently practical man, is trying to figure a way to get the troops home. And so, iron\u00ad ically, the Soviet news media have finally been allowed to convey a small sense of the human cost of that eight-year misadven\u00ad ture. The situation in South Africa more closely parallels what's happening in the occupied territories, but with this important differ\u00ad ence: In the spring of 1986, the South Afri\u00ad can authorities concluded that by severely restricting news coverage of black unrest\u00ad and by locking up thousands of potential troublemakers-it could actually stop the vi\u00ad olence. The tactic worked. With the exception of black-on-black violence-the kind the South Africans love to see publicized-the rebel\u00ad lion has subsided. But South Africa has merely postponed its time of reckoning and, in choosing to tough it out, has become even more of a pariah among nations. Its sheltered white residents continue to have no real sense of the violence and rage that exists all around them. There, too, the gains of censorship are likely to prove illusory. Which brings us back to the situation in Israel. The clashes between troops and dem\u00ad onstrators have dominated not just the Western news media, but the Israeli media as well. People there are keenly aware of what is happening in the occupied territo\u00ad ries, which doesn't mean that they are all furious with their government. If anything, this new threat to Israel's security is moving the country to the right. But that's how things work in an open so\u00ad ciety. The Israelis know what is happening. They also know that the world is watching and making harsh judgments based on what it sees. Come fall, they will again go to the polls to choose between a party that is will\u00ad ing to trade land for peace and one that argues for a continued hard line. Whatever the outcome, the choice will not be made out of ignorance. It could be argued that the American news media are skewing the process by plac\u00ad ing undue emphasis on Israel's repressive measures. But, if anything, the harsh pub\u00ad licity has served as a warning shot to the Is\u00ad raeli authorities, forcing them to curb their tactics before their Western allies felt com\u00ad pelled to take some kind of political action. As a result, fewer Arabs are dying. And if that trend continues, the story will die, too. 447 CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT: AN IMPORTANT REFORM HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE OF MAINE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. Speaker, today I am intro\u00ad ducing legislation to close an important loop\u00ad hole in the child support enforcement statute. The Child Support Enforcement Amend\u00ad ments of 1984 require the withholding of child support payments from wages when past due payments equal 1 month's support. Employers are required to comply with this wage with\u00ad holding. However, a serious flaw in this system has recently come to my attention. Under regulations set by the Department of Health and Human Services, an employer who withholds child support payments from an em\u00ad ployee's wages has 1 O days to turn that pay\u00ad ment over to the appropriate State agency for distribution. The problem is that there is no penalty for an employer who waits longer than 1 o days to turn over the support payment. The law does give the State the power to take such an employer to court. However, if this is done, the employer can come to court with the check for the overdue payments and the case is dropped. Meanwhile, what hap\u00ad pens to the family dependent on the support payments? As the payments sit with the em\u00ad ployer, where they can be earning interest for that employer, the custodial parent is usually forced to turn to Federal welfare assistance. The continuation of court ordered child sup\u00ad port payments to custodial parents is essential to the well-being of their children. Many of these parents count on weekly support pay\u00ad ments to provide for their children's basic needs. For this reason, I am introducing legis\u00ad lation to create a Federal penalty for employ\u00ad ers who do not send wages withheld for child support to the appropriate agency within 1 O days. As we in Congress emphasize the need for efficient Federal welfare spending, I believe this legislation does just that. I urge my col\u00ad leagues to support this needed reform. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CIVIL SERVICE DUE PROCESS AMENDMENTS HON. PATRICIA SCHROEDER OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, today I, along with my colleagues Representative FRANK HORTON and Representative MERVYN DY MALLY, are introducing the Civil Service Due Process Amendments of 1988. This bill contains five substantive sections which were reported by the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service on August 5, 1987, as part of H.R. 25, the Whistleblower Protection Act. There is nothing in the bill which has not been subject to hearings, committee deliberations and approval. 448 Before describing the provisions of the bill, let me explain why we are breaking up the whistleblower bill. After the committee report\u00ad ed H.R. 25, Congressman FRANK HORTON persuaded the administration to develop a form of the legislation which they could sup\u00ad port. In a series of negotiations, the adminis\u00ad tration representatives stated that the five sections contained in the bill I am introducing today were not appropriate for a whistleblower protection bill because they did not directly relate to whistleblower protection. Represent\u00ad ative HORTON and I are still trying to find some compromise on H.R. 25 which deals with the issue and satisfies all the interested parties. Nevertheless, there is no reason not to move these other worthwhile sections sep\u00ad arately. Here, then, is what the Civil Service due process amendments do. Section 1 is a short title. Section 2 is the text of H.R. 555, legislation introduced by Congressman DYMALL v to pro\u00ad vide Merit Systems Protection Board appeal rights to certain employees in the excepted service. Similar legislation passed the House during the last Congress. Passage of this leg\u00ad islation has been made all the more urgent by the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court last Monday in United States versus Fausto. In this decision, the Supreme Court cut off an al\u00ad ternate channel of judicial review for excepted service employees, saying that Congress, in passing the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, had intended to deprived excepted service employees, other than those with veterans preference, of the right to challenge adverse actions. This bill provides those appeal rights. Section 3 provides for the reinstatement of employees after they win their MSPB cases at the regional office level. Now, they have to wait the extra 2 years until the agency ex\u00ad hausts its appeal to the full board. Section 4 says that a Federal employee who the agency wants to fire and who is eligi\u00ad ble for an annuity can take his annuity and still challenge the adverse action before the MSPB. Currently, an employee who elects an annuity is considered to have retired voluntari\u00ad ly and cannot challenge the adverse action. Section 5 requires that MSPB hearings be held near the job site unless it is cheaper for the Government to hold it elsewhere. Now, MSPB hearings are held in certain designated regional cities. Section 6 requires that the MSPB be named the respondent in appeals of its decisions. Currently, the agency is named the respond\u00ad ent and Justice litigates the case. These provisions are effective for cases filed after the date of enactment. A TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT CHIANG CHING-KUO OF TAIWAN HON. MIKE ESPY OF MISSISSIPPI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. ESPY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share this tribute to a most honorable man, President Chiang Ching-kuo of the Republic of China, whose recent death on January 13, EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS 1988, sent shock waves through his people. The people of that island nation lost their leader and they have sadly mourned his pass\u00ad ing as if they had lost a part of their family. It was only last April I met and spoke to Presi\u00ad dent Chiang while in Taipei wishing him a happy birthday. President Chiang left behind an island coun\u00ad try that enjoys unsurpassed economic pros\u00ad perity and more importantly, he left behind a constituency that is now more comfortable saying what it thinks. I saw it so clearly when I visited Taipei last year, and became readily impressed with the openness and industrious\u00ad ness of the people. Indeed, the President's true legacy was the institution of true political reforms during the last 12 months of his life. During this brief period; he lifted martial law, he allowed oppo\u00ad sition political parties to exist; he relaxed con\u00ad trols of newspapers; and he permitted Taiwan residents to visit their relatives on the main\u00ad land. Mr. Speaker, it seems that overnight Presi\u00ad dent Chiang's political initiatives transformed how his people think and act. Despite open political demonstrations by the opposition po\u00ad litical party which greatly irritated the conserv\u00ad ative segments of society, President Chiang, as was his will only nine days before his death, noted his desires: \"It is * * * my hope that you actively carry constitutional democrat\u00ad ic development without interruption.\" And I believe, his will and his direction will be car\u00ad ried out. We are all hopeful that the pace of democ\u00ad ratization, in accordance with the late Presi\u00ad dent's wishes, will continue in the Republic of China under the leadership of President Lee Teng-hui. CLEAN LAKES FUNDING HON. ARLAN STANGELAND OF MINNESOTA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. STANGELAND. Mr. Speaker, for weeks now we've been learning about \"special\" or unwarranted provisions contained in the fiscal year 1988 continuing resolution, House Joint Resolution 395. Each day reveals a new sur\u00ad prise in the massive funding bill. Today, though, I want to bring to the House's atten\u00ad tion a glaring omission in the appropriations bill. The HUD-independent agencies title does not provide a single penny for the Environ\u00ad mental Protection Agency's clean lakes pro\u00ad gram. Congress must act quickly to restore the funding for this relatively small but crucial environmental program. Section 314 of the Clean Water Act estab\u00ad lishes a national program to protect, restore, and improve the quality of publicly owned freshwater lakes. Since 1980, EPA has provid\u00ad ed financial and technical assistance to States for classifying lakes, identifying techniques for restoring water quality, and implementing cleanup and control projects. The Water Quality Act of 1987 strengthened the section 314 program by increasing and ex\u00ad tending the authorizations, providing for lake restoration plans, and establishing a new na-January 28, 1988 tional cleanup demonstration program. This was in direct response to testimony from State water officials and a ground swell of support from citizens and other lake users. The House-and Senate-passed fiscal year 1988 appropriations bills each contained $15 million for the section 314 program. This rep\u00ad resented a tripling of the funding level in the fiscal year 1987 appropriations law. Congress increased the appropriations because of the program's enormous past success, future im\u00ad portance, and continuing public support. Unfortunately, the conferees on the fiscal year 1988 continuing resolution deleted all funding for section 314. I understand they faced difficult constraints and had to make some unpopular decisions. But I also under\u00ad stand that a reinvigorated and adequately funded clean lakes program will pay enormous dividends. As a Minnesotan and as the rank\u00ad ing Republican member of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee's Sub\u00ad committee on Water Resources, I know the value of clean lakes and the valuable contri\u00ad butions EPA can make to State and local pro\u00ad grams. Already, we are hearing of numerous prob\u00ad lems and setbacks in State and local efforts because of the unexpected zero funding level in the continuing resolution. State applications for this year's grants are put on hold indefi\u00ad nitely and hundreds of watershed and conser\u00ad vation districts are scrambling to reassess their cleanup goals and schedules. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I intend to lend my full support to legislation in the coming months to restore the section 314 funding. I urge each Member to join me in this effort. We can't wait until another year-end continu\u00ad ing resolution. We need appropriations for this crucial program to be available during this fiscal year-we can't afford to put it off until next year. The program is simply too impor\u00ad tant and too successful to be put in jeopardy due to last-minute budgetary decisions. THE AIR TRAVEL RIGHTS FOR BLIND INDIVIDUALS ACT HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR. OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation that would prohibit air\u00ad lines from discriminating against blind passen\u00ad gers. I have been involved in this issue for 2 years and I believe the time has come to force both the Department of Transportation and the airlines to directly address this serious problem. My bill entitled the Air Travel Rights for Blind Individuals Act, would amend the Feder\u00ad al Aviation Act of 1958 by adding the following provision: A carrier shall not use visual acuity or a passenger's use of a white cane or dog guide as the basis for establishing any restriction on seating in aircraft. On December 2, 1987, I, with Matthew Sco\u00ad cozza, Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs at DOT to discuss this January 28, 1988 issue. I asked for this meeting after the Na\u00ad tional Federation of the Blind walked out of negotiations with DOT over the promulgation of regulations to prohibit discrimination against handicapped individuals by the airlines. These regulations are required under the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-435). DOT proposed that the regulations be drafted through a negotiated rulemaking process. Although it was a constructive meeting, the regulations under the Air Carrier Access Act may not be implemented for at least another year. It is my hope that this legislation will focus attention on the blind community and the unique problems they have encountered. No clear cut evidence exists to indicate that a blind passenger sitting in. an emergency row exit seat poses a safety threat to other pas\u00ad sengers. Despite this, the airlines, with the ap\u00ad prent support of the Federal Aviation Adminis\u00ad tration, will not allow blind persons to sit in emergency exist row seats. Mr. Speaker, I hope to continue working with both the blind community and DOT to settle this issue once and for all. JAPANESE AMERICAN COMMUNI\u00ad TY TO HONOR BARNEY FRANK HON. ROBERT T. MATSUI OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, this Saturday, January 30, 1988, our colleague from Massa\u00ad chusetts, BARNEY FRANK, will be honored by the Japanese American community for his outstanding work on redress legislation. This honor comes as no surprise, for BARNEY'S tireless work as chairman of the Subcommit\u00ad tee on Administrative Law and Governmental Relations was crucial to the development and eventual passage of H.R. 442, the Civil Liber\u00ad ties Act of 1987. BARNEY'S outstanding efforts on behalf of this legislation add to a lengthy list of his con\u00ad tributions to the cause of civil rights and human dignity. His involvement in the civil rights movement, his career in the Massachu\u00ad setts House of Representatives, and his record in Congress distinguish BARNEY as a foremost advocate for justice and fairness. BARNEY FRANK has established himself as a passionate and articulate defender of the prin\u00ad ciples which have made the United States the great Nation it is today. Mr. Speaker, by forcing Japanese Ameri\u00ad cans into internment camps, the United States Government strayed from its pursuit of liberty and justice. We are fortunate, however, to have a colleague like BARNEY FRANK to help this Nation straighten its course. 19-059 0-89-15 (Pt. 1) EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS SAN FRANCISCO GIRLS CHORUS IS CHOSEN TO PERFORM IN HUNGARY HON. TOM LANTOS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to announce today that when the Bela Bartek International Choir Competition is held in Hun\u00ad gary in July, the San Francisco Girls Chorus will be representing the United States-indeed it will be the only group from America at this most important event. Hungary is the world center \u00b7for choral music, especially for girls and young women. Competing there means that the San Francis\u00ad co Girls Chorus has reached the top level of girls choirs in the United States. Founded in 1978 by Elizabeth Appling at the suggestion of Kurt Herbert Adler and Richard Bradshaw of the San Francisco Opera, the chorus is made up of girls from 7 to 16. Rehearsals are twice weekly, and the chorus members, in ad\u00ad dition to choral performances, participate in dramatic productions and a summer camp. Advanced singers are selected to sing with the San Francisco Opera. The group has toured the Pacific Northwest, West Germany, England, and has performed at the White House. Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the San Francisco Girls Chorus and everyone associ\u00ad ated with it as they look forward to competing on a world stage with the world's best choirs. They are a credit to San Francisco and to America. DUMPING ON \"OCEAN DUMPING'' HON. JAMES J. FLORIO OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. FLORIO. Mr. Speaker, the waste man\u00ad agement crisis facing the Nation has only in\u00ad creased the urgency to resolve the dilemma in disposal and treatment methods. With more wastes accumulating and overflowing from landfills, one of the more pressing environ\u00ad mental effects of the resultant dumping has been on the ocean. The landfill crunch makes several things ap\u00ad parent. First, since only so much waste can fit into a limited amount of land, available space for waste disposal is increasingly going out of circulation. Better approaches to deal with the crisis are needed. Yet despite its mandate, the Environmental Protection Agency is not enforcing the already existing laws regulating disposal and ocean dumping. Second, with the need to ensure that the Nation's wastes are not released into the eco\u00ad system to damage any further the fragile envi\u00ad ronment, not enough has been done to em\u00ad phasize the existence of available technol\u00ad ogies in coping with the crisis. In the economics of the garbage crisis, the demand for disposal space has been exceed\u00ad ing the supply. With nowhere to go, more and 449 more municipal sludge is winding up in our Nation's water systems. And since much of those wastes carry the threat of pollution, there is a corresponding need to treat the wastes to a greater extent. In the State of New Jersey, with the closing of many important landfills because of a lack of available capacity, the ocean has become the quick fix in getting rid of whatever unwant\u00ad ed material our Nation produces. However, almost invariably included in the waste material discharged into the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and into the Nation's es\u00ad tuaries and river systems are such hazardous pollutants as PCB's and substances such as plastic. In New Jersey, half of the total sludge pro\u00ad duced within the boundaries of the State is eventually discharged offshore into the Atlan\u00ad tic Ocean. When the totals across the Nation are added up, the amount of waste spilling into the Nation's aquatic ecosystems tops more than 15 million tons, including 7 million metric tons of municipal sewage and 8 million metric tons of dredged material. Recently, under the auspices of the Trans\u00ad portation, Tourism, and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee chaired by Congressman THOMAS LUKEN, a field hearing was held in Hoboken, NJ. At this hearing, industry and community leaders voiced not only their con\u00ad cerns about obstacles in the development of these technologies but also their demonstrat\u00ad ed potential in reducing the toxicity and amount of wastes that are dumped in the ocean. Concentrating on alternative technologies available currently or in the near future once testing of those technologies has been com\u00ad pleted, the hearing focused on two concerns. First of all, the technologies and the re\u00ad sources do exist for municipalities all over the Nation to reduce the amount of wastes that ultimately must be disposed of with the con\u00ad ventional methods and the toxicity of the wastes which end up in the ocean. Second, it also demonstrated that the de\u00ad velopers of these technologies are facing a stone wall in their efforts to make these tech\u00ad nologies the cornerstone of an improved and more efficient disposal process. Although the EPA is charged with the en\u00ad forcement of statutes presently on the books, including the 1978 Marine Protection, Re\u00ad search, and Sanctuaries Act and the Clean Water Act's regulation of municipal discharges into the ocean, the EPA has yet to display the necessary enthusiasm in enforcing these laws. What is needed now is not only to make the EPA live up to its congressional mandate of enforcing the laws but also to turn the spot\u00ad light on alternative technologies for waste dis\u00ad posal and treatment. I am including below an article by Liv Osby, a reporter for the Daily Record of Morristown, NJ, detailing this hearing on the different ap\u00ad proaches available to resolve this crisis. As she has done many times in the past while a reporter covering the state of affairs in New Jersey, in this article, Ms. Osby thoroughly ex\u00ad amines the pressing needs created by the crisis. The article follows: \u00b7 450 CRITICS SAY EPA BLOCKS ALTERNATIVES TO SLUDGE DUMPING <By Liv Osby) HoBOKEN.-lndustry leaders at the fore\u00ad front of alternatives to dumping sludge in the ocean told a House subcommittee yes\u00ad terday that government is the biggest obsta\u00ad cle to implementing new technologies. The federal Environmental Protection Agency allows \"regulatory confusion and delay\" and is trapped in a \"permitting straight jacket,\" said Barry A. Reiter, an en\u00ad gineer with Environmental Systems Co. in Little Rock, Ark. \u00b7 Reiter and other representatives of firms from across the nation testified at a hearing of the House Subcommittee on Transporta \u00ad tion, Tourism, and Hazardous Materials at Stevens Institute of Technology. The sub\u00ad committee met at the request of ranking subcommittee member Rep. James J. Florio, D-N.J., who said 7 million tons of sludge are dumped off the New Jersey coast each year. \"For too long, destructive ways of dealing with waste, <such as) ocean dumping, have been tolerated, even encouraged on the premise that there was no feasible alterna\u00ad tive,\" the Democrat said. \"That just isn't so.\" Reiter said technological break-throughs, such as thermal treatment and other meth\u00ad ods of rendering sludge harmless or even useful, are being developed with private funding, while EPA drags its feet behind, using public opinion as its reason. Paul S. McGough, vice president of Re\u00ad sources Conservation Co., Bellevue, Wash., said that while millions of dollars go into engineering studies, firms on the technolog\u00ad ical frontier go out of business waiting to demonstrate their findings. \"It's not the public that's objecting,\" said McGough. \"It's the EPA.\" F. William Gilmore, chief executive offi\u00ad cer of Colorado 's Cleanup & Recovery Corp., said the EPA shows resistance to new treatment technologies. \"There are a number of new technol\u00ad ogies,\" he said. \"But I suspect they'll remain on the shelf. Congress and EPA should en\u00ad courage the industrial community to employ novel and innovative treatment ideas ... otherwise, the institutional bias will continue mm1m1zmg prospects for ... promising technologies.\" The EPA is conducting several research programs into alternate technologies, said John Skinner, director of office of environ\u00ad mental engineering and technology demon\u00ad stration for the EPA. After hearing the testimony, Rep. Frank Guarini, D-N.J., said EPA has \"failed to meet its mission.\" Florio said EPA also fails to enforce laws governing ocean sludge dumping. But Rich\u00ad ard T. Dewling, commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Protection, said Congress must pass a law barring the practice. \"Legislation is the only way to stop dump\u00ad ing. We need changes in the law that don't allow loopholes ... or it will continue,\" Dewling said, noting 50 percent of the state's sludge is dumped in the Atlantic. Florio said the loopholes can be interpret\u00ad ed as EPA's \"non-productive exercise of its discretion\" because federal law empowers the agency to ban ocean dumping unless there's no economically feasible alternative. \"It's redundant for Congress to pass a law saying: Enforce the laws,\" he said. \"EPA to\u00ad morrow must say: No waivers or permits.\" EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT WE MUST REDUCE THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX HON. ERNEST L. KONNYU OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. KONNYU. Mr. Speaker, 5 weeks ago this Congress passed the budget for fiscal year 1988. This bill was roughly 82 days past due which can largely be attributed to negotia\u00ad tions on an agreeable bipartisan deficit reduc\u00ad tion package. We in Congress must begin work now on a deficit reduction package for future years. This package should significantly cut spending and roll back the current, heavy taxation of saving and investment. In particular, one positive tax move would set the capital gains tax rate at 15 percent. History has proven that we can actually raise revenue in order to meet deficit reduc\u00ad tion targets by cutting the capital gains tax rate. By reducing the rate on capital gains in 1978, increased revenue from capital gains taxes rose from $8.1 billion in 1977 to $11. 7 billion in 1979. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated the preferential tax rate on capital gains, which are now taxed as ordinary income. This will have devastating effects on the formation of capital and will surely result in a capital gains tax revenue loss over the next few years. The current capital gains tax rate will have an adverse impact on the ability of small busi\u00ad nesses to raise equity capital since it reduces the willingness of venture capitalists to take the risks involved in funding innovation and technological research. History has proven this to be the case as higher capital gains taxes imposed in 1969 inhibited the efficient use of capital and virtually dried up funds available for risky new ventures and new tech\u00ad nologies. It is said that America's revolution might never have been launched without the 1978 cut in capital gains taxes. Higher capital gains taxes reduce the liquidi\u00ad ty and efficiency of capital markets. Higher capital gains taxes reduce taxpayer's willing\u00ad ness to realize capital gains. Higher capital gains taxes reduce the amount of tax revenue that the Federal Government actually re\u00ad ceives. It is essential that we restore preferential capital gains tax treatment to a maximum rate of 15 percent. Enacting this legislation could add billions of dollars to the Federal Treasury and give a tremendous boost to high-technol\u00ad ogy and other industries and businesses seek\u00ad ing the venture capital to keep the United States ahead of its international competitors, most of whom impose no capital gains taxes at all. January 28, 1988 TRIBUTE TO LARRY D. ANDERSON HON. HENRY J. HYDE OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor today for me to pay tribute to a constituent of mine, Mr. Larry D. Anderson of Elmhurst, IL, who re\u00ad cently was named by the Jaycees as one of the 1 O outstanding young people in the State of Illinois. Knowing what I know of Larry's commitment to the DuPage County community, I can think of no better recipient for this most prestigious award. It was Larry's idea to initiate with others a privately financed flood relief fund following the August 1987 disaster which left thousands of people temporarily homeless in the metro\u00ad politan Chicago area. More than 180 families in the Elmhurst community, flooded from their homes, benefited from the estimated $85,000 contributed to the fund. An attorney, Larry has given new dimension to the term pro bono. In the selfless service of others, he has nurtured a sense of community spirit by his work with the Cub Scouts, Little League baseball, community theater, the PT A, the United Way Campaign of Elmhurst, the YMCA, the Chicago Bar Association, and his church, St. Peter's United Church of Christ. A member of the Elmhurst Jaycees since 1977, he has actively served his club in a vari\u00ad ety of leadership positions, in addition to re\u00ad ceiving numerous awards from the State and national organization, the latest award being yet another example of his commitment to ex\u00ad cellence. Thus, it is with great pleasure that I extend my very best wishes to Larry and his club col\u00ad leagues who, I am sure, share a sense of ac\u00ad complishment and pride for what Larry has contributed to Elmhurst and DuPage County. TRIBUTE TO ALDA WILLIAMSON HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, on January 29, 1988, one of my constituents, Ms. Alda Wil\u00ad liamson, will retire after 33 years of valuable and trusted service with United Parcel Serv\u00ad ice. Alda, as she is known to her colleagues and professional associates, has been the company librarian and archivist. She has been the regular official reader of the CONGRES\u00ad SIONAL RECORD, and her deep understanding of the legislative process has been a great asset to the UPS Public Affairs Group. Aldo was born in Hickory, NC, and attended the public schools there. She graduated from Lenoir Rhyne College with majors in history, English and biology. She received a fellowship at the University of Maryland, and simulta\u00ad neously worked as a Library of Congress bibli\u00ad ographer for the Office of Strategic Services. January 28, 1988 She instructed in history for the 3 years at Hood College, Frederick, MD, followed by 3 years as assistant professor of history at Baylor University, Waco, TX. For the next 4 years she supervised the circulation library of the University of Chicago. She joined United Parcel Service, Septem\u00ad ber 23, 1954. Alda has served well the com\u00ad pany and the company's shipping public. Her research was instrumental in enabling UPS to expand from serving retail stores in a number of major cities to serving the entire population of the 50 United States and Puerto Rico. Alda has doubled as a training materials writer and editor in the national communica\u00ad tions department. Her 33 years of diligence chart a model record of trustworthy and effective manage\u00ad ment. I am delighted that Alda is planning to relo\u00ad cate to Austin, TX, where she will enjoy the in\u00ad tellectual and political climate of that capital city. Alda deserves all the finest security, rest and entertainment that Texas can offer be\u00ad cause, through her work at UPS, she has so conscientiously devoted the last 33 years of service to others. I salute Alda Williamson for the many contri\u00ad butions she has made to United Parcel Serv\u00ad ice. PRESIDENT CHIANG CHING-KUO HON. MATTHEW G. MARTINEZ OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my colleagues in both the House of Representatives and in the Senate in extend\u00ad ing my sympathies to the Chinese people in the Republic of China for the passing of their leader, President Chiang Ching-kuo, on Janu\u00ad ary 13, 1988. I was deeply saddened upon learning of the death of President Chiang. I had the honor of meeting with President Chiang during past trips to the Republic of China. On a personal level, I found President Chiang to be a coura\u00ad geous leader who truly cared about the citi\u00ad zens of the Republic of China. President Chiang's accomplishments validate this per\u00ad ception. Through his leadership, the Republic of China has been transformed from an im\u00ad poverished island country into an economic giant all within a 25-year period. Moreover, President Chiang must be credited with en\u00ad couraging the evolution and operation of de\u00ad mocracy in the Republic of China. In sum, the Republic of China has lost a valiant states\u00ad man. On behalf of the people of the 30th Con\u00ad gressional District of California, I express my deepest sorrow to President Chiang's family and to the citizens of the Republic of China on the loss of President Chiang Ching-kuo. I share their sense of loss and I hope and trust that President Lee T eng-hui will lead his nation to even greater economic prosperity and political liberalization . EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS FARMERS' MARKET NUTRITION ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM HON. MICKEY LELAND OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. LELAND. Mr. Speaker, today I am intro\u00ad ducing legislation to establish a 3-year nation\u00ad al demonstration project which would permit States to provide participants in the Special Supplemental 'Food Program for Women, In\u00ad fants and Children [WIG] with additional re\u00ad sources to purchase fresh produce and other nutritious foods from farmers' markets. This bill, which is also sponsored by my colleagues Representatives GEJDENSON and ATKINS will help increase income for farmers and supply low-income households with nutritious foods for consumption. This legislation is based on a program that has been successfully demonstrated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for just 2 years. The Massachusetts Department of Food and Agriculture established a pilot pro\u00ad gram to provide nutritionally at risk inner city residents of Massachusetts with fresh, and nutritious fruits and vegetables through a net\u00ad work of farmers' markets in 1986. The pro\u00ad gram is also designed to provide farmers who are participating in the markets with new cus\u00ad tomers and increased sales. The Massachusetts' program is very simple. Low income mothers and elderly people who have been determined eligible to participate in the program are given $1 O worth of coupons. These coupons are used to purchase fresh produce at a participating farmers' market. Hence, both the low income consumer and the farmer benefit from the transaction. The success of the program can be meas\u00ad ured by the growth and the acceptance of the program in Massachusetts. In 1986, coupons valued at $18,000 were distributed to 2,000 families by the Department of Public Health's Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children [WIG] office. According to the Department of Food and Ag\u00ad riculture in Massachusetts, these families pur\u00ad chased more than 60,000 pounds of fresh Massachusetts produce at four farmers' market sites. The 60 farmers who participated realized a 25-percent increase in gross sales. The program has since been expanded to eight additional farmers' markets statewide. Participation has increased to 13,500 WIG families and nearly 200 farmers. Massachusetts, the first State to implement a farmers market coupon system, is not the only State which can show success in bringing together low income families and farmers. Programs generally replicating the one in Mas\u00ad sachusetts can be found in Connecticut and Iowa. Vermont is operating a similar project, where produce from farmers markets is made available to low-income individuals who use the emergency food shelves network. The Connecticut and Iowa programs are tar\u00ad getting large communities with high concentra\u00ad tions of low-income families, Hartford and Wa\u00ad terloo respectively. Based on the success of these two selected sites, both States plan to expand their programs to reach more low income residents and farmers markets state-451 wide. Vermont is also expanding its program based on the overwhelmingly positive reaction from beneficiaries. This legislation offers a variety of benefits. It addresses the nutritional needs of women and children who come from low-income house\u00ad holds-State health agencies set income cri\u00ad teria at 185 percent of the national poverty level or below-and must be certified by a health professional to be at nutritional risk. The food packages provided through WIG each month are designed for the dietary needs of the pregnant, postpartum , and lactat\u00ad ing women, infants, and children up to the age of 5. They provide vitamins and nutrients which are most likely to be absent from their diets. The supplementary purchase of items such as fresh fruits and vegetables which many of these households lack clearly contrib\u00ad utes to the well-being of people in danger of malnourishment. The experience of the four programs in ex\u00ad istence indicates that the low-income con\u00ad sumer becomes acquainted with markets where a greater amount of food per dollar can be obtained. In Massachusetts , the average participating family received nearly 40 pounds of food for $10 in coupons for the farmers' market season. The program improves mar\u00ad keting opportunities for local farmers and the additional income provides them with incen\u00ad tives to operate in low-income areas. Finally, the program establishes no new bureaucracy but works through existing systems. We believe the programs already in oper\u00ad ation display the capabilities State government and communities have in solving problems and improving the quality of life. Such pro\u00ad grams can stimulate market opportunities for local farmers throughout the country and im\u00ad prove access to fresh products to low income, nutritionally at risk individuals. This bill pro\u00ad vides for a modest investment which will have a great impact on vulnerable groups. I would like to now share with my colleagues a copy of the farmers' market pilot project legislation, which I urge you to cosponsor. PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK HON. STENY H. HOYER OF MARYLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday , January 28, 1988 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, today I am intro\u00ad ducing this resolution to recognize one of our Nation's most valuable national resources\u00ad our public employees . The quality of govern\u00ad ment's service to people in this country and around the globe reflects America's true lead\u00ad ership position in the world. Public employees defend our borders, en\u00ad force our laws, and represent our interests in countries around the world. They fix our roads, vaccinate our children to prevent child\u00ad hood diseases, deliver our mail, negotiate our treaties and trade agreements with other na\u00ad tions, and perform countless other public serv\u00ad ices that many of us have come to take for granted. To commend public employees for their un\u00ad ceasing dedication to serve the American 452 people, I introduce this resolution to designate the week of May 2 through May 8, 1988 \"Public Service Recognition Week.\" FARMERS' MARKET NUTRITION ENHANCEMENT ACT HON. SAM GEJDENSON OF CONNECTICUT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. GEJDENSON . Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with two of my colleagues, Representa\u00ad tives MICKEY LELAND and CHESTER ATKINS, in introducing the Farmers' Market Nutrition En\u00ad hancement Act. This legislation will help small family farmers by increasing the use of farm\u00ad ers markets and will also provide fresh food to nutritionally at-risk families. Most of us would agree that some of the best new initiatives aimed at meeting the needs of low-income Americans do not come from Washington, but from the States. I am always encouraged when Congress takes notice of these grassroots initiatives and puts the weight of the Federal Government behind their development. The WIG-farmers' markets programs in Con\u00ad necticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Iowa fit into the mold of innovative and effective grassroots initiatives. The programs were born out of belief that more fresh produce in the homes of WIC families will improve the fami\u00ad lies' general health and result in healthier babies. They were initiated with State and pri\u00ad vate money, and have won accolades from farmers and low-income people alike. In Connecticut, the Hartford food system distributed free bonus coupons to 6,200 WIC recipient households during the fresh produce growing season solely to be used at three farmers' markets in the Hartford area. Over 80,000 pounds of locally grown produce was purchased with the coupons and Hartford county farmers increased their sales by 25 percent. Similar results were registered in Massachusetts. For most of the coupon users, this was their first time shopping at a farmers' market. Over one-third of the WIC recipients who received a coupon came back to the market again to use their own money. Farmers felt the coupons made it worthwhile for them to keep marketing their produce in the inner city. The Farmers' Market Nutrition Enhance\u00ad ment Act authorizes seven demonstration pro\u00ad grams over a 3-year period. We chose to au\u00ad thorize demonstration, not permanent pro\u00ad grams as there are many aspects of WIC\u00ad farmers market programs that need to be fine tuned. We also hope that States will recognize the benefits of these programs and significant\u00ad ly increase State and local support for their continued development after the 3-year dem\u00ad onstration project has run its course. Our legislation also realizes that we are in a period of budget austerity. The Farmers Market Nutrition Enhancement Act only appro\u00ad priates $2 million per year for the 3-year life of the program, and requires a total of $1 million in matching State contributions . The $2 million Federal appropriation, fur\u00ad thermore, will have no impact on the benefits EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS currently available to WIC recipients. The standard WIC package of milk, cheese, infant formula, cereals, and fruit or vegetable juices will be supplemented, not supplanted, by the demonstration programs with fresh produce from farmers markets. Farmers redeem the coupons for cash from the State. In introducing this legislation, Representa\u00ad tives LELAND and ATKINS and I are very realis\u00ad tic in our expectations for this program. We do not expect that this bill, in and of itself, will end hunger in America or bring an end to the farm crisis. The Federal Government, howev\u00ad er, would be remiss if it did not act to support the development of a very positive movement which will increase business for small family farms and put more fresh produce in the homes of low-income families. TRIBUTE TO SIX CONSTITUENTS HON. JOSEPH P. KENNEDY II OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to six of my constituents. These six-Timothy Holt, Milagros Espada, Barbara Hughes-Sullivan, Marianne Meyers, Melissa Menton, and Scott F. Toner-have distin\u00ad guished themselves as students and as mem\u00ad bers of their community and have been awarded scholarships at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. Timothy Holt, of Cambridge, earned an A average at the Maine Maritime Academy and is a computer science major. Milagros Espada finished in the top 5 percent of her class at Somerville High School and has chosen man\u00ad agement as her major. Barbara Hughes-Sulli\u00ad van, of Somerville, graduated from Bunker Hill Community College with an A average and has selected psychology as her major. Mar\u00ad ianne Meyers, a graduate of the New England Conservatory, has selected English as her major. These four outstanding students have been awarded the Chancellor's Scholarship for Excellence . Melissa Menton received her GED in July 1986. Since then she has worked as a recep\u00ad tionist in Boston and as a volunteer at Green\u00ad peace. She plans to pursue a political science major. Scott Toner, of Cambridge, was very active at Matignon High School and also has been active with the Catholic Service Pro\u00ad gram. He also plans to pursue a major in polit\u00ad ical science. Both of these students have been awarded the Michael Ventrusca Scholar\u00ad ship. We all agree that education is vital to our country's future. But we must not forget that quality education depends on more than good schools and colleges and more than excellent teachers and professors; quality education also relies on motivated students. Students like these make America's educational future bright. I am very proud to bring these students to the attention of my colleagues . These six indi\u00ad viduals have combined talent, hard work, a commitment to excellence, and a commitment to their community . The University of Massa\u00ad chusetts at Boston has always been an out-January 28, 1988 standing school. With students like these it will be even better. LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE STUDENT LOAN DEFAULT PROBLEM HON. JIM JONTZ OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. JONTZ. Mr. Speaker, today I am intro\u00ad ducing legislation to address the student loan default problem. Paying for students who are defaulting on their guaranteed student loans [GSL's] has become the third largest expenditure of the Department of Education. This cannot contin\u00ad ue if the GSL Program is to survive. At the same time, any response to this problem should not penalize future students or schools for a situation beyond their control. My legislation gives students, lenders, insti\u00ad tutions, guaranty agencies, and the Depart\u00ad ment of Education additional responsibilities to prevent defaults and help obtain collections . The bill: First. Requires monthly information from guaranty agencies to be sent to the national student loan data bank at the Department of Education. The data will include student loan delinquencies, defaults, and the change in status of a borrower whose loan is delinquent or in default. Second. Requires guaranty agencies to pro\u00ad vide a monthly report to eligible institutions of borrowers who are delinquent of their obliga\u00ad tions. The institution then has an affirmative responsibility to review and correct the infor\u00ad mation and report back. Third. Establishes a consistent and equita\u00ad ble definition of \"default rate\" which takes into account collections made on defaulted loans as well as a credit for certain high risk students who graduate or successfully com\u00ad plete a program of study. Fourth. Requires that limitation, suspension, or termination of participation in guaranty pro\u00ad grams be based on default rates after 3 years of reliable and consistent data have been ac\u00ad cumulated. Institutions with default rates below 25 percent may not be subject to limita\u00ad tion, suspension, or termination from guaranty programs . Other aspects of the institutions' default rate situation may also be considered prior to any limitation, suspension, or termina\u00ad tion procedures. Fifth. Requires additional information from borrowers, including an acknowledgment of the responsibilities associated with the loans. It allows schools to withhold transcripts and other records from borrowers who are in de\u00ad fault. Further, the student is provided with a statement of consequences for default on a loan and the student is required to provide ad\u00ad ditional information during the entrance and exit interview which could be helpful in collec\u00ad tion of loans. Sixth. Requires schools to institute default prevention programs . In addition, the pro\u00ad ceeds of the student loans can only be multi\u00ad ply dispersed on a quarterly basis, with no January 28, 1988 funds available until 14 days of the program have been completed. Seventh. Provides a congressional finding that the continuation of the IRS Offset Pro\u00ad gram has been successful and should be con\u00ad tinued, and that other offset programs should be examined that would assist in the collec\u00ad tion of defaulted loans. Eighth. Requires the Department of Educa\u00ad tion to report annually to Congress on this issue. I urge my colleagues to review the legisla\u00ad tion and support this commonsense approach to addressing the default problem. It ensures the integrity of the GSL Program and contin\u00ad ued student access to GSL's. THE FARMERS' MARKET NUTRITION ENHANCEMENT ACT HON. CHESTER G. ATKINS OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. ATKINS. Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago the Massachusetts Commissioner of Agriculture began an innovative, low-cost program that di\u00ad rectly benefits two groups of people that have fared badly in our economy: young mothers and their children, and farmers. It does so in a way that would make Adam Smith proud: It brings supply to meet demand. Farmers in the United States produce an overabundance of food. In order to sell their goods, farmers are forever looking for new markets and customers . Mothers and young children in the Special Supplemental Food Program, commonly known as WIC, are provided with vouchers that list specific foods that they should eat to make their diet more nutritious. But they still need to fill in the rest of their diet. They need to know where they can get fresh and nutri\u00ad tious produce for themselves and their chil\u00ad dren. Thus, we have a large supply and a large demand, both groups needing each other. The Massachusetts program brings them together by providing WIC mothers with $10 worth of coupons to buy fresh produce at farmers' markets in their area. The farmers then redeem the coupons for their full value. This has the effect of introducing fresh produce into WIC recipients' diets. It also in\u00ad troduces new customers for the farmers that sell produce in these markets. In essence, these coupons have worked as a free market\u00ad ing device for the farmers. The program has been a great success. Re\u00ad demption rates are high, often as high as 7 4 percent. And the cost has been extremely low: In 1987, the program served 32,500 people for only $248,000. Essentially, there is little cost over the value of the coupon. Word has spread about the success of the Massachusetts program. Similar programs have been established in Connecticut, Ver\u00ad mont, and Iowa. Today, I am joining MICKEY LELAND and SAM GEJDENSON in introducing the Farmers' Market Nutrition Enhancement Act, a Federal demonstration program to support existing farmers' market coupons programs and en\u00ad courage the creation of new programs. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS It is rare, indeed, that we find an idea with as much promise as farmers' market coupons. By bringing WIC recipients, a group looking for inexpensive ways to purchase nutritious foods, together with farmers, who are always looking for more buyers of their produce, we have made a perfect match. I urge my colleagues to support this legisla\u00ad tion. TRIBUTE TO CHARLENE VEST HON. JACK BUECHNER OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. BUECHNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a selfless and outstanding servant of our Nation's youth-a teacher and mentor, a woman respected and loved by her stu\u00ad dents-Charlene Vest. In a time when we're really not certain whether \"Johnny\" can read after all, it is para\u00ad mount for us as this Nation's elected Repre\u00ad sentatives to give overdue recognition to the dedicated, professional men and women who are the true heroes of our public education in\u00ad stitutions. From the Second Congressional District of Missouri, Charlene Vest was such a hero. As a teacher of third-graders at the Pattonville Traditional School, she established for her students under NASA charter a \"Young Astro\u00ad nauts Club\" after she herself witnessed a launch of the space shuttle. Taking to heart the words of Plato, that \"[t]he direction in which education starts a man will determine his future life,\" during her 23-year tenure, Charlene Vest directed an entire generation of elementary school stu\u00ad dents toward dwellings in the higher realms of knowledge and wisdom, and prepared those students to be 21st century American leaders. The life of this hero of American education came to a tragic end in December, when she was killed in an automobile accident. In her memory, the Young Astronauts Club has been renamed, with the approval of NASA, to the \"Charlene Vest Young Astronauts Club,\" and a 23-foot oak tree will be planted-1 foot for each year she so nobly served her school. The memory of Charlene Vest will continue through the many young people whose lives she so deeply touched. It is an honor for me as the elected repre\u00ad sentative from the Second Congressional Dis\u00ad trict of Missouri to hereby immortalize the name of Charlene Vest in the House of Rep\u00ad resentatives this day, January 28, 1988. THE CHILD PROTECTION AND OBSCENITY ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1987 HON. JOEL HEFLEY OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. HEFLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to praise the recent actions of several national telecom\u00ad munications firms in taking steps to limit so\u00ad called dial-a-porn telephone lines. 453 Last week, one of those companies, US West, covering 14 western States, announced it would move such dubious services to a new, pay prefix-960-while continuing to offer other dial services through the old 976 prefix. At customer request, US West will block calls to either prefix or both, free of charge. And US West will no longer provide billing services for the 960 services. This last action is echoed by that of AT&T, which recently announced that it, too, would no longer provide free billing services to those providers of pornographic telephone services. A spokesman for the Mountain Bell subsidi\u00ad ary of US West pointed out that phone com\u00ad panies are public utilities, not community cen\u00ad sors. Yet their actions will give customers the tools they need to protect their children. Plans such as these are indicative of the best traditions of the American system-of pri\u00ad vate companies and individuals taking the initi\u00ad ative in addressing a public problem. We should applaud them for their action. and en\u00ad courage other telephone carriers to adopt similar policies. _ Yet, at the same time, we in this Chamber should not view the actions of these utilities as a way out of making hard decisions of our own on this matter. No doubt everyone here has received too many letters from constitu\u00ad ents to forget the importance the public places upon this issue. Two weeks ago, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York approved the Federal Communications Commission's latest set of regulations governing these types of commu\u00ad nications. At the same time, the court rejected the Supreme Court's distinctions between \"obscene\" and \"indecent,\" a ruling which may send the issue back to the Supreme Court. Nonetheless, the FCC claims it now has workable regulations in place and may consider introducing further legislative curbs within this year. Today, I signed on as a cosponsor to the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1987. This comprehensive package, drafted by the Justice Department and reflect\u00ad ing the findings of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, appears to offer the best legislative avenue for addressing this issue in light of legal precedent and existing regulatory statutes. The act seeks, first, to update Federal law to take into account new technologies em\u00ad ployed by pornographers and, second, to remove loopholes and weaknesses in existing law. Its provisions address three basic areas-sexual exploitation of children through child pornography, obscenity, and child pro\u00ad tection, the latter provision including dial-a\u00ad porn and cable pornography. I believe that this law, combined with contin\u00ad ued efforts by private citizens and the tele\u00ad communications industry and the enforcement of existing FCC regulations, will do much to halt the spread of this social problem. The pornography issue has festered in the courts and before Congress for almost 2 years. A general consensus has formed among the public that something must be done and that public is asking this body to act, in order that debate on this issue might be brought to a conclusion. In light of that 454 sentiment, I urge you to support passage of the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforce\u00ad ment Act of 1987. JAPAN, ICELAND STILL KILLING ENDANGERED WHALES HON.GEORGEJ.HOCHBRUECKNER OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. HOCHBRUECKNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my anger at learning that two nations-Iceland and Japan-will violate inter\u00ad national agreements and continue the illegal killing of whales in 1988. I would like to share with Members an article from the New York Times which describes this situation: [From the New York Times, Jan. 24, 1988] JAPAN AND ICELAND WILL DEFY BAN ON THE KILLING OF WHALES REYKJAVIK, ICELAND, Jan. 23 <Reuters).\u00ad Japan and Iceland will continue to hunt whales despite an international moratorium and have threatened to leave the Interna\u00ad tional Whaling Commission if the organiza\u00ad tion objects, Icelandic radio and officials said today. The radio quoted Kazuo Shima, counselor of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, as saying in Reykja\u00ad vik that if the commission formally opposed its research program Japan might withdraw from the commission. Officials said Iceland's Fisheries Ministry, Halldor Asgrimsson, made a similar threat at a closed two-day conference in the Icelan\u00ad dic capital that was attended by officials of six whaling nations. He also called for changes in the International Whaling Com\u00ad mission. Japan says it wants to hunt for 300 minke whales to calculate the size of the minke stock, and Mr. Asgrimsson said Iceland would proceed with its four-year program of hunting up to 120 whales per year for re\u00ad search purposes. Conservationists have argued that research programs are thinly disguised efforts at continuing commercial whaling. DISPUTE ON COMMISSION TERMS The whaling commission condemned Ice\u00ad land's program last year as being in viola\u00ad tion of an international moratorium on com\u00ad mercial whaling that is to last until 1990. Icelandic officials say that the moratori\u00ad um was enacted on the premise that the time would be used to increase research into whale populations but that the commission had shown little willingness to do so. The United States threatened Japan on Friday with possible economic retaliation if it killed any whales on its current expedi\u00ad tion in the Antarctic. Federal law requires sanctions against any nation certified as vio\u00ad lating international efforts on whale conser\u00ad vation. Iceland averted such certification last year by agreeing to lower its announced quota to 100 whales from 120. In return, Washington promised to work with Iceland on changes in the Internation\u00ad al Whaling Commission JAPAN ACCUSES U.S. OF PREJUDICE The radio said that at the conference Mr. Shima blamed the harsher reaction to Japan's hunt for whales on American \"racial prejudice.\" EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS Mr. Shima said Thursday that Japan was prepared to continue its whaling program, despite the American threats. \"If the United States places sanctions against Japan we are ready to accept such sanctions,\" he said. Mr. Asgrimsson is to meet with officials in Washington next month to discuss possible changes in the whaling commission's scien\u00ad tific committee. The news of plans by Japan and Iceland for the continued killing of endangered whales comes at an especially bad time. It is particu\u00ad larly disruptive to negotiations aimed at im\u00ad proving our economic relationship with one of the offending nations-Japan. The whaling issue is likely to complicate efforts to negoti\u00ad ate in good faith with this important foreign trading partner. Furthermore, this news is disturbing as the Congress of the United States is in the proc\u00ad ess of reauthorizing and strengthening the landmark Endangered Species Act. This act has enjoyed broad public support since its en\u00ad actment in 1973. It provides for the strongest species protection of any statute ever enacted by a nation, and it has served as a guide for other countries trying to protect and conserve their natural environment. Clearly, U.S. law requires sanctions against any nation which violates international efforts to conserve whales. I urge my colleagues to seriously consider imposing economic sanc\u00ad tions on nations proceeding with plans to kill endangered whales. Mr.\u00b7 Speaker, we must send a signal to the governments of Iceland and Japan that this nation will not tolerate the taking of whales and the abrogation of international agree\u00ad ments to which the United States is a party. The trade bill now under consideration in the Senate may be an appropriate place to start in this regard; perhaps some other vehicle is preferable. By whatever means, this Congress must go on record as supporting the conser\u00ad vation of the international marine environment and opposing the killing of endangered marine animals. STRIVING TOWARD EXCEL- LENCE IN PERFORMANCE AN INNOVATIVE \"STEP\" FOR MIN\u00ad NESOTA STATE GOVERNMENT HON. BRUCE F. VENTO OF MINNESOTA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 28, 1988 Mr. VENTO. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to share with my colleagues excerpts from an article written by Mr. Michael Barzelay and Mr. Robert A Leone of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University as it appeared in the July/ August edition of The Journal of State Government. Their article extols glowing praise for an innovative ap\u00ad proach to improve State government initiated by Minnesota's Governor Rudy Perpich known as striving toward excellence in performance [STEP]. STEP is an example of institutional self-im\u00ad provement aimed at better serving its custom\u00ad ers at its best. By involving the State's civic and business leaders in a partnership to im\u00ad prove the management of State government, January 28, 1988 Minnesota commissioner of administration, Sandra J. Hale, was able to form a coalition whose very strength was its flexibility. It is no wonder that this successful project has become a model for a public policy course at the Kennedy School of Government. CREATING AN INNOVATIVE MANAGERIAL CULTURE: THE MINNESOTA \"STEP\" STRATEGY (By Michael Barzelay and Robert A. Leone) Minnesota state government is experienc\u00ad ing quiet cultural change. Every year, public managers throughout the bureaucracy are invited to experiment with managerial inno\u00ad vations designed to enhance the quality, quantity or cost-effectiveness of their agen\u00ad cies. Many public servants are responding eagerly to the invitation to serve citizens better, to measurably improve their operat\u00ad ing performance and to take greater respon\u00ad sibility for making their agencies more inno\u00ad vative and productive. The belief that public managers should strive for excellence in performance by con\u00ad sciously experimenting with internally gen\u00ad erated ideas is not widely accepted, even if the \"good government\" state of Minnesota. Yet this concept of public management is making some headway among the state's civil servants, political appointees, business executives and union leaders. Behind this cultural change lies a set of carefully de\u00ad signed political and managerial strategies. This paper explores how a coalition forged by Commissioner of Administration Sandra J. Hale is providing the political support for a nascent culture of innovation throughout Minnesota state government. THE DEVELOPMENT OF HALE'S STRATEGY Commissioner of Administration Sandra Hale was well positioned to experiment with new strategies to improve state government. Hale eventually premised her strategy upon beliefs which ran counter to previous pro\u00ad ductivity schemes. Her first premise was that state employ\u00ad ees are predominantly competent and dedi\u00ad cated to their work as well as capable of in\u00ad novating if empowered to do so. Second, suc\u00ad cessful organizational change usually re\u00ad quires employees to retain substantial con\u00ad trol over the process of change. The third was that employees are ordinarily more mo\u00ad tivated by the goal of improving perform\u00ad ance-increasing quality, quantity or cost-ef\u00ad fectiveness-than by mandates to lower costs or raise productivity. Finally, the com\u00ad missioner believed state employees might actively take advantage of private sector re\u00ad sources if a joint public-private performance initiative were designed according to these premises. Hale desired to challenge common beliefs that state employees are unresponsive, follow routines and are not innovative. How\u00ad ever, as commissioner of the Department of Administration <DOA) she possessed few direct institutional resources to promote good management across state government. Primarily an oversight agency, DOA man\u00ad ages the state's information and telecom\u00ad munications services, procurement, motor pool and property holdings, as well as a prestigious group of internal consultants. To create a climate for innovation, experi\u00ad mentation and performance improvement, Hale needed the commitment of, among others, the governor, fellow commissioners and civil servants. Unless Perpich visibly supported Hale's premises and programs, other agencies would likely be indifferent to her initiatives. Fortunately, Perpich was at\u00ad tracted to Hale's conception of innovation, ~-. . .. -\u00b7~-\u00b7 ~ ~ ~ - January 28, 1988 which he found similar to the management philosophy of Control Data Corporation, where he served as an executive between elections. Yet Hale could not expect the governor to dedicate much time to pursuing a theme so counter to traditional concep\u00ad tions of \"good government.\" Hale also faced the skepticism of state em\u00ad ployees. Her strategy of relying on civil serv\u00ad ants to initiate producitivity improvements could be undermined by, among other things, strong popular beliefs that depre\u00ad cate the competence of bureaucrats. The very state employees whose innovative ideas she sought had learned to follow rules and procedures closely to protect themselves from various external challenges. Neither did Hale expect help from the state legislature. Legislators typically gain more political mileage by exposing the inad\u00ad equacies of the bureaucracy, taking stands on issues, servicing constituent requests and seeking state aid for local needs than by seeking to improve the quality, quantity and cost-effectiveness of government. Hale had practically nowhere to turn. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS improvements would be offset by budget cuts as had happened in previous reform ef\u00ad forts. The fear that innovations would lead to budget and possibly staff cuts tended to discourage bureaucrats from seeking to in\u00ad novate. In Hale's vision of a productivity program, state employees would be assured that their budgets would remain intact even after their suggested innovation was successfully implemented. This vision could be made credible by the support of the steering com\u00ad mittee. The steering committee's sole re\u00ad source was its prestige, but that was indeed a significant resource. While the mere existence of such a steer\u00ad ing committee could lend support for excel\u00ad lent management and innovations, it could not quickly change long-established behav\u00ad ior patterns. The committee somehow had to provide legitimacy to particular innova\u00ad tions so that the proposed changes would be accepted within the state government and so that the legislature would not match im\u00ad provements in cost-effectiveness with budget cuts. BUILDING A COALITION The institutional procedure designed to Perpich appointed Hale commissioner, in provide such political cover was to let the part, because she had worked closely with steering committee sanction the innova\u00ad leaders in business, politics and the arts, tions; state employees would submit innova\u00ad and was adept at using these contacts to tive project proposals to the committee for strengthen organizations with which she \u00b7 approval or disapproval.

Further, differentiation, the words represented by Andres encouraged the commissioner to em-the STEP program were first \"Strive phasize the goal of improving service qual-Toward Efficiency and Productivity,\" but ity (in contrast to the historical goal of re-later were changed to the more positive ducing costs). \"Strive Toward Excellence in Performance.\" Hale was persuaded that several promi\u00ad nent members of the business community might support a strategy of relying on state employees as sources of innovation and of using a public-private partnership to en\u00ad hance these state employee innovative ef\u00ad forts. In 1984, Hale began to build a coali\u00ad tion of business and political leaders to sup\u00ad port a state productivity program based on the premise that state employees are com\u00ad petent and eager to innovate. INSTITUTIONALIZING THE COALITION By the end of 1984, Hale began to form a steering committee for the productivity project. Perpich agreed to serve as co-chair, signaling his commitment to the effort, along with Andres. Andres consented to re\u00ad cruit other top business leaders as well. Leaders of the major public sector unions, together representing virtually all state em\u00ad ployees, were invited to serve on the steer\u00ad ing committee. With the governor as co\u00ad chair and with the unions involved, Hale set a tone that distinguished her project from prior productivity efforts. Hale also sought to eliminate state agency staff fears that savings from productivity WHY BUSINESS PARTICIPATES IN STEP Corporations participate in STEP in two ways: through six top executives who are members of the steering committee and through firms which are asked to become \"private partners\" for specific STEP projects. Complex motives explain the con\u00ad siderable degree of business participation. The Minnesota business community is well known for its civic consciousness. Except through occasional participation in productivity programs such as LEAP, how\u00ad ever, Minnesota business had not been par\u00ad ticularly involved in improving the manage\u00ad ment of state government. Recent attention to the issue of corporate social responsibility helped convince some business leaders to promote excellence in state government. In the 1970s, Control Data Chairman William Norris and other leading corporate executives argued for greater cooperation between business and government through \"public-private part\u00ad nerships.\" Perpich vocally supported such partnerships at the start of his administra\u00ad tion in 1983. Hale thought it made sense to tie the governor's productivity initiative to the partnership concept. 455 Once STEP gained the support of leaders such as Andres and Perpich, corporations that prided themselves on being outstand\u00ad ing \"citizens\" could not easily abstain from participating in this new model of public\u00ad private cooperation. These institutional in\u00ad centives sometimes blended with market-ori\u00ad ented ones. For example, Control Data's do\u00ad nation of \"process flow analysis\" software to the Division of State Claims <the agency responsible for the state's workers' compen\u00ad sation program) occurred as part of a strate\u00ad gy to tailor its products to the public sector market. At the same time, the donation was greatly facilitated by the idea of public-pri\u00ad vate partnerships as well as by the institu\u00ad tional structure of the STEP program. COMPETING MODELS Unifying the diverse elements of STEP is the vision that state employees rather than the private sector should be the source of innovative ideas and change. Within this unifying vision, there is room for diverse views. Initially, some people saw STEP simply as a vehicle to mobilize bureaucrats' good ideas and to help make these ideas an institutional reality. Others, such as Deputy Commissioner Babak Armajani, viewed STEP foremost as an instrument for chang\u00ad ing the culture of the state bureaucracy. These differing views of STEP have impli\u00ad cations for project selection, design and follow-up. For example, Armajani's ap\u00ad proach favored projects that would provide project managers with greater management discretion, increase opportunities for em\u00ad ployee participation and team work, breed a concern among state employees for serving customers and provide a mechanism for measuring results. According to this view, STEP was a deliberate effort to transform project leaders and team members into car\u00ad riers of the new culture of managerial excel\u00ad lence. PRODUCING RESULTS STEP has elicited a significant response from the bureaucracy in its beginning years. Interviews with STEP program participants revealed several motivations for participa\u00ad tion in the program: (1) some employees be\u00ad lieve that support for an innovative idea from outside their agency counterbalances their supervisors' indifference, (2) some su\u00ad pervisors feel compelled to generate STEP proposals to please the powers that be, (3) some participants wish to prove that the public sector can be managed as well as the private sector. The following sample of STEP projects from these beginning years shows a remark\u00ad able range of STEP projects. The Division of State Claims, as men\u00ad tioned, used STEP to acquire sophisticated computer software to streamline the proc\u00ad essing of worker's compensation claims. The parks department now accepts credit cards in a STEP-sponsored initiative to make it more convenient for park patrons to pay for season permits. A planning group integrated data bases to facilitate economic development. The corrections department diversified the product lines in prison industries and developed a program to sentence prisoners to community service as an alternative to in\u00ad carceration. The state human rights agency uses its private partners to aid in the enforcement of equal housing and employment opportu\u00ad nities. 456 A health agency revised the reimburse\u00ad ment formulas for services to handicapped children. The treasurer improved cash management techniques by coordinating activities with the financial community. The state weather service developed new channels of communication with major users of its services. DOA now offers local government access to its centralized telecommunications serv\u00ad ice on a fee-for-service basis. None of these innovations is spectacular in its own right. However, every item on this list is designed to make government work better, not just cheaper. These projects are designed to achieve excellence in public management through innovation, and, in so doing, to help reinforce a culture that en\u00ad courages, nourishes and rewards innovations from within state service. The politics of innovation are still being invented in Minnesota. The common mean\u00ad ing of good government, for instance, is be\u00ad ginning to include the notion of high-qual\u00ad ity, cost-effective performance. In response to criticism from the Independence-Republi\u00ad can challenger during the 1986 gubernatori\u00ad al campaign, for example, Perpich explicitly cited the STEP program as evidence of his dedication to improving government. Although the long-term, bottom-up, \"ex\u00ad cellence in performance\" approach has been institutionalized neither in the world of pol\u00ad itics nor in the state legislature, the ap\u00ad proach has made headway among some EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS socio-economic and political elites as well as among some state employees. Through STEP's communications and other activi\u00ad ties, a new discourse of public management is becoming meaningful to an increasing number of people in state government. The traditional culture of rigid hierarchy and exclusive accountability to process is being challenged by people holding an alternative vision of public administration. The STEP vision is sustained, in part, by newly established networks of like-minded individuals, formed across departmental lines, across bureaucratic strata, and, to some extent, across the boundaries of the public and private sectors. At a minimum, these networks, deliberately fostered by STEP, help reorganize patterns of authority and communications in ways that breed in\u00ad novation. STEP is likely to succeed for three impor\u00ad tant reasons. First, innovation is an organi\u00ad zational process. Successful innovation is not merely a good idea successfully imple\u00ad mented; it is a carefully crafted process that percolates a succession of new ideas to the surface and effectively implements a por\u00ad tion of them. STEP is a remarkable project p:-ecisely because of its attention to the in\u00ad stitutionalization of innovation from within Minnesota state government. Second, the STEP program implicitly rec\u00ad ognizes that inducing innovation requires political coalition-building, which, in turn, may require the kinds of creativity typically associated with \"cultural entrepreneur-January 28, 1988 ship.\" Cultural entrepreneurship is the art of leading others to alter their core beliefs about social realities and possibilities. Politi\u00ad cal coalition-building is usually necessary to embed these reorganized beliefs in real\u00ad world social structures and institutions. Third, a good deal of STEP's success lies in its reliance on decentralized initiative and its encouragement of clarification of pur\u00ad pose as essential to effective innovation (e.g., asking, Who is the customer? What measurable results do we seek?). Only in this way can the direction and pace of inno\u00ad vation match the strategic agenda of indi\u00ad vidual government agencies. The same ap\u00ad proach to innovation is simply not appropri\u00ad ate for all state agencies and the STEP pro\u00ad gram is wise enough to recognize and ac\u00ad commodate this reality. STEP's ultimate success rests on an appre\u00ad ciation of a simple reality-continued inno\u00ad vation is as much as a cultural phenomenon as an administrative one. Good ideas perco\u00ad late to the top, are championed by public entrepreneurs, and are politically accepted only in a culture that values innovation for the good that it accomplishes, not merely the money it saves. STEP consciously and systematically ad\u00ad dresses this cultural question by empower\u00ad ing individuals and agencies in the bureauc\u00ad racy to act on behalf of better government, while challenging those outside the bu\u00ad reaucracy to recognize that government can never be inexpensive if it is not done well.
