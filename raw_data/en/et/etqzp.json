Keywords: Non-communicable Diseases; CVDs; Hypertension; AbuseDOI: 10.31080/ASMS.2022.06.1227 Introduction Chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are long term de - terioration and impairment of health due to multiple non patho- genic causative factors. These are major killers of people and need urgent actions across the world. Non-communicable diseases ac- count for nearly 70% of deaths worldwide, with an estimated 75% of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries [1]. Global burden NCDs is caused due to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and chronic lung diseases [2]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in year 2016, around 18.0 mil- lion were died only due to victims of CVD, this was accounting for 31% of all registered premature deaths. Of these, 85% resulted from a heart attack or stroke. These conditions affect equal num-bers of men and women. The WHO estimates that by 2030, approx - imately 24 million will die from CVD conditions annually mostly due to stroke and heart disease. Although these conditions remain prevalent in global mortality rates, people can start taking steps to prevent them. Most of these chronic diseases have marked risk fac- tors but most of them are related to conditions such as ageing, envi- ronmental and diet structure and nutritional and human behavior. On one side there is a world class living with all maximum life standards while other side is completely gripped under poverty, low education, imbalanced dietary structures and poor quality of living standards. Among other natural reasons are related to wa- ter quality, housing and environment. There are imbalances in diet structure, living facility, cleanliness, and hospital care and medicine Citation: Ravi Kant Upadhyay. Scientific Medical Sciences 6.4 (2022): 153-170.availability [3]. There is a need to improve diet quality and food supply at global level under the umbrella of WHO [4]. However, to reduce the risks and disease burden of prevailing NCDs will need huge economic inputs both at global and regional level [3]. It can be maintained by market based economic built up, Medicare in- surance schemes and coperative community services and hospital management. For treatment of chronic communicable diseases socio-legal medicines, public awareness and cultural renaissance is essentially required. Contrary to this there is a world of poor full of miseries, and miserable conditions. There is a lack of money that is a major blockade of child education, nutritional care, livelihood and societal development. It is true that both types of life styles generate chronic health issues; the main reason is human habit and behavior. These seems an immense need of implementation of government schemes for food supply, dietary pattern and physical activity to lower down the burden of hypertension, blood pressure and diabetes [5]. Today luxurious life based on both economic/industry/busi - ness activities unfortunately imposing important chronic issues are alcoholism, narcotics, sex abuses, drug peddling and work stress, tension and blood pressure in society. In both situations health related risk factors and disease incidence are on rise and its prevention is less comparison to the rate of occurrence and spread. Most of the chronic disease cases are from both high income and low income society. The condition is very worse in American-Afri - can population, though Asia and Australia are also in grip of these diseases. These impairments are either permanent or temporary impose residual disability/chronic impairment and non reversible, non measurable pathological alterations. There is a rising trend of alcoholic, narcotics and drug abuse in young population. Condition is more anxious that young age school children, colleges and higher education centers are in grip of all these abuses. Among important factors use of cigarettes, sigar, hukka bars and other forms of smok - ing, alcohol and drug abusing habit is increasing in teenagers and adolescents day by day [6]. There is an utter failure of community services for solving issues related to stress, smoking, alcoholism, narcotics, hypertension, cancer and blood pressure with poverty stressed low income unmanaged society. These are also responsi - ble for crime in urban suburban and rural areas. There is a need of long term planning and life time treatment approach to prevention and control of non-communicable diseases [7]. Risk factors NCDs have multiple risk factors i.e. use of high salted hot fried fast foods, liquor, smoking and narcotics are making young gen- eration disable. Youngsters are coming under high blood pressure fumes, sugar, obesity, stress, hypertension, anxiety and wordless - ness. Dietary patterns and physical disabilities are not normal and people are becoming extravagant and victim of consumerism. Besides environmental risk factors such as occupational health hazards, drinking of polluted water, inhalation of air pollutants, agrochemicals, industrial waste and drugs are increasing in urban areas. In urban areas there seems an increasing prevalence of non- communicable diseases i.e. high blood pressure, sugar, fatty liver, bone fracturing and degeneration, cardiovascular, renal, nervous, and mental diseases. It is true that prevalence of NCDs risk factors and disease burden varies in rural and urban areas. The key factors of difference are wages, living conditions, food habit, education and human behavior [8]. For management and prevention of NCDs identification and action on risk factors is essential for increasing disease-free life expectancy in society at global level [9]. To reduce the morbidity and death toll, there is need of launching of aware- ness programs, approaches and discourses on non-communicable diseases at global level. Disease burden Outcomes of survey reports clearly indicate that at global level burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is increasing in low- income countries [10]. Major reasons of NCDs are climate change, economic unevenness and lack of medical facilities and food habits and life style [11]. The main reasons behind it poverty, unemploy - ment, low life standards, bad social habits, lack of awareness, hos - pital care and rising levels of environmental pollution, and climate change [12] . NCDs are responsible for high morbidity, mental and physical disability, and fragmentation of family structures, soci - ety and culture. These are giving rise secondary problems and all around miseries, hardships and economic loss at global level. Due to changed lifestyle diabetes, cancer, stress and hypertension are major chronic NCDs issues. Psychological health issues, arthritis, chronic bronchitis, asthma, emphysema, and breathlessness and are behavior and age dependent. All these factors are increasing macroeconomic burden of communicable diseases on the society [13] both in low- and middle-income countries [14]. In future it will further increase if proper management of NCDs is not being 154Chronic Non-communicable Diseases: Risk Scientific Medical Sciences 6.4 (2022): 153-170.done properly [15]. Though, it is very difficult to think about any cure in absence of known agent, multi-factorial causation, long liv - ing period and indefinite onset of diseases like CVD, coronary heart diseases, smoking, hypertension, high serum cholesterol, obesity, cancer and blindness. For fast control and reducing rapidly grow - ing NCD burden allocation of human resources and essential medi - cines and technologies, must be coupled with quality assurance modalities [10]. Source of information For writing this comprehensive research review on animal ven- om toxins/enzymes/proteins, various databases were searched. For collection of relevant information specific terms such as medi - cal subject headings (MeSH) and key text words, such as \"chronic non communicable diseases\", \"risk factors, disease burden, mor - bidities, treatment, complications and mortalities, \"published till 2022 were used in MEDLINE. Most specially for retrieving all articles pertaining to chronic non communicable diseases electronic bibliographic databases were searched and abstracts of published studies with relevant information on the venom toxins/ allergens were collected. Furthermore, additional references were included through searching the references cited by the studies done on the present topic. Relevant terms were used individually and in combination to ensure an extensive literature search. For updating the information about a subject and incorporation of recent knowledge, relevant research articles, books, conferences proceedings' and public health organization survey reports were selected and collated based on the broader objective of the review. This was achieved by searching databases, including SCOPUS, Web of Science, and EMBASE , Pubmed, Swissprot, Google searches\" From this common methodology, discoveries and findings were identified and summarized in this final review. Major healthcare issues related to CVDs Cardiovascular (CVDs) Cardiovascular disease (CVD) severely affects the heart or blood vessels mainly arteries, veins, or capillaries throughout the body and around the heart. In coronary heart disease the flow of oxygen- rich blood to the heart muscle is blocked or reduced. Among them atherosclerosis is a major problem as LDL cholesterol is deposited inside the lumen of arteries, it increases the risk of blood clots and oppose the normal blood flow. It also damages arteries run in vari-ous organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys and eyes. CVD com- prises many different types of conditions. Few of them happen all of a sudden while some might develop delayed and lead to other morbidities or diseases. There are various symptoms of CVDs i.e. angina is characterized by a severe chest pain. It occurs due to de - creased blood flow into the heart, or an irregular heartbeat or heart rhythm. Similarly, the arrhythmia and congenital heart diseases are which affect the coronary arteries that feed the heart muscles, or a sudden blockage to the heart's blood flow and oxygen supply. It results in heart attack, heart failure, wherein the heart cannot con- tract or relax normally. There are other deformities such as dilated cardiomyopathy, a type of heart failure, related to increase in size of heart and cannot pump blood efficiently. Another problem is hy - pertrophic cardiomyopathy, in which thickening of heart muscle walls create problems to the relaxation of muscle, obstruct blood flow, and develop electrical instability. Sometimes blood leaks back through the mitral valve of the heart during contractions, and mitral valve prolapsed. A part of the mitral valve bulges into the left atrium of the heart while it contracts; it causes mitral regurgitation and pulmonary stenosis. In pulmonary stenosis narrowing of the pulmonary artery reduc- es blood flow from the right ventricle (pumping chamber to the lungs) to the pulmonary artery (blood vessel that carries deoxy - genated blood to the lungs). In aortic stenosis, narrowing of the heart valve takes place that causes blockage to blood flow leaving the heart. It also associated with arterial fibrillation, an irregular rhythm that can increase the risk of stroke, rheumatic heart dis - ease. This complication of strep throat induces inflammation in the heart that affect the function of heart valves. Peripheral arterial disease occurs when there's a blockage in the arteries to the limbs, usually the legs. In peripheral artery disease arteries become narrow that reduces blood flow to the limbs. It ini- tiates cramping of legs pain that becomes more severe during walk - ing. It also causes numbness or weakness in the legs. Few of them are, aneurysm a bulge or enlargement in an artery that can rupture and bleed, atherosclerosis, in which plaque forms along the walls of blood vessels, narrowing them and restricting the flow of oxygen rich blood [16]. In renal artery disease flow of blood to and from the kidneys is obstructed, it can lead to high blood pressure and spasm. In peripheral venous disease, veins that transport blood from the feet and arms back to the heart, get blocked, it results in 155Chronic Non-communicable Diseases: Risk Factors, Acta Scientific Medical Sciences 6.4 (2022): 153-170.swelling of legs and varicose veins, and ischemic stroke. Sometimes venous blood clots break or loose and become dangerous as they move to the pulmonary artery. Buerger's disease is a blood clotting disorders that also causes inflammation, often in the legs, and may result in gangrene. It is possible to manage some health conditions within CVD by making lifestyle changes, but some conditions may be life threatening and require emergency surgery. Aortic diseases are a group of conditions affecting the aorta. This is the largest blood vessel in the body, which carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. One of most common aortic diseases is an aortic aneurysm, where the aorta becomes weakened and bulges outwards. This does not display any symptom, but there's a chance it could burst and cause life-threatening bleeding. CVD is one of the main causes of death and disability in many developed countries. Both CVDs and cancer are responsible for mil- lions of deaths round the globe both in middle and high income countries [17]. However, there are many ways to reduce the risk of developing these conditions. There are also many treatment op- tions available if do they occur. Causes of CVDs Among important causes high blood pressure is the main cause of CVDs. High blood pressure (hypertension) is one of the most im- portant risk factors for CVD. Persistent high blood pressure can put a strain on the walls of the arteries. This can lead to a variety of health problems, some of which can be life threatening. It is there- fore vital that people undergo regular screening for high blood pressure. There are deviations in blood pressure either in systolic pressure, it is the pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts and is the top number in mm Hg on a blood pressure reading. Dia- stolic, which is the lower number, represents the blood pressure when the heart is resting between beats. These are more prevalent in patients [18]. If blood pressure is too high for too long, it can cause serious damage to the blood vessels. This damage can result in a range of complications, some of which can be life threatening. They include heart failure, vision loss, stroke, kidney disease, and other health problems. Smoking and other tobacco use is also a significant risk factor for CVD. The harmful substances in tobacco can damage and narrow your blood vessels. Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in the blood. If its level goes high, it starts deposit - ing in blood vessel lumen, and creates problem to blood flow and increase developing a blood clot.Risk factors Risk factors for CVD include high blood pressure, or hyperten- sion, atherosclerosis or blockages in the arteries, radiation therapy, smoking, poor sleep hygiene, high blood cholesterol, or hyperlipid- emia, diabetes, a high fat, high carbohydrate diet physical inactivity, obesity, sleep apnea, excessive alcohol consumption, stress, air pol- lution, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or other forms of reduced lung function, People with one cardiovascular risk factor often have more. For example, obesity is a risk factor for high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. Diabetes also causes harm to the circulatory system and affects human health. If diabetes persists lifelong, it causes blood sugar level high which damages the blood vessels, making them more likely to become narrowed. Many people with Type 2 diabetes become overweight or obese, which is also a risk factor for CVD. Due to changing food habits and living pattern new risk factors are emerging new NCDs which making situation worst. These chang- ing patterns of cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors are increasing disease burden, both at regional global level [19]. In US 29% of the population, is in grip of high blood pressure (CDC). Among other important causes of CVDs is physical inactivity that makes body obese and heavy weight body mass index above 25 might have frisk of CVDs. Both these conditions initiate diabetes and high blood pressure. Genetic factors are also strong reasons of CVDs, If someone has family history of CVD, he or she will remain under the risk of developing CVDs. Ethnic background is also re- sponsible for CVDs [20]. CVD is more common in people of Latin American, European, south Asian and an African or Caribbean background. This is because people from these backgrounds are more likely to have other risk factors for CVD, such as high blood pressure or type 2- diabetes. Symptoms Symptoms will vary depending on the specific condition. How - ever, typical symptoms of an underlying cardiovascular issue in- clude pain or pressure in the chest, which may indicate angina, pain or discomfort in the arms, left shoulder, elbows, jaw, or back, shortness of breath, nausea and fatigue, lightheadedness or dizzi - ness, cold sweats, Although these are the most common ones, CVD can cause symptoms anywhere in the body. 156Chronic Non-communicable Diseases: Risk Factors, Acta Scientific Medical Sciences 6.4 (2022): 153-170.Diagnosis and prevention There are certain biomarkers of cardiovascular diseases such as elevated blood pressure, severe diabetes, and obesity, problem in breathing, chest pain and inflammation. Among molecular markers of CVDs are non-coding RNAs [21] and miRNAs and noninvasive cardiac-specific biomarkers in obesi - ty and cardiovascular diseases [23]. Inactivity is also an important cause of CVDs. For effective prevention of CVDs a regular exercise for 25 minutes provides relief in blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and cut down overweight. Reduce the body weight by 5-10% lower down risk of CVD. A healthy diet and regular exercise can also help in maintaining a healthy weight. Eating foods that con- tain polyunsaturated fats and omega 3, such as oily fish, alongside fruits and vegetables can support heart health and reduce the risk of CVD. Reducing the intake of processed food, salt, saturated fat, and added sugar has a similar effect. Reducing the use of alcohol, tobacco, and smoking are key risk factors for almost all forms of CVD. Although quitting can be difficult, taking steps to do so can drastically reduce its damaging effects on the heart. Medication Medications that may be recommended include statins to lower blood cholesterol levels, low-dose aspirin to prevent blood clots, and tablets to reduce blood pressure. Anyone taking a daily dose of aspirin to reduce their risk of CVD should ask their doctor whether or not they should continue. However, some options include: medi - cation, such as to reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol, im- prove blood flow, or regulate heart rhythm, surgery, such as coro- nary artery bypass grafting or valve repair or replacement surgery, cardiac rehabilitation, including exercise prescriptions and life- style counseling, relieve symptoms, reduce the risk of the condition or disease recurring or getting worse, prevent complications, such as hospital admission, heart failure, stroke, heart attack, or death. Depending on the condition, a healthcare provider may also seek to stabilize heart rhythms, reduce blockages, and relax the arteries to enable a better flow of blood. Strokes A stroke is a medical emergency in which blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly cut off. This interruption in blood supply pre- vents brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. A stroke oc- curs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and bleeds, or when there's a blockage in the blood supply to the brain. The rupture or blockage prevents blood and oxygen from reaching the brain's tis- sues. Without oxygen, brain cells and tissue get damaged and begin to die within minutes. A stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial, if timely treatment is not provided death is possible. There are three main types of stroke i.e. ischemic strokes, hem- orrhagic stroke and transient ischemic strokes. Most strokes (87%) are ischemic strokes. An ischemic stroke happens when blood flow through the artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain be- comes blocked. Blood clots often cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes [24]. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) involves a blood clot that typically reverses on its own. A transient ischemic attack (also called a TIA or \u00abmini-stroke\u00bb) is similar, but the blood flow to the brain is only temporarily disrupted. Early treatment with medication like tPA (clot buster) can minimize brain damage. Other treatments focus on limiting complications and prevent- ing additional strokes. Most of deaths noted in United States are caused by stroke (CDC). Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either a burst or leaking blood vessel that seeps into the brain. A hemorrhagic stroke happens when an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures (breaks open). The leaked blood puts too much pressure on brain cells, which damages them. High blood pressure and aneurysms\u2014balloon- like bulges in an artery that can stretch and burst\u2014are examples of conditions that can cause a hemorrhagic stroke. There are two types of hemorrhagic strokes: Intracerebral hemorrhage is the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke. It occurs when an artery in the brain bursts, flooding the surrounding tissue with blood. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a less common type of hemor - rhagic stroke. It refers to bleeding in the area between the brain and the thin tissues that cover it. Among more prominent symptoms of stroke is trouble in walk - ing, speaking and understanding, as well as paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg. Ischemic stroke sometimes results in chron- ic inflammatory airway disease [25,26] , imposes long-term risk of myocardial infarction [27] and long time stress in patients [28]. There are certain treatment methods available for stroke treat- ment such as increase of dietary use of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids [29] and intake of oral anticoagulants [30].157Chronic Non-communicable Diseases: Risk Acta Scientific Medical Sciences 6.4 (2022): 153-170.Symptoms The major symptoms of stroke are, paralysis, numbness or weakness in the arm, face, and leg, especially on one side of the body, trouble speaking or understanding others, slurred speech, confusion, disorientation, or lack of responsiveness, sudden be- havioral changes, especially increased agitation, vision problems, such as trouble seeing in one or both eyes with vision blackened or blurred, or double vision, trouble walking, loss of balance or co- ordination, dizziness, severe, sudden headache with an unknown cause, seizures, nausea or vomiting. Risk factors There are so many risk factors which are increasing NCDs as- sociated morbidities and deaths. Heavy alcohol use raises blood pressure levels, it increases the chances of stroke. It also raises tri- glyceride levels, which can cause atherosclerosis. This is plaque buildup in the arteries that narrows blood vessels. Nicotine found in tobacco also raises the risk of stroke because of raising blood pressure. There are some risk factors for stroke such as family his - tory. Stroke risk is higher in some families because of genetic health factors, such as high blood pressure. Both women and men have similar danger of strokes, they're more common in women than in men in all age groups . An unbalanced diet can increase the risk of stroke. This type of diet is high in: salt, saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, inactivity, or lack of exercise, can also raise the risk of stroke. Regular exercise has a number of health benefits. The CDC recommends that adults get at least 2.5 hrs. This can mean simply a brisk walk a few times a week. Every year, more than 795,000 U.S. people have a stroke. Old age is also responsible for stroke. Besides this, race and ethnicity are also responsible for increase in NCDs. Certain medical conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, excess weight, heart disorders, such as coronary artery disease, heart valve defects, enlarged heart chambers and irregular heartbeats, diabetes, blood clot disorder, are seen more in ethnic groups. Diagnosis of stroke Stroke is diagnosed by examining sugar levels, platelet counts, blood clots and cholesterol levels. An MRI or CT can help to locate whether any brain tissue or brain cells have been damaged. It also clearly display bleeding or damage inside brain. EKG or electro- cardiogram records the electrical activity in the heart, measuring its rhythm and recording how fast it beats. An EKG can determine whether person has normal heart conditions or passing under stroke, such as a prior heart attack or atrial fibrillation. A cerebral angiogram offers a detailed look at the arteries in neck and brain. The test can show blockages or clots that may have caused symp- toms. A carotid ultrasound also called a carotid duplex scan, help to recognize fatty deposits (plaque) in carotid arteries, which sup- ply the blood to face, neck, and brain. An increased blood pressure disturbs balance, coordination, weakness, numbness in your arms, face, or legs, signs of confusion, vision issues. In diagnosis of car- diovascular diseases spectrometry imaging is useful. Complications Some of these complications include: seizures, loss of bladder and bowel control, cognitive impairment, including dementia, re- duced mobility, range of motion, or ability to control certain mus- cle movements, depression, mood or emotional changes, shoulder pain, bed sores, sensory or sensation changes. These complications can be managed by methods such as medication, physical therapy and counseling. Prevention Lifestyle changes can't prevent all strokes. People should give up habit of smoking, alcohol and over diet and use of junk food to avoid danger of stroke. Overweight and obesity increases the risk of stroke. To avoid stroke people should eat a balanced diet and stay physically active. Both steps can also reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Routinely checkup for blood pressure, cho - lesterol, and any conditions and consult your doctor for proper guidance. Treatment methods Thrombolytic drugs are provided to break up blood clots in ar- teries of brain, these still stop the stroke and reduce damage to the brain. Normally tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), or Alteplase IV r-tPA is prescribed to dissolve blood clots quickly. Surgery is also used to remove a blood clot and plaques from arteries. This surgery may be done with a catheter. If the clot is especially large, a surgeon may open an artery to remove the blockage [31]. The most common anticoagulant or Acta Scientific Medical Sciences 6.4 (2022): 153-170.can also prevent existing blood clots from growing larger, and pre- vent a stroke, mainly TIA. These medications prevent blood clots by making it more difficult for the blood's platelets to stick together. Statins such as rosuvastatin, simvaststin and atorvastatin prevent the production of an enzyme that can turn cholesterol into plaque. Few drugs are prescribed to reduce blood pressure, lower the pres - sure in your brain, prevent seizures, and prevent blood vessel con- striction. More often, there is need of managing high blood pres - sure with medication, lifestyle changes and interdisciplinary action to cure high risk stroke patients [32]. Maternal health and child care issues With the increase in obesity prevalence among women of repro- ductive age globally, the risks of type 2 diabetes, gestational dia- betes, pre-eclampsia, and other conditions are rising, with detri - mental effects on maternal and newborn health [33]. It encourages healthcare practitioners to initiate a dialogue on women's health, nutrition, and weight management before conception. The rec- ommendations can be contextualized based on local cultural and dietary practices as part of a system-wide public health approach to influence the wider determinants as well as individual factors influencing preconception health [33]. Early check up is important to stop neonatal cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension High blood pressure (hypertension) is a common condition in which the long-term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease. Hypertension is a condition in which the force of the blood becomes too high against the artery walls. High blood pressure is a lifestyle disease becomes very severe as it gives rise hypertension that is a major risk factor for CVDs. Usually hyperten- sion is defined as blood pressure above 140/90, and is considered severe if the pressure is above 180/120. High blood pressure often has no symptoms. Over time, if it is not treated it can lead to severe health complications and increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and sometimes death. Eating a healthier diet with less salt, exercis - ing regularly and taking medication can help lower blood pressure. There are so many factors which are responsible for blood pressure, but family history is most important as the genetics play important role in its severity. Smoking increases blood pressure, avoiding of it reduces the chances of hypertension and risk of CVDs and other health issues. Among primary reasons of hypertension are obesity, alcohol intake, high salt intake, smoking and insulin resistance. Among Secondary hypertension causes are diabetics, pheochromocyota, Cushing syndrome, hyperthyroidism, pregnan- cy and hyperparathyroidism. Long-term hypertension can cause complications atherosclerosis that give rise heart failure and heart attacks, aneurysm, or an atypical bulge in the wall of an artery that can burst, kidney failure, stroke, amputation, hypertensive retinop- athies in the eye, which can lead to blindness. A number of factors such as CVDs, diabetes, chronic kidney dis - ease, and high cholesterol levels can lead to hypertension, especial- ly as people age. Over consumption of alcohol or tobacco increases blood pressure. Without detection, hypertension can damage the heart, blood vessels, and other organs, such as the kidneys. Hence, it is highly essential to check blood pressure regularly. Hyperten- sion is a metabolic disorder; hence, diet, proper medication regular exercise, sleep and rest are highly important [34]. A hypertension patient should regular check blood pressure for reducing health burden of elevated blood pressure [35]. High blood pressure is responsible for sweating, anxiety, sleeping problems, severe head - ache and nosebleeds. Both genetics and immune system play im- portant role in hypertension [36,37]. Treatment and prevention One should come out of stress as quick as possible is only rem- edy control of blood pressure. For keeping stress free one should follow meditation, yoga, pranayma, warm baths, long walk and swimming in daily habit. All these are boon for stress reduction. For a calm and peaceful life avoid alcohol and use of narcotic drugs, smoke free person feel freer than a smoker. People who have high blood pressure or people at high risk for developing high blood pressure should reduce their intake of saturated fats in favor of unsaturated forms. They should use eating more fruits and veg- etables and less fat or use trans fats mainly poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Easy, healthy fibrous diet is more beneficial, it must have whole grain, high fiber foods, a variety of fruits and vegetables pulses, such as chickpeas, beans, and lentils, nuts, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, low fat dairy products. Clinical medicines are also prescribed for treatment of high blood pressure and hyper tension. A serial long term course of 159Chronic Non-communicable Diseases: Risk Factors, Acta Scientific Medical Sciences 6.4 (2022): 153-170.medicines such as beta and alpha blockers and calcium channel blockers provide quick relief. Few diuretics such as thiazides, in- dapamide and chlorythalidone are also prescribed. Angiotensin converting enzymes, adrenergic inhibtors and vasodilators are also provided. Both treatment and duration must start under guidance of some clinical expert. The choice of medicine depends on age of individual and status report based on family history. Diabetes Diabetes is a disease state due to lower or high blood sugar level. Blood glucose is the main source of energy that comes from the utilization and absorption of food material. Insulin secreted from pancreas controls glucose level. In a state of low insulin secre- tion consumption of glucose by body cells is reduced and its extra amount stays in blood. It results in diabetes. There are two forms of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes In Type 1 diabetes body does not synthesize enough amount of insulin. Type 1 diabetes is also an autoimmune disease in which im- mune system attacks and destroys the cells in pancreas that make insulin. Still it is unclear why immune system attacks pancreatic cells which synthesize insulin. Type 1 diabetes occurs in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive. Type 1 diabetes is seen in 10% of people. Type 2 diabetes In Type 2 diabetes body does not synthesize properly or use in- sulin well. In Type 2 diabetes body becomes resistant to insulin and sugar builds up in blood. It also happens at any age, even during childhood. Mostly it is reported in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes. Gestational diabetes This is also a high blood sugar state that appears during preg- nancy. Insulin-blocking hormones produced by the placenta cause this type of diabetes. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. But women those having gestational diabetes, may have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is ac- tually type 2 diabetes. A rare condition called diabetes insipidus is not related to diabetes mellitus, although it has a similar name. It's a different condition in which your kidneys remove too much fluid from your body. Monogenic diabetes is less common and is an inherited form of diabetes. The bottom line diabetes is starting stage of diabetes; it is very hard to spot at first. It is also known as touch of sugar\" or \"borderline diabetes. Causes and risk factors Certain factors increase your risk for diabetes. Normally type 1 diabetes is found in children and teenager. Other factors like physi- cal inactivity, race, and certain health problems such as high blood pressure also affect type 2 diabetes. Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Certain genes are linked to the disease. Type 2 dia- betes increases appeared in overweight persons of more than 45 years age or older. Gestational diabetes is the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant woman's cells less sensitive to the effects of in- sulin. This condition runs in families. Type 2 diabetes occurs due to genetic and lifestyle factors. Obesity and extra body weight in- creases the risk. Carrying extra weight, and belly stomach makes body cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on blood sugar. Ethnicity is also imposes high risk of diabetes. People from eth- nic background African, American, Hispanic or Latino American, Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, American Indian, or Asian American ancestry are more susceptible to high blood pressure, high choles - terol or high triglycerides. Diabetes complications Diabetes imposes severe effects if remain untreated, high blood sugar level is harmful for nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs. Over time, high blood glucose leads to problems such as heart dis - ease, stroke, kidney disease, eye problems, dental disease, nerve damage, foot problems Diabetes symptoms are caused by rising blood sugar. Diabetic person displays symptoms of increased hun- ger, increased thirst, weight loss, tiredness, frequent urination, blurry vision, extreme fatigue, sores, decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction and poor muscle strength. Diabetic women become prone to urinary tract infection, their skin get dry and become itchy. It may also cause recurring infections. This is because ele-160Chronic Non-communicable Diseases: Risk Factors, Acta Scientific Medical Sciences 6.4 (2022): 153-170.vated glucose levels make it harder for the body to heal. High blood sugar damages organs and tissues throughout body. Diabetic per - son become prone to heart attack, stroke, neuropathy, and face eye sight problems, hearing loss, bacterial and fungal infection. Uncon- trolled gestational diabetes can lead to problems that affect both the mother and baby. Diabetes can lead to serious medical compli- cations, but it can be managed by using appropriate medications and lifestyle changes. Treatment of diabetes Diabetic person should avoid carbohydrates in food for example use of rice, sugar and sweat dishes. It increases blood sugar level rises. Take fibrous food materials and take reagular insulin doses according to doctors advice. Getting the right balance of protein, fat, and carbohydrates can help you control your blood sugar. Diet and exercise can help some people manage Type 2 diabetes. If life- style changes aren't enough to lower your blood sugar, you'll need to take medication. Eating the right types of foods can both control your blood sugar and help you lose any excess weight. Few impor - tant drugs such as statins are prescribed in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus [38]. Thyroid dysfunction is also related to Type 2 Diabe- tes Mellitus. It is also related to CVDs and has severe clinical mani- festations [39,40]. Sulfonylurea is used as glucose-lowering agents [41]. Monogenic diabetes is due to single gene defects that pri- marily affect beta cell function with more than 30 different genes reported. Children with antibody-negative, C-peptide-positive dia- betes should be evaluated and genetically tested for monogenic diabetes. Alcoholism Alcohol use disorder (sometimes called alcoholism) is a medi - cal condition. Alcoholism severely affects neural functions and be- havior both in males and females [42]. It is an antisocial act, carry youngsters in deep depression, anxiety [43] and influences genet- ics of users [44]. It imparts slow but cumulative long term effects in user which appear in form of distress or chronic disease. An un- controlled drinking is highly harmful for vital organs. In users alco- hol imposes inability to control drinking due to both a physical and emotional dependence on alcohol. Alcoholism or alcohol dependence or use disorder change habit and mood and person always remain in grip to have strong need to drink. In a state of un-drink alcohol addiction make person more anxious and irritable. As soon as the effect of alcohol wearing off person show withdrawal and face problem in sleeping, shakiness, irritability, anxiety, depression, nausea, restlessness and sweating. Binge or heavy drinking is highly dangerous, it increases the risk of certain cancers i.e. breast, liver, colon and mouth. It also evokes fatty liver disease and cirrhosis. It can also cause damage to the brain and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy is harmful for developing embryo. Alcohol also increases the risk of dementia, despair, depression, coma, seizures and suicide. In heavy drinking stage heavy car crashes, injuries, homicide, and suicide have been seen. Symptoms include repeated alcohol consumption despite re- lated legal and health issues. Those with alcoholism may begin each day with a drink, feel guilty about their drinking and have the desire to cut down on the amount of drinking. No single lab test is available for alcohol use disorder but it is identified by smell and person's conversation behavior. It's a disease of brain function and requires medical and psychological treatments to control it. Treat- ment involves counseling by a healthcare professional. A combina- tion of medications, behavioral therapy and support can help to recover. Various treatment methods such as behavioral therapies including counseling, or talk therapy, with a psychologist or men- tal health counselor can instruct and change behavior the alcoholic person. Topiramate and gabapentin can also decrease cravings in some people. An older medication disulfiram is rarely used today. These medications seem to help decrease the background obses - sional thinking around alcohol. In addition, affected person needs inpatient medical (hospital), residential rehabilitation, outpatient intensive therapy or outpatient maintenance to restore the neuro- psychological behaviour [45]. Family history of alcoholism helps to alleviate the associated problems, and remedial solutions family. There is a need to know the factors, condition, mental situation and behavior of person to relieve stress, restore epigenetics, and lower down the use of alcohol [46]. Narcotics or drug abuses The term narcotic originally referred medically to any psy - choactive compound with numbing or paralyzing properties. Narcotics are now called opioids manily morphine, codeine, and heroin, but are not made from opium. They bind to opioid recep- tors in the central nervous system. These are derivatives of many of the compounds found within raw opium latex. Narcotics are a 161Chronic Non-communicable Diseases: Risk Factors, Acta Scientific Medical Sciences 6.4 (2022): 153-170.class of drugs that are used to treat moderate to severe pain, as well as severe acute pain. There are many types of narcotic pain medications. Some of the more common narcotic pain occurring opiates (plant alkaloids derived from the opium poppy) as well as synthetic (man-made) and semi synthetic opioids are considered to be narcotic drugs, which include both legally prescribed and illicit varieties. Opioids not only diminish the perception of pain signaling in the central nervous system but also produce rewarding, euphoric effects, making them targets for abuse and highly addictive. Narcotics, also known as opiates and opioid analgesics, Narcot- ics are usually prescribed to alleviate intense, short-term pain as in the case when someone has a medical condition (cancer) or when someone is recovering from a surgery. The narcotics bind to nerve receptors located in the brain in order to block and reduce pain. Codeine is typically prescribed when someone experiences mild to moderate pain. A doctor may prescribe something stronger when pain intensifies, like morphine or fentanyl. Effects The consequences of illicit drug use are widespread, caus- ing permanent physical and emotional damage to users and negatively impacting their families, coworkers, and many others with whom they have contact. Drug use negatively impacts a users health, often leading to sickness and disease. They are widely overused and are associated with over two million cases of substance abuse that have resulted in overdoses. Narcotic, impose intense side effects on users. Some common side effects of narcot- ics are dizziness, drowsiness, constipation, dry mouth, headaches, Nausea, Itching (usually mild), Severe narcotic side effects include cardiac arrest, trouble breathing, and chest pain. These drugs bind to 5-HT3 receptor modulates physical dependence on opioid nar- cotics [47]. These make the person psychotic, moody and addictive and impose bowel syndrome [48]. There is a growing opioid epi- demic that is also responsible for increase in Hepatitis. Prevention Control on drug abuse was decided in 1961 convention that is governed by 1972 protocol. This convention establishes strict con- trols on the cultivation of opium poppy, coca bush, cannabis plant and their products. This convention, suggested complete ban on 136 narcotic drugs (although cocaine is a stimulant drug rather than one that induces sleep) including natural products, such as opium and its derivatives, morphine, codeine and heroin. It also provide ban on synthetic drugs, such as methadone and pethidine, as well as cannabis and coca leaf. Parties to the 1961 Conven- tion undertake to limit the production, manufacture, export, im- port, distribution and stocks of, trade in and use and possession of the con-trolled drugs so that they are used exclusively for medical and scientific purposes.). The impact of drugs on society According to NSDUH data over 3.5 million individuals aged 18 and older admitted to having injected an illicit drug during their lifetime in 2004. Of these individuals, 14 percent (498,000) were under the age of 25. Similarly, 123,235 adults living with AIDS were noted in the United States in 2003. This was spread due to use of injection for taking drug. These show least survival rate. CDC fur- ther reports that more than 25,000 people died in 2003 from drug- induced effects. Drug abuse severely affects every section of society. The drug abuse imposes negative consequences not only individuals but largely effect their families and friends. Children of individuals who abuse drugs often are abused or neglected as a result of the in- dividuals' preoccupation with drugs. Children whose parents and other family members abuse drugs often are physically or emotion- ally abused and often lack proper immunizations, medical care, dental care, and necessities such as food, water, and shelter. The risk to children is even greater when their parents or guardians manufacture illicit drugs such as methamphetamine. Methamphet - amine abusers often produce the drug in their own homes and apartments, using hazardous chemicals such as hydriodic acid, io- dine, and anhydrous ammonia. Children who inhabit such homes often inhale dangerous chemical fumes and gases or ingest toxic chemicals or illicit drugs. These children commonly test positive for methamphetamine and suffer from both short- and long-term health consequences. Moreover, because many methamphetamine producers also abuse the drug, children commonly suffer from ne- glect that leads to psychological and developmental problems. The economic impact of drug abuse on businesses whose em- ployees abuse drugs can be significant. The economic consequenc -162Chronic Non-communicable Diseases: Risk Acta Scientific Medical Sciences 6.4 (2022): 153-170.es of drug abuse severely burden federal, state, and local govern - ment resources and, ultimately, the taxpayer. Drug users jeopardize the safety of citizens and adversely affect the environment. Drug abusers are catastrophic to airline pilots, air traffic controllers, train operators, and bus drivers are just a few examples. Drug abuse imposes, absenteeism, lost productivity, and increased use of medical and insurance benefits by employees who abuse drugs affect a business financially. People with addiction often have one or more associated health issues, which could include lung or heart disease, stroke, cancer, or mental health conditions. For example, it is now well-known that tobacco smoke can cause many cancers, methamphetamine can cause severe dental problems, known as meth mouth, and that opi- oids can lead to overdose and death. In addition, some drugs, such as inhalants, may damage or destroy nerve cells, either in the brain or the peripheral nervous system (the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord). Drug use can also increase the risk of contracting infections both for HIV and hepatitis C (a serious liver disease). These people share injection syringes and needles that is a very unsafe practice. It also generates skin infection (cellulitis) after exposure to bacteria by injection drug use. Drug use and other mental illness often co-exist. In some cases, mental disorders such as anxiety, depression, or schizophrenia may come before addic - tion. In other cases, drug use may trigger or worsen those mental health conditions, particularly in people with specific vulnerabili - ties [49]. Narcotic drugs impose anxiety or depression and psychiatric mental disorder in the long run, as well as increase the risk of devel- oping addiction. Narcotics severely affect pregnant or breastfeed - ing mothers. Some drug-exposed children will have developmental problems with behavior, attention, and thinking. Secondhand to- bacco smoke exposes bystanders to at least 250 chemicals that are known to be harmful, particularly to children. Involuntary expo- sure to secondhand smoke increases the risks of heart disease and lung cancer in people who have never smoked. Injection of drugs accounts for 1 in 10 of cases of HIV. Injection drug use is also a major factor in the spread of hepatitis C, endocarditis and cellulitis [50]. Use of illicit drugs or misuse of prescription drugs or drink - ing alcohol is responsible for car accidents driving after drinking alcohol. Drugged driving puts the driver, passengers, and others who share the road at risk. After alcohol, marijuana is the drug most often linked to impair driving. Major negative effects noted in marijuana drivers are faulty lane weaving, poor reaction time, and altered attention to the road. Imaging scans, chest X-rays, and blood tests can show the damaging effects of long-term drug use throughout the body. Smoking Social smoking is crime on non smokers; it is quite distinct from individual smoking because a lonely smoker feels shy and keeps hiding himself. Both types of smoking are evils in society. From adults children also start participating to seek some enjoy. But it is highly harmful for teenage groups. Smoking shows cumulative long term effects and is directly responsible for lung cancer (National Cancer Institute). There are intermittent smokers which use smok - ing one time a day or limited time in a weak, but it is very rare. Pas- sive smoking of cannabis is highly harmful. The most commonly- used definition characterizes as social smokers those who smoke predominantly when others are present. So, for example, young adult smokers, such as college students, are often characterized as social smokers, because many (27-70%) of them say they most of - ten smoke with others about 19% smoke only with others. Control and prevention of NCDs Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) cause a large burden of disease globally. Some infectious diseases cause an increased risk of developing specific NCDs [51]. Control and prevention of NCDs is a very challenging task because society is changing very fast and moral values are decreasing in youngsters. The condition is more alarming as teenage groups are under grip of alcoholism, smoking and narcotics with changing habits and their likeliness for high slated fast foods. Condition is more vulnerable in low economic African and south east Asian countries. Though situation in Latin American and European countries is also severe but it is under managerial limits because healths care medication and functioning of counseling centers. For a achieving an early success and for a quick action on NCDs change in human behavior and habit through awareness, counseling, social and community medicines may pro- vide good results. Further, change in lifestyle can cut down the dis - ease burden of NCDs like CVDs, mainly stroke, high blood pressure, stress, strain, diabetes, cancer and AIDs. Integrated management of HIV/NCDs: knowledge, attitudes, and practices of health care workers Incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in HIV patients on ART in a developing country [52]. 163Chronic Non-communicable Diseases: Risk Acta Scientific Medical Sciences 6.4 (2022): 153-170.Modification of known risk factors will reduce the burden non- communicable diseases (NCDs). Though there are cumulative numbers of NCD risk factors exhibited by an individual which are responsible for disease burden [53]. Demographically, the more number of cases are reported from rural areas in comparison to the urban areas. This significant rise in rural areas is poverty, lack of proper education, unemployment and awareness. These situ- ations can be managed by forming Village Health Teams (VHTs) which can focus on infectious diseases and maternal-child health. These must include skilled clinicians and technicians so that an early diagnosis, treatment and counseling become possible. It will reduce the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) [54]. Though, endogenous factors are associated with, but exog- enous factors such as region, residence status, land tenure system and behavioral characteristics have significant causal effects on the cumulative NCD risk factors [53]. In reducing the risk factors and disease burden long term plans based on survey, reporting, hospital care medication and regular counseling will play important role. Huge funds are required to develop hospitals and clinical centers to purchase essential equip- ment and medications for diverse NCDIs at first-referral level hos - pitals. Further, there is a need for decentralization and integration of NCDI services in existing care platforms and improved assess - ment and monitoring to fully achieve universal health coverage through Govt aids and insurance companies [55]. Medication and equipment availability can solve issues related to high blood pres - sure, hypertension acute, epilepsy, type 1 and type 2- diabetes and asthma. Modern diagnosing tools equipments and medications are needed in hospitals to cure patients heart failure, rheumatic heart disease, hypertensive emergencies or acute minor surgical condi - tions. For coordination of various hospitals the monitoring frame- work must be established for evaluating health system response to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). This might include all indica- tors to assess availability of affordable basic technologies and es - sential medicines required by both public and private primary care centers [56] . Both private and public primary care facilities and public secondary facilities are currently not adequately prepared to comprehensively address the burden of NCDs in India [56]. For better management collected data on human resources, equip- ment, NCD screening and management, medicines, and laboratory tests [56]. To reduce the disease burden of NCDs in low incoming countries heavy investment be needed to equip the hospitals to fo- cus largely on survey, diagnosis and treatment of communicable diseases. These low income countries have epidemiologic, demo - graphic, and nutritional transitions. Further, to control age related NCDs schooling counseling, treat- ment and socialization are important methods. For quick control WHO must limit the production, manufacture, export, import, distribution and stocks of, trade in and use and possession of the controlled drugs. With this production of natural narcotics must be fully banned. It will certainly cut down infection-attributable NCD burden in many sub-Saharan African countries [57] where several common risk factors of NCDs (tobacco, alcohol use, high systolic blood pressure, dietary risks, high fasting plasma glucose, air pol- lution, and high LDL cholesterol) are enforcing people. To tackle with NCDs development of multisectoral action plans are important for identification of common challenges. These will help in applying and opting best clinical practices, share their expe- riences [58] about family history, risk factors, disease burden due to obesity, high BP , CVDs and diabetes. These plans must have sur - veys on expenditure on food, clothing, hygiene, and energy. These will help in mitigation of nutrient deficiency diseases and need for consumption of different food Law enforcement is also an impor - tant tool that can give a direction and judicial framework to reduce the NCDs under social evils. There is requirement of international agreements, national and sub national legislation, regulations and other executive instruments, and decisions of courts and tribunals [59]. World Health Organization and its partners could take to mo- bilize the legal workforce, strengthen legal capacity and support ef - fective use of law at the national level. Legal and regulatory actions must move to the centre of national non-communicable disease action plans. This requires high-level leadership from global and national leaders, enacting evidence-based legislation and building legal capacities [59]. Hence, law can applied as a tool for imple- menting policies for prevention and control of leading risk factors [59]. It will also help in identification of key areas of intersection between law and non-communicable diseases.164Chronic Non-communicable Diseases: Risk Acta Scientific Medical Sciences 6.4 (2022): 153-170.Type of disease Causes Symptoms Morbidity Treatment Disease burden Cardiovascular diseases Coronary heart diseasesCigarette smoking, high BP , elevated serum cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, sedentary habit and stress, High LDL cholesterolInadequate blood flow, impairment of heart function124-283 per 1,00,000 popula- tionChanging life style, daily exercise, dietary habit, medicinesMacroeconomic Non reversible, high risk Dilated cardiomyopathyProblem in heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle stretches and thins (dilates) and can't pump blood as well as a healthy heart can.

Conclusion It is true today NCDs creating havoc as large portion of world population mainly youngsters are in grip of these diseases. There is a rising economy, urbanization, pollution and NCDs. Among major causes are awareness, social behavior, medication and food hab- it. the proportion of crude NCD burden attributable to infectious causes was 11\u00b77%, which was higher than the proportion of bur- den attributable to each of several common risk factors of NCDs. There is high prevelance of use of tobacco, alcohol, smoking, and narcotics with additional burden of high systolic blood pressure, dietary risks, high fasting plasma glucose, air pollution, and high LDL cholesterol. In other broad regions, infectious causes ranked between fifth and eighth in terms of crude attributable propor - tions among the nine risks compared. Ethnicity is also one of the important factors with age and sex related infectious risks re- mained highest in sub-Saharan Africa of the broad regions. Com - pared to the urban residence status, the relative risk of living in a rural area significantly increased the risk of having 1 or 2 risk factors by a multiple of 1.55. Conclusions: The non-communicable disease burden is on the increase, with more participants report- ing to have at least two risk factors. Besides, endogenous factors, exogenous factors such as region, residence status, land tenure 167Chronic Non-communicable Diseases: Risk Factors, Acta Scientific Medical Sciences 6.4 (2022): 153-170.Bibliographysystem and behavioral characteristics have significant causal ef - fects on the cumulative NCD risk factors. There is an urgent need to maintain health care institutions, medical care, socio-economic de - velopment, community awareness and health planning and treat- ment rate and recovery. Absence of known agent, multi-factorial causation, long living period and indefinite onset, CVD, coronary heart diseases, smoking, hypertension, serum cholesterol, obesity, cancer blindness. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are increas- ing in prevalence in low-income countries including Uganda. Huge funds are required for allocation of human resources and essen - tial medicines and up gradation of technologies for diagnosis and treatment. Funds are also required for purchase of equipment mo- dalities are desperately needed in order to adequately address the rapidly growing NCD burden.
