Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy. We need your help. I would like to contribute Magic Johnson did not contract HIV from a contaminated vaccine If Your Time is short - Magic Johnson announced in 1991 that he had contracted HIV through unprotected sex. - There is no evidence that National Basketball Association players took part in a Hepatitis B vaccine program, as this post claims. As conspiracies continue to spread that the COVID-19 vaccine is causing adverse health effects in athletes, a public health figure claimed something similar happened in the 1990s \u2014 specifically, that Basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson contracted HIV after taking a contaminated vaccine. Dr. Judy Mikovits, a [controversial virologist](https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/may/08/fact-checking-plandemic-documentary-full-false-con/) who made headlines for spreading false claims in the COVID-19 conspiracy film \"Plandemic,\" claimed in an interview that Johnson was among other National Basketball Association players who were exposed to HIV after taking a \"contaminated hepatitis B vaccine.\" She made the comments in a video interview with Stew Peters, a far-right radio show host with his own history of spreading [conspiracy theories](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/19/watch-water/stew-peters-film-watch-water-ridiculously-claims-c/) about [vaccines](https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/nov/29/died-suddenly-repeats-debunked-covid-19-vaccine-cl/). \"They did not protect the NFL,\" Mikovits said in a clip from the interview that she shared in a [Jan. 12 Instagram post](https://perma.cc/QM25-6CKS?type=standard) and on This was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our [partnership with Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related).) Johnson, who spent his 13-year NBA career with the Los Angeles Lakers, has shared openly for [more than 30 years](https://www.ebony.com/31-years-later-magic-johnson-reflects-on-contracting-hiv/) that he contracted HIV through unprotected sex. Featured Fact-check On Nov. 7, 1991, Johnson [announced](https://apnews.com/article/los-angeles-lakers-nba-entertainment-sports-health-d51716031d2641c7e58957e9ef9da718) that he was HIV positive, a public admission that came at a time when [harmful stigmas](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/sports/2021/11/07/magic-johnsons-1991-hiv-positive-announcement-paradigm-shift-change-still-more-done/6265391001/) surrounded those who contracted the virus. \"I am certain that I was infected by having unprotected sex with a woman who has the virus. The problem is that I can't pinpoint the time, the place or the woman. It's a matter of numbers,\" [he said.](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.latimes.com%2Farchives%2Fla-xpm-1991-11-13-sp-1326-story.html) Since his diagnosis, Johnson has been an outspoken advocate and activist for HIV and AIDS patients. We reached out to Mikovits for evidence of her claim, but did not receive a response in time for publication. We did not find any evidence or news reports showing that NBA players had participated in a hepatitis B vaccine program like the one Mikovits described. But we've seen many claims about vaccines [containing HIV](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/12/facebook-posts/no-covid-19-vaccines-do-not-contain-hiv-lipid-wrap/) or causing [AIDS](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/may/16/viral-image/still-no-connection-between-covid-19-vaccines-and-/) over the last three years, all of them [baseless](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/08/blog-posting/no-covid-19-vaccines-arent-causing-aids/).
