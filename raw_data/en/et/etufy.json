The AAEP Proceedings is protected by copyright andinformation submitted and accepted becomes theproperty of AAEP. However, requests for copies or re-prints will be honored by AAEP only with the cooper-ative permission of the presenting author, who by hisor her presentation represents all authors. AAEP re-serves the right not to accept any submission withoutfurther recourse. Presentations for the AAEP Convention will be selected directly from the review-ready submissions to the AAEP.Submissions may include case series with follow-up data, orthe results of experimental or observational studies as sci-entic papers, as well as \"How to\" and review papers. Selec-tion will be made by the Educational Programs Committee.The quality of the submission will determine the selection.Missing data or proposed, but not completed procedures, willexclude the submission from consideration. AAEP invitesinformation dealing with any subject germane to equinepractice, but special consideration will be given to submis-sions by practitioners and material with practical content ornew information. At least one author of a report describingdiagnosis, treatment, or the interpretation of medical infor-mation should be a veterinarian. All submissions should strictly adhere to the Instructions for Authors. Submissions will be ranked using the AAEPScoring Criteria (see Scoring Criteria section) and the high-est-ranking papers will be selected for the available time. Authors are expected to acknowledge all sources of fund- ing or support for the work described and to disclose to theEducational Programs Committee any nancial interest (in-cluding ownership, employment, consultancy arrangements,or service as an ofcer or board member) they have withcompanies that manufacture or sell products that gureprominently in the paper or with companies that manufac-ture or sell competing products. Such an interest will notnecessarily influence the decision to accept or reject a sub-mission for the program, but must be included in the Ac-knowledgments section for the convention proceedings. Guidelines: Failure to adhere to the following format will result in non-acceptance. It is the author's responsibility to convince theEducational Programs Committee of the value of the submis-sion, as well as to portray to the reader the contents of thepresentation. Specic instructions for Scientic papers, \"How to\" papers, Review papers, <250 word abstracts, and Business papers, and can be found in their respectivesections.

Results5. Discussion6. Acknowledgments i. Declaration of Ethicsii. Conflicts of Interest 7. References Title: The title should be 15 words or fewer, at the top and on therst page. Example:Upper Respiratory Dysfunction in Horses During HighSpeed Exercise Take Home Message: This should be a short, concise summarization of the mainconclusion and should be no longer than two or three sen-tences (approximately 50 words). \"How to\" papers do not require a take-home message. Example:Local anesthetic injected into the cofn joint is not se-lective for only this joint. Such injections will desensitizemuch of the navicular bone and its suspensory ligaments. Introduction: The rationale for the submission should be given briefly andsignicant published work acknowledged here. The clinicalsignicance should also be included, as well as a clear state-ment of the objective or purpose of the submission. Thestatement of objectives is usually found in the last sentenceof the Introduction. Materials and Methods: This section should describe experimental methodology inthe case of a didactic study or, in the case of a clinical study,should include a description of the population from whichthe animals were selected and how they were selected forinclusion in the report. Data obtained and how they were obtained must be de- scribed. A description of the statistical methods used to sum-marize data, test hypotheses, and characterize the signicanceof results should also be included. For weights and measures,metric units should be used. Dosages should be expressedentirely in metric units and with specic time intervals. vi 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSExample:22 mg/kg, q 12 h, IV (not 10mg/lb, BID, IV) Results: Actual results with numbers and data must be presented.When possible, quantify ndings (mean, median, proportion)and present them with appropriate estimates of measure-ment error or uncertainty (such as standard deviation (SD),standard error (SE) or condence interval) in addition to theresults of hypothesis testing. If the data can be well repre-sented with a graph or gure, these are encouraged if sub- sequent publication is not anticipated. If numbers and dataare not presented due to concerns regarding publication in arefereed journal, indications of relative differences betweengroups such as odds ratios, % change, and signicant differ-ences must be included in the submission to be consideredacceptable. In these instances, the authors should submit thedata in the form of means, standard deviations, or other de-scriptions of comparisons among groups in an appendix, whichwill not be published and only used for review purposes. Discussion: Important ndings documented in the results of the studyshould be stated. Results should be related to other workwhich has been done and how the results differ or agree withpreviously published work and why any differences may haveoccurred should be discussed. The practical take home mes-sage for the equine practitioner should be clearly dened andstated in the summarizing nal statement. This statementmay be longer, but should be similar in content to the takehome message at the beginning of the paper. Acknowledgments: Acknowledgments should include nancial and materialsupport for research (e.g. Grayson Jockey Club ResearchFoundation, AQHA Foundation) and technical support forwork performed. Declaration of Ethics: A Declaration of Ethics statement should be included in thepaper under the Acknowledgments section. Authors mustdeclare if they have adhered to the Principles of VeterinaryMedical Ethics of the AVMA (https://www.avma.org/KB/ Policies/Pages/Principles-of-Veterinary-Medical-Ethics-of-the- AVMA.aspx) If your paper or presentation references the use of a com-pounded pharmaceutical, please be certain that you are fa-miliar with the FDA guidelines on the use of compoundedpharmaceuticals and that the product you reference is in com-pliance. See section below regarding papers using compoundedmedications or medical devices.All submissions should cite levels of evidence-basedmedicine.You should plan to include any ethical considerations as partof your oral presentation if your paper is accepted. Conflicts of Interest: Authors are expected to disclose the nature of any nancialinterests they have with companies that manufacture or sellproducts that gure prominently in the submission or withcompanies that manufacture or sell competing products. (Thisincludes ownership, employment, consultancy arrangements,or service as an ofcer or board member.) A Conflict of Intereststatement should be included in the paper under the Acknowl-edgments section whether a conflict exists or not.Example of COI StatementConflict of Interest: Dr. John Doe has no conflict of interest.Dr. Jane Doe has served as a paid technology analyst forthe venture capitalists that initiated the formation of Com-pany ABC and served as a member of the Board of Direc-tors of Company ABC from its inception until 2008.Company ABC is currently commercializing the use ofProduct XYZ.

All authors are required to disclose any actual or potentialconflict of interest including any nancial, personal or otherrelationships with other people or organizations within threeyears of beginning the submitted work that could inappro-priately influence, or be perceived to influence, their work. At the point of submission, the American Association of Equine Practitioner (AAEP)'s policy requires that authorsmust disclose and describe the nature of any actual or po-tential nancial and/or personal relationships. When consid-ering whether a conflicting interest or connection should bedeclared, the author is asked to answer the following: Isthere any arrangement that would embarrass you or any ofyour co-authors if it was to emerge after publication and youhad not declared it? As an integral part of the online submission process, submit- ting authors are required to conrm whether they or theirco-authors have any actual or potential conflicts of interest todeclare, and to provide details of these. It is the submittingauthor's responsibility to ensure that all authors adhere to thispolicy. 1. Any and all authors listed on the paper must disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest 2. Any and all authors listed on the paper must disclose if no conflict exists 3. The nature of the conflict (actual or potential) needs to be described Conflict of Interest in Industry Sponsored Research: Authors whose papers are submitted for publication mustdeclare all relevant sources of funding in support of thepreparation of a paper. The AAEP requires full disclosure ofnancial support as to whether it is from the industry, thepharmaceutical or any other industry, government agencies,or any other source. This information should be included inthe Conflict of Interest section of the published paper. Authors are required to specify sources of funding for the study and to indicate whether or not the text was reviewed bythe sponsor prior to submission, i.e., whether the study waswritten with full investigator access to all relevant data andwhether the sponsor exerted editorial influence over the writ-ten text. In addition to disclosure of direct nancial support tothe authors or their laboratory and prior sponsor-review of thepaper, submitting authors are asked to disclose all relevantconsultancies prior to submission. This information should beincluded in the Conflict of Interest section at the end of paper. References: All submissions must include references.

IACUC Approval: AAEP is dedicated to the humane use of animals in scienticresearch in accordance with the Institutional Animal Careand Use Committee (IACUC). AAEP recognizes the difcultypractitioners may have when attempting to obtain IACUCapproval therefore the Educational Programs Committee hascompiled a list of liaisons that practitioners can use as aresource. For a copy of this list, e-mail Carey Ross atcross@aaep.org. Compounded Medications or Medical Devices: To be considered for selection in the Annual Conventionprogram, abstracts that include the use of compoundeddrugs must adhere to the tenets described in the AAEPEquine Veterinary Compounding Guidelines (2005). Speci-cally, compounded drug or medical devices cannot be used inlieu of a FDA approved product if the approved product has a viii 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSlabel indication for the purpose or condition being evaluatedor described in the abstract. An exception to this policy will be made for abstracts re- porting clinical trials conducted in fulllment of the require-ments for the approval of a new drug (FDA) or biologic(USDA). Submitted papers that use compounded drugs or medical devices will be reviewed by at least two individuals with ex-pertise in this area selected by the CE Steering Committee.The individuals will then make a recommendation to the EPCabout the suitability of the submission for potential inclu-sion in the program. Standard of Care: The AAEP is sensitized to having people use the term \"Stan-dard of Care\" from the podium. If you plan to do this pleaseinclude this in your abstract or written submitted material sothe EPC can conrm its agreement with your statement.1. A diagnostic and treatment process that a clinician should follow for a certain type of patient, illness, or clin-ical circumstance. Adjuvant chemotherapy for lung can-cer is \"a new standard of care, but not necessarily the onlystandard of care.\" (New England Journal of Medicine,2004). 2. In legal terms, the level at which the average, prudent provider in a given community would practice. It is howsimilarly qualied practitioners would have managed thepatient's care under the same or similar circumstances.The medical malpractice plaintiff must establish the ap-propriate standard of care and demonstrate that the stan-dard of care has been breached. Deadline: ALL papers must be submitted online by March 15,2016, 3:00 p.m. E.T.; under no circumstances will submis-sions received after the deadline be considered or reviewed.ALL deadlines must be adhered to in order to have the pub-lished Proceedings available at the meeting. Review Process: To respect the integrity of the Annual Convention programand ensure the fairness of the review process, AAEP hasadopted blind reviewing in which the identity of the authorsand reviewers are not known to each other. Papers will bereviewed, scored, and selected by the Educational ProgramsCommittee. Please follow the blinding guidelines below.Blinding Guidelines: The title page and/or front matter of the blinded version ofa paper should contain no references to any author or tohis/her afliation. All unpublished works by an author of the submitted man-uscript should be blinded. When referring to an author's publication, the form of thirdperson should be used. Any acknowledgments section should be removed from theblinded version. Also, please delete any notes that indicateafliation, conference presentations, grants, author or de-partmental web sites, etc. Do not use author name or afliation in the names of thesubmitted les. Scoring Criteria: One goal of the Educational Programs Committee (EPC) inchoosing submissions for the AAEP annual meeting is tocombine the best available clinical research with clinicalexperience and expertise to meet the needs of our patients.To request a copy of the AAEP Scoring Criteria, e-mail CareyRoss at cross@aaep.org.Pre-Press Approval: Authors will have nal approval at the page proof stage.Changes/updates in numbers, dosages or inappropriategrammar may be made within one week of receiving pageproofs.

The technique should be relativelynew or not widely understood or used in practice. The goal ofthe \"How to\" paper is to give the equine veterinarians theinformation they need to critically evaluate the pros and consof the technique and implement it in their practice if theychoose. The title should begin with \"How to . . .\" and clearly iden- tify the technique or procedure that will be presented. A\"Take Home Message\" is not required for \"How to\" papers.The Introduction should include why you use the technique.If there is a problem with the traditional methods or thecurrently used method can be improved, this should beexplained. The Materials and Methods section should explain exactly how the technique is performed so that another veterinarianfamiliar with the subject area could follow your example. Youmay use a step-by-step method for the paper and the presen-tation. All medications, supplies, and equipment usedshould be described using generic names. Trade names andaddresses of commercial products critical to the techniquecan be included in footnotes. The Results section should include a summary of what happens when you use this technique. The number of horsestreated in this manner and an assessment of the outcomeshould be included. You may use personal assertions or datato assert its value, but you must explain how you determinedthat the technique works. In the Discussion section you can give your personal views as to why you think the technique works. Discuss the prosand cons of your approach.

Review papers are presented for the purpose of updating themembership on a new subject or for gathering informationthat may be conflicting. The aim of the paper is to help themembership put the information in perspective, and to makejudgments on conflicting information. A review paper will notprincipally present original data. The goal is to clarify exist-ing knowledge on a subject and help the membership betteruse the information in their day to day practice. Review papers should generally be formatted as described in the \"Instructions for Authors of Manuscripts\" exceptwhere otherwise noted here. The paper should be titled \"Re-view of Some Subject.\" The content of review articles shouldbe organized with headings and subheadings that provide alogical flow to the material presented. A \"Take Home Mes-sage\" is required for a Review Paper. The Introduction shoulddene the subject matter and put it in context, explainingwhy the review is necessary. The purpose of the review papershould be clearly stated in the Introduction. Agreement and disagreement within the subject matter should be identied along with the strengths and limitationsof the information sources. Reference should be made to theauthors who generally support the opinions stated. The au-thor's perspective, including his/her own interpretation ofthe information if it is different from previously publishedopinions, should be included. The end of the discussionshould contain a summary and the conclusion that the au-thor has drawn for the audience, based upon the revieweddata. As with a Scientic Paper, a \"Take Home Message\"should be provided by the author that summarizes the prac-tical application of the information for the practitioner. If previously published material is submitted, including text, photographs or drawings, the author must acknowledgethe original source and submit written permission from thecopyright holders (author and publisher) to reproduce thematerial.

In order to encourage submission of the newest scienticinformation for inclusion in the AAEP Annual Conventionprogram and simultaneously not jeopardize future publica-tion of this material in a refereed journal, the following cri-teria have been developed for these submissions of ScienticPapers that will be published in the AAEP Proceedings. Insuch instances, the published abstract can be /H11349250 words. However, these \"abbreviated abstracts\" should follow astructured format with the same subheadings (Take HomeMessage, Introduction, Materials & Methods, Results andDiscussion) as the full-length scientic paper. Please be aware that the Take Home Message is included in the total word count.

Under references, list all authors when there are threeor fewer; list only the rst three and add \"et al.\" when thereare four or more. The author is responsible for the formattingand accuracy of all reference citations. Since readers fre-quently depend upon the reference citations to guide them infurther reading, it is imperative that the citations are correctso that libraries can locate the papers a reader may wish toobtain. Reference examples can be found in the General In-structions for Authors. Footnotes: References to personal communications and papers submit-ted but not yet accepted for publication should also befootnoted: Figures: The resolution should be at least 300 dpi.

Provide this permission when you submit youroriginal manuscript. Deadline: ALL papers must be submitted online by March 15,2016, 3:00 p.m. E.T.; under no circumstances will submis-sions received after the deadline be considered or reviewed.ALL deadlines must be adhered to in order to have the pub-lished Proceedings available at the meeting. Review Process: Papers will be reviewed, scored, and selected by the Educa-tional Programs Committee. Since the presentation ability ofbusiness speakers is crucial, the review for these papersrequires a two-step process: 1. Initial acceptance of the paperwhile the author is blinded. 2. The process becomes un-blinded before nal selections are made. This two-step review process was implemented to protect the association from selecting speakers whose presenta-tions may have a strong commercial bend. Blinding Guidelines: The title page and/or front matter of the blinded version ofa paper should contain no references to any author or tohis/her afliation. Any acknowledgments section should be removed from theblinded version. Also, please delete any notes that indicateafliation, conference presentations, author or departmen-tal web sites, etc. Do not use author name or afliation in the names of thesubmitted les.Scoring Criteria: The subject matter is relevant to the business operations ofa veterinary business. How-to Cases should be based uponpersonal experience in a veterinary business. Papers de-scribing a business process should be applicable to anequine veterinary business and should be supported by ref-erences from business publications. To request a copy of theAAEP Scoring Criteria, e-mail Carey Ross at cross@aaep.org. Pre-Press Approval: Authors will have nal approval at the page proof stage.Changes/updates may be made within one week of receivingpage proofs. Final grammatical changes will be the decisionof the editors. Substantial changes or removal of any datawill result in forfeiture of complimentary registration andtravel, and exclusion from the program. Reimbursement: Presenting authors will receive one complimentary registra-tion and a reimbursement of $550 to help support travel. Mentors for Authors: Paper submissions by private practitioners and rst timeauthors are highly encouraged. Please email Carey Ross(cross@aaep.org) to request a list of members in various areas of expertise that have agreed to volunteer their time tomentor an author who needs guidance. \"How to\" Paper Submissions: \"How to\" papers are presented to describe and explain atechnique or procedure used in practice. The goal of thesepapers is to give the equine veterinarians the informationthey need to critically evaluate the pros and cons of thetechnique and implement it in their practice if they choose. \"How to\" Papers should follow the same guidelines in this document, except where otherwise noted below. The Title should begin with \"How to . . .\" and clearly iden- tify the technique or procedure that will be presented. A \"Take Home Message\" is not required for \"How to\" papers. The Introduction should include why you use the tech- nique. If there is a problem with the traditional methods orthe currently used method can be improved, this should beexplained. The Materials and Methods section should explain exactly how the technique is performed so that another veterinarianfamiliar with the subject area could follow your example. Youmay use a step-by-step method for the paper and thepresentation. The Results section should include a summary of what happens when you use this technique. You may use personalassertions or data to assert its value, but you must explainhow you determined that the technique works. In the Discussion section you can give your personal views as to why you think the technique works. Discuss the prosand cons of your approach. Explain how the technique ishelpful and why this should be important to your colleagues.The end of the discussion should contain a summary of thetechnique and its advantages in the take home message.Case selection, case study number, and case follow-upshould all be included. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 xiiiWant to know how your AAEP Annual Convention program came together? The Educational Programs Committee (EPC) is charged with creating and reviewing educationalcontent to produce high-quality CE for the AAEP. The committee is composed of AAEP membervolunteers from both small and large private practices as well as academia and industry. Membersinclude both general practitioners and specialists.The Las Vegas program includes invited papers for the \"In-depth\" and \"How to\" sessions as wellas sessions comprised of papers that independent authors submitted for consideration. Topicchoices for the invited \"In Depth\" and \"How To\" sessions are based on member feedback from the2010 AAEP CE Needs Analysis survey. Topic session leaders are selected by the Program Chair,and then these session leaders invite a slate of speakers to prepare the papers that become an \"InDepth\" overview or a series of related \"How To\" talks. Although invited, these papers undergo arigorous peer review process by the EPC.Papers submitted by independent authors are each assigned 3 reviewers from the EPC. Thereviewers do not know the names of the authors. Content is scored using the criteria of StudyDesign, Study Quality, Innovation and Impact, Practicality, and Manuscript Quality. Once papersare scored, they are discussed by the section facilitators and reviewers. The highest rankingpapers are included on the program to accommodate the number of slots available. This year 200papers were submitted for the 67 available slots on the program.Non-scientic sessions addressing business, welfare, ethical and industry concerns are alsoplanned as the scientic program materializes. Speakers who are invited to participate in thesesessions prepare papers that are also reviewed by members of the EPC for inclusion in theProceedings.The peer review process for the AAEP Proceedings is rigorous. It requires an enormous effort bymore than 50 members of the EPC to create the best possible program for the AAEP membership.Several thousand volunteer hours were spent putting together the Las Vegas program, so pleasethank them for all their hard work creating this program for you. xiv 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSGeneral Instructions for Authors Papers: Guidelines for Authors ix \"How To\" Papers: Guidelines for Authors x Review Papers: Guidelines for Authors x Abstracts /H11349250 Words: Guidelines for Authors xi Business of Practice Skin Grafting Horses That You Can Perform in Your Practice 1 Jim Schumacher, DVM, MS, DACVS What You Should and Should Not Put In or On a Wound 9 Dean A.

Introduction Skin grafting wounds of horses is performed most commonly to speed healing of wounds so large theycannot heal by second intention, but any healthyopen wound can be grafted. Grafted wounds healmore rapidly than do wounds that heal by secondintention, and more rapid healing may make graft-ing more economical than a protracted period ofbandaging. The two basic types of skin grafts are the pedicle graft and the free graft. A pedicle graft is createdadjacent to the wound and when transferred to thewound still remains connected to the donor site by avascular pedicle. A wound healed with a pediclegraft has a good cosmetic appearance because thegraft is comprised of all components of skin, butpedicle grafting is not used commonly to coverwounds of horses because mobilizing skin of horsesto advance a pedicle graft is difcult. Grafts ap- plied to wounds of horses are usually free grafts. A free skin graft is a section of skin that has been detached completely from its donor site. An au-tograft, or isograft, is a free graft transferred fromone site to another on the same individual and is, byfar, the most common type of free graft applied to wounds of horses. An allograft, or homograft, is afree graft transferred between two members of thesame species, and a xenograft, or heterograft, is afree graft transferred from a member of one speciesto a member of another species. The most com-monly used xenograft is the porcine xenografts. Allografts and xenografts provoke an immuneresponse and, therefore, are eventually rejected.They are sometimes applied to a wound as a biolog-ical dressing (see Using Grafts as Biological Ban-dages below). Free skin grafts are also classied according to whether they include the entire dermis or just aportion of it. Full-thickness grafts contain the epi-dermis and the entire dermis, whereas split-thick-ness grafts contain the epidermis but only a portionof the dermis. Full- or split-thickness skin graftscan be applied as sheets (i.e., sheet grafts) or im-planted within the wound (i.e., island grafts). Eachtechnique of free skin grafting has benets anddrawbacks, and the technique selected, therefore,depends on the circumstances, such as the size orlocation of the wound, the necessity for cosmesis, AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 sur- geon, and the owner's nances. The free graft attaches to the wound by brin within minutes after it is applied and is nourishedinitially by imbibing plasma into the graft's vessels,a process referred to as plasmatic imbibition. 1-5 Within 2 to 3 days, capillaries and broblasts fromthe wound invade the brin. The new capillariesinvade other vessels within the graft, establish newvascular channels into its dermis, and anastomosewith capillaries in the graft. 3,4The graft is revascu- larized by day 5 and is attached rmly to the woundby day 10. Wounds of horses most commonlygrafted are granulating, but fresh tissue is morelikely to accept a graft than is granulation tissuebecause fresh tissue is more vascular. Grafting awound while the wound is fresh is better than wait-ing to graft until the wound has lled with granula-tion tissue. Immature granulation tissue accepts agraft more readily than mature granulation tissuefor the same reason. Chronic granulation tissue,therefore, should be trimmed to below the wound'sedge, and grafting postponed until the wound haslled with fresh granulation tissue. The woundshould be free of signs of inflammation before it isgrafted, and removing the upper portion of the gran-ulation bed not only allows the wound to ll withnew, highly vascular granulation tissue, it also re-moves bacteria and polymorphonuclear cells thatcontribute to inflammation. The most common cause of failure of a skin graft to be accepted by a wound is infection, 6but other causes are accumulation of fluid beneath the graft,shearing forces between the wound and the graft,excessive inflammation of the wound, and poor vas-cularity of the wound. 1,2,5The wound becomes in- fected when its concentration of bacteria exceeds itsability to rid itself of bacteria, but the concentrationnecessary to infect a wound is much less for somebacteria, particularly \u00df-hemolytic streptococci andpseudomonads, than for others. 3,5Granulating wounds on the distal portion of limbs of horses areinherently more inflamed than are wounds locatedelsewhere on the body. 7,8Grafts applied to wounds of the distal portion of the limbs of horses, therefore,may be more prone to failure than are grafts appliedto wounds proximal to the hock and carpus. Anaccumulation of exudate, blood, or serum beneatha graft prevents brin from attaching graft tothe wound and obstructs revascularization of thegraft. 9Shearing forces between the wound and the graft, caused by movement of the bandage,disrupt brin and impair revascularization. A wound should be assumed to be infected if it shows signs of inflammation. 10To resolve infection of a granulating wound, the appropriate antimicro-bial drug is best administered topically because an-timicrobial drugs administered systemically arelikely to fail to reach a therapeutic concentrationwithin the surface of granulation tissue. 3,11Strep- tococcae are nearly always susceptible to a \u00df-lactamantibiotic,12whereas pseudomonads are usually susceptible to an aminoglycoside antibiotic.2A top- ically applied \u00df-lactam antibiotic may become inef-fective in resolving a streptococcal infection if otherbacteria in the wound are not susceptible to the\u00df-lactam antibiotic \u00df-lactamase, an be preserved,however, by concurrently administering clavulanicacid, a potent inhibitor of \u00df-lactamase. Most bac-teria and the inflammatory cells they attract can beremoved from an infected, granulating wound sim-ply by excising the supercial layer of the granula-tion tissue, the site where the bacteria reside. 2. Preparing the Wound for Grafting Chronic granulation tissue should be trimmed tobelow the wound's edge, and grafting postponed un-til the wound has lled with fresh granulation tis-sue. The wound should be free of signs ofinflammation before it is grafted, and removing theupper portion of the granulation bed not only allowsthe wound to ll with new, highly vascular granu-lation tissue, it also removes bacteria and polymor-phonuclear cells that contribute to inflammation.Hair surrounding the wound should be clipped, andthe wound should be cleansed with an dilute anti-septic solution or with 0.9% saline solution. Skinsurrounding the wound should be cleansed with anantiseptic soap, but application of soap to the woundshould be avoided because soap may inflame thewound and drive bacteria deep into the granulationtissue. 3. Island Grafting The simplest method of skin grafting is island graft-ing, a technique in which small discs, plugs, or stripsof full-thickness or partial-thickness skin are im-planted into a granulating wound for the purpose ofincreasing the area of skin from which epithelialcells can migrate to cover the wound. Types of is-land grafts applied to wounds of horses includepunch grafts, pinch grafts, and tunnel grafts. Punch grafts are full-thickness plugs of skin har- vested and implanted into granulation tissue usingskin biopsy punches. The grafts can be harvesteddirectly from an inconspicuous site on the horse,such as the portion of the neck that lies beneath themane or the perineal region, by using a 6- to 8-mmdiameter skin biopsy punch. The small woundscreated by the punch are usually left unsutured toheal by second intention. Subcutaneous fascia must be excised from each graft to the subcutaneous fascia by apply-ing tension to a hemostat attached to the subcuta-neous fascia while grasping the plug with a thumbforceps in the other hand (Fig. 1). Another clini-cian slices the tensed subcutaneous fascia TRAUMA/WOUND MANAGEMENTgraft with a scalpel blade. Another technique used to remove subcutaneous fascia from the graft is,after penetrating the skin with the skin biopsypunch, to lift the edge of the graft, using thumbforceps, to expose subcutaneous fascia, which is thenexcised from the dermis. Some clinicians prefer toharvest punch grafts from a section of skin excisedfrom the pectoral region to avoid the tedious task ofexcising subcutaneous fascia from each plug. 14 The plugs are harvested from the excised section ofskin by using the biopsy punch after subcutaneousfascia is excised from the section of skin. The sec-tion of skin is discarded after the plugs have beenharvested, and the donor site in the cranial pectoralarea is closed in one or two layers. The recipient holes in the wound are created using a slightly smaller punch (i.e., approximately 2 mmsmaller diameter) than that used to harvest thegrafts to allow for contraction of the grafts so thatthe grafts t snuggly within their recipient holes.A cotton-tipped applicator inserted into each holeprevents a blood clot from forming within the holeand facilitates locating the holes for inserting thegrafts. Creation of the holes should begin distallyand proceed proximally so that the hemorrhage fromthe sites of implantation does not obscure that por-tion of the wound that has yet to be implanted.No consideration need be given to the direction ofhair growth because orienting the hair in its properdirection is tedious and has little or no effect on thecosmetic outcome. Pinch grafts are small discs of skin, 3 mm or less in diameter, that are implanted into shallow pocketscreated in granulation tissue. 15A disc is harvested by tenting skin to create a cone and then excisingthe cone with a scalpel blade. The disc is thicker inits center than at its periphery; discs 3 mm or less indiameter are entirely split thickness. Pinch graftsshould be harvested from an inconspicuous site,such as the perineum, neck, ventrolateral aspect ofthe abdomen, or ventral aspect of the pectoral regionbecause each site of harvest heals with a small scar.Hair is removed from the donor site, and the site iscleaned and desensitized by injecting local anes-thetic solution subcutaneously. Skin is most easilytented for excision by using a 20-gauge, hypodermicneedle with a bent point, and the tented skin is mosteasily excised with a No. 11 scalpel blade. Thegraft is placed onto the wound and a pocket intowhich the disc is to be implanted is created in thegranulation tissue distal to the graft by inserting aNo. 15 scalpel blade into the granulation tissue at anacute angle to create a shallow pocket. The disc,which adheres precariously to the wound by surfacetension, is guided into the pocket by using the No. 15scalpel blade. The grafts are inserted into thepockets with the graft's epidermis oriented towardthe surface of the wound. No consideration need be given to the direction of the hair in the graftbecause, as with punch grafting, orienting the hairin a direction to match that of the hair surround-ing the wound is tedious and has little or no effecton the cosmetic outcome. Implantation shouldbegin distally. The thin layer of granulation tissue covering each pinch graft usually sloughs within 2 weeks. 15The supercial, pigmented portion of pinch and punchgrafts usually sloughs at approximately this sametime exposing the nonpigmented portion of the graft,which may be difcult to discern from surroundinggranulation tissue, creating the false impressionthat the pinch or punch graft has failed to be ac-cepted. Advancing epithelium, which appears as ared ring surrounding each pinch or punch graft, isobserved by approximately 3 weeks, and these ringsof epithelium expand until they converge to coverthe entire wound. Tunnel grafts are strips of split- or full-thickness skin implanted beneath the surface of granulationtissue. 16-18Tunnel grafts can be harvested using a variety of techniques and can be implanted with thehorse anesthetized or sedated. Common sites forharvesting tunnel grafts include the ventral aspectof the flank, the neck, and the cranial pectoralregion. Tunnel grafts can be harvested by creating linear wheals, several centimeters wide and slightly longerthan the width of the recipient bed, by subcutane-ously injecting isotonic saline solution (if the graftsare harvested with the horse anesthetized) or localanesthetic solution (if the grafts are harvested withthe horse sedated). 16-18A straight intestinal for- ceps is applied to the wheal, and skin protrudingbetween the jaws of the forceps is excised with ascalpel blade. The thickness and width of the graftis determined by the amount of skin protruding be-tween the jaws. If the strip of skin is full thickness, Fig. 1. Subcutaneous fascia must be excised from the dermis ofa punch graft to expose the dermal vasculature subcutane- ous fascia must be to exposethe dermis for plasmatic imbibition and revascular-ization. If the strip of skin is split thickness, thepartial-thickness wound at the donor site is leftunsutured. Full-thickness strips of skin can also be harvested from a 2- to 3-cm wide, full-thickness, elliptical sec-tion of skin excised from the cranial pectoral regionor ventrolateral aspect of the flank. The section ofskin is divided into 2- to 3-mm-wide strips aftersharply revascularization. The donor site closed inone or two layers. Split-thickness tunnel grafts canbe cut from a split-thickness section of skin har-vested from the thorax or the abdomen (see Split-thickness Sheet Grafting below). A tunnel graft is implanted by pushing the shaft of a long, thin alligator forceps through the granula-tion tissue in the wound, perpendicular to the longaxis of the limb, at a depth of 2 to 4 mm until the endof the forceps emerges at the far side of the wound.An end of the graft is grasped by the forceps, and theforceps, with the graft in tow and epidermis orientedtoward the surface of the wound, is pulled backthrough the wound (Fig. 2). The protruding ends ofthe graft are anchored to the skin with a suture,staple, or cyanoacrylate glue. 16-18Grafts are im- planted approximately 2 cm apart. A wound tooconvex to be spanned by the alligator forceps isimplanted in two steps. In this circumstance, theend of the forceps is inserted into the granulatingwound at the wound's margin and exited at thecenter of the wound. One end of the graft isgrasped by the forceps and pulled through the tun-nel. The end of the forceps is then inserted into thegranulation tissue at the margin of the opposite sideof the wound and exited close to or at the site ofentry of the graft in the center of the wound. Theend of the graft is grasped by the forceps and pulledback through the wound. The granulation tissueoverlying the graft is likely to slough within a weekexposing the revascularized graft, provided that thegraft was implanted shallowly (i.e., at /H113492 mm) (Fig. 3). If the graft was implanted deeply (e.g., at 4-5mm), granulation tissue overlying the grafts mustbe excised a week or more after implantation. 16-18 Island grafting requires little expertise and no expensive equipment and can nearly always be per-formed without anesthetizing the horse. Islandgrafts are often accepted by wounds incapable of Fig. 2. To implant a tunnel graft, a thin alligator forceps ispushed supercially through a granulating wound on the dorsalaspect of a hock, and the graft is grasped and pulled through thetunnel created by the forceps.

Because island grafting is tedious, itis usually reserved for small wounds. Island graft-ing should only be used for situations where epithe-lial scarring is irrelevant to the owner. Becauseisland grafts must be implanted in the wound, theycan be applied only to granulating wounds. 4. Full-Thickness Sheet Grafting A full-thickness graft, which is composed of epider-mis and dermis, is usually harvested from the pec-toral region, where the skin is relatively mobile.The graft can be harvested with the horse sedatedafter desensitizing the donor site by depositing localanesthetic solution subcutaneously. The donorskin is incised with a scalpel and then excised fromunderlying subcutaneous tissue using scissors.The donor site is sutured in one or two layers and astent bandage is sutured to the sutured wound.Subcutaneous fascia is sharply excised to expose thedermis. The recipient site must be desensitizedwith local or regional anesthesia when the graft isattached with staples or sutures (Fig. 4). The graftcan be attached to the margin of the wound usingcyanoacrylate glue without using local or regionalanalgesia, but to attach the graft using glue, thegraft must be larger than the wound. The graftshould be attached to the recipient site with slighttension to open the small dermal vessels for plas-matic imbibition and revascularization. 19 Although by granulating wounds, full-thickness grafting isusually reserved for fresh, clean wounds. Full-thickness grafts require more nourishment than dosplit-thickness grafts and bloodvessels for revasculariza-tion. 9,20Full-thickness sheet grafts can be har- vested and applied without using expensiveinstruments and without anesthetizing the horse.Wounds healed with a full-thickness skin graft aremore cosmetic than are wounds healed with anyother type of graft. Full-thickness grafts, however,can be used to cover only small wounds because thelargest graft that can be harvested from the cranialpectoral area, while allowing the donor site to beeasily closed primarily, is an ellipse usually notwider than 8 cm. The owner should be cautionedthat the sutured donor site might dehisce but reas-sured that an open wound in the pectoral regionheals rapidly and cosmetically. 5. Split-Thickness Sheet Grafting A split-thickness sheet graft is composed of epider-mis and a portion of dermis and is harvested bydividing the dermis with a a a free-hand knife.Power-driven dermatomes and drum dermatomesrequire little experience to operate and allow har-vesting of grafts of precise width and thickness.They are, however, expensive, require skilled main-tenance, and may malfunction. Drum dermatomesare seldom used to harvest split-thickness sheetgrafts from horses because the maximum length ofthe graft that can be harvested is limited to thelength of the circumference of the drum. Split-thickness sections of skin large enough to graft extensive wounds of horses can be harvestedeconomically with any one of a variety of free-handdermatomes manufactured for harvesting skin ofhuman beings. A free-hand knife is much less ex-pensive than a power-driven dermatome or a drumdermatome, requires no maintenance, does not mal-function, and can be transported easily. A split-thickness sheet graft can be harvested from theventral aspect of the abdomen, the least conspicuousdonor site, with a free-hand knife, whereas harvest-ing split-thickness skin from this area with mostpower-driven dermatomes is difcult to impossible. The most easily used free-hand knives have an adjustable roller to control the depth of the cut anduse a disposable blade. An example of such a knifeis the Watson skin grafting knife a(Fig. 5). The position of the adjustable roller is controlled by acalibrated knob at one end of the roller. The rolleris locked in position by tightening a knob at theother end. The depth at which the skin is cut isgoverned by the distance between the adjustable Fig. 4.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 5IN-DEPTH: TRAUMA/WOUND MANAGEMENTroller and the blade, the pressure applied to the knife during the harvest, and the angle of incidenceat which the knife is held. 11 The horse must be anesthetized to harvest a split- thickness sheet graft. The donor site of a split-thickness graft should be at an inconspicuouslocation because the donor site heals leaving a largeepithelial scar. The ventral aspect of the abdomenis the least conspicuous donor site, but harvestingfrom this site using a power-driven dermatome isextremely difcult. To harvest a split-thicknessskin graft from the ventral aspect of the abdomen, afree-hand knife is generally required. For this pro-cedure, the horse is positioned in lateral recum-bency, hair is clipped from the ventral aspect of theabdomen, and the ventral aspect of the abdomen isscrubbed with an antiseptic soap. The ventral as-pect of the abdomen should protrude over the edge ofthe table so that the table does not restrict up anddown movement of the knife during harvest. Drap-ing is not necessary. Harvesting usually begins atthe umbilicus and proceeds cranially, and so, if thesurgeon is right handed, the graft is more conve-niently harvested with the horse positioned in rightlateral recumbency. After lubricating the knifeand donor site with isotonic saline solution, theknife is pressed into the abdomen with moderatepressure at an angle of 5 to 10\u00b0, and the graft isharvested by moving the blade up and down andforward (Fig. 5). The surgeon should pause to ex-amine the graft and donor site after harvesting sev-eral centimeters to determine whether the dermis isbeing cut at the desired thickness. The depth of cutcan be changed by repositioning the adjustableroller, by changing pressure applied to the knife, orby changing the angle of incidence at which theknife is held. When a sufcient length of graft hasbeen harvested, the knife is tilted upward to sepa-rate the graft from the abdomen. The graft is xed to the wound's margin with sutures, staples, or cyanoacrylate glue. Applyingthe graft after the horse recovers from anesthesiaremoves the risk of damage to the graft that mightoccur during recovery. The wound's margin mustbe desensitized by using local or regional anesthesiaif the graft is applied with sutures or staples afterthe horse recovers from anesthesia. A graft appliedto a large wound or a wound in a highly mobileregion, such as the dorsum of a fetlock or hock, canbe further secured to the wound with simple-inter-rupted sutures placed through the graft into thewound. These sutures can be inserted with thehorse standing without using local or regional anes-thesia if the tissue underlying the graft is granula-tion tissue because granulation tissue has nosensory innervation. Split-thickness sheet grafts are readily than are full-thickness grafts because split-thickness grafts require less nourishment and havemore vessels in the dermis for plasmatic imbi-bition and revascularization. They can be har-vested in sheets large enough to cover wounds toolarge to be covered by a full-thickness graft or islandgrafts. Although the appearance of a wound healedwith a split-thickness skin graft is superior to that ofa wound healed with island grafts, it is inferior tothat of a wound healed with a full-thickness skingraft. Harvesting a split-thickness graft is moreexpensive and less convenient than harvesting afull-thickness graft or island grafts because to har-vest a split-thickness graft, the horse must be anes-thetized. Piliation at the donor site of a split-thickness skin graft is often poor, and epithelialscarring may be extensive. 6. Meshing Sheet Grafts Although a split- or full-thickness sheet graft can beapplied to a wound as a solid or meshed sheet, mostare meshed before being applied to a horse, usuallyto expand the graft so that the graft is able to covera wound larger than the graft itself (Fig. 6). Mesh-ing a sheet graft also allows escape of exudate orblood interposed between the graft and the woundand enables a topically applied antimicrobial drug tocontact a large portion wound. Because brin llsthe fenestrations, a meshed graft is more stablethan a nonmeshed graft, and because a meshed graftcan expand, it is better able to tolerate motion. 21 A graft can be meshed tediously with a scalpel blade or easily and rapidly with a meshgraft der-matome. A relatively inexpensive meshgraft der-matome is the Padgett mechanical skin mesher, b which consists of staggered, parallel rows of bladeshoused in an aluminum frame (Fig. 7). The graft ispressed into the blades with a rolling pin. Thestaggered pattern in which the graft is cut allowsthe graft to be expanded to three times the graft'soriginal area. Other meshgraft dermatomes are Fig. 5. Harvesting a split-thickness skin graft from the abdomenof a horse in right lateral recumbency using a free-handknife. The adjustable roller's position is controlled by a cali-brated knob at one end of the roller, and the roller is locked withthe knob at the other end. Cranial is to the left. 6 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: TRAUMA/WOUND MANAGEMENTavailable that allow the graft to be expanded from one and one-half to nine times the original area ofthe graft. Full-thickness sheet grafts of horses aredifcult to mesh on commercial meshgraft der-matomes and so usually must be meshed manu-ally. To manually fenestrate a sheet graft, thegraft is attached to a sterile piece of cardboard orStyrofoam with hypodermic needles, and, using ascalpel blade, staggered, parallel rows of incisionsare created in the graft. The longer and morenumerous the incisions, the greater the expan-sion. Applying a meshed and expanded graft ex- poses small portions of the wound within thefenestrations (Fig. 6), and these exposed portionsheal by contraction and epithelialization leaving apattern of diamond-shaped epithelial scars. 7. Aftercare The grafted wound is covered with a sterile, nonad-hering dressing, to which an appropriate antimicro-bial agent has been applied. The dressing issecured to the wound with conforming rolled gauze,and a heavy bandage is applied to the region. Thebandage is usually not changed for 4 to 5 days aftergrafting to avoid disrupting the graft, but if nosoco-mial infection with virulent bacteria is a commonproblem, the bandage should be changed daily.An antimicrobial drug effective both Streptococcus and Pseudomonas such as ticarcillin with clavulanic acid, should be appliedtopically to the dressing when each bandage ischanged. 22The graft can be considered accepted when it has revascularized and this usually occursby approximately day 5. The supercial portion ofthe graft, especially that of a full-thickness graft,sometimes fails to vascularize and becomes desic-cated, making it difcult to determine whether thegraft has been accepted. The desiccated tissueeventually sloughs revealing vascularized dermis(Fig. 8). The exposed dermis may closely resemblegranulation tissue but has a paler color. 8. Storing Split-Thickness Sheet Grafts Skin sterile or lactated Ringer's solution can be storedin a refrigerator for at least week. 9,23By using a culture medium, such as McCoy's 5A medium, towhich a small volume of serum has been added,the viability of the stored graft can be extended toat least 3 weeks. 24The concentration of serum in the medium should be between 10 and 33 per-cent. 25To avoid an antigenic reaction to the se- rum, a commercially available, antibody-freeequine serum or the horse's own serum or shouldbe added. 26Stored skin can be used to regraft the wound if the primary graft is partially or com-pletely lost. A graft harvested when a horse isanesthetized for treatment for a wound can bestored until the wound is healthy enough to per-mit grafting. A wound accepts a stored graftmore readily than it does a fresh graft becausegrafts stored for 24 hours or more undergo anero-bic metabolism, which causes release of metabo- Fig. 6.

Introduction The main concept in wound cleaning is to remove the necrotic tissue and other debris from the wound,while also reducing the bacterial load. The reduc-tion in necrotic debris and bacteria will help thewound to heal more effectively, both functionallyand cosmetically. Consequently, it is important tochoose a technique that does not cause more necrosisand subsequent bacterial growth. Every cleaningagent and technique will cause some trauma to thewound. It is therefore important to weigh the costto benet of the technique prior to starting. Inessence, the benet of a clean wound must beweighed against the trauma that the agent willcause. Cleaning agents will generally cause some type of chemical trauma leading to cellular toxicity. Themost biocompatible cleaning agent should always bechosen to limit the toxicity to the wound bed. Var-ious cleaning agents will be discussed further in thissection. Human chronic wound healing groupshave a saying: you should not put something in awound that you would not be willing to put in youreye. It is a great way to consider limiting thetrauma associated with most of our wound-cleaningagents. I think this is especially true in the eld of veterinary medicine where we are often entrenchedin historical use of cleaning agents and techniques. Cleaning techniques also have the potential to cause trauma to the wound bed. Most techniqueswill cause some type of mechanical trauma to thewound. This is especially true when mechanicalforces such as scrubbing or high-pressure lavage areused. The trauma to the tissue left behind must beconsidered when choosing a cleaning technique. The hope is that the veterinarian will choose wiselywhen selecting wound-cleaning agents and tech-niques so that wounds will quickly andeffectively. 2. Saline (Isotonic and Hypertonic) Isotonic saline has been shown to be as effective as1% povidone-iodine (PI) in reducing infection ratesin the human emergency room. 1Although the iso- tonic nature is gentle to the wound bed and unlikelyto cause necrosis of the surrounding tissue, isotonicsaline is somewhat acidic and it may be better to usea polyionic replacement fluid. Hypertonic saline(20%) is very effective in reducing bacterial numbersin the wound. However, it can be traumatic to nor- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 as well. Hypertonic saline should be used only in wounds that are obviously infected. 3. PI PI has been used extensively in equine wound care.However, the bulk of research shows that PI is verylimited in reducing bacterial numbers in the wound.In one study, isotonic saline reduced bacterial num-bers better than PI, 2whereas in another study there was no difference between PI and isotonic saline inbacterial reduction. 1In a third study, PI was not an effective substitute for wound debridement.3 The general thought is that PI causes necrosis of theunderlying tissue leading to more bacterial infec-tion. Consequently, PI should only be used aroundthe wound over intact skin, and never in the wounditself. 4. Chlorhexidine Chlorhexidine has been used since 1946. It hasshown a lot of promise in reducing the bioburden ofbacteria in intact skin. However, there is limitedevidence showing that it can effectively reduce bac-terial numbers in wounds without causing furthertrauma to the wound bed. In a study evaluatingthe antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine and salinefor irrigating a fracture, therewas no benet to using chlorhexidine. 4Similar to PI, the toxicity to the wound bed most likely leads totissue necrosis. 5. Hydrogen Peroxide Hydrogen peroxide (HP) is popular for its efferves-cent effects. However, HP has not been shown tohave antibacterial effects. 5There may be some limited benet with regard to wound debridementbut probably not enough to warrant the use of HP. 6. Acetic Acid Common distilled vinegar has been shown to bebenecial in reducing pseudomona infections in hu-man patients. It is thought that the low pH of theacetic acid creates an environment that cannot betolerated by select bacteria. 6,7It is generally used as a 0.25 or 0.5% solution with a 15-minute/day soakor compress. The wound should be rinsed with sa-line after therapy with acetic acid. 7. Surfactant-Based Cleansers Surfactant-based cleaners are generally isotonic andare considered minimally toxic and irritating to thewound bed. They generally contain some type ofsurfactant such as polysorbate-20 or pluronic F-68.In 2005 Wilson et al 8showed the surfactant-based cleansers were the least toxic of all wound-cleaningagents studied. The most toxic formulations wereHP, modied Dakin's solution (sodium hypochloriteand boric acid), and PI. The surfactant-basedcleansers are very effective on minimally contami-nated wounds and should be applied, allowed to sitfor 1 to 2 minutes, rinsed off, and reapplied asnecessary. 8. Topical Antibiotic Silver Silver is a very effective antimicrobial agent. It hasbeen used in many forms in veterinary medicine,most commonly as silver sulfadiazine cream (SSD).Newer formulated silver dressings also show greatpromise in reducing bacterial numbers in wounds.In a study comparing the use of SSD and nonadher-ent wound dressings, the SSD group had less exu-berant granulation tissue. 9In a human burn study, the silver-impregnated dressings lead to sig-nicantly reduced length of hospital stay, analgesicuse, wound infection, and inflammation comparedwith SSD. 10 9. Topical Antibiotic Nitrofurazone Nitrofurazone was rst approved for the use in an-imals in 1979 and has been applied to wounds instaggering volumes since that time. Yet, researchfrom as early as 1979 has shown that nitrofurazoneretards the healing rate by as much as 24%. 11 Nitrofurazone should not be used in open wounds. 10. Topical Antibiotic Triple Antibiotic Ointment Triple antibiotic ointment has been used since the1950s. Research has shown the combination ofpolymixin B, bacitracin, and neomycin to have syn-ergistic effects on bacterial reduction in wounds. 12 A very interesting perspective on triple antibioticointment is that the bacterial susceptibility to it hasbasically remained unchanged since its discovery.Along with silver, it is one of the best topical agentsavailable to use in a wound. 13 11. Wound Dressings There are probably as many different wound dress-ings as there are wound cleaning agents. This lec-ture will focus on the agents the presenter has themost experience with. Wound dressings should be chosen based upon the wound's stage of healing. The author is not awareof any single dressing that provides benetsthroughout all stages of the wound healing process.Consequently, the appropriate dressing will varythrough the wound treatment. In general, thestages of wound healing can be divided into thefollowing: debridement, wound moistening, granu-lation tissue development and wound contraction,and epithelialization. The wound should be keptmoist in all of these stages as moist wounds willgenerally heal in half the time as wounds left ex-posed to air; as long as the appropriate dressing ischosen. 12. Debridement Dressings Debridement dressings are designed to and necrotic tissue from the wound. Debride-ment dressings should often be combined with sometype of sharp debridement where the bulk of the 10 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: TRAUMA/WOUND MANAGEMENTnecrotic tissue is removed from to dressing application. Hypertonic Saline Hypertonic saline dressings providean aggressive, nonselective debridement. Theywork by drawing the fluid out of bacteria and dis-eased cells, reducing their attachment to the woundbed, and then lifting them out of the wound whenthe dressings are changed. The author uses themost effective debridement dressings commerciallyavailable a. You can make your own hypertonic sa- line by dissolving 200 g salt in 1 L boiling water.Lower concentrations of hypertonic saline do notseem to be as effective. This debridement dressingshould be discontinued when the wound no longerseems infected. Antimicrobial Dressings One manufacturer's antimicrobial (PHMB). PHMB is an antimicrobialthat disrupts the cell walls of microorganisms. Thereis no developing resistance known to PHMB. Thedressing was originally developed to apply over awound to stop bacterial penetration (it is also used inbaby wipes and contact lens cleaning solutions). It isnow accepted that the dressing will kill bacteria whenplaced into a wound as well. It comes as a dry dress-ing and should be moistened with saline prior to use ina wound. Similar to hypertonic saline, this dressingshould not be used as a primary dressing after thewound has been effectively debrided and the bacterialnumbers have been appropriately reduced. It can,however, be used as a secondary dressing to limitbacterial penetration to the wound bed. Honey Honey has been used to improve wound healing forcenturies. Some types of honey, such as honey de-rived from specic plants like the Manuka bush,seem to have even more antimicrobial effect thanwould be seen with the natural hyperosmolalitypresent in all honey. Not all honey is created equalin this effect, so only honey that is known to haveantimicrobial benets (Manuka honey) should beused in wound care. 14,15 13. Moistening Dressings Although most of the wounds presented to the vet-erinary practitioner are necrotic and infected, somewounds are dry, often from inappropriate woundcare. In these wounds, a gel dressing should beapplied to \"donate\" moisture to the wound and im-prove the wound healing process. Gel dressingscommonly contain water, glycerin, and a polymer.Some gel dressings incorporate a gauze that helpsthem maintain their normal shape. Either theamorphous or the formed dressings can be used toadd moisture to a dry wound. As soon as the woundis moist, another dressing should be used. 14. Granulation Tissue Development and Wound Contraction Dressings Calcium Alginate (Alginate) In the past, exuberant granulation tissue has been the bane of the equine practitioner, and to think thatyou might choose a dressing specically to encour-age granulation tissue would have been frownedupon. However, one of the complications of equinewound healing is the lack of inflammatory responsethat is formed by the horse after wounding. Cal-cium alginate dressings will lead to an effective in-flammatory process that will help wound healingproceed in an effective order. Another valuablebenet of the alginate dressings is that they containa lot of calcium that is \"donated\" to the wound toencourage wound contraction. These dressings canalso be placed directly on exposed bone that hasbeen curetted to minimize bone sequestrum forma-tion. As soon as granulation tissue lls the wound,these should be discontinued. 15. Epithelialization Dressings Semiocclusive foam dressingschelp to nish off the wound healing process. The foam dressings willincrease the surface temperature of the wound by1-2\u00b0F, which will preferentially select for epithelial-ization. They are a relatively closed-cell design sothat the granulation tissue does not grow into thefoam. The added benet of the AMD foam is that itcontains the same PHMB as described above in thedebridement dressings to limit bacterial growth onthe surface of the wound. It is not recommended toadd any other agent to the wound during the epithe-lialization process. In summary, there are many options for wound- cleaning agents and wound dressings that have ei-ther negative effects or unknown effects on thewounds. It is the veterinarian's job to make sure toselect a wound cleaning agent or a dressing that willencourage the most functional and cosmetic end re-sult. If you are not sure what the dressing does,you should make sure to nd out before using it.Many of these materials have quite detrimental ef-fects on the wound.

Introduction Wound infections are common in equine practice, but most respond to routine antibiotic therapy and wound care, so they're not often considered a hot topic fordiscussion. However, wound infections are becomingmore of a challenge as multiple antibiotic resistancebecomes more common among bacterial pathogensin humans and animals. Multidrug-resistant strains are still relatively uncommon in equinepractice, but we have seen a dramatic increase intheir prevalence and diversity in the past 20years, particularly in hospitalized patients (ien-osocomial infections) but also on-farm (i.e., com-munity-acquired infections). It's time wereadjust our expectations and start anticipatingthat at least some wound infections are and will becaused by multidrug-resistant pathogens againstfor which we have few good antibiotic options. In other cases, antibiotic sensitivity is not the issue; rather, tissue perfusion or the patient's im-munocompetence is the limiting factor. We maynot think of these host factors as primary determi-nants in the development and persistence of woundinfection until the patient has failed to respond to antibiotic therapy, by which time the infection has metaphorically run away with the ball. Getting the home-eld advantage with serious wound infections basically means making the bestuse of the local conditions and resources. We knowthis eld and we know the players; we simply mustmake the best use of our knowledge. In particular,we must get into the habit of looking beyond ourcustomary reliance on antibiotics primarily or exclu-sively, and address the wound ecology globally.Targeted antibiotic therapy that is directed by theresults of bacterial culture and antibiotic sensitivitytesting remains a cornerstone of effective manage-ment for serious wound infections. However, otherfactors beyond in vitro antibiotic testing are crucialto a successful outcome in severely traumatized andinfected wounds. 2. Extensive Contamination Some wounds in horses are complicated by extensivecontamination, which results in overwhelming num-bers of bacteria in the wound. Examples include: 61 /H114082015 13IN-DEPTH: with wounds involving the distal limb and with penetratingwounds to the abdomen or perineum that in-volve compromised bowel (including surgicalwounds). Penetrating wounds to the oral cavity, phar-ynx, esophagus, or upper airway\u2014althoughthese sites have a good blood supply, they alsohave an extensive resident microflora that arereadily disseminated by mucus secretions. Environmental contamination\u2014dirt, plant de-bris, or insect activity (fly eggs) may introducelarge numbers of bacteria into any open wound Wound site and contamination source may beimportant in empiric antibiotic selection forinterim therapy while awaiting the results ofculture and sensitivity. However, extensivecontamination is less about the specic sourceand types of bacteria than about the sheernumbers of bacteria invading the tissue andoverwhelming the host's defenses. Thus, tar-geted treatment is aimed at reducing bacterialnumbers in the wound by physically expellingthe contaminated material, without causingfurther damage or deeper infection. Treatment Approach For wounds that remain contaminated with fecalmatter or other material with a large bacterial load,the following dictum is useful: \"The solution to pol-lution is dilution.\" High-volume lavage is indicatedfor these wounds. Many of these wounds also re-quire surgical debridement and establishment ofgood drainage. Lavage Thoroughly irrigate the wound with sterile isotonicfluid until all visible contamination and purulentdischarge have been removed: Use sterile 0.9% saline, Lactated Ringer's, orHartmann's solution. Use copious quantities, as much as necessaryto visibly and thoroughly cleanse the wound. Use moderate delivery pressure, in the rangeof 10-15 pounds per square inch (psi); thisrange can be achieved by forcefully depressingthe 20- or 30-mL syringe throughan attached 18-gauge needle. Direct the fluid into every part of the wound. Repeat lavage as necessary. Avoid using profoundly hypotonic fluids, such as plain water because of the difference in osmolalityand the associated tissue injury; use plain wateronly as a last resort, and only to remove gross con-tamination. Also avoid delivery pressures muchgreater than 15 psi, because high pressures maycause cell damage and/or drive bacteria deeper intothe tissues. Conversely, delivery pressures muchlower than 10 psi are ineffective.Adding an antiseptic such as povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine to the lavage fluid is unnecessary andunlikely to provide additional benet to high-volume, pressurized lavage. Not only is the contacttime too brief, but some antiseptics (egpovidone-iodine) are inactivated by organic matter. Debridement Surgical debridement is another important compo-nent of management for wounds that contain heav-ily contaminated and compromised tissue: Debride all tissue that looks devitalized or ir-reparably damaged (e.g., necrotic skin, fascial tags, frayed tendon or ligament, soft and dis-colored bone). Open the wound as much as necessary to allowthorough lavage and debridement; there is novalue in preserving the healing/healed skinincision if it encompasses infected tissue. Repeat lavage to remove any residual debridedtissue. Repeat debridement as necessary. Maggot debridement therapy may be worth con- sidering as an alternative or adjunct when completesurgical debridement is difcult or impossible with-out causing damage to viable tissue. Maggot ther-apy may be particularly useful in contaminatedwounds with deep or multiple tracts, such as pene-trating injuries to the foot and stulous withers. 1,2 Not only does debridement reduce bacterial num- bers by removing heavily contaminated materialfrom the wound, it also enhances the effectiveness ofwound lavage by removing physical impediments tofluid flow. In addition, debridement aids subse-quent drainage of inflammatory debris and infec-tious material from the wound. Drainage Severely infected wounds tend to be effusive, oftenwith copious accumulation or discharge of purulentmaterial. This bacteria-laden, inflammatory exu-date must have an egress for the immune system toeffectively control the infection and orchestratewound repair. Thus, drainage is a key componentof wound management, not just for wounds involv-ing extensive contamination, but for every infectedwound. Encourage gravity-assisted (\"dependent\") drain- age from the most distal or ventral parts of thewound, taking advantage of the location, orienta-tion, and shape of the wound where possible. Ifnecessary, surgically create a drainage portal in thedistal/ventral portion of the wound. In so doing, avoid opening the wound any more than is necessary to allow thorough lavage, debride-ment, and continued drainage, as it is important toavoid exposing the interior of the wound to furthercontamination. Along the same lines, take carewhen using Penrose drains and setons because these 14 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: TRAUMA/WOUND MANAGEMENTstrategies may suck or wick bacteria into the wound. For deep bone infections, thorough surgical debride-ment under general anesthesia may best be followedby use of an antibiotic-impregnated implant such aspolymethylmethacrylate beads, collagen sponges, orsterile plaster of Paris, and the wound closed pri-marily, leaving only a small opening for furtherdrainage. The exception to the rule is when there is gas accumulation in the deeper tissues. For thesewounds, the larger the egress, the better. Woundsthat act as one-way valves, such as deep wounds tothe axilla or inguinal area, suck and trap air withinthe tissues, sometimes causing spectacular subcuta-neous emphysema that may take several days todissipate. Clostridial often accom- panied by extensive subcutaneous and intramuscu-lar gas accumulation that may extend along fascialplanes. These wounds are best left open, and en-larged if necessary, to prevent air trapping in therst instance and facilitate treatment of the anaer-obic infection in the second. Manual and Movement Therapy Wound drainage may be further encouraged with controlled movement. Specic techniques dependon the nature of the wound, the stage of healing, andthe potential for harm with excessive or inappropri-ate movement. Massage and/or passive range-of-motion exercises may be appropriate for horsesrestricted to a stall. To avoid complications, man-ual therapy is best directed by a physical therapistor veterinary rehabilitation therapist when treatingwound infections (see American Association of Re-habilitation Veterinarians: www.rehabvets.org). Hand-grazing or hand-walking, and even limited turnout in a pen or small pasture, may be appropri-ate for more ambulatory patients. Avoid unat-tended turnout when wound dressings includebandages or leg wraps that may loosen and eitherleave the wound exposed or cause injury duringunrestricted activity. Movement may have additional benets by help- ing to optimize blood flow to, from, and within thewound; limit or prevent restrictive brosis; preventor resolve digestive and musculoskeletal problemsassociated with inactivity; stress, socialisolation, and/or boredom of connement; and other-wise improve the patient's physical and psychologi-cal health and wellbeing. These aspects of nursingcare are particularly important when the nature ofthe wound necessitates stall connement for weeksor months. Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy Drainage may also be achieved with negative-pres- sure wound therapy (NPWT), also known as vacu-um-assisted closure. Subatmospheric pressure ofbetween 75 and 125 mm Hg is applied to the woundusing a small vacuum pump and occlusive dressing.This technique speeds wound closure, evacuates in-flammatory fluid and debris (including bacteria)from the wound, and improves microcirculationwithin the wound bed. 3,4Originally developed for use in human medicine, NPWT is increasingly usedin small-animal medicine for grossly contaminatedor otherwise-complicated wounds. 5-11Develop- ments in dressing design and in pump size andportability make NPWT a viable option for use inhorses as well. 12 Avoiding Transmission Not only do infected wounds in animals carry the potential for human infection (zoonosis), but hu-mans can transmit pathogenic bacteria such asStaphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and entero- bacteria to the animal patient (reverse zoonosis or\"humanosis\"). 13To avoid transmission in either di- rection, communicate well with the nursing staffand encourage the practice of good hygiene: weargloves or wash hands with soap and warm waterbefore and after handling the wound or dressings,and promptly dispose of all dressings and cleaningmaterials in the garbage or a biohazard container. 3. Bacterial Refugia In this context, a refugium is any substance or cir-cumstance that protects bacteria within the woundfrom the host's defenses and from effective concen-trations of antibiotic drugs, thus enabling the infec-tion to persist and potentially to progress. Refugiacommonly associated with wound infections inhorses include: Foreign bodies\u2014most often pieces of metal,wood, or other plant material (thorns, awns,etc.). Surgical implants\u2014metal plates, pins,wire; Mucoid biolms produced by the bacteriathemselves. We are already in the habit of considering the presence of foreign bodies and most of these otheritems in persistent wound infections, but bacterialbiolms have not received as much attention in vet-erinary medicine as they have in human medicine,where they commonly contribute to catheter-relatedinfections and chronic wounds. 14Treatment of wounds complicated by foreign bodies or other inan-imate refugia is fairly straightforward, requiringsurgical removal, debridement, and/or drainage.However, bacterial biolms require a somewhat dif-ferent approach. Bacterial Biolms Bacterial biolms are not a new phenomenon, buttheir importance 15IN-DEPTH: TRAUMA/WOUND MANAGEMENTtance\u2014of infections has only lately come to light. Bacterial biolms are gel-like substancescomposed of an extracellular matrix of polysaccha-rides, proteins, glycolipids, bacterial DNA, water,the bacteria that secreted the matrix, and oftenother microbes that are taking advantage of theprotected environment. 14,15 Although most biolms in wounds are micro- scopic, a well-established biolm may be visible tothe naked eye as a shiny coating or sheen on thesurface of the affected tissue or implant, and it mayfeel slippery or slimy. 15Some bacteria in biolm mode produce (e.g., Pseudomonas aerugi- nosa produces a greenish pigment).15Discolor- ation of the wound surface or dressing is not areliable indicator of a specic pathogen, nor of thepresence of a biolm and does not replace a properlysampled and handled culture. Unlike serous exu-date, purulent discharge, and sloughed cells, a bac-terial biolm is not easily washed away. The following dynamics are described 15for bacte- rial biolms under experimental conditions that aresimilar to those found with naturally occurringwounds: Within minutes, bacteria attach to an avail-able surface. Within 2-4 hours, strongly attached micro-colonies have formed. Within 6-12 hours, an initial biolm hasformed, which becomes increasingly well orga-nized and tolerant of antiseptics and antibiotics. Within 2-4 days, the biolm is mature; it isnow highly resistant to adverse host and envi-ronmental influences, including antisepticsand antibiotics, and it sheds bacteria singlyand as microcolonies within fragments of bio-lm that can colonize other areas. Within 24 hours of mechanical disruption, themature biolm has reformed. The biolm provides a secure attachment for the bacteria and a moist, stable, and nutrient-rich envi-ronment that protects against desiccation, deluge,and other adverse physical conditions. 14,15It also protects the bacteria from the host's defenses andfrom potentially lethal concentrations of antibioticdrugs. 15,16 Depending on the antibiotic, diffusion through the matrix may be impeded and/or the drug may beinactivated by chemical constituents of the matrix.In the presence of a mature biolm, the minimuminhibitory concentration of an antibiotic or antisep-tic to which the wound pathogens are susceptiblein vitro may be increased by as little as 2-fold and asmuch as 200-fold. 15-19Furthermore, bacteria within biolms alter their metabolism and gene ex-pression in ways that promote survival, includingthe formation of subpopulations that are metaboli-cally inactive (quiescent), and thus relatively invul-nerable to antibiotics at any concentration. 15,16,20Even more problematic is the sharing of antibiotic resistance among bacteria within the biolm. In apolymicrobial biolm, antibiotic-binding or -degrad-ing substances secreted by bacteria that are resis-tant to a particular drug may also protect bacteriawithin the biolm that are susceptible to that drug.In addition, there is potential for antibiotic-resis-tance genes to be transferred from one bacterialspecies to another within the protected environmentof the biolm. 15,16 Polymicrobial biolms are documented to occur in equine wounds of various types (traumatic, surgical,acute, chronic). 21,22Under experimental condi- tions, many different bacteria isolated from woundsor normal skin in horses are capable of producingbiolms. 20,22However, the conditions under which clinically relevant biolms form in equine woundsrequire further study. In humans, problematic bio-lms are most common in wounds with poor perfu-sion, in malnourished patients, and in those withcomorbidities that impair immune function (e.g., indiabetic ulcers and severe burns). 14-16 This aspect of wound care is paramount when deal- ing with a biolm-infected wound; even thoughmany different wound pathogens are capable of pro-ducing a clinically relevant biolm, most do not be-cause tissue perfusion and bactericidal host defensesare adequate to prevent its establishment. Treatment Approach Bacterial biolms present a particular therapeuticchallenge. Not only do they protect the enclosedbacteria from host defenses and from antibiotics, butthey are highly resistant to chemical damage. Amature biolm is relatively impervious to commonantiseptics, alcohols, acids, bleach, hydrogen perox-ide, and other generators of oxygen radicals (e.g.,ozone) unless concentrations are used that are toxicto the host cells. 16,17 Plaque on dental enamel is a good example, and a handy reminder, of how quickly bacterial biolmscan form in a suitable environment and what isrequired to remove them. The biolm must bephysically degraded to expose the bacteria within toantibacterial substances, which then slow the re-formation of the biolm. Mouthwashes are of lim-ited and short-term benet if not preceded bythorough tooth brushing and flossing. Another es-sential element is frequent removal (i.e., regular tooth brushing). Biolm-infected wounds require the same three- step approach 15-17,23 1. Physically Degrade the Biolm Vigorously debride the wound to remove purulent discharge, necrotic tissue, and any discernible bio-lm, even if it causes minor bleeding; in fact, freshblood contains antibacterial components that facili-tate Step 2. The goal is to remove as much of thebiolm and associated bacteria as possible and ex-pose the remaining bacteria to biocides (Step 2). 16 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: TRAUMA/WOUND MANAGEMENTDepending on the wound, options include the following: Drag a gauze swab (i.e., mildly abrasive mate- rial) across the surface. Use pulsed lavage (e.g., waterpik) at moderate pressure to dislodge and flush away the biolm (this option is better than swabbing for veryuneven surfaces). Use low-frequency ultrasonic debridement. Draw the sharp or blunt edge of a scalpel bladeacross the surface. Sharp debridement and low-frequency ultrasonic debridement are most studied 15-17,23Surfactants as polyhexamethylene biguanide (polyhexanide [PHMB]) may be useful ad-juncts because they reduce the surface tension of thebiolm, which facilitates its degradation andremoval. 15 AXIOM I Wear gloves to protect against zoonotic and reverse- zoonotic infections; and when using a waterpik, alsowear a surgical mask and protective eyewear, par-ticularly if the wound infection is known or sus-pected to involve methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or other multidrug-resistant bacteria. This step may be uncomfortable for the patient, so use sedation and local or regional anesthesia. Fordeep or extensive wounds, and for very uncoopera-tive patients, general anesthesia may be needed forthe rst debridement and periodically thereafter un-til the wound infection is under control. 2. Prevent or Delay Reconstitution of the Biolm Once the protective matrix has been removed or signicantly degraded, most of the bacteria withinthe biolm resume the antibacterial sensitivitiesthey would have outside of a biolm. 15-17If cur- rent culture and sensitivity results are most appropriate antibiotic(s) both topicallyand systemically. 16The efcacy of regional antibi- is likely to be greatest immediatelyafter debridement of the biolm. If sensitivity results are still pending, apply a topical option.16,25The biolm bacteria are susceptible to a wide variety of imme-diately after debridement, including ionic silver so-lutions 16,26and ozone,27but the best choices may be those that have a residual effect by virtue of theiradherent properties (gels, creams, honey). Antibi-otic-containing dressings, re-formation, but their de-creases after the rst 24 hours, 29so these dressings must be changed frequently. An added advantageto topical silver and other antibacterial agents isthat they increase the susceptibility of biolm bac-teria to antibiotic drugs. 16,29 Plasma (natural or hyperimmune) may also be useful by inhibiting bacterial adhesion and replica-tion. 31-33Platelet-rich plasma products may aid in wound healing, but the plasma component seems tohave the principal bacteriostatic effect, 33so it may not be necessary to take the extra steps of concen-trating the platelet portion of the plasma for thispurpose. Whether antigen-specic equine hyper-immune plasma (see Section 4. Immunocompro-mise, below) is superior to plain plasma for biolminhibition remains to be determined, but it is plau-sible that antigen-specic hyperimmune plasmawould be of greater benet when the specic patho-gen has been cultured from the wound. Other antibiolm agents under investigation in- clude lactoferrin, xylitol, ethylenediaminetetra-ace-tic acid UV light, and low-voltagepulsed electric elds. 16,34,35 Regardless of which methods are selected, the aim is to target the biolm bacteria both fromabove (topically) and below (systemically and/orregionally). 15-17 3. Repeat Frequently for as Long as Needed Mature biolms can reform in as little as 24 hours after debridement, so there is a narrow window ofopportunity (/H11349 72 h) in which any bactericidal substances will have a signicant effect on thebiolm population. 15-17,23Repeat steps 1 and 2 daily or every other day until the infection is wellunder control, as evidenced by a reduction in thesigns of infection and the resumption of woundhealing. Most biolms are microscopic, and bac-terial culture of biolm-protected inhabitants maybe unrewarding or incomplete, 15,21,22so until a practical, stall-side biolm identication test isavailable, clinical signs are the best guide. Also,reassess frequently and add or change to a differ-ent method of debridement (Step 1) or inhibition(Step 2) as needed. Each step is equally important. Physically de- grading the overlying biolm restores the suscepti-bility antibacterial agents;however, with a well-established biolm in a se-verely infected wound, one round of treatment is notsufcient. Hence, the need for daily treatment, ortreatment at least every other day, using a combi-nation approach until the infection is resolved orwell on the way. 15-17,23 Admittedly, this intensity of treatment would dis- rupt the wound bed and interfere with wound repairin an uncomplicated wound. However, biolm-in-fected wounds are not simple or straightforwardwounds, and many are chronic. 14Wound repair cannot proceed normally in the presence of a AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 17IN-DEPTH: TRAUMA/WOUND the priority is to address the biolm and thereby resolve the infection. Thereafter, theintensity and invasiveness of treatment can be re-duced, and tailored to the rate and quality of woundrepair. The higher initial costs of this approach are coun- terbalanced by lower overall costs. In humanpatients with chronic, biolm-infected wounds, fre- quent debridement as a component of a multifacetedapproach shortens the duration of treatment and de-creases the overall costs of wound care. 17 Biolms on Surgical Implants Biolms on unstable surgical implants are best ad- dressed by implant removal. Biolms on stablesurgical implants are more of a challenge becausethere may be no other indication for implant re-moval, and good reason to leave the implant in placeif it is still performing the function for which it wasinserted (e.g., a bone plate stabilizing a fracture). In such cases, it may be best to surgically expose theimplant (or infected portion) and perform Steps 1and 2 under general anesthesia in a sterile surgicalsuite, then pack the wound with an antibiotic-im-pregnated material (polymethylmethacrylate beads,collagen sponges, or plaster of Paris) 36in place of Step 3. AXIOM II Biolms in wounds are most likely to form and per- sist in the presence of immunocompromise and/orpoor perfusion, so these conditions must also beidentied and addressed for effective treatment. 4. Immunocompromise We often overlook the fact that antibiotic therapyalone is inadequate in the face of an incompetentimmune system. Antibiotics are only ever adjunc-tive therapy, albeit a very important component ofthe management for serious wound infections.The patient's immunocompetence is of primary im-portance in the prevention and treatment of woundinfections. A number of conditions or circumstances may compromise the patient's ability to prevent or re-solve bacterial infection, including: Age\u2014especially neonatal foals (/H11021 2 very old of passive trans-fer of maternal antibodies (neonatal macronutrients trace mineral, essential fatty acid, oramino acid deciencies). Chronic physical or psychological stress\u2014in-tense athletic training, long-distance trans-port, competitive events, social isolation, sustained hypothermia (i.e., cold stress), hos-pitalization, etc. Diseases concurrentsystemic infection or debilitating systemicdisease. Hyperglycemia a risk factor for wound infec- tions and biolm formation in human patients, 16but there is little evidence that wound infections aremore likely or more problematic in horses with hy-perglycemia unrelated to PPID, possibly because hy-perglycemia is an inconsistent feature of equinemetabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus is rela-tively rare in horses. Treatment Approach In most cases, patients with serious wound infec-tions have already undergone initial systemic as-sessment and treatment. Even so, it is wise toreview or further investigate the patient's signal-ment, history\u2014including recent medications, physi-cal examination ndings, and blood work\u2014andrepeat the physical examination and/or blood workas needed. If possible, treat any condition identied that may be compromising immune function. For example, aseverely infected wound in an older horse with PPIDis unlikely to respond well to wound treatment untilthe PPID is controlled with pergolide. When no specic treatment is available, and even as adjunctive therapy to complement specictreatment, consider administering supplementalplasma. 31,32Fresh plasma from a compatible do- nor living on the same premises (and thus exposedto the same pathogens) is suitable. Antigen-spe-cic hyperimmune plasma may be of particularvalue when the wound pathogen is known. Com-mercial hyperimmune plasma bis available in the United States for Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Streptococcus equi, Rhodococcus be applied topically and/or administered intravenously. Also take care to avoid corticosteroids are highly effective anti-inflammatory therapies, they also in-crease the risk for infection. If corticosteroids areconsidered necessary, such as for initial treatment ofsystemic inflammatory response syndrome, then usea short-acting drug (e.g., dexamethasone) and a short course of treatment (/H11349 48 h). 18 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: TRAUMA/WOUND MANAGEMENTGeneral Supportive Care Good nursing care and nutritional management are also important, particularly when specic treatmentfor the immunocompromising state is not possible: Maintain clean, dry bedding in a well-venti-lated stall that is large enough for the horse tolie down and rise without risk of injury. Provide compatible company to prevent thestress of social isolation; even if the infectiondictates that the horse be physically isolatedfrom others, isolation stalls or barns shouldnot cause social stress or sensory deprivation. Keep the area quiet and dark at night to en-courage rest. Feed a well-formulated diet that provides ad-equate protein, calories, and micronutrients,yet is low in simple carbohydrates (starch andsugars) 38; base the diet on high-quality for- ages, and when extra calories are needed, usesupplemental fat (e.g., vegetable oils, rice bran). 5. Poor Perfusion An effective immune response to bacterial invasionrelies not just on local tissue resources but also onthe delivery of leukocytes and molecules (comple-ment, antibodies, oxygen, nutrients, etc.) to the siteof infection via the systemic circulation. Thus, anycircumstance that limits optimal blood flow to, or at,the site of infection inevitably limits the host's im-mune response, as well as its wound repair capabil-ities, which renders the wound vulnerable to re-infection. Examples include the following: Sustained hypovolemia trauma, particularly crush-ing, strangulating injuries that re-sult in local ischemia. Fibrosis at or proximal to the site of injury. Location of a foreign body, surgical implant, ordevitalized tissue that impedes blood flow. Pressure from an improperly applied ban- dage or cast, or from postural necessity (e.g.,recumbency). Severe local or regional edema (inflammatoryor dependent). Edema is so common with infected wounds that it is easily overlooked as a potentially problematic fac-tor, other than its adverse effect on patient comfortand client perception of treatment efcacy. How-ever, severe edema, whether inflammatory ormerely dependent, may adversely affect blood flowat the site of infection by creating local interstitialpressures that exceed the perfusion pressure of thesmall vessels and capillaries, thereby decreasing tis-sue perfusion within the wound bed and interfering with wound healing. 39 Treatment Approach Blood flow is tightly regulated, so there is a limit tohow much blood flow can be increased in any tissue.Nevertheless, serious wound infections that arecomplicated by poor perfusion are difcult to man-age unless any impediments to optimal and addressed: Ensure good hydration, provide specic treat-ment for systemic disorders as needed. Remove any impediments to blood flow withinthe wound; in particular, debride traumatizedtissue that has been ischemic for longer than afew hours and is becoming, or already,necrotic. Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs toaddress any inflam-matory edema, but avoid corticosteroids andcryotherapy if possible, as they are alsoimmunosuppressive. Control dependent edema using manual andmovement therapy (see Section 2. ExtensiveContamination: Drainage, above) and com- pression bandages where appropriate; applythe bandage from distal to proximal, and takecare to avoid excessive or focal pressure. Consider using NPWT if available (see Section 2. Extensive Contamination: Drainage, above). Oxygen Therapy When blood flow cannot be improved further, one ofthe oxygen therapies may be useful. Hyperbaricoxygen therapy increases the oxygen tension in thetissues, which facilitates all aerobic processes (bothdefensive and reparative) and is potentially lethal to obligate anaerobes. 40,41It may also stimulate the release of stem cells from the bone marrow into theperipheral blood. 42 Ozone therapy and 1% hydrogen peroxide cream are other options. Ozone and hydrogen peroxideare oxygen donors, but their primary value in woundcare may be as biocides, 24,27,43-46as they increase the concentration of oxygen-derived free radicalswithin the wound, which supplements the bacteri-cidal oxidative burst by neutrophils. Medical ozonemay 0.9% solution); be delivered in gaseous form (ozonized air ormedical-grade oxygen), in solution (dissolved in wa-ter or isotonic saline), or as ozone-infused oil (e.g. , vegetable oil). 27,44,45 AXIOM III Oxygen radicals also cause oxidative damage to the patient's cell membranes, so overuse of these thera-pies may be 45 PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 19IN-DEPTH: TRAUMA/WOUND MANAGEMENT6. Antibiotic Insensitivity Lastly, some aspects of antibiotic therapy that may limit treatment effectiveness are worth reviewing.Antibiotic treatment may fail to resolve the infectionfor one or more of the following reasons: Inherent antibiotic resistance\u2014i.e., inappro- priate drug choice for the pathogen(s) involved. Acquired antibiotic resistance\u2014e.g., methicil- lin resistance in S. aureus; unlike inherent resistance, acquired resistance isunpredictable. Inappropriate drug dosage, route, or durationof treatment\u2014each may result in subthera-peutic antibiotic concentrations at the site ofinfection, even when the pathogen is suscepti-ble to the drug. Poor perfusion\u2014it, too, may result in sub-therapeutic antibiotic concentrations at thesite of infection, even with an appropriate drugchoice and dosage. Protection from inhibitory or lethal antibioticconcentrations by refugia, particularly puru-lent material, necrotic tissue, and bacterialbiolms. The last two points are covered in earlier sections. Following are some recommendations for optimalantibiotic selection and delivery. Treatment Approach Effective antibiotic therapy involves these three el-ements: 1. Identify the principal wound pathogens.2. Determine or conrm their antibiotic sensitivities. 3. Achieve effective concentrations of the antibi- otic(s) at the site of infection. It is essential to perform bacterial culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing with serious wound in-fections, and repeat it if the wound has not re-sponded to therapy as expected. Time spent onproviding empiric antibiotic therapy is time wastedif culture and sensitivity testing is not already un-derway. It is crucial to determine antibiotic sensi-tivity\u2014and resistance\u2014for the particular woundpathogen(s) as soon as possible. Conventional culture techniques are now known to identify only some of the bacterial genera andspecies that may be found in wounds, particularly inwounds containing biolms. 21,22Even when con- certed efforts are made to sample the biolm, bacte-ria in biolm mode, especially the metabolicallyinactive subpopulation, can be difcult to grow inculture. For this reason, rapid molecular methodsof bacterial identication are increasingly beingused to guide antibiotic therapy in human patientswith chronic wounds. 15,16But although molecular identication methods are becoming more widely available in commercialmicrobiology laboratories, we are still left with thecurrent culture-based methods of determining anti-biotic sensitivities in each case. Thus, routine bac-terial culture and antibiotic sensitivity testingremains an essential component of management forserious wound infections. Ensuring Reliable Culture Results In addition to aseptic sample collection and promptsubmission in appropriate transport media, it is im-portant to sample the surfaces and materials wherethe wound pathogens are most likely to reside, fac-toring in the various types of refugia that may com-plicate infected wounds in horses. Be sure tocollect samples from the deepest recesses of thewound, and sample multiple sites if the wound hasmultiple pockets, ssures, or layers. If a biolm issuspected, draw the swab across the surface withenough pressure to collect a sample of the biolm,but not enough pressure to cause bleeding given thatblood contains antibacterial elements. Supercialculture of a wound with a biolm is likely to yield anincomplete and potentially misleading sample. Whenever possible, include tissue samples from the wound (e.g., debride and submit some of the debrided material). 22Wound exudate is easier and less invasive to collect, but tissue samples from thesite of infection are more likely to yield reliableresults. For wounds involving or suspected to in-volve a synovial structure (joint, tendon sheath, orbursa), aseptically collect a sample of synovial fluidusing percutaneous aspiration at a site distant fromthe wound. Use the same techniques and precau-tions required when tapping a joint for other diag-nostic or therapeutic purposes. Also submit any other material removed from the wound, such as a foreign body, surgical implant, orsequestrum. In fact, submit all representativesamples. It is false economy to submit only onesample when several different types of material(e.g., exudate, implant, tissue, biolm) have been collected. Conrming that the bacteria culturedfrom a foreign body or infected implant are the sameas those cultured from the wound tissues is valu-able; nding that different bacteria were culturedfrom the object is more valuable still, particularly ifthe wound is complicated by a biolm. Concurrent Antibiotic Use Collect all samples before starting or changing an- tibiotic therapy. If the horse is already receivingantibiotics, either suspend therapy or aim to collectthe culture samples immediately before the nextscheduled dose. Ideally, suspend therapy for a pe-riod that is at least 8 hours longer than the dosinginterval; for example, for antibiotics administeredevery 12 hours, suspend therapy for at least 20hours before collecting samples for culture. Thisextended interval allows the residual bacteria to 20 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: TRAUMA/WOUND MANAGEMENTre-enter a log phase of active growth, making posi- tive culture more likely. However, when time is ofthe essence, proceed with the culture immediately,and notify the laboratory staff of the horse's antibi-otic regimen and timing of the most recent dose inrelation to sample collection. The goal is not simply to identify the pathogens that may be insensitive to the current antibioticregimen, but to form as complete a picture as possi-ble of the microbial ecology of the wound to formu-late an antibiotic treatment plan that addresseseach pathogen and its sensitivities. Interim Antibiotic Selection With serious wound infections, interim systemictherapy with an experience-guided (empiric) antibi-otic selection can be critical to a successful outcomewhile awaiting culture and sensitivity results. Ta-ble 1 lists the common bacteria isolated from varioustypes of wounds in horses 47-55as a basis for empiric antibiotic choices that are most likely to be useful. Unless a specic pathogen with a well-established sensitivity pattern is strongly suspected (e.g., peni- cillin for clostridial myonecrosis), broad-spectrumantibiotic therapy generally is the best approach forinterim therapy with serious wound infections.A combination of penicillin G (crystalline or procainepenicillin) and gentamicin is widely used in horses,but for some pathogens penicillin G is best replacedwith a synthetic penicillin (e.g., ampicillin) or a cephalosporin (e.g., ceftiofur, cefazolin, cephalo- thin), and amikacin is sometimes a better choicethan gentamicin. It is also wise to collect a separate swab or tissue sample from the wound and perform a Gram stainin-house. This simple procedure provides immedi-ate information that can be very useful in directinginterim antibiotic therapy. Table 2 lists some keycytologic features of common equine wound patho-gens, and Table 3 lists likely antibiotic sensitivitiesfor each pathogen based on published studies ofvarious equine populations in North America, Eu-rope, Australia, and New Zealand during the past 20years. 50,53-67 AXIOM IV Antibiotic sensitivity patterns are quite variable and are always evolving. Sensitivity patterns varyamong geographic regions and are heavily influ-enced by the extent of antibiotic use in the particularpopulation of animals and their human caretakers.Pathogens isolated from hospitalized horses or thoseon farms where antibiotics are frequently used aremore likely to show antibiotic resistance than arepathogens isolated from horses at premises on whichantibiotic use is less common. Thus, these pub-lished antibiotic sensitivity patterns should be usedas a general guide only, to aid in making rationalchoices for interim therapy, and never as a substi-tute for patient-specic, current bacterial cultureand antibiotic sensitivity results.Options for Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria At the present time, two antibiotic drugs remain in the arsenal for multidrug-resistant bacteria: van-comycin and imipenem. Note, however, that bacte-rial resistance is now documented for both drugs, sothey are by no means \"silver bullets,\" and they willnot remain viable options in veterinary or humanmedicine if they are used indiscriminately. Theiruse should therefore be reserved for situations in which culture and sensitivity results clearly indicatesensitivity to the particular drug and absence ofreasonable alternatives. Vancomycin Vancomycin is active against many Gram-positive bacteria, both aerobes and anaerobes, includingMRSA and Clostridium difcile. Vancomycin, ei- ther alone or in combination with an aminoglyco-side, is therefore an option for serious infectionscaused by Staphylococcus sp. or Enterococcus sp. that are resistant to all other available options. The recommended systemic dosage in horses is 7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours, administered in saline by slowIV infusion over 30 minutes. 58For infections conned to the distal limb, vancomycin may be ad- ministered by regional perfusion, either IV or in- traosseous delivery. A vancomycin dosage of 300mg in 60-mL sterile isotonic saline seems well toler-ated and achieves therapeutic in fluid and medullary sinusoidal plasma ofthe perfused area. 68-70These regional modes of delivery help optimize the treatment of vancomycin-susceptible infections in the distal limb while mini-mizing the cost of treatment, potential for toxicity,and development of bacterial resistance. Imipenem Imipenem-cilastatin is active against a wide range of organisms,both (E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Salmonella sp., etc.), and most strains of P. aerugi- nosa and Bacteroides fragilis. However, it is not effective against MRSA, and resistance is docu-mented for some Enterococcus sp. A recommended dosage in horses is 10-20 mg/kg by slow IV infusion every 6 to 8 hours. 71Intrasy- novial administration is described in case studies,the dose ranging from 10 to 250 mg. 72Imipenem may also be administered by IV regional perfusion.A dose of 500 mg imipenem in 100-mL sterile delivered into saphenous vein,sustained imipenem concentrations in the metacarpo/tarsophalangeal joint well above the minimum inhib-itory concentration of most susceptible pathogens forapproximately 6 hours. 73Smaller perfusion volumes are also described for IV regional perfusion,72but the safety of higher imipenem concentrations (solutions /H11022 5 mg/mL) have not azithro-mycin, etc.), and chloramphenicol. In general, severe wound infections are best treated with bac- tericidal drugs (penicillins, cephalosporins,aminoglycosides, quinolones [in adult horses],Table 1.

For all serious wound infections, rational antibiotic therapy must be guided by current culture and sensitivity results. Note: Enrofloxacin and other quinolones are not recommended for use 22 2015 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: TRAUMA/WOUND MANAGEMENTmetronidazole, rifampin) rather than drugs. However, these distinctions are somewhat arti- cial and do not always reflect the drug's antibacte-rial activity in the patient. When laboratoryresults indicate sensitivity to a bacteriostat and re-sistance to most or all of the available bactericidaldrugs, use of the bacteriostat should at least beconsidered. In combination with the physical mea-sures discussed in this paper that render the woundenvironment less hospitable to bacteria, inhibitionof bacterial replication may be enough to tip thescales in favor of the host and thus resolution of theinfection, particularly when systemic administra-tion is accompanied by local and/or regional antibi-otic delivery. These decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis. If persistence or progression of the woundinfection would have life-threatening or career-end-ing consequences, then an appropriate bactericidaldrug should be used, even if it is one of the reserveddrugs (vancomycin or imipenem). Local and Regional Antibiotic Delivery In most cases of serious wound infection, systemic parenteral antibiotic therapy is indicated, at least ini-tially, particularly if there is evidence of a systemicinflammatory response (fever, malaise, inappetance,neutrophilia/neutropenia, hyperglobulinemia, ele- vated plasma brinogen or other acute phase proteins). However, for sequestered infections,wounds involving surgical implants that must re-main in place, infections involving poorly perfusedtissue (whether anatomical or pathological), andbiolm-infected wounds, local and/or regional de-livery of the antibiotic(s) may also be needed, andmay in fact be pivotal to a successful outcome.In some cases, these more targeted modes of anti-biotic delivery may obviate the need for ongoingsystemic antibiotic therapy. Local and regional routes of antibiotic delivery include topical application, intrathecal infusion (for wounds involving a synovial structure), 72,74regional IV or intraosseous 36,75-85and antibiotic-im- pregnated implants.36,86-92These alternate modes of drug delivery are well covered elsewhere.36,75,86 Suitable antibiotics, recommended dosages, andsome clinical notes are summarized in Table 4.

Table 5 summarizes some general guide-lines for duration of antibiotic therapy with differenttypes of wounds. Monitoring Response to Therapy It is important to monitor the horse frequently (at least once a day initially) until the infection is re-solved; a positive response should be seen within afew days. Continue antibiotic therapy until signsof infection have resolved completely and woundhealing is proceeding as expected. If there is no improvement within 3 or 4 days of starting or changing treatment, review the case; checkthat antibiotics are being administered as directed,repeat the physical examination and routine bloodwork, and further explore and debride the wound asneeded. Repeat bacterial culture and antibiotic sensitiv- ity testing if, at any point, recovery is not proceed-ing as expected. A single sampling may notbe enough, particularly in wounds with polymicro-bial infections involving multidrug-resistant or-ganisms. Re-culture the wound:If there is a poor response to treatment. If signs of infection recur during therapy or after therapy has concluded. During prolonged antibiotic therapy (weeks ormonths). Within a week of discontinuing antibiotictherapy for polymicrobial infections or infec-tions involving multidrug-resistant organ-isms. At every turn, adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Also watch for signs of laminitis with injury or infection that causes a nonweight-bearing lamenessin one limb or when infection is accompanied bymarked systemic inflammation. And Then . . . Once the infection is resolved, methods for enhanc-ing wound healing can be considered. Dependingon availability and on the nature and location of thewound, they include delayed closure with suturematerial, negative-pressure wound therapy, topicalapplication of growth factors or extracellular matrixmaterial, and skin grafting. 93Table 5. Guidelines for Duration of Antibiotic Therapy in Specic Types of Wounds Tissue Involved Guidelines for Antibiotic Therapy Wounds (general) Staphylococcal infections tend to be insidious in onset and incite a chronic inflammatory response, so therapy is typically required for weeks; base discontinuation of therapy on the health ofaffected tissues and negative culture. Streptococcal infections typically are more antibiotic sensitive, so treatment generally is shorter (10-14 d).

Introduction Anecdotal reports exist of neonates with transient hy- perlipidemia; however, little research is available tosubstantiate this and evaluate effects of age on serialserum triglyceride concentrations. The hypotheses ofthis study were: 1) healthy foals 1-2 days measurement oftriglycerides would demonstrate wide variability. 2. Materials and Methods This was a prospective study in which serial serumsamples were obtained from seven foals and marespost-parturition at 1-2 days of age and were foals immedi-ately postpartum were not different than those inmares (median 28 and 20 mg/dL, respectively). Foals1-2 and 10-12 days of age had higher serum triglyc-erides compared with the immediate postpartum pe-riod and their dams (P /H11021.001). Foals 1-2 agehad higher concentrations (me-dian, 89 and 60 mg/dL, respectively; P/H11021.001). High- est concentrations occurred at 1-2 days of age. 4. Discussion Foals can be hyperlipidemic relative to adult horsesand have triglyceride variability within the neonatalperiod. A milk diet may contribute to hyperlipidemiagiven that neonatal triglyceride concentrations weresimilar to their dams just after parturition and in-creased progressively as foals nursed.

Correcting LACAreafor the known age-dependent decrease in normal L-lactate over the rst week of age should further improve discrimination between surviving and nonsurviving critically ill foals.

Abnormally increased L-lac- tate concentration ([LAC]) is recognized as a fairlyreliable biomarker of disease severity and outcome ingeneral populations of critically ill foals, correctly clas-sifying survival to hospital discharge in approximately75% 1-5Increased [LAC] at admis- sion ) captures the severity or degree of initial hyperlactatemia, whereas the change in [LAC] with time ([LAC]/H9004 ) captures the duration or persis- tence of initial hyperlactatemia in the face of treat-ment. Both, when abnormal, are associated withdecreased survival to hospital discharge in ill neonatalfoals. 1-5Whereas initial hyperlactatemia, deter- mined from [LAC]Admit , commonly results from poor oxygen delivery to tissues, persistent hyperlactatemia,indicated by minimal [LAC]/H9004 when [LAC]Admit is in- creased, has been associated with dysmetabolism and poor oxygen utilization by tissues in the face of ade-quate oxygen delivery. 1,2 This report expands the investigation of the area under the 24-hour [LAC] versus time curve (LACArea), a unique measure of [LAC] exposure that encompassesboth the severity and duration of hyperlactatemia bycorrecting LAC Area for known age-specic differ- ences.6,7To our knowledge, there are no studies that have evaluated the relationship between age-correctedLAC Areaand outcome in ill neonatal foals. We hypothesized that age-corrected LACArea would improve discrimination between foals that survive to hospital discharge and those that do not. In addition, we wanted to compare the performanceof the area under the [LAC] versus time curve using AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 31NEONATOLOGY NOTESonly the values obtained at admission and after 24 hours of hospitalization (2 time points) with valuesobtained at 6-hour intervals over the initial 24 hours(5 time points), both with and without age correc-tion. We hypothesized that the approach usingonly admission and 24-hour [LAC] would consis-tently overestimate the actual L-lactate exposure and fail to discriminate between foals that survivedto hospital discharge and those that did not. 2. Materials and Methods Animals Neonatal foals aged less than 30 days that presented to 1 of 4 university or private referral hospitals in2014 for the treatment of conditions that requireintensive or critical care were studied after havingreceived client-informed consent. The study proto-col was approved by the Institutional Animal Careand Use Committee. Sampling Protocol Details of the sampling protocol have been previ-ously published. 7Briefly, whole blood (0.5-1 mL) was obtained by either direct venipuncture of a jug-ular vein using a preheparinized syringe or pre-placed sterile intravenous catheter upon admission.Additional samples were similarly obtained at 6, 12,18, and 24 hours after the initial sample. L-Lactate Measurement, Calculation of LACArea, and Determination of Outcome toHospital Discharge [LAC] was determined using the [LAC]-measuring techniques currently in use at each participatinglocation. LAC Areawas determined using samples obtained during the rst 24 hours of hospitaliza-tion in 2 ways: rst by using only the admissionand 24-hour values and second by summing indi-vidual areas calculated at 6-hour intervals by thetrapezoidal method for numerical integration. 8 The 24-hour LACArea calculated by summation was then age-corrected using 24-hour LACAreaval- ues determined from normal foals and the age atpresentation of each individual foal (Tables 1 and2; Fig. 1). Short-term outcome was dened assurvival or nonsurvival to hospital discharge andrecorded by the participating clinician at each hos-pital. Only foals that survived the entire initial24-hour hospitalization period were included inthe study. In the example shown in Fig. 1 andTable 3, the foal is 36 hours old at the time ofinitial evaluation. The timeline shown in Fig. 1outlines when L-lactate measurements were taken. It is important that the same measuringdevice is used at each sample time to reduce vari-ability. A total of 5 L-lactate measurements were obtained at 6-hour intervals between the initialevaluation and 24 hours after the initial evalua-tion. The timeline is 24 hours; each arrow in Fig.1 represents a sample time. From these L-lactate measurements, as shown in Table 3, the LACArea can be calculated using the method demonstratedin Table 4. As shown in Table 4, the 6-hour in-terval LAC Areais calculated by adding the 2 values flanking the interval (time interval), dividing thatsum by 2, and then multiplying that number by 6.This is the formula for calculating the area of atrapezoid (see Fig. 2). These 6-hour interval ar-eas are then summed to get the 24-hour totalLAC Areaof 114.6 mmol/L/H18528 h. The appropriate age correction is then applied (in this case37.0 mmol/L/H18528 h for 36 hours of age at presentation)Table 1.

Statistical Analysis Data were tested for normality using the Shapiro- Wilk method. Differences between surviving andnonsurviving foals were tested using Kruskal-Wal-lis (P /H110210.05, see Fig. 3). 3. Results A total of 49 foals were enrolled for this report, 42with complete datasets were used. A more com-plete description of this dataset has been recentlypublished. 7There were 5 nonsurviving foals (5/42; 11.9%). Age at admission was not normally distrib-uted. The median (25th to 75th percentile) was18.5 hours (8.00-45.75) and was not different be-tween survivors (P /H110050.312). Admission [LAC] was 3.25 mmol/L (1.90-4.75) andalso was not different between survivors and non-survivors (P /H110050.923). The area under the 24-hour L-lactate time curve (LACArea) was 58.5 mmol/L/H18528h (44.7-118.4) between survivors and nonsur-vivors (54.0 vs. 122.4, P/H110050.038; Fig. 2). The most commonly applied age correction was 42 mmol/L/H18528h(23/42; 55%); 37 mmol/L/H18528h was the second most com-monly applied correction (9/42; 21%). No differ-ences were found between correction values forsurvivors or nonsurvivors (P /H110050.700). Age-cor- rected LAC Area was further clarify differences between sur- vivors (17.1 vs. 80.4, P/H110050.034; Fig. 2). lactate and 24-hour mmol/L/H18528 and guish survivors from nonsurvivors (62.4 vs. 103.2,P/H110050.135; Fig. 2). 4. Discussion The use of the area under the [LAC] time curve(LAC Area) as a tool for improving prognosis genera- tion gained attention after it was used in septicpediatric human patients, where LAC Areawas found to be superior to both [LAC]Admit and [LAC]/H9004.9 Large prospective studies of general populations ofsick neonatal foals have demonstrated that both[LAC] Admit and [LAC]/H9004 can be useful as biomarkers of disease severity and prognosis but, at best, cor-rectly classify only 75% to 80% of studied foals inregard to survival to hospital discharge. 1-3,5There is evidence from both prospective and retrospectivestudies that both L-lactate parameters perform bet- ter as prognostic indicators in foals with certain specic diagnoses, such as sepsis and diarrhea, andare essentially irrelevant in others, such as meco-nium impaction and isolated failure of passivetransfer of maternal immunity. 1,2,10 It is generally recognized that [LAC] decreases rap- idly after birth in foals. Normal foals have [LAC]larger than that of adult horses at and after birth, with1 recent study demonstrating a signicant progressivedecrease in [LAC] and LAC Areaover the rst week of life, both being indistinguishable from adult values byday 7. 6Fetal energy metabolism from mid-gestation to just prior to foaling includes a reliance on L-lac- tate.11The foaling process also contributes to in- creased [LAC] at birth as the fetus transitions toneonatal life. 12For these reasons, the normal range of both [LAC] and LACAreain neonatal foals will be higher than the normal range of [LAC] in adult horsesover the rst several days of life. Most sick neonatalfoals are presented for treatment within 96 hours afterbirth; the median age in this small study was 18.5hours. This makes considering age-related adjust-ments in L-lactate parameters important when deter- mining prognosis, particularly over the rst 3 days oflife when normal L-lactate concentrations are largest and potentially confounding.

Although prospective and multicenter in nature, the sample size was small, and there werevery few nonsurvivors, limiting our ability to morefully investigate the role of LAC Areaas a prognostic tool. There was also an insufcient number of foalson which to perform valid statistical evaluations bymajor diagnostic category, for example, or to per-form logistic regression to determine the odds ofsurvival based on LAC Area\u2014either corrected or un- corrected. One further limitation is that not allsites used the same L-lactate measuring device, in- troducing uncontrolled variability in the reportedvalues. 13,14However, the results are sufciently Fig. 2. Three methods of calculating the area under the L-lactate time curve, along with the direction and magnitude of potential associated errors, for a foal with sepsis presenting at /H1101150 hours of age. All values were calculated using the trapezoidal rule, which states that the area under a trapezoid equals12(y1/H11001y2)/H18528x. A, The simplest calculation involves L-lactate values obtained at admission and at 24 hours of hospitalization and is represented by the dotted line. This calculation uniformly over- or underestimatesthe actual area; in this case the area was overestimated by 12.3 mmol/L/H18528h. The second method sums 4 separate areas, calculated foreach 6-hour interval from admission to 24 hours, and is represented by the shaded trapezoids. This method does not account for thechanging LAC Areaassociated with age in normal foals /H113497 days of age, which may affect its utility in assessing disease severity and establishing a prognosis. B, The calculated 24-hour LACAreais corrected by subtracting the normal LACAreafor a foal this age (grey box) of 32 mmol/L*h, in order to isolate and demonstrate the magnitude and duration of hyperlactatemia over the initial 24-hourhospitalization period. 34 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSNEONATOLOGYencouraging such that a multicenter prospective study should be undertaken, preferably one thatuses similar L-lactate measurement devices at each participating hospital. Questions of practicality always arise when new techniques are introduced, particularly when math-ematical formulas are involved, potentially explain-ing the failure of some complex predictors ofoutcome, or sepsis, in sick foals in gaining wide-spread popularity 15-19and the persistent use of the sepsis score tally sheet over time despite evidencethat its performance is somewhat location-depen-dent and has changed over time. 20-23Should the application of LACArea prove useful for estimating the prognosis of a critically ill foal, rest assured thatthe calculation is simple and can be done by hand orwith a calculator (and is potentially quite adaptableto a score sheet). Calculation requires 5 measure-ments of [LAC] from admission to 24 hours of hos-pitalization at 6-hour intervals using a singlemeasuring device, commonly performed as part ofroutine monitoring of sick foals that require inten-sive care. The area of each 6-hour interval is cal-culated as the average of the 2 measurementsflanking that 6-hour interval. That mean value isthen multiplied by 6 hours to determine the 6-hourarea of interest. The 24-hour LAC Areais simply the sum of those 4 6-hour areas. Once standards forage correction are established and found to be use-ful, correction can be applied, and the result can becompared to probability estimates for survival,stratied by diagnosis, developed from large multi-center studies. The goal, of course, is to develop arelatively simple and accurate tool for assisting sickneonatal foals and improving the accuracy ofprognoses.

Introduction Birth is a high-risk event in which a myriad of both maternal and fetal factors may result in fail-ure of a foal to properly transition from fetal toneonatal physiology. In the eld setting, thisfailure to transition often presents as a foal that isborn alive (i.e., with heartbeat and pulse), butfails to spontaneously breathe. Without inter-vention, hypoxemia-induced bradycardia ensues,followed shortly thereafter by asystole and death.In this situation, a well-prepared plan and theability to quickly assess the foal and perform ef-fective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) canmean the difference between perinatal death anda live, and healthy foal. Clearly, a foal that fails to spontaneously breathe at birth represents an emergency not amendable to retroactive planning, equipment re-trieval, or travel to the farm. In this situation,preparedness is key, and a positive outcome de- pends entirely on the presence of someone possess-ing the knowledge, skill, and equipment toperform effective resuscitation. Ideally, a veter-inarian would be present at high-risk foalings;however, this is not always possible or predictable. Depending on experience and expertise, breedingfarm personnel can be trained to effectively per-form the basic life support techniques describedhere to improve a foal's chance of survival in theabsence of a veterinarian. 2. Materials and Methods Equipment Supplies can be organized together in a crash kit that allows for easy transport from clinic or truckto the foaling stall (Fig. 1). Breeding farms maysimilarly assemble a kit that can be placed outsideof foaling stalls for easy access during and afterparturition. A portable oxygen tank and flow me-ter can be rented or purchased from local humanmedical suppliers (Fig. 2). Medications should bewell labeled and checked annually for expiration.A dosage chart may be printed and kept in thecrash kit to minimize the need for time-consumingcalculations and help prevent dosage mistakes inan emergency (Fig. 3). 40 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSNEONATOLOGY NOTESSupplies The following supplies should be available in the crash kit: Clean towels Nasotracheal tubes: 8-10-mm internal di-ameter nasotracheal tubecuffSelf-inflating Ambu bag Mask that ts over muzzle and both nostrils Syringes (3 mL) 20 g/H110031-inch needles White tape Bulb syringe Umbilical clamps Light source (small flash light) Laryngoscope (optional) 14 g or 16 g intravenous catheters appropriate for use in foals Portable oxygen tank and flow meter Injectable Medications Epinephrine (1 mg/mL) Vasopressin (20 U/mL) 3. Recommendations for Performing CPR The recently published Reassessment Campaign on Veterinary Resuscitation (RECOVER) Initiativewas created to provide veterinarians with evidence-based guidelines for performing CPR and improvingoutcomes in small-animal patients. 1Although not specically aimed at equine patients, the principlesset forth by the RECOVER Initiative apply acrossspecies and have been adapted into the recommen-dations below. Initial Assessment of the Newborn Foal Normal foals should exhibit spontaneous respirationand movement within seconds of birth. In thesecases, intervention is unnecessary and may nega-tively interfere with maternal-neonatal bonding.For the foal that fails to move and breathe upondelivery, however, rapid assessment and immediateintervention is warranted. Foals placedin sternal recumbency the nos-trils. A bulb syringe can be used to clear the nasalpassages and nasopharynx of excessive fluid and, ifpresent, meconium. Bleeding umbilical stumpsshould be quickly clamped to prevent excessive hem-orrhage. A stethoscope on the chest wall can beused to auscult heart rate and rhythm while simul-taneously palpating femoral pulses on the uppermedial thigh. Normal foals will have heart ratesgreater than 60 bpm (and usually closer to 80-100bpm). Sinus arrhythmia may be noted during therst hour of life. Bradycardia ( /H1102160 bpm) is reason for concern and should alert the clinician that inter-vention may soon be needed. 2-4 Tactile stimulation of the head, neck, and body by vigorous drying and rubbing with a towel is ofteneffective at initiating respiration and resolving mildbradycardia. Stimulating the inner ears or nasalcavities with a nger or piece of bedding straw mayalso be helpful. Initial assessment and the decisionto initiate further resuscitative therapies should alloccur within the rst 2 minutes of life, and ideally,within the rst 30 seconds. 2-4 Fig. 2. Portable oxygen tank and flow meter. Fig. 1. Neonatal emergency crash kit. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 41NEONATOLOGYIf the Foal Fails to Breathe and/or is Bradycardic Foals that remain apneic or display an irregular or gasping respiratory pattern should receive immedi-ate ventilatory support. Additionally, foals withheart rates less than 50 bpm should also receiverespiratory intervention, given that neonatal brady-cardia is often hypoxemia-mediated and will resolvewith adequate ventilation. 2-4 Several options exist for providing ventilatory support to foals in the eld. The preferred methodis intubation through either the nose or the mouth.For intubation, a foal should be placed in lateral orsternal recumbency with its head extended as muchas possible to help guide the tube into the trachea.For nasal intubation, the tube is passed ventrome-dially through the ventral meatus into the naso-pharynx (Fig. 4). For oral intubation, the tongue isgently pulled forward to stabilize the larynx and thetube is passed over the base of the tongue. Foreither technique, gently rotating the tube can helpguide it through the glottis and into the trachea. Fig. 3. Neonatal emergency drug dosage chart. Fig. 4. Nasotracheal intubation in a foal. (\u00a9 Veterinary Ad-vances, Ltd., 2012) 42 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSNEONATOLOGYTubes should be placed as far down the trachea as possible to minimize dead space. Once in the tra-chea, the cuff is inflated, the Ambu bag is connected,and the tube is secured in place by wrapping whitetape around the tube and muzzle. Administering abreath should result in visible excursion of the chestwall and auscultable bronchovesicular sounds overthe lung elds. Care should be taken to ensure thetube has not been placed in the esophagus, whichresults in a palpable tube-like structure dorsal tothe trachea, and abdominal enlargement ratherthan chest wall excursion in response to breath ad-ministration. Intubation should be attempted forno longer than 20 seconds before considering alter-native methods of respiratory support. 2-4 If nasal or oral intubation is not possible, ventila- tion via a mask or mouth-to-nose resuscitation maybe attempted. A commercially available self-inflat-ing resuscitation pump may be attached to a tightlytting mask and used to administer breaths (Fig.5). 3To perform mouth-to-nose resuscitation, the foal is placed in lateral recumbency and the downnostril is occluded with one hand while the otherhand is used to gently occlude the esophagus andprevent aerophagia (Fig. 6). 3,4 Once intubated, the rst delivered breath should have a prolonged inspiratory phase lasting approx-imately 5 seconds to help inflate the lungs and dis-place fluid across alveolar membranes into theinterstitium. 4Additional breaths should be deliv- ered at a rate of 10 breaths per minute.1,2Breaths should be quick and last only long enough to expandthe lungs, as prolonged inspiration times raise in-trathoracic pressure and impair venous return tothe heart. 1The foal should be reassessed 30-60 seconds after starting ventilation. Worsening bra-dycardia, cardiac arrest, or heart rates less than 40bpm warrant immediate initiation of thoracic com-pressions (see next section). 2-4 The use of oxygen during CPR is controversial, with studies suggesting that inducing hyperoxia isdeleterious to patient outcome,1and the 2010 Inter- national Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscita-tion recommended that human infants beresuscitated using only room air after several stud-ies failed to show any benet of oxygen supplemen-tation. 4With that said, in the eld setting, the use of free-flow 100% oxygen either intranasally or at-tached to the Ambu bag in the intubated foal isunlikely to cause harm when used for the relativelyshort time periods required for birth resuscitation,and increasing inspired oxygen levels may help bol-ster arterial oxygenation when cardiac output ispoor. Until further studies are performed in equineneonates, the use of supplemental oxygen remainscontroversial and clinician dependent. If the Foal has a Questionable or Absent Heartbeat and Fails to Breathe A foal that is truly stillborn or has been dead for any length of time is unlikely to respond to CPR. How-ever, a foal that is experiencing acute cardiopulmo-nary arrest at the time of delivery may very wellpresent as a stillborn but respond favorably to im-mediate initiation of resuscitative techniques. Ineither case, the clinician has nothing to lose by at-tempting to resuscitate the \"dead\" foal, and if noth-ing else, efforts made to revive a stillborn foal willlikely be viewed more positively by owners and ob-servers than doing nothing. To perform thoracic compressions, gently but quickly palpate the foal's ribcage for fracturesand place the foal in lateral recumbency on hardground. If rib fractures are present, they should beplaced on the down side. If bilateral rib fracturesare identied, the side with the most cranial frac-tures should be placed down. 2-4The RECOVER initiative recommends a \"push hard, push fast\" ap- Fig. 5.

(\u00a9 rescuer should kneel behind the foal's back and place one hand over the other (Fig. 7). Arms should be keptas straight as possible with elbows locked to allowthe core and back muscles to perform most of thephysical work and prevent rescuer exhaustion.Compressions should center over the heart andshould aim for a compression depth of one third toone half the width of the chest at a rate of 100 to 120compressions per minute. 1-4 If the foal is experiencing cardiac arrest, thoracic compressions should be initiated immediately.Time should not be taken to rst intubate the foalgiven that delivering oxygenated air to the lungswill have no effect on arterial oxygenation in theabsence of circulation. Furthermore, studies inhumans have demonstrated that maintaining circu-lation of relatively deoxygenated blood via uninter-rupted thoracic compressions results in bettersurvival rates than pausing compressions for ex-tended periods of time to give breaths. 1With that said, most cardiac arrests in foals occur secondary torespiratory arrests, and therefore, intubation shouldbe attempted as soon as possible (or simultaneouslyby a second person), or mouth-to-nose ventilationadministered in the case of single-rescuer CPR. 2-4 If the foal is intubated and more than one person is available, CPR should be performed continuouslyat a rate of 100 to 120 chest compressions per min-ute and 10 breaths per minute. In the intubatedfoal, chest compressions should not be stopped dur-ing delivery of breaths. Rescuers can perform CPRin 2-minute cycles; rotating every 2 minutes to pre-vent fatigue and allow for brief patient assessmentbefore resuming compressions. If only one rescueris present, and/or if the foal is not intubated, simul-taneous compressions and ventilation is not possi-ble. In this case it is recommended to perform CPRwith a 30:2 ratio; delivering 30 chest compressionsimmediately followed by two quick breaths. Thiscycle is repeated continuously and the foal is reas-sessed every 2 minutes. 1,2Drug Therapy In foals suffering from cardiac arrest or progressivebradycardia, vasopressor and vagolytic therapiesmay be used to increase heart rate, increase contrac-tility, and induce peripheral vasoconstriction to re-distribute blood to the heart, brain, and lungs.Epinephrine is a nonspecic catecholamine that actson all adrenergic its have inotropic, chronotropic, and bronchodi-latory effects, the vasoconstrictive effects of its /H92511 actions have been shown to be of most benet duringCPR. 1In fact, increased myocardial workload and oxygen consumption as a result of epinephrine'sbeta actions may, in fact, be deleterious to patientsurvival. 1,2Epinephrine is administered at a so- called low dose of 0.01 mg/kg IV every other CPRcycle (i.e., every 4 min during CPR). The epineph-rine high dose of 0.1 mg/kg IV can result in pro-longed peripheral vasoconstriction, renal failure,and ileus, and should be reserved for use only as alast resort. If venous access is not possible, epi-nephrine may be administered intratracheally via ared-rubber tube at a dosage of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg;however, efcacy and absorption from this route ishighly variable. 2-4Vasopressin is a vasopressor that exerts its potent vasoconstrictive effects via periph-eral V1 receptors. It has no cardiac effects. Vaso-pressin can be administered in place of epinephrineat a dose of 0.6 U/kg IV every other CPR cycle (i.e.,every 4 min during CPR). 1,2If enough people are available, an IV catheter may be placed during CPRto facilitate drug administration. In the absence ofextra hands, the author recommends placing a 20 gneedle in the jugular vein and leaving it in place forvenous access and drug administration until a cath-eter can be placed. When to Stop CPR In the hospital setting, end-title CO2(capnography) and electrocardiogram monitoring provide rapidmeans of conrming a return to spontaneous circu-lation and restoration of normal sinus rhythm, re-spectively. In the eld setting, however, a clinicianmust rely on physical examination and observationto signal respiration and return to spontaneous cir-culation. Ventilatory support can be discontinued when spontaneous respiration at a rate of greater than16 breaths per minute is observed; however, the foalshould be closely monitored for recurrence of apneaand assisted ventilation reinitiated if needed. 2-4 Thoracic compressions should continue until a regularheart rate of greater than 60 bpm is present. Pausesin CPR to assess for return of circulation should last nolonger than 10 seconds before resuming compres-sions. 2-4Foals that fail to show any signs of life after 15 minutes of continuous CPR are unlikely to survive.3 Post-Resuscitation Monitoring Foals that arrest during or after birth should beconsidered high-risk patients throughout the neona-tal period. Any maternal or fetal risk factors lead- Fig. 7. Positive pressure ventilation and thoracic compressionsbeing performed in a foal.

If possible, foals re-suscitated in the eld should be transportedimmediately to a referral hospital for further obser-vation and treatment, or at the very least, closelymonitored on the farm for repeat arrest. 4. Discussion The described techniques provide practical guide-lines for performing CPR in foals that without inter-vention would undoubtedly succumb to respiratoryand cardiac arrest. Success rates will vary by caseand depend on a combination of patient and clini-cian factors including the underlying cause of arrest,time to initiation of CPR, and effectiveness of CPRtechnique. Fortunately, the long-term neurologicsequelae frequently noted in humans following car-diopulmonary arrest seems to be rare in foals, re-ported in only 6% of large-animal neonatesundergoing successful CPR a recent retrospec-tive. 6With preparation and practice, basic CPR can be performed in the eld with relative ease,clinicians are encouraged to prepare themselves toput these techniques into action when the appropri-ate emergency situation arises. 5.

Authors' addresses: Rood and RiddleEquine Hospital, 40580-2070 (Haywood, Barr, Spike-Pierce); andCollege of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, The Ohio StateUniversity, Columbus, OH 43210 (Mathys, Mollenkopf); Introduction Incomplete ossication of the tarsal and carpal bones is a problem in equine neonates withpotentially life-long consequences. 2. Materials and Methods Hospital records were searched for Thoroughbredfoals less than 90 days of age who had tarsal radio-graphs performed. The radiographs were exam-ined and graded on a scale of 1 to 4 based on theAdams Skeletal Ossication Index. 1Gestational length was calculated from farm records and Jockey Club birth dates. Race records were obtained fromEquibase.com, and affected foals' records were com-pared with maternal siblings'. 3. Results Grade 1 and 2 foals were premature (gestationlength /H11021325 days); Grade 3 and 4 foals were not. Foals with Grades 1, 2, and 3 were signicantly lesslikely to race than their maternal siblings, and foalswith Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 earned less money. Foalswith incomplete ossication raced more frequently as 3-year-olds than as 2-year-olds. 4. Discussion Incomplete ossication, especially Grades 1 and 2, isassociated with a shorter gestation length, which isexpected given that ossication of the cuboidal bonesoccurs during the end of gestation. Foals withGrades 1 through 3 of incomplete ossication were lesslikely to race and earned less than their unaffectedsiblings, and therefore should be considered poor race-horse candidates.

Morresey, BVSc, MACVSc, DACT, DACVIM (Large Animal) Estimating the prognosis of the sick neonate has profound clinical, economic, and client-relationshipimplications. A plethora of information is available; however, inconsistency between study locationand methodology has led to disparate results, and research center diagnostic capabilities are largelyunavailable in eld settings. However, in some study populations readily observable parametershave been found to be good indicators of prognosis, reinforcing the utility of a comprehensive clinicalexamination. Author's address: Rood and e-mail: pmorresey@roodandriddle.com. \u00a9 2015 AAEP. 1. Introduction Central to the viability of the equine breeding indus- try is live foal production. This is consistent be-tween various locations at approximately 80% ofmares bred. 1,2Economic modeling has determined that to maintain nancial viability for the individualbroodmare, six foals must be produced over a 7-yearperiod and remain viable so as to be sold at auction. 3 Survival of each foal delivered is therefore critical tothe health of the overall equine industry. A number of studies have investigated the prog- nostic value of clinical and laboratory ndings inneonatal foals at time of admission to intensive careunits. From these values mathematical modelshave been created to assist decision making andprognosticate on survival. 4-7However, repeatabil- ity between different locations or between different groups of foals from the same location where themodel was created but in different years was foundto be poor. Mathematical model accuracy was less-ened for conditions that developed after the initialassessment. 7It has been suggested that sepsisscoring should not be used to dene sepsis in clinical study situations unless the score has been previ-ously validated for the particular study center. 8 However, when compared with a regression modelderived from objective clinical data, the modiedsepsis score performed favorably. 9 In eld clinical settings utility of such prognostic models is complicated as parameters available inacademic settings are likely not measurable in theeld. Also, if important values are measurable, re-sults are typically not available in a reasonabletimeframe that would allow meaningful applicationof the information. Even with readily available in-formation, prolonged delay in hospital referral mayalter both clinical and laboratory ndings sufcientto affect prognosis. 10 2. History and Initial Evaluation Readiness for birth of the neonatal foal is intuitivelylikely to have a bearing on prognosis, yet in onestudy prematurity or dysmaturity of the neonate (asindicated by gestational age) did not differ betweensurvivors and nonsurvivors. 7Likewise, age of the 50 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSNEONATOLOGY NOTESneonate at admission did not affect survival.7,11 However, duration of clinical signs prior to admis- sion was found to signicantly negatively affect out-come. 7In one study a 5.8-fold increase in the risk of death for each 24-hour period of delay wasdemonstrated. 11 Among physical parameters determined at the time of admission, a heart rate /H1135070 beats per min- ute, a respiratory rate /H1135060 breaths per minute, a rectal temperature greater than 99\u00b0F, a normal ap-pearance of mucous membranes, and the ability tostand at admission positively affected survival inone study. 7In contradiction to these ndings, in foals presented for respiratory disease the majorityof clinical examination variables at initial evalua-tion were unassociated with case outcome. 12With respect to septic foals, fever was found to be aninconsistent nding in one study. 13 Maternal disease (both systemic and placental) was found to be higher at to be associatedwith negative outcomes. 12,14 3. Signs of Sepsis Signs suggestive of sepsis have been a negativeprognostic indicator in many neonatal studies.Sepsis was identied as the most common problemin both survivors and nonsurvivors in one study. 15 Diagnosis was assisted by sepsis scoring, this beingconsidered more reliable that any individual param-eter. 4Bacteremia in one study was most consis- tently due to Escherichia coli, although mixed infections were also found.16Of 423 bacteremic foals in this study 254 survived, this being affectedby a number of historical and clinical ndings.A positive blood culture is associated withnonsurvival. 17 4. Hematology and Clinical Chemistry Hematological and clinical chemistry values havebeen integral in many neonatal foal prognostic a number of studies. Immunoglobulin G(IgG) concentration also factored in a number ofstudies involving survival and prevention of infec-tion. 18,19A recent study found odds of nonsurvival increasing proportionally with lower IgG concentra-tions, with higher total protein associated with adecreased likelihood of low IgG, and increased albu-min associated with an increased likelihood of lowIgG. 20 Blood glucose has been shown in other species to be indicative of survival. Hyperglycemia, both de-gree and duration, has been associated with nonsur-vival in human medicine. 21-23Hypoglycemia also is problematic, and although critical glucose levelshave not been determined, prolonged human neona-tal hypoglycemia is associated with negative out-comes, both neurological and survival. 24In neonatal foals, hypoglycemia has been associatedvariably with survival, being associated with non-survival in septic foals 11but not overall foal admis- sions.6Hypoglycemia at admission has been associated with sepsis, bacteremia, and the systemicinflammatory response syndrome, with blood glu-cose outside the range of 50 to 180 mg/dL associatedwith decreased survival. 25In another study blood glucose /H11022120 mg/dL was associated with increased likelihood of survival.11It remains uncertain whether derangements in blood glucose are thecause of, or merely reflective of, the pathophysiolog-ical processes decreasing survival. 5. Lactate Lactate is widely reported in the assessment ofhealth and prognosis. Lactate is considered amarker of circulatory competence, with the rate ofclearance predicting survival in some studies. 26,27 In human sepsis cases, serial blood lactate is consid-ered to predict development of multiple organ fail-ure. 28In sick human neonates blood lactate elevations are associated with increased mortality,with increasing levels preceding clinical indicatorsof deterioration. 29 In neonatal foals, admission arterial blood lactate has been shown to be associated with survival andoccurrence of systemic inflammatory response syn-drome. 30Venous blood lactate elevation, and persistent hyperlactatemia, has been shown asso-ciated with survival and severity of illness. 31,32 The highest admission lactate concentrationswere present in hemorrhagic shock, sepsis, andcomplicated perinatal asphyxia younger, encephalopathic foals inanother. 32Regardless of diagnosis, lac- nonsurvivors vssurvivors. 17 6. Metabolic and Endocrinological Pathways Academic studies regarding the prognosis for neona-tal survival have advanced to involve variables dif-cult to measure at point of care in routine clinicalpractice. Septic nonsurvivors have been shown tohave elevated arginine vasopressin and adrenocor-ticotrophic hormone, with a subcategory of neonateshaving cortisol im-plying adrenal 33,34Hypo- perfusion of critically ill foals, with the attendantclinically evident signs of poor peripheral perfusion,has been associated with elevated levels of both ar-ginine vasopressin and aldosterone. 35Anion asso- with nonsurvival.15Associated with sepsis in humans, plasma adrenomedullin hasbeen shown elevated in critically ill foals but lacksthe specic association with sepsis seen in otherspecies. 36As more is revealed about the complex endocrinological pathways of the neonatal foal dur-ing the additional AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 51NEONATOLOGYTable 1.

Discussion\u2014How Much More Do We Know, and How Can it Help Us? The 1980s are looked upon as the birth of equine neonatology. During this time, prognostication ofthe severity of illness and likely outcome was basedupon clinical parameters derived from experience,and routine laboratory values available at the time.Attempts to formulate prognostic mathematicalequations followed with varying success. Theseequations were based upon weighting factors de-rived from clinical data collected at various researchsites, but unfortunately uniformity and transferencebetween sites was difcult to achieve. Through the1990s and early 2000s aspects of the presentingphysical examination and laboratory values wereintegrated to provide a basis for prognosis, yet thisalso suffered from an inability to be transferred be-tween hospitals and sometimes within the same hos-pital over time. Metabolic status became moreclosely studied with the widespread validation andapplication of lactate levels. Largely from the2010s, research has turned toward homing in onendocrinological processes present in the neonatalfoal and their disturbances due to in utero depriva-tion and periparturient events (Table 1). A numberof studies suggest appropriate basic physical exam-ination parameters, blood work that does not sug-gest the likelihood of a septic process, and asufcient Ig concentration to be associated with sur-vival. This information is readily assessed in eldsituations. In recent studies, some degree of link-age between endocrinological dysfunction and clini-cally evident comprises has been made. 37 Throughout this period, the importance of the clinical examination has not been diminished, andin fact has been enhanced as in multiple studiesinvolving many different populations of foals in var-ious centers, physical parameters and observationshave been retained in many prognostic models.Therefore, whereas the search for an objective, con-sistent, and transferrable marker of prognosis con-tinues, veterinarians should rededicate themselvesto conducting searching and comprehensive clinicalexaminations of at-risk neonates.

Introduction Starting, running, and growing a small business can be a challenge for anyone, especially for those whoare trained in a technical eld but lack educationand experience in basic business disciplines, includ-ing planning, marketing, nance, and human re-sources (HR) just to name a few. How do you llthese gaps when your nancial resources are likelystretched and your time is limited? Whether youare already in business or looking to start your prac-tice, there are resources available to help you. Ofcourse, there are certied public accountants, law-yers, business consultants, and specialists availableas well if you have the nancial resources to hirethem, but if you don't or if you're not sure, freeresources are available. The US Small BusinessAdministration (SBA) has resource partners thatexist to assist the small business commu-nity. These partners include SCORE, small busi- ness development centers, and the Women'sResource Center. This article will focus rst onhow SCORE can help you succeed and second on aprocess you can use to develop a strategic plan tomove your business ahead.2. What Is SCORE? SCORE is America's premier source of free and con- dential small business mentoring and advice.The SCORE organization consists of experiencedbusiness people who volunteer their time to helpsmall business owners, managers, and entrepre-neurs succeed. As a national organization, SCOREhas more than 10 000 members distributed across320/H11001 chapters. Chances are very good that there is a chapter near you, but if not, there are still ways totap into SCORE's resources. SCORE's volunteersunderstand the needs and challenges of managingsuccessful businesses because they have been there.They have owned and operated their own businessesor have served in management positions in varioustypes of businesses. The basic service provided bySCORE is mentoring and advice delivered throughface-to-face sessions, telephone calls, e-mails, or, insome cases, video conferencing. Clients seeking advice on a specic topic are generally paired with amentor most closely matching their needs. Onegoal of SCORE volunteers is to establish an ongoingmentoring relationship with their clients. The pri-mary mentor may often route clients to other men- 56 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: EQUINE PRACTICE TODAY NOTEStors who have the experience or expertise in the specic area of concern. In addition to one-on-onementoring, SCORE can assemble a team of mentorsto visit the client site to analyze the situation\u2014aSWAT team approach, so to speak, to assisting theclient. In addition to mentoring, SCORE also helpsto educate the small business community by holdinglocal workshops conducted by the chapters as well asonline seminars and workshops available throughthe national organization. 3. Who Does SCORE Serve? SCORE serves entrepreneurs starting their busi-ness/practices, owners managing and growing theirbusiness, and owners facing times of trouble/oppor-tunity. Let's take a look at how SCORE mentorscan help you in each of these situations. Entrepreneurs Starting a Business Chasing your dream is an exciting endeavor; how-ever, before acquiring your business license, buyingequipment, and opening your doors, there is a pro-cess that you should follow to get off to a good start.The author suggests that you rst visit a SCOREmentor to discuss your idea and to map out a plan toget you there. Generally, you should perform a fea-sibility analysis to test your idea and answer basicquestions such as the following: What is your value proposition to the customer? Who is your target audience? How big is the market? What is the competitive situation? What is your competitive advantage? What will your startup costs be? How will you operate the business? What are your preliminary nancial projec-tions (revenue and costs)? After performing this preliminary analysis and re-viewing it with your SCORE mentor, you should beready to move on. This could include digging deeperinto the previous questions, determining the organiza-tional entity (LLC, S corporation, partnership, etc.)and licensing requirements of your jurisdiction, ren-ing your nancial projections, and calculating yourfunding requirements. If outside funding is required,all of the above can be assembled into a formal busi-ness plan for submission to funding sources. YourSCORE mentor can then review your nal plan, helpcoach you on how to present it, and direct you topossible funding sources. Owners Managing and Growing Their Business All right\u2014so you've opened your doors and are in theearly phases of operating your business. Now anew set of issues have presented themselves, such ashow to attract more business, what to do if yourun out of cash, how to grow your business, etc.SCORE can help answer these and similar questionsthrough both mentoring and education. As whenyou started your business, you should have a planfor growing your business. Developing an annualstrategic plan is a key element in managing andgrowing your business (more on this later). YourSCORE mentor can guide you through this planningprocess and help to hold you accountable for execut-ing the plan. In addition to planning, you can cometo SCORE for advice on the following specic issues: Marketing and sales Product pricing Business processes Hiring and ring of employees General management Financial control Cash flow Funding Your SCORE mentor or chapter has the resources toassist you. Additionally, you may want to consideradding your mentor to your advisory board if youhave one. Your SCORE mentor wants to have anongoing relationship with you and wants at a mini-mum for you to keep them abreast of how yourbusiness is progressing. Owners Facing Times of Trouble/Opportunity Although we don't like to think about it, there can betimes when serious problems arise that maythreaten the life of the business. Then again, therecould be tremendous opportunities that arise thatdemand special attention. Regardless, SCOREmentors can assist you. SCORE can assemble ateam to help you analyze the situation and chart acourse of action (provided you haven't waited toolong). Sometimes a problem can be so severe, however, that there is no recovery path. Don't let this hap-pen to you. Work with your SCORE mentor to de-velop a set of key results indicators (KRIs) that canserve as an early warning mechanism to head offany problems before they become too severe. Inaddition, after developing a strategic plan and re-viewing the plan's progress with your mentor, youwill have an additional set of objective eyes lookingat your business for potential problems and/oropportunities. 4.

Strategic Planning: A Key to Growth As mentioned previously, a strategic plan is a vitaltool in managing and growing your business. Thissection outlines a process for developing a strategicplan for your business. Although it may seem likea daunting task, it doesn't have to be. It does,however, require that you get away from the dailytasks of running the business and spend some qual-ity time thinking about what you want to accomplishand how to do it. Your plan should specify your goals and objectives along with the strategies and tactics necessary toaccomplish them. It will help you to be proactiverather than reactive, keep you focused on what isimportant, and provide you with a yardstick to mea-sure performance. The plan should be clearly andconcisely written down\u2014it doesn't have to be a workof literary art. To get you started, you rst need toestablish your process (i.e., what steps you will fol-low) and then put together a schedule. An exampleof a workable process is as follows: Establish your planning team Review or set mission, vision, and values Set your destination Build your marketing plan Build your operational plan Build your nancial plan If you are new to planning, you may want to justfocus on the next year. As you rene your processand become more comfortable, you can expand theplanning horizon out to 3 to 5 years. Choosing your planning team is an important element in developing a good plan. You do not want to try and go it alone. Having people who canand will contribute to the thinking process and pro-vide critical feedback is imperative. You want peo-ple that know and care about you and your business.They could be knowledgeable/key employees or out-side resources such as your accountant or lawyer,business associates, friends, and SCORE mentor. Your mission, vision, and values set the param- eters for your planning. If you have them, that's great. If not, it's worth spending some timewriting down your thoughts, but be careful not to letthis task drag on too long. Your mission is essen-tially why your business exists. Your vision iswhat the business will look like in the future. Yourcore values specify how you want your business tobehave. Expressions such as \"customer rst,\" \"in-tegrity,\" \"quality,\" \"innovation,\" or are ex-amples of core values. These core values willgenerally reflect those of the owner. They are use-ful in hiring (and selecting partners) because youwant people who share your values.Setting your destination species where you want the business to go. This step actually has two components. The rst is to honestly assesswhere you are today; the second is to dene whereyou want to go. To assess where you are today,document your target market, products and ser- vices, competition, customers, capabilities, and -nancial performance. You should also take note of any trends (such as those on social media) or externalfactors (such as government regulations, the economy,and technology) that may affect the business. Fi-nally, you should perform a SWOT analysis on yourcurrent business to exploit strengths and opportuni-ties and to address weaknesses and threats. After examining where you are today you can now establish where you want to be at the end of theplanning horizon. Note here that if you are lookingout 3 to 5 years you'll want to set goals, objectives,and strategies that establish vectors for your busi-ness. After the long-term direction is set, you canthen bring your planning down to the next year.Here you set goals and objectives that are attainablein the next year and consistent with the long-termdirection. Your goals and objectives can addressseveral categories: Revenue and protability Products/services/markets/locations Capabilities/resources Operational improvements Customer relations Systems and procedures Regardless of the category, your objectives shouldbe specic, measurable, achievable, relevant, andtimely. One note of caution: you may set more ob-jectives than you can reasonably accomplish withthe resources you have available; therefore, youshould also establish priorities. As you further de-velop the plan into action items and budgeting, itmay become apparent that you do not have the re-sources necessary, and the priority can be used toadjust the plan. Your marketing plan is the rst step in dening how you will accomplish your goals and objec-tives. Here you may need to do some market re- search to gain further insights into your existingmarket or new markets you want to attack. Fornew markets, research the market's size, uniquecharacteristics, what its needs and problems are,any special buying factors, pricing, etc. Preferably,you have done this research before you set an objec-tive to enter a new market. If you do not have agood handle on your existing market, a similar anal-ysis should be performed. You also should analyzeyour competitors and understand their strengthsand weaknesses, products and services, pricing,marketing messages, and positioning. Study theirwebsite for insights and solicit feedback from yourcustomers. 58 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: EQUINE PRACTICE TODAYYou can dene the 4 Ps for your business as follows: Product: What are your products/services? Price: What is your Place: Where will you deliver the product/ service? Promotion: How will you promote the business? Next, for each step in the customer cycle, develop a strategy to address acquiring and retaining custom-ers. The customer cycle, denition, and possiblestrategies include the following: Suspects: Suspects are those who could poten- tially use your service. Strategies to reach suspectsinclude creating a website, optimizing search en-gines, direct mailing, and advertising. Prospects: Prospects have a need/interest for your service. Strategies to entice prospects includeoffering incentives, coupons, and white papers. Customers: Customers have purchased your service. Strategies to \"wow\" customers include pro-viding a quality customer experience, excellent ser-vice, and post-service follow-up. Repeat customers: Repeat customers are those who have purchased goods or services fromyour business multiple times. Strategies for re-taining repeat customers include offering perks,sending out newsletters, and following up. Raving fan: A raving fan is someone who loves your company. Strategies for rewarding ravingfans include offering perks and reference bonuses. The idea is to develop and implement strategies that move customers from suspects to raving fans. Finally, develop a clearly articulated value prop- osition and marketing message that you will inte-grate into every marketing program and vehicle(website, brochures, advertising, e-mail blasts, so-cial media, etc.). Note that you could have a differ- ent marketing message depending on the targetmarket (e.g., 1 for the horse owner and 1 for thebreeder). The message should communicate thebenets of your service and correspond to the needsof your audience. Step 2 in dening how you will accomplish your goals and objectives is your operationalplan. This step determines the strategies and tac- tics bundled together as programs that your businesswill execute to achieve your objectives. You can es-tablish programs in areas such as the following: Sales and revenue Product development/product line expansion Infrastructure\u2014website, automation, equipment Systems and procedures Hiring/training/HR The programs should support specic goals and ob-jectives. Within each program you should denethe strategies you will use and the tactics/actionplans that will be required to execute the strategy.This is best explained by the following example: Objective: Increase sales by 50%. Strategy 1: Expand the sales force. Tactics: Develop a quick-start sales training program in Q1 and add new salesperson in Q2 andQ3. Strategy 2: Expand the marketing program to increase lead generation (prospects). Tactics: Update website with a new look and feel and better search engine optimization in Q1 andimplement an e-mail marketing and social mediastrategy in Q2 and Q3. Please note that each tactic has a delivery time- frame (by quarter in this example) and should includea responsibility assignment. As the year proceeds,you will tighten up these program schedules by devel-oping project plans with tasks, timelines, milestones,and task responsibility. To repeat an earlier warn-ing, choose your objectives wisely. Don't have toomany, and focus on those that are most important.Keep your plan in harmony with your ability todeliver. The last step in the planning process is creating a nancial plan to support your goals and objectives,strategies, and tactics. The nancial plan includesthe following: Revenue projections Costs/expense budget Scenarios KRIs Revenue projections are your forecast of how muchand when you will generate revenue. The projec-tion should be built from the ground up for eachproduct group you market. It is often not feasibleto forecast every product you sell, so forming groupsof similar products with similar margins makes theprojection process more manageable. For example,estimating how many customers you will have forthe product each month and multiplying that by theaverage revenue per customer will generate amonthly revenue gure. In this example, both thenumber of customers and average revenue per cus-tomer can be tracked as you move through themonth as one of your KRIs (more on that later). Your cost and expense budget lays out the cost of running the business or, in other words, where themoney goes. Some costs can be expensed, whereasothers may need to be capitalized. Typical catego-ries of costs that are expensed include the following: Fixed: costs incurred every month regard- less of revenue (rent, utilities). Variable: costs associated directly with rev- enue (cost of goods sold, commissions). Step function: costs that increase when revenue reaches certain levels (hire an addi-tional employee for sales, lease more space). Discretionary: costs associated with imple- AAEP PROCEEDINGS BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: EQUINE PRACTICE TODAYmenting your programs (more flexibility in timing these programs if business conditionsdo not follow the plan). As with revenues, costs should be slotted by month,thus giving you the components for your projectedmonthly income statement. This is another pointat which you can test your plan for feasibility. Other factors to consider in building your nancial plan include allowance for bad debt, average collec-tion period for receivables, payment period for pay-ables, inventory levels, repayment of debt, andcapital expenditures. These factors can affect yourcash flow and need to be managed. You can beprotable and still run out of cash. This part of your plan will help you to identify any nancing needs you may have for working capitaland capital expenditures. To prepare you for thepossibility that things won't go exactly as planned,you should run some variations, or scenarios, onyour projections and budget. With a good spread-sheet you can see what happens if revenues fallshort or exceed your projections. Try using a best-/worse-case adjustment of /H1100625% to 30%. The same can be done with costs you don't control, although it probably won't be as dramatic a swing as revenues.This exercise will get you thinking about what youwould do if reality doesn't follow the plan. Finally, you can establish key results indicators (KRI) to serve as metrics you use to track yourbusiness performance before you see it reflected onyour nancial statements. These indicators varyby type of business but could include the following: Month-to-date sales/daily sales Order backlog Pipeline (prospects becoming customers) Cash balance Accounts receivable Inventory Billable hours/utilization percentThese KRIs can be reported daily or weekly as you move through the month so you're not in for anysurprises when the nancial reports arrive on yourdesk. If necessary, you can take early action tohead off potential problems. 6. Your Plan Is Done...N o wWhat? Your strategic plan now becomes a tool to help youmanage your business. If you have employees,share some or all of it with them to get everyone onthe same page. Align their goals and performancemeasurements with your plan. Use your plan tomanage the business. On a daily or weekly basis,review your KRIs in the form of a flash report.Examine your nancial statements once a monthand compare actual results to what was planned.Then take time to understand any signicant vari-ances from your plan. You may also want frequentupdates on operational programs that are in prog-ress. Finally, review the overall status of yourprogress against your plan each quarter\u2014preferablywith your planning team\u2014and make any necessaryadjustments. If you \"plan your work and work your plan\" you will have a good chance of reaching your goals andobjectives. One nal note. This may seem like a lot of work and a distraction from day-to-day operations, butremember as the owner and manager of the businessone of your key responsibilities is to plan. Also, itdoesn't have to take too long. A series of 5 to 6 teammeetings preceded by individual thinking time canresult in a good plan in 2 to 4 weeks. Get started.You won't regret it.

Thus, global travel may potentially jeopardize the wellbeingof these sport horses, but at the same time provides opportunities for the equine Province, China;e-mail: jloomans@oculus-insights.com. \u00a9 2015 AAEP. 1. Introduction In most of the Western countries, recreational use of horses evolved from an agricultural, transportation,and military necessity to a professional sport, rac-ing, and leisure industry. 1Our careers as equine veterinarians rely heavily on this industry wherethe bond between the horse and the rider/owner canbe very strong both emotionally as well as nan-cially. We have created an infrastructure with ac-ademic education for (equine) veterinarians, furtherspecialization opportunities, created (inter)nationalorganizations of equine veterinarians and special-ists, built clinics, referral centers, centers of excel-lence, etc. In \"our world,\" our customers take thisfor granted and see it as an easily accessiblecommodity. 2 Recently, new countries have entered the world of equestrian sport, which is good for the sport as a whole and the Olympic status of the sport. Ex-panding their global network is the strategy of thetwo leading governing bodies of equestrian sport,the Fe \u00b4de\u00b4ration Equestre Internationale (FEI) and the International Federation of Horseracing Author-ities (IFHA), who, in 2013, joined forces and createdthe International Horse Sports Confederation(IHSC). Because globalizing equestrian sport in- volves movement of the equine athletes around theworld, making the global transportation of thehorses easier is a priority for the IHSC. 3A sar e - sult, the organization has intensied their coopera-tion with the Animal World Health Organization(OIE). According to the 2013 Annual Report of the IFHA 3: \"The IHSC's primary mission will be the exchange of information and technical knowledge,and collaboration on issues that represent the col-lective interests of both our organizations, includingthe international movement of horses with the Ani-mal World Health Organization (OIE), horse wel-fare, anti-doping, coordinated communications andfair play.\" \"Under titled 'Developing and Promoting International Competition', the afliation be- tween the IFHA and the OIE was discussed.The presentation made by Bernard Vallat, Direc-tor General of the OIE, groups detailed the facilitationof the international movement of racehorses, in-cluding a concept known as High Health, HighPerformance (HHP) which would allow for astreamlined movement of sport horses and race- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. /H114082015 61THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: EQUINE PRACTICE TODAY NOTEShorses that met criteria as being low risk for dis- ease transmission.\" The aim of the HHP horses status is to allow for these horses to be transported more easily be-cause their health status is monitored more fre-quently than that of other (local) horses and the riskof disease transmission is minimized. Transport-ing the horses to new emerging countries for compe-tition is only one of the challenges; keeping themhealthy during their stay is yet another. Many ofthese emerging economies/countries lack the infra-structure to provide for the complex needs of thesehorses once they arrive. Professional equine veter-inary care, amongst other needs, is often completelyunavailable. Challenges and opportunities existfor equine veterinarians and equine veterinary prac-tices that consider expanding their activities abroadas part of their strategic plan. 2. The Global Equine Industry The FEI is the global regulatory body of most eques-trian disciplines and is located in Lausanne, Swit-zerland. They have registered approximately90,000 athletes (riders and horses) and regulate3500 events per year. 3The organization is also a good source of information for what is taking placein equestrian sports worldwide given that they pro-vide annual reports with statistics of their events.Between 2007 and 2013, the number of events orga-nized under the FEI umbrella increased by 56%despite the economic recession in many parts of theworld. Fig. 1 shows the differences in percentageper discipline with 2007 as the starting point. Inall disciplines with the exception of driving, thenumber of events increased from 2007 to 2014. Table 1 provides information about the total num- ber of equestrian competitions organized under FEIrules per country in 2013 as an indication of theimportance of these countries in the equestrian in-dustry. France, United States, Germany, Italy,Austria, Spain, United Kingdom, Australia, TheNetherlands, and Belgium are the ten countries thatprovide greater than 100 competitions annually.Table 2 shows which countries made the biggestgrowth in percentage of competitions between 2009and 2013; i.e., the most active newcomers in eques-trian sports in these recent years. Here Estonia,Costa Rica, Tunisia, Oman, China, India, Venezu-ela, Jordan, and Slovakia are at the top with morethan 200% growth in their competitions. Many ofthese countries have the ambition to become impor-tant players on the world stage, and given recentresults at the Olympics, World Equestrian Games,and other international competitions the equestriansport is globalizing rapidly. The IFHA also provides information on their web- site regarding starts, breeding, prize money, betting,etc., and this provides a good insight into what ishappening globally in the racing and Thoroughbredbreeding industries. Table 3 shows the 30 coun-tries with the most horse races (both flat and jump)in the world in 2013 and the prize money involved.The United States, Australia, and Japan are shownto be the key players in this industry. Table 4provides information about the number of breedinghorses (foals, mares, and stallions) per country andthe percentage of growth between 2011 and 2013.Globally, the number of Thoroughbreds used forbreeding decreased 11.1% during this period, butthere are large differences between countries; someof the most active horse racing countries in the Fig. 1.

This industry contracture wouldbe expected to have a negative effect on the work-load and income of equine veterinarians working inthis sector in these countries. 3. Opportunities Many equine veterinarians who work with breedingfarms, stallions, and sport horses already have con-tacts abroad. Horses are examined for export, lab-oratory samples are taken, and pre-purchaseexaminations are performed. Semen and embryosare exported, and sport horse services are providedto international sport and racehorses. Additionaltouch-points are the team veterinarians of nationalteams who travel with horses to competitions, FEIofcial vets or treating vets at international compe-titions and races, and advisors of international op-erating equine industries. Veterinary practicescan utilize these contacts and develop an interna-tional presence as part of their strategy. Evenwithout providing services in foreign venues, veter-inarians can provide an important service to theirclients by being a resource and advisor. Did youever wonder where the horses that you are prepar-ing for export end up, what calibre of veterinary careis available abroad, and whether you should provideadvice to the buyer and/or seller on these matters? An excellent way to learn more about the equine veterinary industry abroad is through foreign in-terns, externs, or associates who work at your clinic,or in your region. There are also trade missions ofspecic sectors to different countries where you canteam up with breeders, horse dealers, horse feedindustry, pharmaceutical industry, etc. Very oftenthese kinds of missions are organized by local em-bassies or consulates of your country and they arealso very helpful and equipped to provide local in-formation about our industry. It is necessary toactively research these different recourses, connectwith local equestrian federations, and create yourown network. 4. Challenges Working in other countries and other cultures canbe challenging, especially in emerging countrieswhere our profession is not well understood, or thespecic knowledge and clinical skills of workingwith sport and racehorses does not exist locally.If a strategic decision as a practice or as an individ-ual is made to investigate these new business oppor-Table 2.

Language Language can be a big issue. You are likely to have to work with a translator, but the veterinary medi-cal vocabulary as well as the terminology used inequestrian sports may be unfamiliar to an availabletranslator. You may need to determine: \"Is theresomeone available, or can someone be educated?\" Apotentially good translator can be a local rider orinstructor who has been abroad or a local veterinar-ian who was educated in an English-speakingcountry. Culture In our society, animal welfare is an important topic and we tend to care deeply about our horses. Thisis not always the position animals have in othercultures. Observed differences can also be a matterof ignorance of horse husbandry and basic horse-manship. It is important to determine whetherthere are enough local people who possess knowl-edge about equine care, or whether there is willing-ness to learn. Local Veterinary Profession It makes sense to nd out whether there is an ex- isting academic education system for veterinariansand what the current opportunities are for studentsto be educated both theoretically and practically inequine veterinary medicine. Furthermore, under-standing the status of equine veterinarians in thecountry, how they are organized, their availability,their credibility, and the requirements for licensingare important to research. Teaming up with localveterinarians and helping them to develop theirskills in equine medicine can be mutually benecial. Veterinary Pharmaceutical Products Veterinary pharmaceutical products for horses are indispensable in day-to-day practice. Simple prod-ucts available at home might not be availableabroad. For example, a country such as China hasno medicinal products registered for horses at alldespite a well-organized legislation on veterinarypharmaceutical products. Finding the neededproducts can be very difcult if not impossible.It can take marked effort to nd products registeredfor other species and humans that can be safely usedin horses. Also, importation of drugs can be dif-cult if not completely prohibited; and thus, locallymanufactured items may be the only available, andthese may have variable quality or purity and mayprove to be dangerous. Facilities and Equipment Finding equipment such as x-ray generators and ultrasound units is not too difcult in most countriesgiven that these machines are used for human med-icine all over the world. They are relatively easy toTable 4.

Constructingsurgical facilities and obtaining specialized equip-ment to safely induce and maintain horses undergeneral anesthesia is more difcult to accomplish.When there are facilities available elsewhere in thecountry, it is necessary to determine whether thereare horseboxes or trucks available and allowed totransport horses to these destinations quickly andsafely. Local Legislation Even when there are no equine veterinarians avail- able in a particular country, that does not automat-ically give a foreign veterinarian the right topractice there. It is important to research locallegislation, including whether your diploma is ac-knowledged and whether you are allowed to work inthe country. Tax implications, whether you workas an employee or start your own business abroad,are important to investigate both in the new marketas well as at home. Local Health Threats for Horses When you start from scratch in a new culture in a new country, you want to know as much as possibleabout the possible threats for the horses. These donot necessarily have to be infectious diseases, para-sites, midgets, mosquitos, etc. Simple things, suchas the temperature and humidity in different partsof the year; availability of good roughage, grains, orpellets, drinking water; stable quality; and pastureavailability may have a large effect on equines'health and welfare. The presence of good farriercare should also be investigated. At one's homecountry these elements are often taken for granted,but in a new environment they may be impossible toget or of inferior quality. Personal Safety and Insurance Working with horses carries signicant risk and accidents during work do happen. In an environ-ment that lacks horsemanship and up-to-date infra-structure these risks should be expected to increase.Therefore, investigation of the human healthcaresystem is essential. It is very important to makesure you are well prepared and know whether andwhere help is available. Insurances policies forhealth and disability at home may have to be ad-justed to accommodate a change to a work environ-ment abroad. Professional liability insurance alsois likely to require modication.5. Discussion International sport horse competitions are expand-ing all around the globe. In emerging economies,the middle class and wealthy have discovered theleisure and competition horse and want to play arole in the international scene. Betting on horses isalso very popular in many of these coun-tries. Horses travel easily around the world andsometimes end up in places that have no properinfrastructure and are not equipped to provide pro-fessional care up to our standards. Due to thesecircumstances the welfare of these horses can becompromised. Both the FEI and IFHA are workingwith the OIE to make it easier for sport horses totravel the world. This provides opportunities inthe equine industry. Equine veterinarians who areprofessionally involved with the export of horses areparticularly well positioned to embrace this strat-egy. Providing education to owners, grooms, rid-ers, and veterinarians in these regions can be quitea challenge but is often rewarding. The most im-portant factor for success internationally is the en-gagement of the emerging countries' riders andhorse owners (individuals and companies) and fos-tering their willingness to invest in (veterinary)care. The equine veterinary profession in these re-gions is empowered through the help of equine prac-tices from other parts of the world. This does nothave to be an altruistic enterprise but can be part ofa business strategy to expand practice activitiesoverseas, providing not only veterinary services butalso equine welfare, veterinary education, andhorsemanship. In a shrinking local economy, aglobal presence can be an opportunity for growthand a strategy for expansion and survival of yourbusiness.

PRACTICE TODAYThe Equine Liver Health and Disease Thomas J. Divers, DVM, DACVIM, DACVECC This article is dedicated in memory of Dr. Doug Byars, a wonderful friend, colleague, teacher, andequine clinician.

Anatomy and Histology The liver is the second largest single organ in the horse (skin is rst), accounting for approximately1.5% of body weight. 1In the adult horse, the liver is positioned obliquely in the cranial abdomen, withthe left lobes located ventrally near the 7th to 10thintercostal spaces and the right lobes positionedmore dorsally and opposite the 9th to 16th The smaller ventral quadrate and rightdorsal caudate lobes are located mid-abdomen. 1 The liver on the left encompasses approximately onethird of the liver mass and is often adjacent to themore caudally located spleen; this provides an op-portunity, when visualized with ultrasound, to com-pare the relative echogenicity of each organ. Theliver should be hypoechoic compared with the spleen(Fig. 1), and with hepatic brosis the liver andspleen appear more similar in echogenicity. 2An unusual anatomical variant in horses is atrophy ofthe right lobe of the liver that occurs in some middle-age-to-older horses. In this condition, there is aloss of hepatocytes with condensation of the hepaticstroma and a thick, wrinkled hepatic capsule devel-ops. 3This atrophy may occasionally prevent ultra- sound visualization of the right liver. The cause ofthis atrophy is somewhat unique to the horse, and isnot believed to be a result of divergence of arterial orvenous blood flow. Instead, it is believed to resultfrom compression of this portion of the liver by theright dorsal colon and cecum. 3In the fetus and newborn foal, the liver is relatively much larger and on fetal ultrasound the liver is the easiest organ toidentify. 1 At the light microscopic level, the liver can be divided into structural units called hepatic lob-ules. 1,4,5The classic hepatic lobule is a composed of numerous plates of livercells (hepatocytes), radiating toward a central vein. Situated around the perimeter, at each \"corner\" ofthe lobule, are branches of the hepatic artery, he-patic portal vein, and bile duct (together called thehepatic triad), plus lymphatics. Blood from hepaticarterioles and portal venules mixes together in he-patic sinusoids, which surround the plates of hepa-tocytes, thus bathing each hepatocyte in a mix ofarterial blood plus venous blood that has comemainly from the gut and spleen via the hepatic por-tal system. Sinusoidal blood then travels along theplates of hepatocytes toward the central vein, even-tually entering larger hepatic veins that convergenear the diaphragm to the caudal cava.Between each hepatocyte are microscopic bilecanaliculi into produced by each hepato-cyte is secreted. 5 Bile flow within each hepatic lobule is opposite that of blood, with bile heading toward bile ducttributaries at the periphery of each lobule. Theducts from each lobe join and eventually form the 66 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE NOTESleft and right hepatic ducts. These unite to form the common hepatic ducts leading to the commonbile duct. Both the bile duct and pancreatic ductempty into the duodenum at the major duodenalpapilla, located on a slightly raised mucosal ridge. 1 This ridge can be seen on endoscopic examination ofthe duodenum, just prior to the cranial flexure of theduodenum at the beginning of the sigmoid loop.Opposite the major duodenal papilla is a smallerprojection into the bowel, the minor duodenal pa-pilla, which contains the opening of the accessorypancreatic duct. Seventy percent of blood flow to the liver is deox- ygenated blood from the hepatic portal vein. 5The hepatic portal vein receives blood from the stomach,spleen, pancreas, small intestines, cecum, and largecolon, making the liver the most important organ forassimilation and metabolism of nutrients, orally ad-ministered drugs, and gut-derived toxins or bacte-ria. 6The portal vein does not receive blood from the most distal colon and rectum, kidneys, reproduc-tive organs, or from the mammary gland. 4The other 30% of blood to the liver pro-vided by the accompanying hepatic artery. 5,7Ap- proximately 10% of the total blood volume at anyone time is found in the liver. 5 1. Pathophysiology and Pathology Insults to the liver and secondary diseases are com-mon due to hepatic ltration of enteric-derived tox-ins, both bacterial and chemical. Fortunately, theliver is an amazingly regenerative organ and mostdiseases do not progress to failure. Although hepa-tocytes are fully differentiated cells they are capableof active proliferation by self duplication in responseto acute external stimulation and up-regulation ofhumoral factors, all without any contribution fromhepatic stem cell progenitor cells. 8-10However, in the chronically injured liver, hepatocytes do not pro-liferate well and biliary cells commonly proliferateand form ductules around the portal veins. Thebiliary cell proliferation associated with chronic in-jury may contain progenitor cells, which can giverise to both hepatocyte and biliary cells in an at-tempt to repair the liver. 8,11 The liver is a vital organ, one that performs many essential functions such as production of mostplasma proteins (including albumin), production ofalmost all coagulation factors, and production ofacute phase proteins (e.g., brinogen, amyloid A,hepcidin). The liver also stores glucose as glycogenand performs glycogenolysis required. It per-forms acids such as propionate, some aminoacids, and in general, the liver is the most importantorgan in the intermediate metabolism of proteins,carbohydrates, and lipids. It is an important stor-age organ for fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K)and many elemental nutrients (iron, copper, sele-nium, and molybdenum). The liver is also the de-toxifying organ of the body for many xenobiotics (achemical compound; as a drug, pesticide, or carcin-ogen that is foreign to a living organism) and is theprime organ for rst-passage metabolism of manydrugs and for excretion of some. 5 Liver pathology can, simply from a clinical per- spective, be divided into acute vs. chronic, and whenpossible, into predominately hepatocellular vs. bili-ary injury. Laboratory biochemical testing can behelpful in determining predominantly hepatocellu-lar vs. predominantly biliary types of disease whenthe relative increases between hepatocellular andbiliary enzymes and between direct and indirectbilirubin are compared. Distinguishing betweenacute vs. chronic liver disease is best ccomplished byevaluation of history, clinical ndings, ultrasoundand/or biopsy evidence of brosis (evidence of bro-sis in particular is an important determinant oflong-term prognosis). Resolution of acute hepaticinjury often results in a rapid and complete recoverywhereas chronic injury is more likely to cause bro-sis. 12Differentiating whether biliary or hepatocel- lular disease predominates can be important innarrowing the differential diagnosis list and, whenpossible, allows early, focused therapy. In manycases, it may not be possible to make clear-cut dis-tinctions between the two. In the horse, the rate atwhich brosis can occur is surprising. When inves-tigating ferrous fumarate toxicity and hepatic fail-ure in newborn foals in 1983, 3- and 4-day-oldaffected foals commonly had evidence of both brosisand regeneration. 13 Following injury, hepatic brosis is believed to be promoted predominantly by hepatic stellate cells(also known as perisinusoidal or Ito cells). 5,7,8He- patic stellate cells are located in the perisinusoidalspace (space of Disse), in close proximity to hepato-cytes, just beneath sinusoidal endothelial cells andadjacent to Kupffer cells. These stellate-shapedcells are normally quiescent and are present in rel-atively small numbers; they contain intracellular Fig. 1. Sonogram of the 8thintercostal space showing normal liver (hypoechoic) and spleen (hyperechoic). The ability to visual-ize both organs at this site allows the examiner to assess nor-malcy of hepatic parenchyma. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURElipids that serve to store vitamin A as retinal ester. When the liver is damaged, Kupffer cells producetumor necrosis factor alpha, causing the stellatecells to contract individually but proliferate in num- bers. These activated cells become chemotactic, de-crease their vitamin A stores, secrete collagen (thuscausing brosis) and eventually become senescent. 8,14 Kupffer cells are specialized macrophages that are part of the reticuloendothelial system. Kupffercells are responsible for destroying gut-derived bac-teria, endotoxins, and other foreign substances.They also help in recycling iron from senescent orinjured red blood cells and, as a result, Kupffer cellsaccumulate hemosiderin and this can be pronouncedeven in disease-free horses. 15 2. Biochemical Testing for Liver Disease and Failure Biochemical testing is imperative when attemptingto diagnose liver disease or liver failure. From aclinical perspective, biochemical results can be help-ful in narrowing the differentials for the liver injuryand, when evaluated over time, can help predictprognosis. Biochemical testing can also be used toidentify subclinical hepatotoxin such as isseen with pyrollizidine specic. Increased values ofserum SDH, and AST are mild SDH is released fromthe cytosol of the hepatocyte and has a short half-life(hours) and repeated SDH measurements can behelpful in determining resolution or progression ofhepatic insult. 17GLDH is localized in hepatic mi- tochondria and is markedly increased in the serumof most horses with acute liver disease resultingfrom or with necrosis of hepatocytes; sensitivity forGLDH elevations in detection of hepatic necrosisand hepatic lipidosis was 78 and 86%, respectively. 18 GLDH is thought to be more stable and have aslightly longer T 12than does SDH, although SDH is stable for at least 24 hours when the sample isrefrigerated. 19 GGT is an excellent screening test for hepatic disease in the horse.20In my experience it is rare that a horse with severe liver disease will not haveelevated plasma/serum GGT. GGT often continuesto elevate for several days after a hepatic insult is nolonger present, presumably due to biliary hyperpla-sia. Although the greatest elevations in GGT areseen with biliary disease, there is some GGT releaseinto plasma with hepatocellular injury. 21On rare occasion, and with severe chronic brosis, SDH andGLDH may return to normal range despite a fataloutcome.The magnitude of elevation of hepatic-derived en- zymes may not correspond to functional abnormali-ties and should, therefore, be considered tests thatmeasure disease and not tests that measure func-tion (the magnitude of increases in hepatic enzymes[especially GGT] should not routinely be used byitself to determine prognosis). During a 2-yearfarm investigation of a forage-associated hepatopa-thy in Europe, more than 70 weanlings, yearlings,and adults had elevated GGT values, some as highas 1000 IU/l (mean, 180 IU/l) and GLDH values ashigh 1200 IU/l, yet not a single horse has demon-strated signs of hepatic failure nor any obvious clin-ical signs (author, personal observation). Theprognosis for horses with hepatic failure is best de-termined by function test abnormalities, etiology,and presence or absence of hepatic encephalopa-thy. 22Somewhat unique to the horse, hematocrit, serum iron, and percentage iron saturation aresometimes high in horses with severe liver diseaseand remain after rehydration. Racehorses occa-sionally have mild-to-moderate increases in GGT(50-140 IU/L) without any other biochemical evi-dence of liver disease. This phenomenon has beenobserved for at least 30 years and the elevation inGGT has often been temporally linked to poor per-formance. 23In some situations, multiple horses stabled together may have elevations in GGT. Pos-sible causes include drug administration causinginduction of GGT, toxin exposure and disease spe-cic to the biliary tract, viral infections causing onlyincreases in GGT at the time of sampling, and over-training with depletion of hepatic glycogen. 24GGT activity between 70 and 100 U/L has previously beenassociated with poor health, oxidative stress, andovertraining the horse, and further, those horseswith high GGT values showed a markedly reducedincidence of increased GGT following reduction intraining intensity in subsequent years. 23Further- more, GGT levels in these horses almost alwaysreturn to normal within a few weeks with rest.Recent studies demonstrated that serum GGT activ-ity was correlated training load andracing frequency 25and maladaptation to training.26 It should be noted that hepatocellular liver en- zymes may be elevated with many systemic inflamma-tory disorders. This likely reflects inflammatory,vascular, hypoxic, and toxic insults to the liver sec- ondary to the primary disorder. Bile acids can beelevated in horses with intestinal disorders such ascolic and enteritis and in equine dysautonomiawhere the elevations in bile acids may be due to bothliver pathology and ileus. The severity of theselaboratory abnormalities in horses with colic, espe-cially moderate-to-markedly-elevated bile acids, hasbeen associated with prognosis. 27 Liver function tests may only become abnormally elevated when approximately 70% or more of liverfunction is lost. 28These tests include conjugated (direct) times in conjugated bilirubin of more than 0.2 mg/dL above normal range has, in my experience, been a sensitivemarker of liver failure. When the abnormally highconjugated bilirubin comprises 25% or more of is often suggestive of a pro-nounced biliary and obstructive disease. 11,30Sep- tic with intestinal ileussometimes have with no additional evidence of hepatic dysfunc-tion. 31Treatment in such cases should focus on the sepsis and intestinal ileus. Conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and when increased in serum, bilirubin-uria may result, which can be detected by green-col-ored bubbles after shaking urine in a tube or by usingurine test strips that detect bilirubin (Fig. 2). Onvery rare occasions a healthy horse will have a positivebilirubin reading on the urine test strips, although I donot know why. Unconjugated bilirubin is not watersoluble and does not normally pass in the urine.Increased unconjugated bilirubin is also a sensitivetest of liver failure but lacks specicity given thatelevations may also occur with anorexia, hemolysis or,on rare occasion, marked elevations may be seen in anotherwise-healthy horse (presumed congenital de-ciency in glucuronyl transferase). 32Although it is common knowledge that horses that are off feed canhave unconjugated bilirubin concentrations that areslightly outside normal laboratory ranges, this lattergroup of healthy horses likely reflects some variationin uridine-diphosphate glucuronyltransferase activ-ity. 32 Serum or plasma bile acid levels may be early predictors of liver failure when values increaseabove 30 /H9262mol/L.20,22Mild elevations in bile acids (as high as 20 /H9262mol/L) may be seen after 2 to 3 days of anorexia.33In some healthy neonatal foals, se- rum bile acid concentrations may be well above nor-mal adult horse values and should therefore not beused alone as disease or function tests in this agegroup. 34In a state of negative energy balance, se- rum triglycerides are increased in equines but he-patic lipidosis resulting in liver failure is rarelyfound in these patients except in those with li-pemia. 35In foals with hepatic failure hypoglyce- mia is often present, whereas in adult horses bloodglucose is more commonly normal or increased butmay be low in some cases. 20,36Plasma lactate is frequently high and bicarbonate is usually with fulminant hepatic failure. Serum albu-min is inconsistently and only mildly low in horseswith either chronic (18%) or acute (6%) severe liverdisease/failure. Conversely, serum globulins areincreased with liver failure frommultiple causes. 37These ndings, reported by Dr. Gary Carlson, who had a long-time interest in dis-eases of the equine liver, are somewhat unique tothe horse. The absence of hypoalbuminemia inmany horses with liver failure is partially explainedby a longer half-life (19 days) of albumin in horsesthan in other domestic species. Volume contractionwas not believed to be the cause of the elevated totalprotein in most cases. 37The increase in globulins is explained by either an increased exposure or an-tigenic response to enteric-derived antigens thatwould normally be cleared by the healthy liver andits Kupffer cells, or to an immune response to thediseased liver. There may be a decrease in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and increase in PT and PTT clotting times inhorses with liver failure. 11,29The low BUN is pre- sumed to be associated with failure of the hepaticurea cycle and the increased clotting times are dueto insufcient lack of synthesis of factors II, V, VII,IX, X, XI, and XII (VIII is produced mainly in endo-thelium). Coagulation abnormalities may not al-ways occur with obstructive biliary diseases causingfailure despite the importance of normal enteric bileacids in the absorption of vitamin K and its impor- tance in activating factors II, VII, IX, and X. 30Al- though coagulation abnormalities exist in many horses with liver failure, clinical bleeding is uncom-mon and liver biopsies can be safely performed inthe great majority of cases. 38One explanation for this is that platelet counts generally remain normalin horses with liver failure. Fibrinogen, an acutephase protein made in the liver, is usually in normalor low range in most cases of equine liver failure,except with cholangiohepatitis where it may behigh. 30 3. Liver Biopsy Liver biopsy can be performed safely in the horsefollowing ultrasound examination and identicationof an appropriate site. For many years, liver biopsywas safely and generally successfully performed onthe patient's right side using anatomical landmarksalthough the biopsy report would occasionally re-turn with the reading, \"normal lung\" or \"normaldiaphragm.\" A recent study reported that usingthe traditional landmarks as biopsy sites may result Fig. 2. Urine sample in a plastic container and glass tube dem-onstrating yellow to light green appearance of bilirubinuria, es-pecially evident in the foam.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREin unsuccessful sampling of the liver in many horses and could puncture the lung or intestine.39The study concluded that the practice of blind percuta-neous liver biopsy in horses is not recommendedbecause of the potential risk of serious complica-tions. 39Although biopsy is safe after identifying the liver by ultrasound, biopsies may not be neededin many cases. If historical, clinical and laboratoryinformation clearly suggest a diagnosis such asTheiler's disease or hepatic lipidosis then biopsy isunlikely to be of additional help in managing thecase. Hepatic biopsy is best used, in my opinion,when the cause of the diagnosis is unknown, or anytime when a biopsy sample might help determineclinical treatments or prognosis. Sampling shouldbe considered in cases of chronic liver diseases ofunknown etiology (and there are many) or samplingfor bacterial culture. Although samples should beobtained, I must admit that biopsies of chronic hep-atitis/hepatopathy cases rarely provide a specic eti-ology or etiopathogenesis (toxic or infectious orimmunologic), and even in bacterial cholangiohepa-titis case approximately 50% of samples are culturenegative. Regardless of these limitations, the bi-opsy is still the most direct way of evaluating theliver when clinical information and biochemical test-ing leaves us searching for a diagnosis, treatmentplan, or prognosis. Prognosis should not be solelybased upon microscopic assessment of the amount ofbrosis but must include clinical ndings, biochem-ical tests, assessment of other microscopic ndingsfrom the biopsy and ultrasound examination. 20 An experienced equine hepatic sonographer is oftenable to accurately predict the severity and extent ofhepatic brosis (Figs. 3A and B). Assessing PT andPTT prior to biopsy may not be necessary if plateletcount is normal because, as noted previously, severehemorrhage following liver biopsy is extremelyrare. 38If the PT and PTT are known to be pro- longed this should not prevent sampling if the bi-opsy results might prove important to casemanagement. On rare occasions the liver cannot be visualized on the right but can be visualized and biopsied on theleft. This is not my preference as the few colics Ihave witnessed following hepatic biopsy have mostlyoccurred when liver was sampled. Thereare spring-loaded and ultrasound-guided biopsytechniques but I still prefer: 1) visualization of theliver with ultrasound; 2) selection of the anatomicsite and the proper needle angle needed to allow forpenetration of the maximal liver thickness; 3) rou-tine preparation of the site for biopsy; and 4) usingthe old fashioned \"Tru-Cut\" needles, which, seem tome to provide better sample size. Causes of Liver Failure 1. Cholestatic Causes of Liver Disease Obstructive or cholestatic disorders of the liver in- clude any diseases that have, as the primary dys-function, obstruction of bile flow. Liver failure withbiliary obstruction as the predominant dysfunctionis characterized clinically by colic and icterus. He-patic encephalopathy is uncommon in thesecases. 30,40The expected biochemical cholestatic liver in GGT, abnormally high conjugated bilirubinwith 20% the total bilirubin often being inthe conjugated form, and markedly elevated serumbile acid concentration. The causes of cholestaticliver disease and failure include suppurative cholan-giohepatitis, cholelithiasis, displacement of the leftcolon to the right with obstruction of the commonbile duct, and duodenal ulcerations in foals thatoccur either at just caudal duct. 30,40-42 Primary cholangiohepatitis (CH) and cholelithia- sis (CL) two of the most frequent causes of ob-structive hepatic disease in horses. Inflammationof the biliary tract is called cholangitis but in adulthorses with clinical disease there is usually a con-current inflammation of hepatocytes hence, cholan- Fig. 3.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREgiohepatitis. CH CL as diseases of middle-age-to-older horses with no obvi-ous sex or breed predilection. 30,40,43Although the etiopathogenesis of CH and CL in horses is uncer-tain, retrograde bacterial infection from the smallintestine is considered probable and this hypothesisis supported by the studies by Johnston et al, 40Reef et al,44and Peek.30The isolation of enteric, with this hypothesis. 30,40,44,45Plant mate- rial has occasionally been found inside the stones,44 further supporting retrograde invasion of bacteriaand even ingesta from the duodenum as a predis-posing cause of the disease. aAs bacteria gain en- trance to the biliary system from the duodenum (bileis normally sterile), it would be expected that aninflammatory response would occur with tissueswelling thus potentially increasing the pressurewithin the common bile duct and forcing infectioninto the biliary canaliculi. The ascending infectionis thought to initiate a cholangitis, which may thenextend into the periportal region of the liver causingcholangiohepatitis. 40The occurrence of enteritis or inflammatory bowel disease prior to the onset of CHin some cases may also support the ascending en-teric bacterial infection hypothesis, 46,47although most cases of CH do not have a clear history of eitherprior enteritis or inflammatory bowel disease. 30 The most common organisms cultured from the af-fected horses are E. formation.Equine choleliths are predominantly composed lesser extent calciumphosphate. 30,44,48,49Ascending enteric bacterial in- fection is thought to be critical in the development ofbrown pigment stones (calcium bilirubinate) inman. 50,51Deconjugation of ofcalcium bilirubinate, and cementation by anionicglycoproteins is thought to result in the formation ofthese calculi. 50It is clinically important to realize that calcium bilirubinate crystals may form ini-tially, followed by sludge formation and then stoneformation. If that hypothesis is true, then eachstage of the process may signal further decreases inthe efcacy of medical treatment. In the majorityof clinical cases of equine cholelithiasis, stones arefound in more than one area of the biliary tree andcan include intrahepatic and extrahepatic chole-liths, of the com-mon bile duct). 44Multiple stones are common, with one extreme case reported as having 1,120stones. 52Stones in the common bile duct would almost always be expected to produce signs charac-teristic of obstructive failure whereas stones in otherareas of the biliary tree may be silent.Clinical signs associated with these conditions in- clude pyrexia, colic, icterus, and in chronic cases,signicant weight loss. 30,40,43,44,48,53-56In a small percentage of cases, both neurologic signs caused byhepatic encephalopathy (HE) and photosensitizationmay be seen. 40,57Unless the disease is chronic and extensive brosis has occurred, hepatocellular func-tion is not severely compromised, thus accountingfor the absence of HE in many cases. Althoughnonspecic, colic and marked icterus are the mostcommon clinical ndings in horses with obstructiveCH and CL. 30,40,43,48Fever would be expected but is not always evident on a single exam. Some de-gree of depression may be present. Affected horseshave markedly elevated serum concentrations of thehepatobiliary enzymes GGT and bilirubin.A increase in the conjugated than 25% of the total bilirubin iscommon 40,43,48,49but in approximately one third of cases the percentage of conjugated/total bilirubin islower than 25%. 30Affected horses almost always have an increase in hepatocellular enzymes SDH,GLDH, and AST (commonly 2-4 times normal), al-though the proportionate increase above normal val-ues is usually less than that seen with serum GGTelevations (commonly 7-20 times normal). Hyper-brinogenemia was common in nine of 10 horsesdiagnosed with CH in our initial retrospective studyof CH at the University of Pennsylvania 40but that was not the case in our second study of nine horsesat Cornell. 30Other notable serum biochemical hyperglobulinemia. 30,40If one is trying to diagnose CH and discovers that globulins are notelevated then this could be a red flag for either awrong diagnosis or some complicating factor; Ilearned that from a case that Dr. Sandy Tasse dis-cussed with me in 2012. That case had all of theclassic clinical and laboratory ndings associatedwith CH but the total protein was only 5.6 g/dL andalbumin was normal. The horse did have liver fail-ure due to infectious CH but did not respond toroutine and extended therapy for CH on the farm.After consulting with Dr. Julia Felippe at Cornell, itwas found that the horse also had combined variableimmunodeciency necessitating euthanasia. I feltbadly that I had not diagnosed it earlier. Clotting function tests (PT and PTT) were consis- tently normal in our second study, despite biochem-ical evidence of advanced hepatobiliary disease 30 but there are reports of severe CH and CL causingprolongation of both PT and PTT times. 40,43 Transabdominal ultrasound examination of the liver with a 5/H11006 megahertz (MHZ) sector scanner is required for diagnostic imaging purposes and formonitoring treatment of equine liver disease. Theliver can almost always be visualized on the right inhorses with cholelithiasis, even in older horses thatcommonly have atrophy of the right lobe, becausehepatomegaly is present in all cases except for thosewith chronic and diffuse brosis. The ultrasono- of liver enlargement and distended,thickened bile ducts variable liver echogenicity.In horses CL, increased hepatic echogenicity,hepatomegaly, distended bile ducts, occasionalcalculi are the salient features of the condi-tion. 40,44,48,58Stones can often best be visualized in the 7th to 10th intercostal spaces on the right side(Fig. 4), just ventral to the lung border, and are seenin approximately 50 to 75% of horses with CL 44; stones are uncommonly seen on the left. The bili-ary tree is usually not detectable ultrasonographi-cally in normal horses but dilated bile ducts can beseen as enlarged channels running parallel to theportal veins in approximately 40% of horses withobstructive CL and this nding should be consideredsuspicious for either intra- or extrahepatic biliaryobstruction even if no stones are seen. 2,44Hyper- echoic choleliths with acoustic shadowing can occur,whereas other less mineralized calculi or sludge mayhave only faint or no acoustic shadowing. If severalbile ducts are severely distended that suggests alikely obstruction (cholelith) in the common bileduct. If no stones can be imaged this may suggesta favorable prognosis for CL with surgery (assumingabsence of hepatic parenchyma hyperechogenicitysuggesting brosis) because there may be only asingle obstructing stone. In contrast, if stones canbe seen in the image eld with classic ndings ofhepatic failure due to obstruction, one can assumethere is at least one other stone obstructing thecommon bile duct and the presence of multiplestones may lower the prognosis. Stones obstruct-ing the common bile duct cannot be imaged on trans-cutaneous abdominal ultrasound but whenendoscopic exam of the duodenum is performed,with luck the stone or a \"bulge\" may be noted at thebile duct opening (Fig. 5). Histopathology of biopsy material can provide valuable information as to the severity of inflamma-tory CH and the extent of accompanying hepaticbrosis. Historically, marked periportal and bridg-ing brosis have been interpreted as poor prognosticindicators in horses with suspected or known CH orCL. 30,48Case reviews suggest that extended sur- vival times (months or years) may be possible insome horses despite histological evidence of chronichepatobiliary damage (severe periportal and bridg-ing brosis). 30An estimate of the degree of brosis, based upon hepatic echogenicity, can also be deter-mined by ultrasound exam and may be nearly asprognostic as a liver biopsy. There is some sugges-tion that horses with biliary obstruction have a char-acteristic circumferential biliary hyperplasia (K.Butterworth, personal communication, 2013) on mi-croscopic examination of a liver biopsy and this canbe helpful in the diagnosis and prognosis when anobstructing stone cannot be seen on ultrasound orduodenoscopy and surgery is being contemplated.This nding does not have 100% sensitivity so if allother clinical and laboratory ndings are character-istic of CL then surgery (if an option and appropri-ate) should not be ruled out based on the absence ofthis microscopic nding. Another indication for bi-opsy is to provide a sample for bacterial culture, inhopes of determining the etiologic agents such thatspecic antimicrobial therapy can be chosen. Un-fortunately, as noted previously, cultures obtainedfrom biopsy samples are negative in approximately50% of cases. 30 Based upon previous studies it would seem that long-term administration of systemic antibiotics iscritical for the successful treatment of CH and insome cases of CL in horses. 30Median treatment period in one study, where seven of nine horses hadliver failure due to CH but survived, was 51 days(range, 17-124 days). 30Antibiotic selection should Fig. 4.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREideally be based upon culture and sensitivity results from hepatic biopsy material but clinicians are fre-quently required to select an initial antimicrobialagent empirically or when the culture results arenegative. The isolation of predominantly Gram-negative enteric and mixed anaerobic organismsfrom cases of chloramphenicol) wouldbe reasonable choices. Although the liver nearly 50% of metronidazole, its use in CH isunlikely to be a problem or require a dose adjust-ment unless there is marked liver brosis. In theabsence of positive culture results, clinicians maynot only have to select an agent empirically butshould also be prepared to change antibiotics accord-ing to clinical response. In one study, in all horsesthat improved, clinical improvement was seen daysto several weeks before normalization of serum GGT actually increased during the initialperiod of clinical improvement in all horses. I donot believe that there is a level of GGT that accu-rately predicts treatment failure in CH, as long asthe horse is clinically stable, the ultrasound exami-nation does not reveal numerous obstructing stonesor diffuse brosis, fever abates, and laboratory testsimprove within 7-10 days after medical therapycommences. The highest GGT in an affected horsethat I have successfully treated with medical ther-apy was 2,270 IU/L but I consulted on a case inVirginia where the horse recovered despite a GGT of3,200 IU/L. Continuing antimicrobial therapy un-til both clinical and biochemical recovery has oc-curred may be important in achieving a successfuloutcome and I suggest monitoring serum GGT ac-tivity as a biochemical marker of recovery. Sup-portive medical care using intravenous fluids andanti-inflammataory drugs was a critical part of thetreatment of several cases in our reports. Therapeutic agents, such as the bile salts cheno- deoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol),that are specically used to encourage dissolution ofcholesterol-rich stones in man, have no effect oncalcium bilirubinate calculi but, as anti-inflamma-tory and choleretic agents that increase bile produc-tion, their use more liquid excrete. 59These bile salts were initially pre- dicted to be potentially toxic in horses due to theirability to be metabolized to the hepatotoxic com-pound lithocholic acid by intestinal bacteria in an-other hindgut fermenter, the rabbit. 60During the past 4 years we have now used ursodiol in eighthorses with CH when standard medical treatmentsas listed above were not providing a favorable re-sponse. Five of these horses had somewhat sur-prising recoveries, including one that clearly had anobstructing stone and others with \"sludge\" visual-ized on ultrasound examination. There has beenno recognizable evidence of toxic effects in any case but additional studies on safety and efcacy areneeded. Administration of ursodiol may increase se-rum bile acid concentrations. There is direct experi-mental support for the use of dimethyl sulfoxide(DMSO) in the treatment of brown pigment stones inman because it is a direct solubilizer of calcium biliru-binate 61and I still recommend its use for CH and CL. Previous reports have described the surgical treatment of cholelithiasis.48,53,54,57,62Unfortu- nately, intrahepatic calculi are largely inaccessibleto the surgeon and the fact that many cases ofequine cholelithiasis possess multiple intrahepaticand extrahepatic choleliths means that recurrentbiliary obstruction would be likely even if an ob-structing stone is removed. The best surgical out-come has been when there is thought to be a singlestone obstructing the bile duct and when hepaticbrosis is not severe. Surgery should be consideredfor horses that have intermittent or persistent ab-dominal pain, ultrasonographic evidence of obstruc-tion to biliary outflow, moderate-to-no hepaticbrosis, few or no stones visible on ultrasound, andan unsuccessful response to medical therapy. Rec-ommending surgery when you are uncertainwhether it is a single obstructing stone causing theclinical disease can be difcult so one must use all ofthe information above to make that decision. Inaddition, consultation with a voice of experiencesuch as the one Dr. Jim Becht and I received on acase in 1985 is always helpful. In that case wewere struggling to make a diagnosis as to the reasonfor persistent colic and liver failure when Dr. Whit-lock suggested, \"if I were you boys I would considercholelithiasis in that mare and explore her,\" themare did well following a choledocholithotripsy andwent on in later years to deliver a foal by SeattleSlew. Thanks to Dr. Whitlock for the \"suggestion.\" Right dorsal displacement of the large colon (RDDLC) can cause nonstrangulating obstructions,preventing the normal flow of ingesta through thebowel lumen without resulting in intestinal vascularcompromise. 41It may be difcult to make a den- itive diagnosis of a RDDLC because of the vagueclinical ndings (often mild colic, questionable ab-normalities on rectal exam, etc.) although the diag-nosis is easier in horses that have the highly specicbut not highly sensitive ultrasound examinationnding of horizontally flowing mesenteric blood ves-sels in the right cranial to mid-abdomen. 63In the late 1980s we initially noticed that some horses withRDDLC had intense icterus and marked elevationsin the serum activity of GGT, often accompanied byan increase in concentration of conjugated bilirubin.The elevations in GGT returned to normal aftersurgical correction of the displacement and liver bi-opsies showed minimal pathology, suggesting thatthe elevations are due to some feature of the colic AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 73FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREepisode rather than being caused by primary hepatic disease. In 2005, Dr. Rachel Gardner reported41on the surgical and postmortem examinations of horseswith RDDLC that demonstrated how positioning ofthe colon in horses with RDDLC sometimes resultsin compression of the bile duct causing extrahepaticbile duct obstruction and a subsequent GGT activity and direct bilirubin. The useof GGT as a diagnostic test for RDDLC would resultin many false negatives. However, the presence ofhigh GGT activity in a horse with examination nd-ings consistent with a colon displacement is support-ive of RDDLC, and in those circumstances wasfound to have a specicity of 98%. Horses not re-sponding to medical therapy and exhibiting contin-ual abdominal pain with examination ndingssuggestive of a RDDLC should not have surgerydelayed because of elevations in serum GGT or bil-irubin concentration unless historic or ultrasono-graphic evidence are suggestive of a primary hepaticdisease. 41 Gastric outflow obstruction in suckling foals is caused by duodenal and pyloric ulcer disease andcommonly follows an episode of diarrhea 1-4 weeksearlier. CH can occur in these foals if the obstruc-tion is at or distal to the opening of the bile duct; thisis reported to occur in 28% of cases. 64Surgical correction by gastrojejunostomy or gastroduodenos-tomy and often an additional jejunojejunostomy willresolve both intestinal and bile obstruction in mostcases. Antimicrobial therapy is required in thesecases because feed material and bacteria can befound in the bile duct. Initial reports suggestedthat having CH decreased prognosis in these casesbut a recent report did not conrm that. 64If the obstruction is at the opening of the common bileduct, a hepaticojejunoscopy as rst described byOrsini and Donawick 42will be needed in addition to the intestinal bypass surgery. Even with success-ful corrections of obstructions just distal to the hepa-topancreatic ampulla, continued bile reflux into thestomach may cause chronic gastric ulcers and less-than-favorable growth in some affected foals. Itmay be difcult to determine the extent of CH in thefoals prior to surgery because GGT is often only mod-estly increased. With hepatic duct obstruction, GGTand direct bilirubin are more markedly elevated.Barium studies may show barium entering the biliarytree if the obstruction is distal to the opening. An additional and recently reported cause of cholangiohepatitis occurred in a suckling foal asso-ciated 312-month-old foal was treated with minocycline and seemed to recover. 2. Infectious Causes of Nonobstructive Liver Disease and Failure Tyzzer's Disease There are several infectious diseases of foals that may result in liver failure, Tyzzer's disease (Clos-tridium piliforme) being the most reported and bestdescribed. 66Listeria monocytogenes has been re- ported as causing similar ndings to Tyzzer's dis-ease young foals. 36,67All of these have a concurrent bacteremia/ septicemia. In adult horses, other than previouslydiscussed bacterial cholangitis, infectious causes ofsevere liver disease or failure include viral hepatitisand infectious necrotic hepatitis (Black disease orClostridium noyvi). 68 Tyzzer's disease, a cause of acute and generally fatal hepatitis and bacteremia in 5-36-day-old foalsis caused by Clostridium piliforme. Clostridium pl- liforme is thought to be common in the environment but given that it is difcult to culture, little is knownregarding the epidemiology and pathogenesis of thedisease. Dr. Swerczek, at the University of Ken-tucky who rst reported the disease in the UnitedStates in foals in 1973, has recently authored anexcellent retrospective study on 148 cases of thedisease. 66The average age of foals at death in that study was 20 days and there was not believed to bea breed or sex predisposition. Relative risk of dis-ease seems to be greater in the later months of thefoaling season and one could speculate that, similartoRhodococcus equi, shedding by both mares and healthy foals increase environmental contaminationas the foaling season progresses. Foals normallyconsume freshly deposited feces from their dam fromd a y2t o3 5 66and the mare's feces may serve as the source of infection for the foal.66Affected foals are generally well fleshed at the time of illness, and anincrease in protein and carbohydrate diets fed to themare and foal has been suggested as possibly affect- ing the intestinal microbiome, permitting overgrowthof the C. piliforme bacteria and predisposing the foal to clinical disease. 66The disease is generally sporadic both on and between farms and of low overall inci-dence, likely less than 0.1% of foals per year. Mul- tiple cases have been reported on some farms andincreased environmental contamination and bacte-rial colonization of the mares leading to increasedfecal-oral transmission is possible. 66One of the more interesting Tyzzer's case scenarios was de-scribed to me by Dr. Tennant: A draft mare withtwins had one foal that died from conrmed Tyzzer'sdisease after being admitted to the hospital andwhile the mare and other live foal were waiting to gohome, the second foal developed fever and hepatitisand was treated successfully with antibiotics forsuspected Tyzzer's disease. Affected foals, espe-cially younger ones, are often found dead in thepasture without prior clinical signs being observed.Clinical signs are acute in onset and include signs ofboth septic shock and liver failure, including fever,weakness, tachycardia, icterus, recumbency, sei-zure, and coma. Laboratory ndings are also sug-gestive of septic shock and liver failure, includingleukopenia, toxic changes in neutrophils, hypoglyce- 74 abnormalelevations in both unconjugated and conjugated bil-irubin, with unconjugated usually comprising thegreatest increase. Rarely is treatment successful.The rst published case report of successful treat-ment of suspected Tyzzer's disease, using fluid ther-apy, penicillin, and sulfa was only Tyzz- (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] posi-tive on liver biopsy) successfully treated occurred ina foal treated at University of California Davis withampicillin, gentamicin, fluids, and nutritional sup-port. 70The diagnosis of Tyzzer's is usually made by clinical ndings and autopsy observation of wide-spread multifocal hepatic necrosis with the intracel-lular lamentous bacteria. Enteritis carditismay also occur with Tyzzer's disease as the organ-ism can commonly be found in those tissues atautopsy. Theiler's Disease Theiler's disease has been the most baffling equineliver disease of the last century. In November1914, a condition of \"acute liver atrophy\" was recog-nized and reported for the rst time in horses inSouth Africa. 71Affected horses were being used for African horse sickness immunization experimentsperformed by Dr. Arnold Theiler. bImmunization consisted of simultaneously inoculating horsesboth with serum from recovered horses and liveAfrican horse sickness virus. One thousand onehundred forty eight horses were passively immu-nized against African horse sickness; the total num-ber of cases of acute liver failure was 27, includingve recoveries. The disease was observed in fourhorses that never received any inoculations, whichis the earliest scientic suggestion that the diseasewe now know as Theiler's disease could be bothinfectious and contagious. Theiler also provided a summary of the results of immunization of horses belonging to farmers ineight different South African districts between Oc-tober 1916 and January 1917. 71Of 1154 horses inoculated, 210 were reported to have died of acuteliver failure but, again, seven cases were believed tohave occurred in nonimmunized horses. The prin-cipal pathologic changes that Theiler described areclassic for our current pathologic description of Thei-ler's disease, also known as acute hepatitis or serumhepatitis. The liver is reduced in size, the edges are sharp and flattened, and its consistency is usuallyrm. On microscopic examination, the liver cellswere seen to have undergone necrosis. Emigrationof round cells and regeneration of bile ducts areadditional commonly identied features. In rarecases, the blood of dying horses showed distinct he-molysis and hemoglobinuria. This is likely the ear-liest report of hemolysis occurring in horses withliver failure, a nding that Dr. Tennant in 1972 also reported on in a U.S. horse with hepatic failure. 72 Theiler described the clinical course of the disease as a very rapid one, usually approximately 24 hours.Sometimes it lasted less than 6 hours whereas otherfatal cases lasted up to 3 days. Recovery was ob-served to occur in a minimum of 4 days. There wasno fever present. The onset of clinical signs wasperacute and characterized by violent neurologicsigns in most instances. If the horse was noted tobe semi-conscious, it was often standing in the sta-ble with its head hanging in a corner and refusingfood. The gait was slightly swaying or staggering.In the more violent cases the symptoms increasedrapidly in intensity or were present from the veryonset. Horses were noted to push their heads vio-lently forward against a wall and in so doing as-sumed all possible positions, resulting in bruisingand laceration of the skin of the head and point ofthe shoulders. These violent symptoms were fol-lowed by partial or complete coma. In the somno-lent or semi-conscious stage, the eyes were staring,the horse apathetic toward its surroundings, withtwitching of the lips, chomping of the teeth, opistho-tonus, kicking at the abdomen, and yawning noted.Despite Dr. Arnold Theiler's brilliant work, no de-termination as to the cause of the serum inoculation-related acute hepatic necrosis could be made. 71 Since Theiler's observations, clinically similar ill- nesses have been described in many parts of theworld. Most reported cases have been observed 1 to3 months after horses have been treated with serumor plasma products produced in other horses. Therst reported cases of acute equine hepatitis associ-ated with equine biologic administration in theUnited States occurred during the pandemic of west-ern equine encephalomyelitis that rst was ob-served in 1930 in California 73and then spread rapidly throughout the western states. Madsen74 and Marsh75,76described a second wave of disease (hepatitis) that occurred 2 to 3 months followinginitial outbreaks of western equine encephalomyeli-tis and use of the prophylactic serum treatment.Since these outbreak reports, hepatitis following theadministration of equine plasma or serum has beendescribed in horses from around the world and casesundoubtedly occur in the United States every year.Acute hepatitis has been reported following treat-ment with a variety of equine serum products identical clinical, pathologic laboratoryndings, and disease have also been re-ported in which equine biologicals were not admin-istered. 95Regardless, most reported cases of Theiler's disease have been associated with the pro-phylactic or therapeutic use of serum or plasma AAEP PROCEEDINGS 61 /H114082015 75FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREproducts of equine origin and it would seem that products containing pooled serum/plasma from mul-tiple donors may have a higher risk of causing dis-ease than products produced from a single donor.The overall risk of Theiler's disease and acute he-patic failure in association with equine blood prod-uct inoculation is not known given that many caseslikely go unreported. We know of at least six con-rmed cases that occurred in 2014, all associatedwith the administration of tetanus antioxin. It isalso likely that some horses may have less fulminantand even subclinical liver disease following admin-istration of certain blood products or specic lotnumbers of those products. An etiology similar tothat of viral hepatitis B or C in humans has beensuspected to be the cause of Theiler's disease be-cause of the similarities between low incidence ofclinical disease in inoculated humans and horsesand the long incubation period following inoculationof blood products. 96,97The long period (generally 45-60 days) between inoculation of blood and onsetof clinical disease in humans is known to be associ-ated with the slow increase in serum antibody,which is followed by a rather sudden attempt toclear virus from infected hepatocytes. 96,97 To summarize information available on equine acute hepatitis/Theiler's disease, there seem to bethree separate epidemiologic diseases with identicalclinical, clinical pathologic, and autopsy ndings:1) acute, often fulminant hepatitis in adult horsesthat have received equine origin blood products ap-proximately 4-10 weeks earlier and less fulminantor subclinical disease in some other horses receivingthe same product; 2) acute, sometimes fulminant,hepatitis occurring in an adult horse that was incontact with a blood product-inoculated Theiler'sdiseased horse but did not itself receive the equineorigin blood product; and 3) acute fulminant hepa-titis in adult horses, often broodmares on pasture,with no known blood product administration. Thisthird syndrome is sometimes associated with farmoutbreaks involving a few horses over a 2-6-weekperiod and is most common in the autumn season.Two farms that Dr. Tennant and I have investigatedhad more than one outbreak with several years inbetween outbreaks. The classic Theiler's disease,with a history of blood product administration 4-10weeks prior to acute liver failure, might be morecommon in the spring but that might be associatedwith foals and mares receiving tetanus antitoxinfollowing foaling. In a review of our last 14 cases ofTheiler's disease at Cornell, only four cases wereconrmed to be associated with TAT administrationand one was associated with commercial plasma.Although the overall incidence of Theiler's disease inadult horses receiving TAT is low, tetanus antitoxinhas for the past 40 years been the most commonblood product associated with the disease in theUnited States. Theiler's disease may be more com-monly associated with TAT administration thanequine plasma because of either the more frequentadministration of TAT or because TAT is producedas a pooled product while commercial units of nor-mal plasma are most often collected from a singledonor. A small number of cases have occurred fol-lowing intravenous commercial plasma administra-tion and one case that I know of occurred followingintrauterine plasma administration. From per-sonal research experience, Theiler's disease was pro-duced in a failed Lyme disease project of ours in1986 when Borrelia burdorferi was mixed with 4-8 mL of commercially purchased serum, which wasthen administered subcutaneously to adult poniesand then 6 and 7 weeks later two ponies developedTheiler's disease and died; there was no indicationthat Borrelia itself caused the disease. The clinical disease (acute hepatitis, Theiler's dis- ease, serum hepatitis) is characterized by fulmi-nant acute encephalopa-thy including cortical blindness. As previouslymentioned, neurologic signs may range from mild tosevere depression or coma to severe maniacal behav-ior and seizure. The discolored urine (bilirubin-uria) that is typically seen in horses with hepaticfailure will have green-colored bubbles when shakenand this could serve as a point of care test to sepa-rate liver failure and HE from other causes of en-cephalopathy and from encephalitides. In somesevere cases of Theiler's disease and in liver failureof other causes, hemolysis and hemoglobinuria maybe found and is a poor prognostic nding in myexperience. The cause of the hemolysis is unknownbut may be due to physical damage to the red bloodcells passing through the sinusoids of the diseasedliver, oxidative damage resulting from liver failure,or release of large amounts of copper or iron from thediseased liver. Some horses may have photosensi-tivity and abdominal pain. Laboratory ndings in Theiler's disease are typi- cal of acute severe liver disease predominantly af-fecting hepatocellular function and include markedelevations in serum hepatocellular enzymes affected horses The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) often isnearly 2000 IU/L; greater than 4000 IU/L seems tobe associated with a poor prognosis. In the last 14Theiler's cases diagnosed at our hospital the meanAST was 2545 (1116-5267). There are alsomarked elevations in SDH and GLDH and a markeddecline in those enzymes after 2 or 3 days of treat-ment may suggest a favorable prognosis if there isimprovement in clinical signs as well. There is amoderate increase in biliary-derived enzymes withGGT usually increased to 100 and 300 IU/L (mean,197). Horses that are recovering from the disease(improved clinical signs and decreases in SDH andGLDH values) may still have some further mildincrease GGT. This should not be interpreted as abad prognostic nding as the continued elevation inGGT is likely related to bile duct hyperplasia and /H11408Vol. 61 STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREthe liver com-prising less than 20% of the total. Prolongation ofPT and PTT are almost always present, and a smallnumber of the horses have thrombocytopenia, likelyindicating disseminated intravascular coagulation.Bile acids, anion gap, and lactate almost alwaysnoticeably increased. Blood glucose is frequently inthe 140-170-mg/dL range and no horse in our last14 cases was hypoglycemic. Ammonia concentra-tion in our last 14 cases has ranged from 91 to 495mmol/L (normal, /H1102190 mmol/L). Signalment and history are important in the di- agnosis of Theiler's disease: Any adult horse withclinical signs of acute fulminant hepatic failure thathas received serum (especially TAT) or plasma ap-proximately 4-10 weeks earlier would likely haveTheiler's disease as the top differential. If thehorse has appropriate signs and laboratory ndingsof Theiler's disease but no history of recent bloodproduct administration and there is no suspicioustoxic cause for the hepatic failure then nonbiologicorigin acute hepatitis should be considered. Ultra-sound examination of the liver in horses with Thei-ler's disease may seem unremarkable other than theliver is sometimes hard to image due to its smallsize; if the liver is seen it may seem hypoechoic.I generally do not perform a liver biopsy on a horsewith \"classic\" Theiler's disease as the utility of aliver biopsy is marginal because histologic data willnot change therapy. Unfortunately, in many casesa diagnosis is often made at necropsy where the liveris almost always smaller than normal (Fig. 6).Measurement of liver weight in comparison withbody weight (BW) in our last 13 cases of Theiler'sdisease found that the liver in Theiler's diseasehorses was 1.0% of BW and normal controls were1.6% of BW, suggesting a 40% decrease in hepaticsize following disease. Affected livers show severecentrilobular or massive liver necrosis/apopto-sis, 77,84-86with portal areas often less severely af- fected but a mononuclear reported in horses with Theiler's disease 77,86 and was found in three of 12 of our most recentnecropsy cases at Cornell (Sean McDonough, per-sonal communication). Alzheimer type II astro-cytes are present in the brain in virtually all thecases. Treatment focuses on treating HE when present or preventing it from occurring (HE treatment, page92), along with supportive care including fluids, nu-tritional support (page 95), antioxidant treatments,anti-inflammatory and antibiotic treatments. Pen-toxifylline, 7.5 mg/kg by mouth (PO) or IV (com-pounded), two or three times daily, may be helpful indecreasing systemic inflammation, which undoubt-edly occurs with Theiler's disease. A bactericidalantibiotic (e.g., ceftiofur) should be administered inall cases of acute liver failure to inhibit bacterialtranslocation (gut to blood). Bacterial transloca-tion is of increased risk in acute fulminant liverdisease because of loss of Kupffer cell numbers andfunction, in addition to the potential for increased intestinal permeability resulting from ischemia andcongestion of the intestine. Acetylcysteine has beenproposed as an antioxidant treatment for acute fulmi-nant liver failure in humans. 98Acetylcysteine is best known as the specic treatment for acetaminophentoxicity but as a potential glutathione donor and anti-oxidant, it could have value in treating other acute fulminant liver diseases. I have administered thesterile acetylcysteine solution marketed for nebuli-zation by slow intravenous administration to100 mg/kg) by mixing in 5% dextrose. A prepara-tion labeled for intravenous use in humans is notavailable in the United States and the sterile nebu-lization product is used in human hospitals. Horses with Theiler's disease have a guarded to poor prognosis if there is fulminant HE. Horsesthat continue to eat for 3 days and have supportivetreatments may then make a quick recovery. Myexperience is that horses with Theiler's disease areusually either dead or \"on their road to recovery\"within 3-5 days. There are no proven long-termconsequences in horses that recover. Newly Discovered Equine Hepatitis Viruses Recently, three distinct equine hepatitis viruseshave been discovered in horses: nonprimate hepa- Fig. 6. Livers from two horses of similar body weight, normalliver on left and shrunken Theiler's disease liver on the right. AAEP (EPgV), which are all close Flaviviridae family relatives of human hepatitis C viruses (HCV). 99-101 The horse seems to be unique among our domesticanimal for harboring these so-called \"hepatitis vi-ruses.\" 102The recent discovery of these equine hepatitis viruses is directly related to the use of thenewer technology involving nucleic acid deep se-quencing of samples. Unknown nucleotides arethen reassembled using de novo computerized se-quencing to identify new agents. One of the prob-lems with this technology, for us as clinicians, is thatnding new and infectious agents may not be clini-cally important. NPHV was the rst of the three new blood borne viruses to be reported. 99NPHV was found in pooled equine serum and in the serum of eight of 103normal horses (7.8%), of which 35% were NPHV-antibody positive; samples tested were those sub-mitted for equine infectious anemia (EIA) testing atCornell, and it was therefore assumed that horseswere healthy. Since that description in the UnitedStates, NPHV viremia has been reported in three of142 horses (2.1%) in Great Britain and in seven of210 horses (3.3%) from Germany. 103,104Multiple NPHV infections have also been reported in Japanand Brazil. 105,106Similar incidence of NPHV infec- tion in clinically healthy horses is found in France(Stephane Pronost, personal communication). Cur-rently, accumulated data from Europe, North Amer-ica, and Asia suggests that nearly 40% of all adulthorses are seropositive, prevalence of active infec-tion is 4% and approximately one fth of those 4%are chronic carriers. 103-105No infections from ei- ther of these three new viruses (NPHV, TDAV,EPgV) have been found in mules or don-keys. NPHV is a member of the Hepacivirus genusin which human HCV are the prototype membersand of the three new viruses found in horses, NPHVis most closely related genetically to HCV. NPHVhas also been found commonly in bats, rodents, andOld World moneys and it is the only one of the threerecently discovered horse hepatitis viruses known tobe hepatotropic in the horse. 102,107As regards clin- ical importance, the testing of a somewhat randomassortment of naturally infected horses has sug-gested that there is little documented associationbetween NPHV infection and clinical hepatic dis-ease in those horses. 103,108In NPHV experimen- tally infected horses there is mild diseasedocumented by elevations in liver enzymes and lym-phocytic portal inflammation and piecemeal hepato-cyte necrosis. 107,109The elevations seem to occur shortly after development of measureable antibod-ies, suggesting that antibody-mediated activity re-lated to the virus could cause some disease. Whensevere combined immunodecient foals were exper-imentally infected, 109they produced no antibody and there was no increase in GGT, further support-ing an immune response to the infection and asso-ciation with disease. 109The only report of clinical disease associated with NPHV infection is a casereport from Europe of Theiler's disease with thehorse having high levels of NPHV viremia and asthe viremia diminished the horse recovered. 110 Although our data set is small, horses that arechronically infected with NPHV do not seem to de-velop clinical disease. We have one horse at Cor-nell that has retrospectively from frozen and storedsamples been infected for 10 years (thanks to Dr.Doug Antczak for storing serum for such a longtime). This horse has no elevations in liver en-zymes and a liver biopsy obtained after at least 9years of infection was normal. Most horses infectedwith NPHV seem to have relatively slow develop-ment of NPHV specic antibody (approximately 6-8weeks) 107,109followed by viral clearance in the fol- lowing months. In 2014, with the collaboration ofscientists at both Rockefeller and Columbia Univer-sities, we were able to successfully infect a seroneg-ative horse with infectious clones of NPHV, yieldinghigh RNA titers in the serum and liver of the horseand establishing the molecular components of afunctional NPHV genome; cell culture of HCV likeviruses is extremely requiring the use ofinfectious clones for inoculation. Delayed serocon-version, slightly elevated circulating liver enzymes,and mild hepatitis was observed, followed by viralclearance. Hepatotropism was conrmed by levelof viremia in the liver and by nding negative-strand RNA in the liver, a hallmark of viralreplication. 107 In August 2011 we were asked to consult on an outbreak of acute hepatitis in horses.110Two and a half months earlier four horses from the affectedfarm had developed botulism caused by ingestion oftoxin-contaminated hay. Twenty-two horses eat-ing that hay had been treated, either therapeuticallyor prophylactically, with Clostridium botulinum an- titoxin (equine origin). Seven of 17 horses treatedwith one particular lot of botulinum antitoxin devel-oped clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hepati-tis 6-8 weeks later. Hepatitis was not observed inve horses that were treated with a separate lot ofbotulinum antitoxin produced from different horsesor in 53 farm horses that had not received antitoxin. Using high-throughput pyrosequencing, a new vi- rus belonging to the family Flaviviridae (the familyof human HCV) was identied in the serum of twoclinical cases of acute hepatitis/Theiler's disease andin the botulinum antitoxin the horses received 47and 52 days prior to the onset of illness. The nu-cleic acid sequences of the viruses in the two hepa-titis cases and in the botulinal antitoxin werevirtually identical. The virus was named Theiler'sDisease-Associated Virus (TDAV). 100A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)then was used to test the serum of horses for thenewly discovered equine hepatitis-associated virus(TDAV). All 17 of the horses that received the in-criminated lot of botulinum antitoxin tested positive 78 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREfor the new virus, including the seven horses with acute hepatitis. One of the donor horses that pro-duced the antitoxin was positive. Serum from allother horses was RT-PCR negative for the virus.Follow-up testing 6 months later demonstrated thatthe donor horse had cleared the virus and the prod-uct was again widely used with no other cases ofacute hepatitis being reported, further supportingthe association between the virus and disease.The original 17 TDAV-positive horses were retestedafter 1 year by qRT-PCR and TDAV was undetect-able in 13 of the previously infected horses. How-ever, in four horses, persistent TDAV viremia wasdemonstrated. 100A large portion of the horses from the index farm have been retested since theoutbreak and no additional horses have become PCRpositive, suggesting direct horse-to-horse transmis-sion or transmission by insect vectors may not occuror is not common. This work would not have beenpossible except for the excellent collaboration of theattending veterinarian, Dr. Anita VanBlaricum,who recognized the disease syndrome and providedappropriate samples for testing. Her keen observa-tions have persisted; she found that three of theclinically affected horses with liver disease went onto have colon displacements weeks after the hepati-tis. Is it possible the liver disease affected colonmotility or caused a mild anatomical shift predispos-ing those horses to right displacements? Follow-up studies since 2012 nd that TDAV seems to be a relatively rare virus in the UnitedStates horse population and it has not been found inhorses in the United Kingdom and France or in anyother species so far. 103Interestingly, blood product- associated Theiler's disease has not been reported inFrance and United Kingdom for four decades. On thefour separate premises in North America where wehave found the TDAV virus, there are some historicallinks to Theiler's disease, but no current cases werediscovered on three of those premises. Thanks toDrs. Laurie Beard, Phillip Johnson, Kara Lascola, Be-atrice Sponseller, and other referring veterinarians,we have been able to test serum and/or livers from sixhorses with fulminant acute hepatic necrosis (Theiler'sDisease) that had 4-10 weeks earlier received tetanusantitoxin and were unable to nd TDAV virus. It is,therefore, likely that TDAV might cause a milder yetclinical form of Theiler's disease but another virus thatwe are investigating may be responsible for the fulmi-nant form of the disease. The most recent of the new equine blood-borne equine flaviviruses was reported by Kapoor et al and has been named the Equine Pegivirus (EPgV).103 EPgV and TDAV are both members of the Pegivirusgenus but are genetically distinct. Pegiviruses, al-though a common infection in humans and otherspecies, are not known to cause clinical disease inother species. Three of the original 12 EPgV in-fected horses from Alabama were reported to havehad elevated liver enzymes but were not clinicallyill. 101qRT-PCR testing of both lymph node biopsyand liver biopsy tissue from infected horses failed todemonstrate hepatotropism of the virus. 101Two of the horses were shown to be carriers of EPgV for atleast 3.5 years. Nine liver samples obtained fromrandom equine necropsies in California were testedfor EPgV and one was positive. 101Although there is little data to support an association betweenNPHV or EPgV infections and clinical equine liverdisease at this time, this possibility cannot be ruledout. 103Although all three viruses (NPHV, TDAV, and EPgV) are believed to be transmitted by blood,the high seroprevalence of both NPHV and EPgVsuggest there must be modes of transmission otherthan plasma and antitoxin inoculations. The roleof and importance of co-infection in disease isunknown. Hepatic Abscesses Hepatic abscesses are rare in horses and, when pres-ent, usually cause weight loss, fever, and laboratorysigns of inflammation rather than indications ofliver disease or failure. Corynebacterium pseudo- tuberculosis andStreptococcus spp. are listed as the most common organisms associated with bacteremicabscess formation in adult horses and Rhodococcus equi and Streptococcus spp. abscesses being most common in growing foals. 29 Parasitic causes of liver failure are extremely rare, but parasitic infections may cause focal gran-ulomas. 111,112Heterobilharzia americana causes a remarkable starry sky image of the liver on ultra-sound exam, but horses have no signs of liverdisease. 111Cystic lesions can be caused by Echino- coccosis granulosus, but they are generally an inci-dental nding at necropsy; in the United States theyare mostly in imported horses. Parascaris equo- rum andStrongyle spp. migration through the liver can cause hemorrhagic and focal necrosisand eosinophilic granulomas, but are not expected tocause dysfunction, although secondary abscessescould occur. 112 Infectious necrotic hepatitis (Clostridium noyvi or Black disease) has been described in horses,68,113but rather than causing signs and laboratory ndings ofliver failure, ndings are mostly the result of peritoni-tis and a systemic inflammatory response. Ultra-sound of a liver with abscessation or necrosis as occurswith Black disease would likely show an inconsistentappearance in different locations of the liver. Gasechoes may be seen with Black disease or abscessescontaining other anaerobic organisms. Parasite mi-gration (flukes) are a of livernecrosis in ruminants an anaerobic environ-ment conducive for proliferation of clostridial spores,but in horses this link is not common. 3. Toxic Hepatopathies Pyrrolizidine Alkaloid Toxicity Toxic causes of liver disease and liver failure are relatively common in horses and most are associated AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 79FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREwith is doubt that pyr- rolizidine alkaloid (PA)-containing plants are themost common plants, worldwide, causing toxic liverfailure in horses. There is a long list of PA-containing plants, but (Patterson's curse) are some the more common species reported as causing hepatotoxicityin horses in North America. 114Recent reported outbreaks of Crotalaria species hepatotoxicity in horses have mostly been from Brazil and Austra-lia. 115The incidence of Crotolaria toxicosis in the southeastern, central, and mid-Atlantic states, ar-eas where the plant is found, seems low in compar-ison with toxicity from other PA-containing plantsfound in the western United States and parts ofCanada. All parts of PA-containing plants, fresh ordried, are toxic but toxin concentrations may varyduring the course of the growing season and for theperennial Senecio jacobaea and many other PA- containing plants, toxin concentration is highestduring budding and flowering; the onset of floweringheralds the period of greatest risk for toxicity forthose plants. 116Threadleaf groundsel is an ever- green and maintains foliage throughout the year.ForCrotolaria, the seeds are most toxic. 116Most PA-containing plants have a bitter taste and, there-fore, variable palatability. Hepatotoxicity fromplant ingestion is usually associated with chronicfeeding of contaminated hay but with drought con-ditions and sparse grasses these same toxic plantswill be consumed in the pasture. The liver is important in both toxic pyrroles for- mation and in detoxication of PAs. The parentPAs in the plants are relatively unreactive but whenmetabolized by the horse can produce highly toxicpyrroles. 114Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are absorbed and metabolized in the hepatocytes, especially in thezone 3 region with more acute intoxication, wherehepatocytes with the highest level of drug-metabolizing enzymes are located. 7PAs are dehy- drogenated to yield pyrroles which cross-link DNAand cell division and hence 7Another important liver may eventually become small andbrotic. 115Horses that ingest large amounts of PA plants over a few days, usually in contaminatedalfalfa hay, may die from subacute liver disease andhepatic lesions in these cases might have diffusecentrilobular necrosis 118and, unless megalocytesare observed, lesions could look similar to Theiler'sdisease pathology. Megalocytes may not be seen inthe liver on microscopic exam until 30 days or moreafter exposure to the PA. 119 The effect of PA toxins on the liver is cumulative and it is estimated that horses must ingest approx-imately 2% or more of their body weight to develophepatic failure. 119In many instances, by the time clinical signs develop weeks or months later, con-taminated hay is often long gone from the property.If conrmation of the diagnosis cannot be made byinvestigation of the feeds or from histopathology ofthe liver, chromatography/mass spectrometry test-ing of frozen liver could be performed to detect py-rollic metabolites. 119Although the disease is chronic, acute onset of neurologic signs (HE) is acommon presentation and onset may be precipitatedby a number of stressors. Weight loss, diminishedappetite, jaundice, and photosensitization can beearly clinical ndings, followed by acute onset ofneurologic signs due to hepatic encephalopathy.Weight loss and decline in appetite often go unde-tected in many cases. Laryngeal paralysis and gas-tric impaction also occur in a small percentage ofaffected horses. 120-122 Horses with PA-induced hepatic failure have a guarded-to-poor prognosis due to the extensive bro-sis that occurs in most cases prior to the develop-ment of any clinical signs. Treatments for hepaticencephalopathy (page 92), antioxidant therapy withvitamin E, S-adenosyl methionine milkthistle extract, anti-inflammatory/anti-brosistreatment with pentoxifylline, supportive care withfluid therapy, and nutritional management provid-ing a high-energy and adequate-protein diet (page95) are, to my knowledge, the most frequent treat-ments provided to horses with PA toxicity and liverfailure. There is minimal proof of efcacy for thosetreatments in affected horses but most of the treat-ments seem reasonable based upon pathophysiologyof the disease. The addition of dietary supplementsof cysteine, butylated hydroxyanisole, 200 micro-grams of vitamin B 12/kg of feed, and 5 mg of folic acid/kg of feed did not alter toxicity in ponies fedtansy ragwort. 123A recent study in rats found that administration of SAMe and vitamin E adminis-tered before and after monocrotoline pyrrole expo-sure and efcacy studies onSAMe are not available in horses and bioavailablityof silymarin in horses may be less than 1%. 125 When the above treatments are administered rela-tively early in the course of the disease, and with adose of luck, a moderate percentage of clinicallyaffected horses (including even a few with signs ofHE), will have transient resolution of clinical signsand survive for several months or have completerecovery. 126,127I suspect that earlier detection of disease, increased antioxidant therapies, and betternutritional management including provision of 80 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREmild-to-moderate-protein diet might have improved the prognosis since my internship year in Californiain the mid-1970s when the outcome of treatmentwas generally poor. One of the more favorable out-comes I know of was from cases that Dr. KarenUnger managed in 2013. Although some horsesdied from PA toxicity, four horses with persistentand marked increases in AST, GGT, and bile acids(up to 108 /H9262mol/L) for 3-4 weeks survived and ap- peared clinically normal 3 years later. Serum bileacid concentrations greater than 50 umol/L gener-ally indicate a poor prognosis for long-term life. 118 When a case of PA toxicity is conrmed or suspectedon a farm, measurement of GGT in other horses onthe farm is a sensitive, although not 100% sensitive,test to detect subclinical cases. 16GGT testing of horses potentially exposed to plant or environmentalhepatotoxins, such as alsike clover, Panicum most common pasture-associated hepatotoxic-ities seen in some areas of the northeastern UnitedStates and in some provinces of Canada (Ontario,Que \u00b4bec, Alberta); it is also seen in Europe. 128-130 Much of the original description of the disease camefrom outbreaks of hepatic failure in horses in On-tario where the disease was called \"big liver dis-ease.\" 128The disease most often occurs when horses graze pastures or are fed hay containinglarge amounts of alsike clover. An increased inci-dence of poisoning is reported during wet seasonswhen the clover grows luxuriantly on heavy claysoil. Two presentations of the disease have beendescribed. 128The rst is dermatitis-stomatitis, previously referred to as trifoliosis or clover disease. The second presentation of the disease, believed tobe associated with more long-term consumption ofthe plant, is hepatic dysfunction, characterized byicterus, colic, and nervous system signs. It remainsunproven whether photosensitivity without signs ofliver failure is really a primary photosensitivity orwhether it is secondary to biliary disease that per-mits phylloerythrin accumulation without othersigns of liver failure. We have found marked ele-vations in GGT in exposed, asymptomatic, horsesgrazing elds of alsike clover that might support thelatter suggestion. The liver of horses that die fromthe disease may be noticeably enlarged withrounded edges, sometimes weighing 5% of bodyweight or 25 kg in a 500-kg horse. Other cases mayhave normal or even smaller-than-normal livers ifthere is extensive brosis. Characteristically thereis little inflammation in the liver and the paren-chyma is mostly intact except where it collapses byexpanding brosis. Bile duct proliferation and -brosis, most severe in the portal areas, is found in allcases but these two ndings are common to severalother toxins including PA toxicity (however, PA tox-icity and most other hepatotoxins will cause moresevere parenchymal disease). Both biliary andhepatocellular enzymes are increased in horses withalsike clover-associated liver failure, as are serumbile acids and direct and indirect bilirubin. Despitethe consistent and often severe portal bile duct pro-liferation and brosis there is little evidence of bilestasis, which helps explain why this, a predominantbiliary disease, may not have the typical high per-cent of conjugated bilirubin in the serum that isexpected with an obstructive biliary diseases. In-terestingly, we have found that horses exposed tothe same alsike clover elds as horses exhibitingliver failure, have elevations inGGT with normal SDH, suggesting that the diseasebegins as a predominant biliary toxicity. The toxic principle in alsike clover has yet to be identied. It is not known whether the agent is atoxic metabolite from the plant itself or a mycotoxinproduced by a fungus (Cymodothea trifolii) living onthe plant. 131We have noticed a pattern where no cases will occur for many years followed by severalcases occurring in other years, suggesting that thetoxicity may be related to a mycotoxin that maygrow best on the alsike clover under certain climaticconditions. Treatment would be the same as for PAtoxicity except the antibrotic drug colchicine (0.03mg/kg PO once daily) could be used and might havesome additional benet in inhibiting brosis. Panicum Toxicity Three different Panicum sp. (panic grasses) have been found to cause outbreaks of liver failure inhorses. The rst outbreak 132involved Panicum coloratum (kleingrass), a species introduced to Texas in 1952 from Kimberly, Union of South Africa,and subsequently widely planted in the state. Thesecond involved Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), and occurred in eastern Nebraska. 133In the au- tumn of 2004, Dr. Melinda Freckleton discovered 14horses in a single stable in Virginia that were clin-ically affected with liver disease, some with failureresulting in death, shortly after being fed a newshipment of hay. 134We had, anecdotally, on two other prior occurrences (1 and 3 years earlier), re-ceived information on outbreaks of hepatotoxicosisin horses in the mid-Atlantic area and had becomesuspicious of fall panicum toxicity based upon lim-ited testing of the hay from those prior outbreaksbut were unable to acquire a sufcient volume of thepresumed toxic hay for a feeding trial. Thanks toDr. Freckleton's efforts, we were nally able to ob-tain hay from the third outbreak, conducted a feed-ing trial, and conrmed the hepatotoxicity ofPanicum dichotomiflorum (fall Panicum). The on- set of severe hepatotoxicosis after fall Panicum hay exposure was rapid (1-2 weeks) in both the natu-rally occurring cases and in the experimentalhorses. Horses with Panicum coloratum hepato- toxicosis had either prolonged grazing on the klein-grass pasture or were fed hay for 150 days beforeshowing signs of liver failure. 132Hepatic pathology AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 81FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREin the experimental horses fed fall Panicum was similar to that seen in horses with spontaneous dis- ease: individual hepatocyte necrosis, interpretedas apoptosis, was apparent. The accumulationof lipofuscin suggested some degree of oxidativestress. Experimental horses also had increases increatine kinase and cardiac troponin I, suggestingconcurrent hepatic, Similar clover, the epidemiologyand specic toxicity associated with panicumgrasses is unclear given that many horses may begrazed or fed hay containing panicum withoutknown toxicosis. Potential plant factors includestrain variation, stage of growth during cutting, orvariation in saponin concentrations. 135Environ- mental variables such as soil composition, weatherconditions, or fungal contamination, also may play arole. For the three panicum toxicity outbreaks thatwe have investigated, all occurred in late fall orearly winter when horses were fed fall Panicum hay harvested during the same year. The toxic princi-ple of fall Panicum is unknown. A synergy between plant saponins and other hepatotoxins, particularlymycotoxins, might explain the sporadic incidence ofhepatic disease. The absence of brosis in the re-search animals suggests that immediate cessation offeeding toxic fall Panicum hay should allow most animals to recover from acute exposure. Medicaltreatment and nutritional management would be asfor PA toxicity. There are many other plant-in-duced hepatopathies in other areas of the world thattime and space do not permit me to review. Mycotoxins Feeding horses grains that are sufciently contam-inated with Fusarium causes the classic disease, leukoencephalomalacia. The mycotoxin can alsocause a concurrent hepatopathy with marked eleva-tions in GGT, in and some other species, liver failure caused by aflatoxinsin horses is rare. It has been reported that thedifference in aflatoxin toxicity in the horse could berelated to in enzyme hepatic P450 S-transferase with the capacity to collapseGSH-conjugation and toxic aflatoxinproduct AFB1-8-9 epoxide. of aflatoxin B 1to ponies has produced vari- able responses, from no or minimal disease (elevatedliver enzymes but no clinical signs), to severe illnessand death. 139-141Prior exposure to the mycotoxin AFB1, which affects hepatic metabolism upon sub- sequent exposure, and duration of exposure beforestudies, may explain the different results. 142The target organ in horses, as in other animal species, isthe liver and horses suffering from aflatoxicosisshow signs of inappetence, depression, fever, tremor,ataxia, and cough. Necropsy liver with centrilobular necrosis, icterus,hemorrhage, tracheal exudates, and brown urine. 140 Iron Toxicity Iron is an absolute requirement for most forms of lifebut is a potentially toxic substance. The liver is themajor storage site for iron absorbed from the intes-tinal tract and it is a primary site for heme ironsequestration. When the capacity of the system tostore iron is exceeded, hemochromatosis may occur.Hemochromatosis is the excessive deposition of ironinto hepatocytes such that toxicity occurs. Hemo-siderosis is the term used to describe iron deposits inKupffer cells and hepatocytes without destruction ofliver parenchyma and is a common nding duringhistologic examination of the normal equine liver,much of which is due to phagocytosis of heme frombroken-down red blood cells. Both processes aremore commonly seen around the periportal region ofthe liver. 15Iron is a known hepatotoxin and horses are often exposed to high-iron diets yet poisoning ofadult horses with orally administered iron is rare.One explanation for this is that horses, as in mostother species, have the protective ability to decreaseiron absorption when body stores of iron are normalor high. 143For example, in one of our experimental equine motor neuron disease-induction trials,horses were fed a highly soluble ferrous fumarate at3-6 times the National Research Council (NRC) rec-ommendation for iron for 21-30 months withouthaving abnormal hepatic iron concentrations. 143 Pearson fed 50 mg/kg of ferrous sulfate to ponies for8 weeks (NRC requirement is 1-2 mg/kg serum iron, andpercent increased, clinical signs or histopathologic lesions inthe liver. 144He concluded that previous reports of hepatopathies in animals with hemosiderin accumu-lation might have represented another primary hep-atopathy with secondary hemosiderin accumulation,especially if the only source of iron is via oral feedconsumption. There are, however, individual case reports of iron overload associated (hemochromato- sis) and liver brosis in horses. 145,146Portal bro- sis and/or excessive iron in hepatocytes were afeature of the iron toxicity in those case reports.Antemortem diagnosis of iron hepatotoxicity is dif-cult because observing large amounts of iron in thediseased liver is not diagnostic. It is known thatlarge amounts of hemosiderin (hemosiderosis) is acommon histologic observation in the liver of horsesthat may occur independent of liver pathology. 15,147 In addition, using measurement of serum iron inhorses with liver disease as a determinant of causeshould not be relied on because horses with a varietyof other known causes of liver failure (both acuteand chronic) may have very high serum iron concen-trations and nearly 100% saturation, without /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREchromatosis. The reason for the high serum iron in those horses with liver failure is unknown but onepossible theory is that during severe liver diseaseiron might be released from the iron storage proteinand iron detoxicant, ferritin, or from the consider-able hemosiderin that seems to normally accumu-late in horse liver. In my experience, afterevaluating serum iron and saturation values inadult horses for more than 15 years, extremely highserum iron and nearly 100% saturation is most com-monly seen in adult horses with liver disease andmay be seen in up to 20% of horses with severe liverdisease. This does not apply to newborn foals, whonormally have very high serum iron for the rst fewdays of life. 148There is a recent abstract conclud- ing that horses drinking heavily iron-contaminatedwater (72.5 mg/L, or 150 times acceptable levels) fora prolonged period can result in hemochromatosisand liver failure. 149 Iron toxicity has been well documented in new- born foals. In the spring of 1983, more than 60foals died at 2-5 days of age in association with theadministration of a probiotic/nutritional supplementpaste containing only 64 mg of ferrous fumar-ate. 150,151Foals that died were always adminis- tered the product before nursing colostrum. Iron toxicity in these foals was likely related to the directpassage of iron to the liver in foals that had notreceived the antioxidant benets of colostrum.Foals were most commonly observed to be ill at 2days of age with variable degrees of icterus andneurological signs. 150Hypoglycemia was almost always present; this is common in foals with hepaticfailure and may reflect the relatively low glycogencontent of foals. Both total and conjugated biliru-bins lessthan 10% of total. Foals were severely acidotic,also characteristic of liver failure in foals. GGTand AST were moderately elevated in all foals and,amazingly, SDH was normal in 3- and 5-day-oldfoals, likely reflecting massive hepatic necrosis onday 1 and the very short half-life of SDH. Interest-ingly, a small amount of liver on the peripheryseemed normal, allowing some function to occur.This was believed to be a result of dilution of the irontoxin between the central area of the liver and mainentry point of the iron, the portal vein. Three sur-prising ndings were discovered from these unfor-tunate cases: bile ductule can berapid and pronounced in equine, Alzheimer typeII cells associated with hyperammonemia can de-velop in 48 hours or less, and detectable brosis maybe seen within 5 days. 13It was hard to fathom that 64 mg of ferrous fumarate would kill a newborn foalwhen 50 mg/kg could be given to adult ponies with-out evidence of liver disease (clinical, biochemical, ormicroscopic), but it did and we learned. All poten-tial toxins, even in small amounts, administered tofoals prior to colostrum consumption could be harm-ful and should be routinely avoided.Another less-well-understood hepatic failure pos- sibly associated with iron overload occurred in foals with neonatal isoerythrolysis that required oneor more blood transfusions. 152Affected foals may have progressive liver disease (increasing liver en-zymes) within days after they receive one or moretransfusions and these foals may exhibit liver fail-ure as soon as 5 days following transfusion or up to3 months later. Histologic lesions in the liver con-sist of hepatocellular necrosis with extensive biliaryproliferation. A greater number of transfusionsand lower packed cell volume (PCV) on hospitaladmission were risk factors for liver failure. Histo-logic ndings are similar to those seen in the new-born foals that received ferrous fumarate,suggesting that a combination of hepatic hypoxiaand iron overload from transfusions may havecaused the severe liver disease. It is unlikely thateither one alone would have caused the disease in somany foals. Regardless, liver failure is one of themost common complications seen in foals with ex-tremely low PCVs who have been transfused. Re-gardless of the etiology of liver failure in those foals,treatment with subcutaneous deferoxamine shouldbe considered because this drug increases ironelimination. 153 The liver is not only the key organ for iron homeo- stasis and storage but is also the main producer ofacute phase proteins. Acute phase proteins includethe iron-regulating protein hepcidin, serum amyloidA, and serum iron (a neg-ative phase reactant) is known to occur quickly inmany species following an acute inflammatory re-sponse and is believed to be an evolved method fordecreasing the iron available to invading bacteria.Except for a few bacteria exceptions such as mynemesis Borrelia spp., iron is the most important element required for bacterial growth. 154Dr. Alex- andre Borges, while on sabbatical at Cornell, dem-onstrated that low serum iron was a better predictorof systemic inflammation than plasma brinogen. 155 Hepcidin is known to be the key regulator of ironmetabolism that leads to hypoferremia during in-flammation. Dr. Borges was further able to cloneand sequence the equine hepcidin gene and performexpression analysis from different equine tissue. 156 That work has shown that equine hepcidin is pre-dominantly expressed in the liver of horses. Whenhorses were challenged with endotoxin, plasma ironconcentration was decreased signicantly from thepre-infusion level by 8 hours and relative real-timeRT-PCR analysis showed that liver hepcidin andIL-6 mRNA at 157The totality of Dr. Borges' work suggests that hepcidinacts as an acute-phase protein in horses, its regula-tion of iron (hypoferitenemia) is more rapid thanmost other markers of inflammation and the serumconcentration of iron is correlated with the severityor course of inflammation, with a return to normalas the inflammation resolved. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 83FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREDrug-Induced Hepatotoxicity Luckily for those of us in equine practice, and for the horse, drug-induced causes of hepatic failure in thehorse are rare. There are rare reported cases ofsteroid hepatopathy in horses. 158,159Imidocarb can cause severe hepatic disease in donkeys160but does not seem to do so in horses. A severe toxichepatopathy has been described in nursing foalsbeing treated for Rhodoccocus equi with both rifam- pin and doxycycline. 161This combination therapy as a cause of liver disease in other species is appar-ently nonexistent or at least rare. Regardless, thiscombination of antimicrobials should be used withcaution in the foal. Rifampicin is thought to be oneof the most common antibiotics associated withdrug-induced liver diseases in humans. Nonsteroi-dal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) hepatopathyhas not been reported in horses, which is surprisingconsidering that acetaminophen is by far the mostcommon drug-associated cause of acute hepatic fail-ure in humans. There is a paucity of literature on the equine cytochrome P450 enzymes and hepatic metabolismof drugs in the horse compared with knowledge inmany other species. Hepatic metabolism can playa critical role in determining both the efcacy and the residence time of drugs in the body, as well as inmodulating the response to toxic chemicals. Age,species (horse vs. donkey, for example), and othergenetic proles may affect hepatic metabolism andbody elimination. Donkeys, and especially minia-ture donkeys, have a much greater capacity formetabolism of some drugs than other equines. 162 Miniature donkeys were also noted to be overrepre-sented in one retrospective study of hepatic cirrho-sis, calling into question whether increasedmetabolism of hepatotoxins might also occur in don-keys (S. McDonough, personal communication,2014). Little is known about the effects of aging onthe hepatic drug metabolizing capacity of horses,but newborn foals are generally believed to havedecreased hepatic metabolism (often along with in-creases in bioavailability and differences in proteinbinding) of many drugs. 163Compared with adult horses, young horses may have less ability to metab-olize aromatic hydrocarbons and less conjugativeability, and may be at greater risk when exposed toxenobiotics requiring metabolism by these sys-tems. 164This might explain why we have seen more markedly increased hepatic enzymes in foalsvs. adult horses exposed to the same toxic pasturecontaining red fescue (author's experience). Somethought should be given to the dose of potentiallytoxic drugs that undergo hepatic metabolism, suchas metronidazole and lidocaine, in foals and a re-duced dose or prolonged interval may be required. 165 Phosphine gas, associated with feeding a pelleted ration treated with aluminum phosphide, causedhepatic failure in a group of horses. 166Horses and ponies seem to be very resistant to any hepatotoxiceffects of high dietary copper and adult horses fed ten times the NRC requirements for copper for 21months or more had 100 times the amount of hepaticcopper as control horses without elevated liver en-zymes or hepatic lesions on necropsy. 143 4. Primary Hyperammonemia A primary or enteric hyperammonemia syndromehas been well described in horses. The rst casereport was by Dr. Tim Mair in 1995 167and we fol- lowed that report with an additional four cases in1997. 168Since that time there have been numer- ous case reports of the condition and a large studyhas been published involving 36 horses. 169It is a relatively common and unique disease of horses andwhen we rst recognized the disorder in the mid-1990s we could nd no other animal model for theequine disorder. Even today, the horse seems to bethe domestic animal most predisposed to fulminantenteric hyperammonemia. Dr. Skip Hintz was con-sulted on the cases we had in the 1990s as he hadexperimentally caused urea poisoning in ponies 170 previously, and the ponies clinical and laboratoryndings were similar to what we were observing inthe horses with primary hyperammonemia. WithDr. Hintz's help and further evaluation of serumurea (urea poisoning causes a rather marked in-crease in urea, which was not present in our horses)and epidemiologic investigations, we were able tosufciently rule out urea poisoning. The character-istic presentation is one of anorexia and mild colicinitially, followed by an acute onset of encephalopa-thy 24-48 hours later. Head pressing, circling,other maniacal behavior and blindness with dilatedpupils are the most common neurologic signs (Fig.7). Infectious causes of anorexia, enteritis, andcolitis have also been described as predisposing fac-tors. In fact, hyperammonemia may be the numberone cause of death in horses and ponies with coro-navirus enteritis. 171We have also, on rare occa- observed the fulminant hyperammonemicencephalopathy while treating horses with PotomacHorse Fever or salmonellosis. We have not identi-ed any unique risk factors in those horses otherthan the primary disease. The possibility of morefrequent recognition of the disease in horses andponies with coronavirus infection and the absence oflarge bowel signs (tympany, etc.) in most of theabdominal pain cases, may point to small intestinaldysfuction or microbiome changes as an initiator forthe disease. Many of our cases have not been asso-ciated with those aforementioned infectious diseasesand instead have been otherwise healthy, nonfebrilehorses with mild colic that preceeded by 12-24 hoursthe acute neurologic signs. It may sound easy, butwith the history of colic in the preceding 24 hours, ithas sometimes taken me an hour or so to gure outthat the current signs are not those of abdominalpain. On rare occasions, an affected horse has evenundergone abdominal surgery for abdominal painwithout nding a lesion at surgery; those horses 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREhave usually not recovered from anesthesia. Al- though gastrointestinal diseases may predispose tothe hyperammonemia condition, there are reports ofstarved horses developing hyperammonemia afterbeing refed and in a small number of cases thereis no evidence of gastrointestinal disease. Dr. Linda Mittel and I recently reviewed 14 documented casesof primary/enteric hyperammonemia evaluated atCornell; epidemiologic data did not reveal any breedor sex predisposition and the average age was 10years (range, 2-17 years). foals, especiallythose syndromes are notas fulminant as what we routinely see in the adulthorses. 169In our review, it was more common for affected horses to be on pasture but a few werestabled horses. The disease occurred as a singlecase on a farm with little or no predisposing riskfactor in 12 of the 14 cases. On one farm in March1997, we had two horses affected at the same timeand those were febrile horses so I tend to think theywere likely coronavirus-infected horses, before weeven knew about coronavirus infections in adulthorses.Affected horses almost uniformly have no evi- dence of liver disease (increased hepatic enzymes) or abnormal liver function to explain the hyper-ammonemia. Characteristic laboratory ndingshave been (e.g., hypoalbuminemia) character-istic of those disorders. The measurement ofblood ammonia is affected by temperature, timeand air exposure. Samples should be collected invacuum blood tubes, kept on ice and measured in30 minutes. 172If the horse has died just prior to arrival and you suspect hyperammonemia, aque-ous fluid can be collected, stored, and tested asdescribed above with values less than 100 umol/Lsuggesting that the horse did not have hyperam-monemia. Ammonia will progressively increasein the aqueous humor following death, makinghigh levels somewhat hard to interpret (LindaMittel, personal communication). Although the cause of the hyperammonemia is unproven it is likely a combination of increased en- teric ammonia production and increases in intesti-nal permeability that overwhelm the normal liver'sability to metabolize the ammonia causing the met-abolic and neurologic disturbances. Overgrowth ofurease-producing bacteria has been discussed butuntil the microbiome is evaluated in affected andcontrol horses, the cause will remain speculative.Treatment for the condition is treatment of theprimary disease, if known, and treatment of HE.Studies in some species suggest that the largestamount of enteric nia. 173If this is true in the horse, a combination of metronidazole and neomycin could be used, in addi-tion to lactulose and probiotics given separatelyfrom the antibiotics. Treatments specic for hyper-ammonemia of more than 1 or 2 days are usually notrequired. For cases with mild colic followed by id-iopathic hyperammonemia I often tell the ownersthat the outcome will be known within 2 days asapproximately half the cases quickly deteriorate tocoma and death with the other half showing im-provement following HE treatment within 24 hoursand often a complete recovery within 72 hours (ex-cept when associated with traumatic injuries).If you have not seen this disease, I can almost guar-antee that you will eventually see one or more casesif you are routinely examining horses presentingwith intestinal signs. When I have shown moviesof affected horses and described the clinical syn-drome at veterinary meetings, it is common for atleast one practitioner in the group to remark, \"I justsaw a case of that.\" Fig. 7. A 10 year old Quarter horse mare had mild colic signs 36hours prior to acute onset of head pressing and cortical blindness.The rectal exam was normal and heart rate was 60 BPM. Thehorse had causing equineliver failure. Hyperlipemia with hepatic lipidosisis a metabolic condition most frequently seen in fatponies, donkeys, miniature equines, and occasion-ally in horses with Cushing's disease. 174-184In some practices, hepatic lipidosis may be the mostcommonly diagnosed of equine failure.Hyperlipemia is dened elevation in serum triglycerides withoutlipemia. 183 Lipid metabolism is mostly determined by dietary intake of digestible nutrients, energy requirements,and insulin activity. Decreases in feed intake, in-creased energy requirements such as pregnancy orlactation, and increased stress hormone release areall known to increase lipolysis of fat stores. 183Li- polysis associated with negative energy balance isstimulated by decreased production of the antilipolichormone insulin. Increases in stress hormones(e.g., cortisol and beta 3 receptor-activated cat-echolamines) enhance lipolysis and adipose lipase. 183 Lipolysis of triglycerides stored in peripheral fatresults in release of free fatty acids (FFAs), alsoknown as into circulation. Circulating FFAs aretaken up by the liver, where they may be oxidized inthe Krebs cycle for energy, stored as triglycerides, ortryglyceride released back into circulation as lipo-proteins. 183In the equine liver, incomplete oxida- tion of free fatty acids seems to be minimal, asmarked ketonemia rarely occurs. With hypertri-glyceridemia, there is an endo-thelial an so they can beused as energy substrate or stored as triglycerides inthe peripheral tissue (fat deposits). There is anincreased activity of LPL activity in ponies withhyperlipemia, suggesting that equine hyperlipemiais and in-creased hepatic secretion of triglyceride-rich verylow density lipoproteins and is not commonly a pri-mary problem with decreased peripheral clearanceof triglycerides. 184In azotemic equines, clearance of triglycerides is thought to be decreased because ofuremic inhibition of LPL activity. 185,186Pre-renal or existing renal diseases and azotemia may be com-pounded by renal steatosis that also occurs withhyperlipemia. Lipolysis and hypertriglyceridemiaare commonly seen in all equines that have either negative energy balance or decreased insulin activ-ity but lipemia only develops in ponies, donkeys,miniature equines, and occasionally in horses withCushing's disease. 35,177On rare occasions, lipemiawill be noted in horses with neoplasia, and I have assumed this may in part be due to increased tumornecrosis factor and its effect on enhanced lipolysisand decrease in LPL activity. Adult ponies, especially Shetland or fat ponies, donkeys and miniature equines of all ages experi-encing enhanced lipolysis can quickly develop li-pemia and hepatic lipidosis and without prompttreatment they often die from metabolic abnormali-ties, liver failure, or occasionally rupture of the liverand hemorrhagic shock (Fig. 8). 183Interestingly, horses and ponies with Cushing's disease often havesome hepatic lipidosis and are, on rare occasion,hyperlipemic but they do not seem to have the samemetabolic/hepatic failure crisis that occurs in otherponies, donkeys, and miniature equines. 177 The most common predisposing factors initiating the negative energy balance and marked lipolysisinclude intestinal diseases, esophageal choke, preg-nancy, dental disorders, transportation, decrease inavailable feed or appetite, parasitism, lactation,laminitis, respiratory diseases, and Cushing's dis-ease. 183Donkeys afflicted with social reordering and donkeys that pine for missing mates are af-flicted as well. Females are most commonly af-fected because late pregnancy and lactation seem tobe signicant risk factors for the disease. The dis-order seems to be common in older donkeys, whichcould be a reflection of concurrent Cushing's diseaseor dental problems in those animals. 181There are cases of hyperlipemia and hepatic lipidosis in fatadult ponies that do not have any additional obviousrisk factors, suggesting that insulin resistance is thebasic mechanism for the lipemia in those ponies 187 although Freestone in an earlier publication did notnd that to be the case. 188 Clinical ndings in equines predisposed to hyper- with the disease, as well as signscaused by the hepatic lipidosis. Clinical signs that Fig. 8. Liver from a miniature horse with hyperlipemia andhepatic lipidosis. The horse died acutely following liver ruptureand hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity. 86 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREcan be directly attributed to the hyperlipemia and hepatic lipidosis include depression, anorexia, jaun-dice, signs of HE, discolored urine, dysphagia, andventral edema. Tachycardia is present in mostcases. Depression is observed in almost all affectedequines with hyperlipemia and some will progress tofulminant encephalopathy (HE) with blindness.Ventral edema occurs in approximately 30% and nearly does in myexperience seem to be commonly caused by hyperli-pemia itself, unless serum insulin concentrationsremain very high for a prolonged time. Laboratory ndings include lipemia and hypertri- glyceridemia, but the does notalways correlate with the triglyceride concentra-tions in the plasma. Some ponies may have grosslipemia with triglyceride levels of only 400-700mg/dL. 189Free fatty acids are increased (normal, /H110210.4 mEq/L)c, as are total cholesterol and some liver enzymes. Handheld, point-of-care devicescould be used for measuring triglycerides and FFAs.The pattern of elevation in hepatic enzymes seemsinconsistent with nearly normal GGT in many cases,but marked elevation (several hundred IU/L) doesoccur in a few patients. Hepatocellular enzymesare often moderately elevated in the serum but arevariable. This may reflect a signicant variation inamount of inflammation of hepatocytes and veryvariable biliary obstruction between cases. Bile acids are generally increased and are often in the 80-120 /H9262mol/L range, PT and PTT prolonged, direct bilirubin increased, and blood ammonia isfrequently high, all suggesting signicant decreasein liver function (failure). Blood glucose is variablewith many cases having low glucose, especiallyyoung miniature equines, yet glucose is high in oth-ers, likely related to insulin resistance. 190Concur- rent pancreatitis can occur, possibly associated withthe excessive hydrolysis of circulating triglyceridesin the pancreas, which might cause inflammationdue to calcium/FFA deposits. Hyperlipemia isknown to be associated with primary pancreatitis infoals, dogs, and some humans. Although theequine pancreas is one of the organs that containsthe GGT enzyme, pancreatitis in equines does notseem to cause elevations in GGT. This is supportedby two case reports of acute severe pancreatitis in adonkey and in two acute, fatal cases of pancreatitisin foals. 191,192 Management of hyperlipemia should target treat- ing any underlying disease, reversing the negativeenergy balance, normalizing plasma lipid concentra-tions and treating hepatic lipidosis/failure. 183,193 Treatment for all of these should begin immediatelyand concurrently due to the sometimes rapid pro-gression of disease. Treatment of predisposing dis-orders will vary but maintaining hydration,decreasing systemic inflammation, and decreasingany pain with drug therapy would seem appropriatein most cases; endotoxin, systemic inflammatorymediators and azotemia all LPL activ-ity. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be needed forthe primary disease or to combat bacterial translo-cation from the intestinal tract. Pergolide shouldbe administered to lipemic horses or donkeys withCushing's disease and in some cases is the onlytreatment needed. 177 Nutritional support for miniature horses, don- keys, and ponies with hyperlipemia and hepatic lip-idosis is the most important indication fornutritional intervention in equine liver disease.Providing calories in the form of mostly carbohy-drates and protein in the meal or forced enteralfeeding is often successful in quickly correcting thislife-threatening disorder, assuming the predispos-ing cause can be promptly corrected. The provisionof adequate calories will inhibit mobilization ofFFAs from adipose sites, and supplemental proteinhas in some species been shown to be an importanttreatment. 194Enteral support could consist of simply feeding the lipemic animal at a highercarbohydrate level and feeding more palatable feed.Syringe feeding 30 mL of corn syrup two to six timesa day has been recommended as a simple method ofincreasing caloric intake. 179Unfortunately, most lipemic equines have a depressed appetite andinterventional nutrition will likely be required.There are reports of fat-free diet formulas thatwere successful when ponies with 195These gen- erally as the carbohydrate supplyand are mixed with casein and alfalfa meal asprotein sources; the combination of carbohydrateand protein intake is likely ideal. A commonformula used in our clinic for poniesand miniature horses with hepatic lipidosis/hyperlipemia is 100-200 g glucose (dependingupon blood glucose levels), 400 g of whey, and50-100 g of alfalfa meal mixed in two liters ofwater and administered every 8 hours via naso-gastric feeding tube. Five to ten grams of potas-sium chloride and multiple B vitamins should alsobe provided in the slurry. The mixture can begiven via a standard stomach tube of proper sizeor through a commercially available enteral feed-ing tube. The gruel must be kept sufciently thinso that it will flow through the tube withoutclogging. There are also numerous commercialenteral products that could be used but many ofthe products marketed for humans contain fats.When commercially available enteral nutritionproducts are used, a low-fat or medium-chain-tri-glyceride fat supplement is preferred for forcedenteral feeding. 178 Parenteral nutrition using 5 to 20% dextrose with amino acids (1 g/kg body weight) can be used in theequine patient with hyperlipemia and hepatic lipi-dosis where enteral diets be administeredbecause of esophageal or intestinal disorders. 176,178 Parenteral nutrition with a moderate dextrose con- 61 /H114082015 87FRANK hy- perlipemic equines that are either hypoglycemic,normoglycemic, or have only mild hyperglycemia.Exogenous insulin therapy may be required if thehorse/pony is hyperglycemic. Although hyperli-pemic equines may have an inherent decrease ininsulin sensitivity, exogenous insulin can decreasehyperglycemia, inhibit lipolysis and improve cellu-lar energy balance. However, there are no con-trolled studies to provide evidence of efcacy ofinsulin in treating equine hyperlipemia, nor is theregood information on the dose, route, and form ofinsulin to use although there are individual reportson the use of insulin. 177,183The easiest and gener- ally safest method of administering insulin might beto use 0.10-0.15 IU/kg of an intermediate or long-acting suspension administered subcutaneously ev-ery 12 or 24 hours, respectively. For severehyperglycemia, a short-acting regular insulin willoffer a quicker response and dosage can be quicklyadjusted as needed with glucose monitoring. Astarting dose for regular insulin that I have used is0.05-0.1 IU/kg/h as a constant rate infusion (CRI) orintramuscularly every 4-8 hours. When insulintherapy is used, blood glucose and serum potassiummust be closely monitored. Intravenous or oral flu-ids are also important in correcting prerenalazotemia, which might decrease LPL activity re-quired to hydrolyze circulating triglycerides. Iwould recommend oral or slow intravenous admin-istration of B-vitamins daily. Although l-carnitinesupplementation is known to affect /H9252-oxidation and energy metabolism and it would be of interest (and Ihave used it in treatment of hyperlipemia) as apotential treatment for hyperlipemia/hepatic lipido-sis, the feeding of dietary l-carnitine supplementa-tion (2 g twice daily) had no effect on plasma FFAsand triglyceride concentrations in healthy ponies. 196 Additional studies on l-carnitine in ponies with hyper-lipemia would be of interest. Heparin therapy is generally not recommended given that LPL may already be maximally activatedin equine hyperlipemia 184and, fatty liver, PT and PTT are often prolonged.184,190I think I made that mistake once of giving too muchheparin to a pony with hyperlipemia as the ponydeveloped a severe hemorrhagic crisis. The mortality rate from hyperlipemia and hepatic lipidosis reported in one case series is approximately50% but the prognosis is variable, depending on thesuccessful and prompt correction of the predisposingcause(s) and on the ability to supply adequate nu-tritional support (enteral or parenteral or both). 183 Prognosis should not be based upon the level oftriglycerides in the serum or upon liver enzyme el-evations. For example, one miniature horse marewith masseter myopathy (and no detectable sele-nium in her whole blood) had lipemia and a plasmatriglyceride concentration of 1926 mg/dL. Follow-ing 2 of enteral triglyceride concentration of 120 mg/dL, withmarked improvement in liver function tests andclinical signs. The horse was able to eat on her ownon day 4. Hyperlipemic horses with Cushing's dis-ease that are receiving pergolide treatment in addi-tion to attention to general health care generallyhave a good prognosis. The prevention of hepatic lipidosis revolves around identifying at-risk equines, pony mares, obese or po-nies and donkeys, and miniature equines of all ageswith diarrhea and other predisposing disorders.Donkeys that have any change in their social status,such as loss of a companion, should be considered athigh risk for disease. Providing adequate caloricintake is important in late-pregnant and early-lac-tation mares. As a preventive, fat could be fed toincrease caloric density and feeding fat to healthyponies increases lipoprotein and decreasescirculating in at-risk equines that already have hy-perlipidemia. Performing body conditionscoring and periodic sampling of at-risk equines fortriglycerides and free fatty acids could be helpful inidentifying metabolic abnormalities before the onsetof clinical signs. Proper maintenance health careand husbandry are of utmost importance in at-riskequines. Testing for Cushing's disease should beinstituted in all older at-risk animals. 6. Vascular, Genetic and Miscellaneous Causes of Liver Failure Hepatic disorders of vascular or genetic origin that result in severe central nervous system signs (he-patic encephalopathy or HE) include congenital por-tosystemic 198-200and portal vein thrombosis. Additional miscellaneouscauses of liver disease or failure include umbilicalvein are not common in foals and, when present,are often not detected until the foal is 6 to 12 weeksof age. 198,201-203This relatively late clinical detec- tion could be because hindgut development in youngfoals is necessary to produce enough enteric ammo-nia to cause sufcient elevations in blood ammonia.We have also noticed that young calves with PSS donot generally exhibit clinical signs until they areruminants. 198,204The diagnosis of PSS is made af- ter looking at the patient's age, clinical signs of HEwith marked elevation in blood ammonia and bileacids and normal serum hepatic enzymes. Thesigns of HE in foals with PSS are variable and in-clude lethargy, disorientation, compulsive circling,ptyalism, seizures, central blindness, walkingthrough fences and so on. Blood ammonia can be 88 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREvery high (up to 300 umol/L) in some PSS foals without evidence of encephalopathic signs. Thechronicity of the hyperammonemia and, in somecases, its gradual development may somehow allowthe brain to adapt to the elevated ammonia levels.PSS can be conrmed by liver ultrasonography, byultrasound-guided, percutaneous trans-splenic agitated the spleen withsimultaneous echocardiography of by 201,205The bubblegram may have higher sen- sitivity because air bubbles will appear in the rightheart almost immediately after splenic injection ifPSS is present. 201Theoretically, if portal circula- tion is normal the liver will lter the bubbles and thebubbles will not reach the heart. Trans-rectal scin-tigraphy for the diagnosis of PSS is performed byplacing a soft rubber catheter as far into the rectumas safely possible and administering 30 mC of tech-netium pertechnetate followed immediately by ra-dioisotope scanning of both the heart and liver.If the majority of technetium is detected rst in theliver then PSS can be ruled out. Conversely, ifmost of the radioactivity appears in the heart rstthen the foal either has a PSS or the technetium wasnot administered \"high\" enough enterthe caudal vena not the portal circulation). If a liver biopsy is performed (usually unnecessary),lobular atrophy characterized by decreased distancebetween the central veins and portal areas and ar-teriolar proliferation in the portal tract with mildproliferation of interlobular arteries are usuallyseen. 201The number and size of portal veins may be subjectively less than normal. These ndingsmay vary depending upon location of the shunt (ex-tra- vs. intrahepatic), but all of the changes developas a result of decreased oxygen supply to the livercaused by the PSS (recall that the majority of oxygento the liver is delivered via the portal vein, not thehepatic arteries). Positive-contrast portographyfollowing anesthesia and catheterization jejunal) or computed tomo-graphic angiography (Fig. 9) with contrast andultra-sonography may all be required to determinethe shunt location prior to considering surgical re-pair. Shunts may occur as either intrahepatic orextrahepatic and be single or multiple shunts. 198 Shunts may occur due to aberrant connections be-tween the systemic circulation (often the caudalvena cava or azygous vein) and virtually any gastric,splenic or mesenteric vessel. 198Surgical repair has been successful using suture ligation, cellophanebands, or casein-stainless steel rings (ameroidrings) placed shunt. 198,201Immediate, total surgical ligation of the shunt vessel can causelife-threatening portal hypertension with increasedmesenteric venous pressures and congestion of thebowel. As opposed to suture ligation, cellophanebands or casein rings can be shuntvessel, modestly occluding blood flow initially; overthe following weeks gradual of theshunt occurs due to either vascular constriction as-sociated with the inflammation caused by cello-phane banding because of gradual casein swellingin the 201Placement of transvenous into shunts could also result inslow embolization and progressive closure of theshunt, but experience has shown that the umbrellasmade for children are too small to cause a sufcientthrombus in the vessel in neonatal large animals. 204 While preparing for diagnostics and surgery, treat-ments for foals with HE secondary to PSS are sim-ilar to HE treatment caused by intrinsic liverdisease and failure (page 92). Enemas are oftenused on foals with HE if the manure becomes abnor-mally rm. One foal with a PSS and a blood am-monia as high as 300 umol/L was maintained onlactulose and minocycline per os, in addition to en- emas, until surgery could be attempted. Hyperammonemia Syndrome in Morgan Foals An acute onset of clinical signs such as coma, blind-ness, and seizures has been associated with the hy-perammonemia syndrome seen in Morgan foals,usually 4-7 months of age. 199,206The onset of clin- ical signs often occurs soon after weaning. Liverenzymes may be mildly elevated and variable de-grees of liver pathology can be seen on microscopicexamination but the degree of microscopic disease ismodest and other liver function tests are not abnor-mal in affected foals. The cause of the disease isunknown but it seems to be a disorder of metabolismof ammonia and possibly other amino acids. Theblood ammonia is extremely high in affected foals(300-500 umol/L), indicating that they have likelydeveloped some compensatory or protective mecha-nism against the persistent elevation in ammonia to Fig. 9. Computed tomographic slice through the liver of a foalwith a Three vascular structures are seenaorta (A), caudal vena cava (C) and portal vein (P). At this point,well within the hepatic parenchyma, the portal vein should J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREsurvive to several months of age. The author has pedigree information on 12 affected foals and, inter-estingly, there is a common grandsire on the pater-nal side in 11 of the foals and in the other foal thestallion is a grandsire on the maternal side. Onemare was bred to the same stallion in consecutiveyears with both foals dying from the disorder. Thedisease is fatal and may end with a terminal hemo-lytic crisis. Some foals may survive the rst crisisand live for days or even weeks before dying with asecond HE crisis. I have not seen or heard of a casein 3 years so perhaps it has been \"bred out\" of thebreed. Portal Vein Thrombosis Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) occurs rarely in foalsfollowing enteritis or in association with Rhodococ- cus equi infection. 200Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in other species as a sequella to sep-sis, hypercoagulability, and inflammation. In olderanimals, hepatic neoplasia may predispose tothrombosis. Although rare, horses with cirrhosismay occasionally develop portal vein thrombosis. Clinical signs in foals attributed to complete por- tal vein thrombosis include diarrhea and HE signs.Diarrhea may occur from increased mesenteric ve-nous pressure and intestinal wall edema if thethrombosis is acute and completely obstructsthe portal vein. Diarrhea may be a predisposingcause of or a result of the PVT. The neurologicsigns are secondary to hyperammonemia, caused bythe collateral flow of the portal blood into the venacava and elsewhere, thus bypassing the liver. Ifthe obstruction is not complete or portoportal collat-eral compensatory circulation develops, clinicalsigns may be absent. One foal with both abdominallymphadenitis, septic tarsitis, and hepatitis causedbyRhodococcus equi had a large but incomplete obstruction of the portal vein and with long-termantimicrobial therapy the patient recovered. Anaged horse developed an acute onset of HE fromportal vein thrombosis secondary to invasion of ametastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. 207Treatment to remove PVT in horses to my knowledge has notbeen attempted. Umbilical Vein Abscess Foals with umbilical vein abscesses extending intothe liver are well documented. 205,208Although the infection in the umbilical vein (which normally be-comes the round ligament of the liver) may extendinto the liver parenchyma, inflammation of the liverand increase in hepatic enzymes are uncommon.The infected and enlarged vein can be easily imagedduring ultrasound examination as it courses into theliver and, in some cases, can be palpated through thebody wall. Affected foals are febrile, depressed,and may concurrently have infected joints and lame-ness. Because of the extent of the infection, surgi-cal removal is generally recommended. If theinfection extends into the liver such that it cannot becompletely removed, then a stump of the vein ex-tending into the liver can be marsupialized to theventral body wall. 208 Liver Lobe Torsion Liver lobe torsion is an uncommon disorder inhorses. Based upon the small number of cases re-ported, 8it would seem that the left medial or acces- sory lobe is most commonly affected, although theentire left lobe was believed to be involved in twohorses. 209-211Predisposing causes were rarely, if ever, identied. Of the eight cases reported, onlythree were presented for colic. Clinical signs aremost commonly anorexia of 1 or more day's duration,tachycardia, and clinical and laboratory signs asso-ciated with systemic inflammation resulting fromnecrosis of the twisted liver lobe and peritonitis.Peritonitis seems to be present in all cases and peri-toneal fluid is often serosanguineous. Serum levelsof hepatic-derived enzymes are unremark-able although SDH and GLDH may be increased inassociation with the systemic inflammatory re-sponse. Ultrasound examination is generally unre-markable as the affected lobe may be obscured fromimaging by the gastrointestinal gas. If the entireleft lobe is \"torsed,\" then the affected portion mayappear as a mixed echogenic mass. Surgical repairis via stapled resection of the affected lobe and thishas been successful in ve cases. 209,211 Persistent Hyperbilirubinemia In otherwise-healthy horses, persistent biliru-binemia is believed to be a result of congenital de-ciency in bilirubin uridine diphosphate-glucuronyltransferase activity. A deciency of enzymeresults in of conjugation of bilirubinwithin the hepatocyte endoplasmic reticulum. Wehave examined or knowledge of several cases ofpersistent hyperbilirubinemia in healthy adulthorses with total bilirubin values between 9 and 16mg/dL on repeated testing. Virtually all of the in-crease in the bilirubin is unconjugated (indirect).Affected horses have normal appetite, no anemia,normal enzymes, and normal serum bile acids.The that somewhatcompetitively enter the hepatocytes at the sinusoi-dal hepatic surface with the help of cytosolic trans-port proteins. The majority of the cases have beenhealthy Thoroughbred horses and most were rstnoted to be icteric upon reading their tattoo whilecompleting health papers. Illness in these horseshas not been recognized, even when monitored for 3or more years. 32 Hepatic Tumors Primary hepatic tumors are rare in horses withhepatoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREall reported.212-216Hepatoblastoma is the most common of the primary hepatic tumors, usually di-agnosed in stillborn fetuses, neonates, and juvenilehorses less than 3 years of age. 217-220The clinical signs in horses with hepatoblastomas are generallynonspecic but include anorexia, lethargy, abdomi-nal enlargement, weight loss, mucous membranecongestion, and fever of unknown origin. Signs di-rectly associated with liver failure have not beenreported. The tumor can be a single mass or mul-tiple masses likely metastasizing within the liverfrom a primary site. The left lobe of the liver maybe more commonly affected. 212Affected individu- als may have increases is common) andbelieved to be with increased erythropoi-etin and from extramedullary hematopoiesis. 217 Ultrasonographically, the liver may be markedly en- larged and a mass of mixed echogenicity may beseen. No treatment has been reported. Hepato-cellular carcinomas are rare in the horse but havebeen reported in a young horse and, similar tohorses, with hepatoblastoma, polycythemia, and in-creases in serum alpha fetal protein may occur. 220 Hepatocellular carcinomas are better dened by im-munohistochemistry than are hepatoblastomas. 212 Hypoglycemia may also be seen with hepatocellularcarcinomas or other hepatic tumors. Cholangiocellular carcinoma is also rare but may occur in aged horses. 212-216,221The onset of the disease is usually insidious, as a consequence of slowand progressive neoplastic inltration from the bile-duct epithelium throughout the entire parenchyma.Clinical signs, including intermittent episodes ofcolic, diarrhea, and fever are most likely related toobstructive cholangitis although bacterial cholan-giohepatitis may also would belikely. 222 7. Chronic Fibrosing Liver Disease Except for PA toxicity, evidence-based informationon chronic brosing liver disease in horses is rare.In Jubb and Kennedy pathology text, 7there is lim- ited discussion (other than on PA toxicity) on chronicbrosis, cirrhosis, or chronic active hepatitis in thehorse. 7Causes of chronic hepatitis that may result in progressive brosis include chronic biliary infec-tion and/or obstruction from hepatocholeliths, planttoxicities, rarely iron toxicity, viral infection,chronic hypoxia, and directedagainst self in theliver. 29Some degree of brosis may occur in any liver disease if hepatic stellate cells are activatedand collagen is deposited. 8In most diseases the brosis is reversible if the primary insult is re-moved, PA toxicity being an exception. 7In con- trast, if the toxic, obstructive, infectious, orimmunologic insult continues, then progressive -brosis, often with concurrent biliary hyperplasia andnodular areas of reduced func-tional hepatic mass and dysfunction occurs(cirrhosis). 7,8,14 The clinical presentation of chronic progressive hepatitis in the horse, sometimes referred to aschronic active hepatitis, may include weight loss,chronic colic, intermittent fever, photosensitizationand other skin conditions, decreased appetite, andeventually neurologic signs associated with HE.Weight loss is likely to be the predominant clinicalnding. Fever may occur with either chronic infec-tions or immunologic reactions. In addition to theskin lesions characteristic of photosensitization ob-served in white-haired areas or on mucous mem-branes, 223a variety of other more diffuse dermatologic signs including alopecia and seborrheaand coronary band lesions may be found withchronic hepatitis. Although unproven, these skinchanges may occur from increased circulating bileacids, decrease in absorption of fat and fat-solublevitamins, or mineral abnormalities associated withhepatic brosis. A multisystemic, eosinophilic, epi-theliotrophic disease can severely intes-tine and other organs concurrently; the etiology isunknown and the condition carries a poor progno-sis. 224Other inflammatory or inltrative bowel diseases may cause secondary liver disease butrarely, if ever, as severe as that seen with multisys-temic, eosinophilic, epitheliotrophic disease. 224,225 Hepatic amyloidosis inhorses used for plasma production; 226rupture of the liver subsequent to amyloid deposition may causeacute hemoperitoneum. The most common biochemical abnormalities with chronic progressive liver disease are marked eleva-tions in either GGT or AST or both. 18GLDH and SDH seem to be more variable, likely related to theirshort half-life and the slow progression of disease inmany horses with cirrhosis. If there is sufcientliver disease to cause dysfunction, then serum bileacids and bilirubins will be increased. BUN andalbumin will generally be low and globulins highregardless of the cause of cirrhosis. Ultrasound ex-amination of the liver may reveal increased echoge-neity due to brosis. Horses with chronic liver disease should have a liver biopsy performed. In my opinion, chronicliver disease may be the best indication for liverbiopsy in the horse. Although PT and PTT may beprolonged with liver failure, biopsy rarely causescomplications if performed properly and if the pa-tient's platelet count normal. Periportal brosiswith ndings on biopsy ofhorses with chronic liver disease, although a fewtoxins, drugs, and hypoxia cause more severe dis-ease in the centrilobular area (zone 3). 7,12Al- though histopathologic examination of liver samples AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H114082015 91FRANK J. biopsy rarely provides a specic etiology for the disease, it may provide information thatguides treatment recommendations. If neutrophilspredominate in periportal inflammation, a course ofantimicrobial therapy in addition to pentoxifyllineand vitamin E would be reasonable. If there is noclinical and serum biochemical improvement in 2weeks and there of bilirubin is conjugated bilirubin), then ur-sidiol (10 PO every 24 hours) treatment couldbe added. If brosis is judged to be moderate tosevere on ultrasound or biopsy, colchicine (0.03mg/kg PO every 24 hours) could be used to inhibit oreven diminish brosis. Colchicine is an alkaloidderived in synthesis along withanti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory ef-fects. 227Colchicine should not be used if PA toxic- ity is suspected or if megalohepatocytes are present,as it is known to inhibit mitosis, as do PAs. Thereis one report of fatal bone marrow suppression in ahorse being treated for chronic active hepatitis withcolchicine. 228 Silymarin, a standardized extract of the milk this- tle seeds (Silybum marianum) is commonly used inthe treatment of chronic liver diseases in severalspecies including the horse. 229,230Flavonolignans are the most common class of compounds present inmilk thistle extract, and of the group, silybin (silib-inin) is considered to have the most hepatoprotectiveproperties. 229,230The percentage of silybin was found to be quite variable among commercial milkthistle extract products. Experimental studieshave demonstrated antibrotic, antioxidant, andmetabolic silybin conrming the clinical horses, a stan- dard bioavailability study of orally administeredsilibinin found less than 1% available. 125SAMe is another nutritional supplement commonly used inthe treatment of chronic liver disease in small ani-mal veterinary medicine. SAMe is a compoundmade primarily in the liver as a byproduct of methi-onine metabolism. Following oral administration,absorption, and trans-sulfuration, SAMe is con-verted into glutathione, a powerful antioxidant.SAMe is believed to stabilize cell membranes, pro-mote secretion of bile, and has anti-inflammatoryproperties. Despite these potentially favorablebenets and information to suggest that SAMe syn-thesis is depressed in chronic liver disease, high-quality randomized studies to demonstrate clinicalefcacy were not found. 232There are no studies on bioavailability or efcacy in the horse. If the inflammatory reaction in the diseased liver is more lymphocytic than neutrophilic then immu-nomodulatory therapy with corticosteroids or aza-thioprine can be used. In some horses with chronicliver disease and a mononuclear inflammatory re-sponse, treatment with 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasonefor 5-7 days followed by a tapering dose of dexa-methasone or switching to prednisolone has resultedin clinical and laboratory improvement for severalmonths in several cases that I have treated, and afew cases have had a full recovery. Nutritionalsupport for chronic liver disease is extremely impor-tant and some guidelines are found on page 95.One nutritional recommendation for chronic liverdisease that has recently changed is that proteinintake in patients with chronic liver disease shouldnot be reduced unless HE is present. In years past,the traditional recommendation for nutritional sup-port in cases of chronic liver disease was to feed alow-protein diet. 233 Prognosis for chronic, active liver disease in horses can often be determined by clinical and se-rum biochemical response to therapy. 22,147,234-236 Quantitative assessment of hepatic function using99mTc-mebrofenin could be performed but studiesin horses with liver disease are not available. 237 Prior to therapy, the degree of brosis and level ofserum bile acids can be used as prognosticindicators. 22 8. Hepatic Encephalopathy HE is a neurologic disorder associated with liverfailure. HE is common in horses with either acuteor chronic liver failure, and in foals with portosys-temic shunts. Primary hyperammonemia syn-dromes in horses also have clinical and laboratoryndings (increased ammonia) similar to HE. Thepathophysiology of HE is complex, and likely in-volves several gut-derived cerebral centrations of blood (CSF)ammonia have been most commonly incriminated ascausing the pathophysiologic events of HE. 240Am- monia (NH3,unionized and a weak base) is toxic at high concentrations and believed to easily pass theblood-brain barrier (BBB) by diffusion while the rel-atively nontoxic ionized ammonia (NH 4/H11001) is limited to a transcellular route for translocation. Ammo-nia is produced mainly within the gut during proteindigestion and amino acid deamination and the con-centration of ammonia in the blood is regulated bythe urea cycle in the healthy liver. Therefore, liverfailure often leads to hyperammonemia in bothblood and CSF. 240Astrocytes normally use ammo- nia when synthesizing glutamine from glutamate,but excessive ammonia presented to astrocytes candisrupt the equilibrium. 241Ammonia is believed to play a key role in the development of HE, withincreased glutamine, effects of varying amounts ofglutamate and neurosteroids on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity, all playing a central rolein ammonia metabolism and HE. 241Increased am- monia metabolism by brain astrocytes results inaccumulation of glutamine, which is known to dis-rupt water balance in the brain leading to cytotoxicedema. 238,241,242Increased ammonia concentra- 92 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREtions in the brain may have direct effects on pH, membrane potential, and neurotransmission in ad-dition to cellular metabolism and cerebral waterbalance. 243Although undoubtedly the most impor- tant single neurotoxin involved in HE, ammoniashould not be considered the sole cause. In fact, amoderate number of horses with HE do not haveblood ammonia values above the reported normalrange. 20Other neurotransmitters are frequently discussed as playing a role in HE but their associa-tion has not been well documented, these neu-rotransmitters include endogenous benzodiazepine-like compounds, mercaptans, monoamines, andaromatic amino brain barrier (BBB) permeability for gut-derived neurotoxins may also play an inte-gral role in HE. The BBB is the physical and met-abolic barrier separating the peripheral circulationfrom the central nervous system and regulates ex-changes between the two. 245Changes in BBB per- meability may be due to both structural alterationsin tight junctions and inflammatory vascular effects,as well as functional changes. Increases in bloodammonia, metalloproteinase activity, and endotoxinmay increase permeability of the BBB in liver fail-ure, permitting transport of other neurotoxins to thebrain. 245 Systemic inflammation and sepsis from endotox- emia or bacterial translocation are often part of thesyndrome of HE. Breakdown products of injuredhepatocytes as well as increases in systemic inflam-matory cytokine production, free radicals, and met-alloproteinases in liver failure have severe systemiceffects in addition to increasing permeability of theBBB. 246The toxic effect of these events on the brain with HE is believed to result in both cytotoxic(intracellular swelling without increased permeabil-ity of BBB) and vasogenic (increased permeabilityof BBB allowing net gain of fluid) brainedema. 238,241,242The clinical signs of HE in horses may be mild with only depression, anorexia, andfrequent yawning. In other cases the signs can befulminant and include head pressing, blindness, cir-cling, and coma. Ataxia can be noticeable in somecases and absent in others. Rarely, ataxia may pre-cede HE signs or icterus in acute liver failure. 247,248 Clinical examination may reveal decreased muscletone of the lower lips, delayed or absent response totouching the inner nares, and cortical blindness of-ten accompanied by mydriasis. These signs are alla result of the cortical disease that occurs with HE.Laryngeal paralysis or dysphagia (presumably dueto HE and functional disturbance in the nucleusambiguous) 122and gastric impaction/rupture121 (presumably due to autonomic nerve dysfunction)are additional ndings that may be associated withHE in horses. Laboratory ndings that are directly associated with HE include hyperammonemia, occasionally hy-poglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. Increasedblood ammonia is common, but certainly not alwaysabove the normal range in all horses with HE.The normal range of blood ammonia in the horsevaries between laboratories but is generally lessthan 90 /H9262mol/L. Many cases of HE have concen- trations in the 100-200 /H9262mol/L range, a few cases are greater than 200 /H9262mol/L, and the highest per- centage of cases seem to be in the upper-normalrange, 70-90 /H9262mol/L. Horses with HE as a result of liver failure generally do not have ammonia levelsas high as those seen with primary enteric hyper-ammonemia, portosystemic shunts, or Morgan foalhyperammonemia syndrome, which often haveblood ammonia concentrations greater than 300 /H9262mol/L.168,198,199Metabolic acidosis, mostly due to lactic acidosis, is common in horses with HE. Theincrease in L-lactic acid is likely a result of de-creased hepatic metabolism of lactate, poor perfu-sion and cellular enhanced hepatic andextra-hepatic aerobic glycolytic activity and lactateproduction. Hypoglycemia is rather uncommon inadult horses with HE but common in young foalswith HE. 20,36In one report of 50 horses with liver failure20none had hypoglycemia, but we have occa- sionally examined a horse or pony with liver failureand hypoglycemia. Dr. Bud Tennant reminded meof a HE case that was hypoglycemic and comatoseand following glucose treatment quickly stood upand eventually recovered. Pathologic ndings in the central nervous system of horses and other animals with HE or other hyper-ammonemia syndromes consist of reactive astrocy-tosis in gray matter, Alzheimer type II cells, andcerebral edema. 249,250Alzheimer type II cells that seemto be metabolically hyperactive) closely associ-ated with increased blood and CSF ammonia; thesecells are also routinely found in the brain of horsesdying from primary intestinal hyperammonemiaand we know from foal studies with acute hepaticfailure that Alzheimer cells can be found in thebrain within 2 days of the hepatic failure. 13,251 Treatments for HE revolve around decreasing en- teric-derived neurotoxins (primarily ammonia), de-creasing cerebral edema, and main-taining to the brain andother vital organs. 251Providing specic treatment for the liver disease per se, such as hepatic lipidosis or bacterial cholangiohepatitis, is imperative but inmany cases of liver failure there are no specictreatments for the hepatic disease and only support-ive care, as outlined below, can be provided. Addi-tional general supportive treatments that inhibitboth systemic and neuronal inflammation, reduceoxidative stress, and prevent multiple organ dys-function are recommended. Correction of intravascular volume decits should be the initial focus for fluid therapy in most horseswith liver failure (LF). 252Expansion of the vascu- lar volume can improve perfusion to the diseasedliver and other organs that may be secondarily in- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 93FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREvolved. with liver failure may have intra- vascular volume decits for several reasonsincluding lack of fluid intake, decreased vasculartone and/or endothelial dysfunction, and increasedurinary loss due to low urea and its negative effecton renal tubular water absorption. Hypertonic sa- line (7.5%, 4 mL/kg) can be administered in adult horses with HE if there is clinical or measurableevidence of severe hypotension and abnormally lowcardiac preload. An hypertonic saline as a resuscitation fluidwould be to administer in the rst hours of therapy20-30 mL/kg of a balanced crystalloid with 50 g ofdextrose and 20 mEq of KCl added to each liter.Supplemental potassium is generally recommendedgiven that horses with HE are anorexic and wouldmost likely be decient in total body potassium.Hypokalemia is known to increase proximal tubularammoniogenesis with the increased ammonia beingreturned to circulation and worsening the symptomsof HE. 253Ideally, a crystalloid with an acetate rather than lactate buffer should be used, but iflactate fluid is all that is available then use whatyou have because fluid volume is likely more impor-tant in the treatment than the buffer composition.The liver is the primary organ responsible for glu-cose production and glucose support should be con-sidered in the fluid therapy plan for all patients withLF. This is especially important in foals with LFbecause they are much more likely to be hypoglyce-mic than are adult horses. Adult horses with LFare rarely hypoglycemic 20but still might benet from glucose treatments to decrease the need forhepatic glucogenesis and glycogenolysis (the littlethat may remain). Normal perfusion to the kidneyand muscle are very important given that they arethe only other organs that can help with ammoniaand glutamine metabolism or elimination. Mosthorses with HE have a metabolic acidosis but cor-rection of this with sodium bicarbonate should beavoided as bicarbonate administration will increasethe ammonia to ammonium ratio, and decrease uri-nary elimination of ammonia. Ideally, all sedatives should be avoided in HE but horses with HE can have propulsive cortical signsthat may require sedation to properly attend to thehorse and to prevent injury to both the horse andhumans. A low dose of detomidine (5-10 /H9262g/kg IV) may sufce and is what I usually use to controlmaniacal behavior in horses with HE. It is impor-tant to not overly sedate a horse with HE becausethat might cause excessive lowering of the head inthe standing horse and promote cerebral edema inaddition to the potential negative effects on thebrain, liver, and other organ perfusion. Propofol(2 mg/kg IV), another short-acting sedative avail-able to veterinarians, could be used in foals with HEto control seizure or maniacal behavior, or for seda-tion prior to general anesthesia, but the volumeneeded for adult horses would likely not be practical.Propofol does not require a change in dose in pa-tients with liver failure and does not worsen HEwhen used as a sedative in humans with cirrho-sis. 254,255Respiratory depression may occur with the use of either propofol or detomidine, and the useof supplemental intranasal oxygen would be ideal ifavailable. Diazepam use in HE is controversial asit can induce astrocyte swelling and worsen HE. 241 In humans with HE, haloperidol is one of the pre-ferred drugs for controlling abnormal behavior. 256 I have not personally used haloperidol for HE inhorses and the form that has been used in horses forbehavior issues is haloperidol deconate, which has adelayed but long-acting effect and would likely notbe of use in most horses with HE. If more long-term sedation is required, pregabalin (3 mg/kg every12 hours PO) or gabapentin (5-12 mg/kg every 12hours PO) could be used given that these drugsundergo minimal metabolism and are eliminated bythe kidney and could provide sedation in HE ifneeded. 256Conversely, horses with profound coma could be treated with sarmazenil (0.04 mg/kg IV) orflumazenil (0.1 mg/kg IV), which could have a posi-tive effect in reversing those neurologic disturbancesof HE via inhibition of benzodiazepine receptor li-gands, which may play a role in the pathogenesis ofHE by increasing GABAergic tone. 201,257Con- trolled clinical trials showed that flumazenil had benecial effect in only a subpopulation ofHE patients. 258,259 One of the most important goals in the treatment of HE is to reduce the blood and CSF ammoniaconcentration. 260The primary means for reduction of blood/CSF ammonia is to reduce the production orabsorption of ammonia from the gut. Therapeuticoptions include neomycin 10-20 mg/kg PO every 8hours or another poorly absorbed antibiotic. Neo-mycin decreases ammonia production via its effecton microbial population and decreases in ammoniaproducing bacteria. Neomycin was used success-fully for decades in human medicine as a rst-lineper os treatment for HE but has fallen out of favorbecause of risk of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity,which would be very unlikely to occur in horsestreated orally for only a few days. 261Rifaximin, a poorly absorbed and expensive rifamycin derivativeantibiotic, is currently the antibiotic of choice inhumans with HE but studies to demonstrate efcacyof this antibiotic over neomycin were not found. 262 Orally administered antibiotics should not be pro-longed beyond 1-3 days if possible to lower the riskof antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Lactulose, apoorly absorbed carbohydrate, has been used (0.3-0.5 mL/kg every 8 hours) in horses to decrease in-testinal ammonia production but no efcacy studiesare available. Lactulose decreases ammonia whenits metabolism in the large bowel results in in-creased H /H11001production and conversion of some am- monia ions (NH3) to poorly absorbed NH4/H11001 (ammonium) salts. Lactulose also can be a helpfulcathartic given that constipation must be avoided inanimals with HE. It may, therefore, be preferred to 94 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREcombine neomycin with lactulose. It would be ideal if the treatments softened the stool (a cathartic ef-fect) without causing diarrhea. Ideally, all oralmedication should be given by dose syringe becausethe nasal bleeding resulting from passage of a stom-ach tube (probably never happens to you) will resultin ingestion of considerable amounts of blood pro-tein, which would be likely to increase blood ammo-nia production. 251 Other oral treatments that have been used in humans in hopes of lowering enteric ammonia pro-duction include probiotics and prebiotics, which mayhave some efcacy in treating HE by increasingnon-urease producing bacteria. 263Treatments to decrease neuroinflammation and disruption energy me- tabolism and antioxidant activity to the braininclude B vitamins, vitamin C, and DMSO, althoughall are unproven. Treatment of cerebral edemawith mannitol or saline may have sometemporary effect in decreasing cerebral edema. There are no highly effective, safe, and specic parenteral treatments for decreasing ammonia thatis present in the blood and CSF of patients with HE.Glycerol phenylbutyrate has been used in humanclinical studies, sometimes combined with branchchain amino acids (BCAAs), to lower ammonia byproviding an alternative to the ammonia-to-ureapathway with excretion of phenylacetylglutamine inthe urine. 264,265L-ornithine-l-aspartate (LOLA) reduces ammonia levels by increasing hepatic am-monia disposal and its peripheral metabolism.It is available in Europe in both intravenous formu-lations and oral formulations and some clinical trials have found it to be effective in treating hepaticencephalopathy. 266,267 Another commonly recommended administered treatment for HE is oral supplementation of BCAAvaline, leucine, and isoleucine. Their role in treat-ing HE is controversial with some reports demon-strating benecial effects possibly via improvingglucose metabolism, decreasing protein and musclecatabolism, and as an alternative pathway (in mus-cle) for ammonia detoxication. 268They may, therefore, be of particular benet in treatment of HEcaused by hepatic lipidosis, but other reports pointout concerns of BCAA administration increasingglutamine synthesis and worsening of HE. 269 Nutritional Management of Acute and Chronic Liver Failure Nutritional management specic for horses with liver disease, other than removing potential hepato-toxins and feeding an adequate diet, is generally notnecessary unless hepatic dysfunction has occurred.Nutritional support for miniature horses, donkeys,and ponies with hyperlipemia and hepatic lipidosisis the most important indication for nutritional in-tervention in equine liver disease. 183Although there are few, if any, evidence-based guidelines fornutritional management of horses with severe liverdisease, some recommendations may be made intu-itively based upon an understanding of the functionof the healthy liver and its repair following disease.Provision of adequate enteric glucose or glucose pre-cursors to the equine with severe liver disease mayhelp maintain normal plasma glucose concentra-tions, decrease the workload of the failing liver, andinhibit lipolysis and muscle protein breakdown.When the liver is sufciently diseased, liver glyco-gen stores and hepatic glucose production viaglycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are likely dimin-ished. Depletion of glycogen reserves in addition toinsulin resistance, which may occur with somecauses of liver failure, increase reliance on gluconeo-genesis from protein and this, often coupled withinappetence, tends to lead to an increased relianceon body protein for energy. Despite this metabolicdysfunction, most adult horses with liver failurehave normal or even elevated blood glucose values,possibly related to insulin resistance. 20,29In a small percentage of cases, hypoglycemia may occur,which could worsen the neurologic signs associatedwith liver failure (HE) and cause generalized neu-romuscular weakness. This is especially pro-nounced in foals with hepatic failure because foalsconsistently and quickly develop hypoglycemia withthe onset of liver failure. 36With an enhanced reli- ance on protein and fat catabolism for energy, thereis both a rapid muscle breakdown and increasedammonia production in addition to increased serumtriglycerides, the latter of which can be life threat-ening to miniature equine, ponies, and don-keys. 174,180Provision of adequate enteric glucose or glucose precursors in horses may decrease theworkload of the failing liver, inhibit lipolysis andmuscle protein breakdown and in those foals orhorses prone to hypoglycemia, maintain plasma glu-cose concentrations. It may, therefore, be impera-tive in normoglycemic or hypoglycemic horses withsevere liver disease that are still eating to providean appropriate supply of glucose or easily digestibleglucose precursors to help supply daily energy re-quirements, inhibit muscle and fat catabolism, anddecrease the need for the liver to perform gluconeo-genesis or glycogenolysis. Compared with otherproducts of carbohydrate hindgut fermentation (e.g.,acetate, propionate, lactate) that can be used forenergy, glucose provides 2-3-fold more ATP. 270 The frequent (every 4-6 hours) feeding of smallamounts of sugars, easily hydrolyzable carbohy-drates, and nonresistant starches that are readilydigested to glucose and absorbed in the small intes-tine should be benecial in maintaining a constantsupply of enteric derived glucose. 271Feeds with high amounts of sugars or hydrolyzable carbohy-drates include most sweet feeds (especially thosecontaining ingredients such as oats, cooked corn/barley, and molasses), whole oats, or soaked beet AAEP PROCEEDINGS higher than unprocessed corn andbarley. 272,273Palatability of the feeds must be con- sidered, given that it is important to keep the horseeating something (even if it is not the ideal feed).Only small amounts of the high-glycemic feeds(/H113491.0 g/kg) should be fed at a time to improve small intestinal starch digestibility as well as prevent hy-perglycemia, extreme insulin surges, and small in-testinal overload, which could result in excessivestarch passing undigested into the cecum 271,274,275 The amount fed may need to be modied based uponappetite of the horse, blood glucose concentrations,and consideration of individual metabolic condi-tions, e.g., presence of any insulin dysregulation.Structural carbohydrates that are converted to vol-atile free fatty acids (VFAs) in the large bowel are animportant source of energy for the horse and shouldbe fed to supplement the energy potential obtainedfrom sugars and hydrolysable starches digested inthe small intestine. Some of the VFAs (i.e., ace-tate) may be used directly for energy, 276whereas others such as propionate and lactate that undergohepatic gluconeogenesis 277may be of less value with a severely diseased liver. A highly palatable grassor grass hay (legumes may be too high in protein forhorses with liver failure) should be fed at approxi-mately 1.5% of body weight dry matter basis for hayif the horse will eat this amount, in addition to thesmall feedings of a grain-based feed as describedabove depending upon blood glucose levels. Palat-ability of fresh grass may be higher than hay or evensome concentrates and horses ill with severe liverdisease may only be willing to ingest grass. If thehorse with severe liver disease has markedly dimin-ished appetite for grain and hay, grazing a nonle-gume grass should be offered as long as the grazingis monitored (gorging while grazing/eating too muchtoo quickly would likely be harmful) and grazingshould be performed at night or in shaded pasturesto prevent photosensitization in predisposed horses.Horses with severe liver disease and concurrent in-sulin dysregulation or those prone to laminitisshould not have uncontrolled grazing on potentiallyhigh water-soluble carbohydrate (fructan and sim-ple sugars) pastures unless appetite is poor. As-suming the horse with liver disease is still eating,the above outlined combination of grains and for-ages might be able to maintain glucose within anormal range, decrease hepatic work necessary forglycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and hopefullyallow the horse to maintain body condition. Horseswith liver failure that are anorexic may need to besupplemented by forced enteral feeding (especiallyponies, miniature horses, and donkeys with hepaticlipidosis) or by continual intravenous administra-tion of 5% glucose with potassium chloride, B vita-mins, and supplemental protein. 178 There are no evidence-based guidelines available for dietary protein feeding in horses with liver fail-ure. In horses with liver failure and neurologicsigns of HE, it can be assumed that the amount ofprotein in the diet should initially be restricted.The old concept of providing a low protein diet to allanimals with chronic liver failure with no evidenceof HE is no longer believed to be standard of care inother species and should be considered in horses aswell. With HE, it can be assumed that the amountof protein in the diet should initially be restricted inhopes of preventing or decreasing hyperammone-mia. Feeding a low-protein feed to horses with hy-perammonemia may decrease enteric production ofammonia and concentration of proteins that may bemetabolized to ammonia or other neurotoxins, whichare believed to contribute to HE. It is, however,important to maintain adequate energy supply byfeeding carbohydrates (as discussed above) and fat(except with hyperlipemic conditions) to horses withliver failure, or there could be sufcient breakdownof muscle protein to cause an increase in blood am-monia. It is also very important that horses withliver disease have adequate fluid volume (either self-drinking or interventional fluids) to maintain hydra-tion and sufcient dietary potassium which maydecrease resorption of ammonia from the kidneys. 255 The gut, liver, muscle, and kidney are all involved inregulating blood ammonia concentrations! There is some evidence that feeding BCAAs (va- line, leucine, and isoleucine) and increasing theBCAA-to-aromatic-amino-acid ratio (AAA) can behelpful with the treatment of liver disease, liverfailure, and HE in humans. 278The rationale for recommending BCAA in the treatment of liver fail-ure is based on their unique metabolic and pharma-cologic properties; muscle metabolism for energyand stimulatory effect toglutamine by muscle rather than hepatic metabo-lism. 269In horses with PA toxicity or in foals with toxic hepatopathy there was an increase in concen-tration of AAA without increases in BCAA. 150,279 Although BCAA treatment for severe liver disease isoften recommended, there is no published data toconrm their benet in treating horses with liverdisease and in humans with HE the evidence isrelatively low. 269A proper dose of BCAA in horses with liver disease is also not known and excessiveamounts could actually enhance ammonia produc-tion from excessive glutamine breakdown in the in-testine and the kidneys, worsening HE. 269I have, therefore, generally taken a conservative approachwith BCAA supplementation, recommending 10g/adult horse every 12 hours. The BCAA can begiven as a commercial paste product or if the horse isstill eating, sorghum and soaked beet pulp can befed as these concentrate sources have a relativelyhigh BCAA:AAA ratio. Corn also has a high BCAA:AAA ratio but if unprocessed has a decreased pre-cecal carbohydrate digestibility compared with theother two products. Sugar supplemented beet pulpcan be offered to diminish total protein intake, yetprovide a high BCAA:AAA ratio and a digestibleenergy equal to oats, but with less fluctuation in 96 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREglucose and insulin.280Sugar beet pulp feeding may also stimulate conversion of ammonia into urea.281Beet pulp should be adequately soaked pre-feeding to decrease chances of esophageal chokeand to provide critically important fluids. BCAAfeeds or products may be of greatest benet inhorses with clinical signs of HE. If the horse haschronic liver disease but no signs of HE then anormal-protein diet with sufcient quality of com-prehensive and balanced amino acids should be fed.As previously mentioned, providing low-protein dietto all animals with chronic liver failure is no longerbelieved to be standard of care in other species. 233 One benecial effect of long-term intake of proteinand specically BCAA in humans with liver cirrho-sis is likely related to improved muscle mass andnutritional status rather than to the ammonia-low-ering effect of BCAAs themselves. 269 Although fat is the most energy-rich food avail- able, the feeding of a high-fat diet to horses withliver disease may not be benecial. The absorptionof fat and fat-soluble vitamins may be hindered bydecreased bile acid secretion into the small intestinein horses with severe liver disease. Some amountof dietary fat is required to facilitate the absorptionof fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) that arestored in the liver. Some modest amount of supple-mental fat in the diet of horses with nonobstructiveliver disease would likely be appropriate and theextra energy will, at least in healthy horses, de-crease triglyceride concentrations and increase lipo-protein lipase activity. 282,283Adding oil to the diet of horses, especially those with severe liver disease,should be gradual and accompanied by additionalvitamin E supplementation. Although similar tondings in horses, feeding fat to healthy Shetlandponies decreases plasma triglycerides (likely by en-hanced lipoprotein lipase activity) but feeding fat toequines that have hyperlipemia/hepatic lipidosisdisorder is not recommended because there will beno further increase in lipoprotein lipase activity andfat feeding may enhance glucose intolerance andinsulin resistance. 283 Nutritional supplements that may have some ben- et in horses with severe liver disease are mostlythose that are normally stored in high concentrationin the liver (vitamins E and K, selenium and zinc),supplements that may decrease oxidative injury orinflammatory/brotic progression or ones that mayimprove metabolism. If the horse with chronicliver disease is still ingesting green forage, supple-mentation with vitamin A is not needed and exces-sive amounts may activate hepatic stellate cells andpromote brosis. 284If the affected horse is not eat- ing green forage then supplementation with beta-carotene and vitamin E are recommended. 143,285 Vitamin E should be supplemented with a solubleproduct at 5 IU/kg body weight daily or more ifsupplemental fat is being fed; B vitamins can beadministered orally. Additional supplements thathave been suggested for chronic liver disease inother species include SAM-e and n-3 polyunsatu-rated fatty acids in hopes of decreasing cellular ox-idation associated with free radicals. 286There is no proof of efcacy for these supplemental thera-pies in treating liver disease in the horse. Milkthistle supplements contain silymarin, which arebelieved to have antioxidant and other liver-pro-tecting actions and are commonly used in treatinghorses with chronic liver disease. The bioavail-ability of one preparation was found to be low inhealthy horses and only minor alterations in an-tioxidant capacity were found. 125,287Iron and copper supplements should not be given to horseswith liver disease as they may promote the Fentonreaction and trigger free radical damage to theliver. 143 Acknowledgments I would like to thank Drs.

Berk, VMD Author's address: Equine 40511; e-mail:jtberk5@aol.com. \u00a9 2015 AAEP. For veterinarians who focus on providing services to those who buy and sell Thoroughbreds both in train-ing and juveniles, there are many issues to consider.In addition to the obvious technical veterinary is-sues, there are other considerations, including clientselection and communication and ethical, legal, andreporting issues. First, the job description for veterinarians em- ployed by clients who wish to buy at a public auctionhas some features that are obvious and some thatare not so obvious. The actual physical examina-tion can be quite variable in terms of thoroughnessand depends upon the wishes of the buying client.The standard examination would include, at thevery least, an assessment of the horse's eyes, heart,external genitalia, and its overall body condition aswell as a visual and manual examination of each ofits four limbs. Part of the routine examination pro-cess would be watching the horse in motion to detect any subtle lameness or neurologic decits. Thispart of the examination will vary depending uponthe age of the horse. At a weanling or yearling saleit is customary to watch the horse walk and turn;at a sale of 2-year-olds in training or older horses intraining it is also customary to observe the horse atthe trot at the end of a shank. (Note: One aspectof the examination that is unique to a \"Horses ofRacing Age\" sale is the access to previous racing performances and public workouts in the sales cat-alog. Veterinarians should become familiar withhow to read and interpret this information to havean idea of the level of competition the horse has beenin and whether the horse has been competitive atthat level, whether the horse's performance hasbeen increasing or decreasing, and how that histor-ical information might affect the level of risk in-volved with the purchase of that horse.) In the process of completing a thorough physical examination, endoscopic examination of the upperairway, and radiographic examination of a standardset of images of the distal limbs, a list of ndings iscreated. That part is obvious. However, the merepresence of ndings does not necessarily disqualify agiven horse from consideration for a particular cli-ent. Many veterinarians will discover ndings thatthey may consider signicant and automatically \"fail\" the horse and remove it from consideration forpurchase. This is essentially deleting an importantstep in the communication process, as if the client istotally averse to risk. The most effective outcome isreached when the ndings, once discovered, have alevel of risk attached to them by the veterinarianand a complete discussion about the ndings and therisk they pose is had with the client. This part of 104 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM AND SALES NOTESthe process goes hand in hand with the veterinari- an's understanding of each client's level of risk tol-erance. This is important because a thoroughexamination can reveal many ndings, some signif-icant, and yet a horse may still be a good candidatefor purchase if the client's risk tolerance is not ex-ceeded and the pricing is acceptable. If there is onething worse than a client buying a horse with aveterinary nding that ends up affecting the horse,it is when a client with a high risk tolerance passeson good horse after good horse, only to watch thosehorses compete at high levels for other owners later. The conversation about client selection goes hand in hand with that of client communication. In thecourse of communicating with clients, the levelof client understanding about veterinary issues be-comes apparent. If a client cannot understand theconcept of risk assessment and wants a rm yes orno/pass or fail type of veterinary input, that can be adifcult client for whom to work. That type ofveterinary/client interaction reduces the chances ofa successful outcome and puts more pressure andpotential legal exposure on the examining veterinar-ian. The veterinarian may decide that such a clientdoes not t his or her comfort level and decline to doany further work for that client. Ethical issues, particularly those related to con- flicts of interest, are commonly encountered by vet-erinarians dealing with the sale of horses. Both atpublic auctions and private sales, it is not unusualfor veterinarians to be placed in a position wherethey are asked to do a pre- or post-sale evaluation ofa particular horse by a long-standing client, only todiscover that the seller of that horse is also a pre-existing client. Because this situation is sometimes unavoidable, it is incumbent upon the veterinarian tohave a protocol for handling such situations that dem-onstrates both transparency and honesty. First, re-garding transparency, veterinarians should alwaysdisclose to a potential buying client that they havebeen responsible for the care of the horse in questionand offer the client the option to enlist the services ofanother veterinarian. The buyer will often be com-fortable with their veterinarian despite the pre-existing relationship. There is a perceived advantagebecause the veterinarian knows the horse to somedegree by virtue of having been its caretaker. A prob-lem arises when the horse has experienced health orsoundness issues that have been attended to by theveterinarian. The dilemma for veterinarians in thesecases is that they possess information that has beenobtained on behalf of the seller. That information hasbeen paid for by the seller and is technically owned bythe seller. When working for buyers, veterinariansoften possess information that may affect the suitabil-ity of the horse for a particular buyer and yet cannotlegally transmit that information to that buyer. In asituation like this, it would be prudent for the veteri-narian to ask the buyer to use another veterinarian.With regard to honesty, the ndings obtained duringthe examination are just that\u2014ndings\u2014and shouldbe communicated to the buyer and seller in an identi-cal manner and expressed with the same degree ofsignicance. This becomes easier when ndings areplaced in risk categories and when that level of risk isclearly explained to both parties. Another issue is that of radiographic tech- nique. This has both technical and ethical aspects.Whether the purchaser's veterinarian is actually tak-ing the radiographs during the course of the examina-tion or reading the radiographs taken by anotherveterinarian, a proper evaluation of the standardviews of the skeletal system cannot be done if theimages are inadequate. Poor positioning, motion, in-adequate technique, and missing views make it impos-sible to visualize the areas of interest, i.e., areas wherepathology would commonly occur. This is a commonproblem at public auctions, where radiographs housedin a radiographic repository may vary widely in qual-ity. In cases where there are missing or inadequateviews, a veterinarian reviewing the images must ei-ther obtain retakes of these poor-quality views if timepermits or report to the client that the images cannotbe used to evaluate the horse adequately. The ethicalaspect to this issue is that there are abundant educa-tional materials available for veterinarians to learnhow to take a full set of good radiographs (see re-sources provided by the American Association ofEquine Practitioners [AAEP] at http://www.aaep.org)so there is no excuse for lack of acceptable quality. There has been much discussion about radio- graphic reports generated by sellers' veterinariansfor the radiographic repository, what they mean,and consequently how reliable they are. There aretwo schools of thought on the part of the veterinar-ians who generate these reports. One group re-cords the ndings seen in areas where pathologywould commonly occur, a sort of cataloguing of nd-ings irrespective of perceived signicance. Othersrecord only those ndings they consider signicantand basically list all other joints as NSF (no signif-icant ndings). The latter method fails to addressthe fact that each buying client has his or her ownlevel of risk tolerance and intended purpose for thehorses that he or she buys, so an omission of infor-mation may render the report less than useful.The former method creates a need for a higher levelof communication between veterinarian and buyerin which the veterinarian, based on his or her un-derstanding of the client's unique risk tolerance, canguide the client in the purchase of any individualhorse. This is precisely why the use of the radiographic reports as a marketing tool in the back walking ringat public auctions is inappropriate and puts bothconsignor and veterinarian at risk of increased legalexposure. Regardless of how they are written, ra-diographic reports are essentially subjective in na-ture. They are not like a Carfax report, and nomatter how diligent a veterinarian is in accuratelydescribing all ndings, there will always be an ele-ment of opinion in each report. Legal counsel ad- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 105IN-DEPTH: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM AND SALESvises that these reports be a complete and accurate report of all ndings to minimize legal exposure.There are some aspects to legal exposure regardingradiographic reports at public auction that are coun-terintuitive and will be discussed by attorneysCasey and Meuser. There are currently no recognized guidelines for generating these reports. If veterinarians are to beheld to a standard of reporting all ndings, it isincumbent upon the sales companies to make thatstandard known so that the vets can comply. Cre-ating a standard for reporting ndings would poten-tially require a group of qualied individuals tostudy the issue and compile a list of reportable nd-ings for the knees, hocks, stifles, front and hindfetlocks of sales horses. Joints absent of those nd-ings on the list could be notated as \"No Findings\"(thus eliminating the word \"signicant\" which isproblematic for legal reasons.) The cataloguing ofreportable ndings would be presumably basedupon available veterinary scientic literature. The potential use of videoendoscopy of the upper airway at public auctions has been discussed byveterinarians and consignors over the last few years.Although not currently in usage at sales in theUnited States, throat videos have become commonat European sales, particularly in France. Thetopic has resurfaced recently within consignorgroups and is currently under consideration for in-clusion in repository settings. Several years ago,an AAEP task force set forth criteria for videoendo-scopic examination of the upper airway, and pre-sumably these criteria will be applied if and whenthroat videos are utilized at sales. Videoendoscopyof the upper airway, whether used in public or pri-vate sales, can be useful from the standpoint ofarchiving the form and function of the throat at thetime of purchase examination. Given the possibil-ity of changes in throat function over time, the saveddynamic images may be helpful from both a diag-nostic and legal standpoint. In conclusion, it is incumbent upon veterinarians working in a public auction setting to become famil-iar with not only the technical aspects of performinga thorough pre-purchase examination within a verylimited time frame but also the communication, eth-ical, and legal issues surrounding that environment.

For sport horse practitioners, pre-purchase exami- nations are a particularly important service inwhich veterinarians play the role of clinician andadvisor in the decision to purchase a particular horse. These transactions are frequently both nancially andemotionally signicant for the buyer, and the decisionsare, in large measure, contingent on the veterinarian'sclinical expertise and understanding of the specicdiscipline or industry for which the horse is intended. Pre-purchase examinations are an opportunity for clinicians to provide highly valued information that,in time, can help to develop and nurture a strongdoctor-client relationship. Conversely, pre-purchaseexaminations have the potential to make that bondmore tenuous should the outcome, for whatever rea-son, be perceived as unsatisfactory. From a businessperspective, a thorough pre-purchase examination canbe a signicant source of revenue provided the veteri-narian is appropriately compensated for his or her time in performing the clinical examination, acquiringand interpreting the images, and communicating withclients. It is particularly important when performing pre- purchase examinations to have a complete under-standing of the client's objectives in purchasing ahorse. Horses may be purchased for pleasure, ath-letic endeavors, and investment purposes, and theclient's goals in owning a particular horse should guide the nature and extent of the examination.In sport horse practice, the majority of the pre-pur-chase examinations are performed on horses in-tended to compete at some level of athletic activity.In addition, many of the clients have a professionaltrainer. In my opinion, it is the responsibility ofthe trainer\u2014not the veterinarian\u2014to advise thepurchaser on price and on the physical ability orsuitability of the horse for its prospective owner andrider. These variables should have been discussedand agreed upon before the veterinarian becomesinvolved in the transaction, and the pre-purchaseexam should be performed in an effort to establishwhether the horse is physically capable of perform-ing at the intended level of athletic activity. In my practice, we frequently perform pre-pur- chase examinations on horses that have had exten-sive athletic careers and have, as a consequence, acquired some degree of wear and tear. An impor-tant and often difcult feature of pre-purchase ex-aminations is the ability of the veterinarian to formand convey an opinion as to whether the nature andextent of specic exam ndings are likely to preventa horse from continuing to perform at the intendedlevel for an acceptable period of time. Being able toformulate such an opinion requires clinical experi- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 107IN-DEPTH: PRE-PURCHASE EXAM AND SALES NOTESence, a thorough understanding of the discipline in which the horse will compete, and a complete under-standing of the buyer's expectations. For example,a client may be willing to purchase an experiencedequitation horse knowing full well that horse mayhave a prior injury or some degree of degenerativejoint disease, because the horse is known to be safeand reliable and will be competitive at specicevents. For such buyers, a horse's reliability andsafety may be acceptable tradeoffs for durability,and it is important for veterinarians to have thatunderstanding to offer effective and appropriateadvice. There are a multitude of ways of performing the actual clinical examination. It is important forpractitioners to develop their own routine thatis thorough, repeatable, and appropriate for thehorse's intended discipline or use. The same is truefor ancillary testing such as lab work and imaging.The extent of the radiographic evaluation should beappropriate for the horse's intended use. Addi-tional modalities, such as survey ultrasounds andupper airway endoscopy, should be made availableand performed based upon the results of the clinicalexamination and the clinician's opinion as to therelevance of the information to be acquired. Be-cause imaging is frequently one of the most costlyline items in pre-purchase examinations, it is oftenuseful to discuss options and cost estimates withbuyers in advance. As with the rest of the exami-nation, it is important to understand and meet theclients' expectations. Invariably, information arises that will be sub- ject to the clinician's interpretation. Scars, radio-graphic abnormalities, and positive flexion tests areall clinical ndings that veterinarians will be askedto interpret to best advise their clients. There arevery few absolutes, and the veterinarian's opinionwill likely be shaped over time by clinical experi-ences. If the veterinarian has uncertainty aboutspecic ndings, it is valuable to have resources toconsult. In my opinion, clinicians who perform pre-purchase examinations should not hesitate to availhim or herself to additional opinions when needed.These are often \"mentor\" veterinarians who are ei-ther employers or colleagues in the industry and areavailable for additional expertise or simple counsel.It is important to acknowledge that the summariesof most pre-purchase examinations will be the vet-erinarian's best estimate and that there is oftensome degree of uncertainty about specic ndings.In these instances, it is helpful for practitioners toprovide information about the relative risks associ-ated with specic ndings and the available reme-dies in the event of an unwanted or unanticipatedoutcome. Pre-purchase examinations are challenging be- cause they require practitioners to perform a thor-ough clinical examination and to interpret thendings in a concise and meaningful way. It is anopportunity to provide a valuable service to clients,both professional and amateur, provided the clini-cian has a thorough understanding of the specicathletic discipline and of the client's objectives.In addition, it is a valuable learning tool because theclinical exam and image ndings can be referred toas an individual horse's career progresses.

Hart, DVM, DVM, DACVP Authors' addresses: Departments of Large Animal Medicine (Hart) and Pathology (Camus),University of Georgia, College of Veterinary Medicine, Athens, GA 30602; e-mail:khart4@uga.edu. *Corresponding and presenting author. \u00a9 2015 AAEP. 1. Introduction Knowledge of the white blood cell (WBC) count and differential distribution of the leukogram isintegral to correctly diagnosing and treating dis-ease in any ill animal. In ambulatory equinepractice, obtaining this information typically re-quires submitting a complete blood count (CBC) toa diagnostic laboratory, and is often associatedwith a delay of a day or more until the results areavailable. This can delay appropriate diagnosisand initiation of therapy and ultimately can affectthe patient's prognosis. Although board-certied veterinary clinical pa- thologists are the most qualied to perform de-tailed microscopic analysis of blood and othersamples, general practitioners can use simpletechniques and inexpensive tools to make a pe-ripheral blood smear from the CBC tube and usethis to rapidly estimate the WBC mass and differ-ential. This information can help practitionersmake a tentative diagnosis and institute appropri-ate therapy without delay while awaiting conr-matory results from the laboratory. The sametools can also be used for other cytologic applica-tions in practice, ultimately improving patientcare and client satisfaction due to decreased de- lays in treatment while providing additional in-come through billable services. Even in a referral institution with an in-house clinical pathology service during routine hours,evaluation of blood smears and cytologic samplesfrom out-of-hours cases can very useful to ex-pediently conrm presumptive diagnoses and ini-tiate appropriate treatment. The goals of thissession are to demonstrate how to make and in-terpret a peripheral blood smear to estimate theWBC mass and differential in equine samples, andto illustrate common leukocyte abnormalities en-countered in equine The accuracy ofbench-top CBC analyzers at providing a differen-tial cell count varies substantially among models:some impedance counters are only able to providea total WBC count, whereas flow cytometer modelscan provide an extremely accurate differential.However, even with top-of-the-line equipmentwith excellent cell type differentiation, a manualdifferential and peripheral blood smear interpre-tation is considered standard of care in veterinaryclinical pathology laboratories to ensure that im-portant cytologic neutrophils, toxic changes in leukocytes, or neoplastic cells are not missed. 2. Materials and Methods There are a number of different ways to prepare andstain a peripheral blood smear, 1and as long as the chosen method produces a \"feathered edge\" and aregion where the cells are spread in a monolayer(Fig. 1), the particular method used is really a mat-ter of personal preference. The method describedbelow has been compiled from best practices used byclinical pathology and large-animal internal medi-cine personnel in our hospital who routinely prepareand evaluate peripheral blood smears in routine andemergent cases. What you will need: A properly lled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anti-coagulated blood sample(purple top tube) from the patient Plain glass microhematocrit tubes (no heparin)or two wooden-handled Q-tips Two glass microscope slides and coverslips Commercial hematology stain set (any stain inthe Romanowsky family of stains is acceptable.) A microscope, minimally with a 10/H11003 objective a n da4 0 /H11003objective, and ideally with a 100/H11003 (oil immersion) objective. There are a num-ber of reasonably priced ($400-800), easy-to-use microscopes suitable for general use inclinical practice. Preparation of the Blood Smear 1. Blood smears should be made within 2 hours of collection to prevent artifacts that altercell morphology. Store the sample in arefrigerator if you cannot make the smear immediately. Make sure the sample isbrought back to room temperature prior tomaking slides and that the slides themselvesare never refrigerated. 2. Mix the sample by repeated inversion for 30-60 seconds if recently collected, or for 3-5minutes if it has been refrigerated. 3. Place one microscope slide on the table with a long side facing you. 4. Partially ll the microhematocrit tube with blood OR dip a wooden-handled applicatorstick into the well-mixed blood tube. 5. Place a small drop of blood on the slide approx- imately 0.5 cm from the short end of the slideclosest to your dominant hand. 6. Take a second slide (pusher slide), hold it on the long sides fairly close to one short end, and gently touch it at an approximately 30\u00b0angle onto the rst slide, adjacent to theblood drop. 7. Slowly back the pusher slide into the blood drop, wait while the blood spreads to the edgeof the slide, then gently and smoothly push thepusher slide across the rst slide in one smoothmotion to the end of the slide. a. Do not push down: the weight of the slide alone will spread the blood. b. If you must make additional smears, you may reuse the pusher slide as long as you donot reuse the same edge that was used topush the blood on the rst attempt. 8. Dry the slide immediately by waving it in the air to prevent crenation of the cells. Staining of the Blood Smear There are a number of different ways to stain bloodsmears and cytologic preparations, 1but for general applications a three-step Romanosky-type stainsuch as Wright's stain is simplest and most useful.This generally will stain proteins pink, DNA/nucleipurple, and bacteria and fungi blue. Follow themanufacturer's directions for specic stains. If youplan to stain and \"dirty\" samples (e.g., fe-cals, transtracheal washes, abscess aspirates, etc.),it is helpful to keep two sets of stain: one for cleansamples such as blood smears, and one for the likelycontaminated samples listed above. In addition,make sure to store and change out your stain prop-erly according to the manufacturers' protocols, toavoid contamination with bacteria, fungus, or stainprecipitate that can impair your ability to analyzeyour stained samples. In our laboratory, we use a stain with the follow- ing basic protocol: 1. Once slide is air dried, hold it by one short end away from the sample and dip it in the xative(clear or light blue) for 10-20 dips (/H1101115 s), Fig. 1. Diagram of the regions of a peripheral blood smear. Thegray area at one end of the slide represents the frosted end thatis included for easier labeling on some slides; your slides may ormay not include a frosted end. The \"butt end\" is the area wherethe drop of blood was initially placed before being smeared by thepusher slide. 110 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYthen blot the short end opposite to the one you are holding on a paper towel. 2. Dip the slide in the stain (pink), for 10-20 dips (/H1101115 s) and blot the short end again. 3.

Air dry again by waving in the air before view- ing under the microscope, and label it with thepatient name or number on one edge awayfrom the smear. Examination of the Blood Smear 1. Visually examine the slide to determine the best area for microscopic examination (Fig.1). 2. Place the slide on the microscope stage, and focus on it using the lowest power objective (4/H11003or 10/H11003). Find an edge of the smear near thebutt end and then quickly scan the wholesmear from butt end to feathered edge to notecell clumps and thin areas. 3. Using the 10/H11003 objective, examine the feath- ered edge. Big things such as platelet clumpsand large cells get dragged out to the featherededge. Equine platelets frequently clump inEDTA anticoagulant, which can cause the au-tomated platelet count to be falsely low. Ifyou see platelet clumping, do not panic over alow platelet count on a CBC. 4. Now move three to four 10/H11003 elds back into the smear, to the monolayer, assuming thatthe patient is not anemic. This is wherecellular morphology is best evaluated andwhere the differential WBC count is best per-formed. You can tell you are at the rightpart of the slide when erythrocytes are closetogether but not touching (Fig. 2). If youcannot nd an area like this on the slide,make another smear and try again. 5. Place a coverslip on the slide and change to the 40/H11003 objective. The coverslip is important be-cause it is required for the 40/H11003 objective to focus properly. Scan back and forth across the short axis of the slide, noting the following:a. Do you see platelets? Are they clumped? You should see 15-20 plateletsper eld at this magnication unless theyare severely clumped. 2 b. Examine leukocyte morphology. i.

Perform a 100-cell differential cell count by scanning back and forth across the shortaxis of the slide (Fig. 3). This will requireeither an actual differential counter, or adifferential worksheet where you make ahash mark next to each cell type as youscan, then tally up the number in each cat-egory when you reach 100 (see Appendix 1). 6. Optional: change to 100/H11003 (oil) objective to evaluate:a. Erythrocyte morphology: size and shape, and presence of any parasites or Heinzbodies Fig. 2.

Note: if you elect to use an oil immersion objective for higher magnication, take care not to go back to the 40/H11003 objective without thoroughly cleaning the oil off the slidebychanging to a new coverslip, or by wip-ing the coverslip with lens cleaner andlens paper. If oil gets on the the 40/H11003objective, it will damage it and render itunusably blurry without removal andproper cleaning. 3. Results The above methodology is recommended for use inthe eld because it is quick, inexpensive, and userfriendly. Below are three case examples that exem-plify applications of this technique and commonlyencountered leukocyte abnormalities encountered inequine practice. Case 1: Peripheral blood smear from an 18-year-old Quarter Horse gelding with colitis(Fig. 4). Case 2: Peripheral blood smear from a5-year-old Warmblood mare with fever anddistal limb edema (Fig. 5). Case 3: Peripheral blood smear from a9-month-old Saddlebred foal with fever andcough (Fig. 6). Estimation of peripheral leukocyte counts from analysis of blood smears can be inaccurate. Whenseven experienced laboratory personnel in our labo-ratory analyzed the same 10 blood smears from dif-ferent species in a prospective study, estimatedWBC count varied substantially among personnel(coefcient of variation, 13-43%), and less than halfthe samples were acceptably consistent with WBCsdetermined with the gold standard automated cellcounter. aSources for error include different count- ing areas, counting broken cells, and variation inmicroscope aperture size. As a result of our study,WBC estimates are now interpreted qualitatively inour laboratory (e.g., low/normal/high) and quantita-tive estimates are no longer given. Thus, imple-mentation of this technique in your practice shouldcomplement rather than replace automated com-plete blood counts. 4. Discussion Preliminary evaluation of a peripheral bloodsmear is a simple procedure than can be per-formed quickly in a eld setting and does notrequire expensive equipment. Information re-garding total leukocyte mass, leukocyte differen-tial, platelet mass, and even detection of someinfectious organisms can be gleaned with this pro-cedure, facilitating clinical decision making aboutthe need for additional diagnostics, and permit- ting initiation of appropriate therapy without hav-ing to wait for the results of send-out tests. The necessary microscope can also be used to perform Fig. 4.

Pleu- ral effusion samples may be collected when an effu-sion is suspected, e.g., when the patient hasdifculty breathing because of a large volume offluid or when a signicant volume of effusion hasbeen detected during diagnostic imaging. Pleuro-pneumonia is the most common pathologic processassociated with pleural effusions in horses. Ana-lyzing the pleural fluid is important for assessingthe severity and pattern of inflammatory responseas well as for detecting the presence and type ofmicroorganisms. Cytologic evaluations are alsoimportant for detecting the presence and type ofneoplastic cells in patients in which neoplasia is the underlying mechanism for the pleural effusion. Evaluating body cavity fluids consists of an initial visual assessment, with more specic informationobtained by a cytologic evaluation. The intent ofthis article is to provide the practitioner with infor-mation on how to perform a cytologic evaluation of abody fluid sample, specically peritoneal or pleuralfluid samples. 2.

Visual Assessment The gross appearance of the peritoneal fluid is therst stage in evaluating a fluid sample. Normalperitoneal fluid appears clear and light yellow inappearance (Fig. 1). Fluid from patients with gas-trointestinal rupture will often appear green-brownin color, with varying degrees of cloudiness and pos-sibly particulates (Fig. 2). Patients with a strangu-lating intestinal lesion often have serosanguinousfluid as a result of varying amounts of erythrocytes(Fig. 3). Iatrogenic bleeding into the peritonealfluid can result from a blood vessel that penetratesthe skin or abdominal wall during the procedure orfrom an accidental splenic puncture during the tap,which results in a blood-tinged or bloody fluid sam-ple. Patients with a peritoneal inflammatory re-sponse (peritonitis) will have a cloudy, opaque fluidthat may vary from yellow to orange or red depend-ing on the number of erythrocytes present (Fig. 4).Enterocentesis can occur by accidental perforationof a viscus during abdominocentesis. The gross ap-pearance of enterocentesis can vary depending onthe character of the luminal content and extent ofadmixing with peritoneal fluid. Pleural fluid is often evaluated when an effusion associated with infectious pneumonia (pleuropneu-monia) is suspected or when there is clinical and/ordiagnostic imaging that indicates a pleural effusionof unknown cause. The gross appearance of pleuralfluid with pleuropneumonia can vary depending onthe extent of lung injury. Many will have a suppu-rative (cloudy yellow) appearance, whereas otherswith more severe lung necrosis may have a cloudyreddish appearance. Pleural fluid samples frompatients with neoplastic disease of the pleural cavitycan vary in appearance depending on the process.Lymphoma that involves the cranial mediastinallymph nodes and other thoracic lymph nodes is oftenassociated with a serosanguinous appearance. Insome lymphoma patients, pleural fluid may appearyellow with variable cloudiness depending on thedegree of cellularity. In some patients with pri-mary neoplasia, suppurative inflammation can oc-cur from necrosis of the neoplasm or secondaryinfection and obscure the diagnosis; thus, cytologicevaluation is critical in making the correctdiagnosis. Routine body fluid analysis before cytologic eval- uation includes a total nucleated cell count and totalprotein concentration (or total solids via refractom-etry). Most normal body cavity fluids (peritoneal Fig. 1. Normal peritoneal fluid appearance is clear with varia-tion in degree of yellow color. Fig. 2. Peritoneal fluid from a horse with gastrointestinal rup-ture. Note the green-brown color with /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYand pleural) have a total protein concentration of less than 2.5 g/dL.3,5Total nucleated cell counts are considered normal if there are less than 5,000cells/ /H9262L. Peritoneal fluid from normal foals will have lower total nucleated cell counts (/H110211,500 cells/ /H9262L).5The goal of fluid analysis has traditionally been to place the fluid into a pathophysiologic group-ing: transudate, exudate, or low-cellularity (/H110215,000cells/ /H9262L) erythrocytes. Beyond the visual assessment of a fluid sample, microscopic evaluation of the cytology can providecritical information of the pathophysiologic processand aid clinical decisions. Consideration should begiven to whether the cytologic evaluation will beperformed in house or transported to a referencelaboratory for evaluation. If transporting the sam-ples, it is helpful to prepare direct smears to be sentalong with the fluid sample. If shipping biopsyspecimens, formalin-xed tissues should be trans-ported in a separate container because formalinfumes will alter the cytologic features of cells onglass slides, making interpretation difcult. Techniques for Slide Preparation and Staining For most normal body cavity fluids, the cellularitywill be low (/H110215,000 cells/ /H9262L), and a direct will be difcult (Fig. 5). Con- Fig. 3.

The turbidity is associated with a high /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 117HOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYcentration of a specimen can be performed by using a regular centrifuge with low gravity (centrifuge5-10 mL of fluid for 5 minutes at 1,000-1,500 rpm)or a cytocentrifuge (Fig. 6). For such normal fluidsamples, it is rare that there will be clinically sig-nicant cytologic ndings. More commonly, theidentication of a protein a good-quality (cellular mono-layer) smear on a glass slide is an important rststep. The most common difculty in evaluatinghighly cellular fluids is making a smear too thicksuch that staining is inadequate and observing cel-lular features is impossible. Slide preparation us-ing the push technique, which is similar to what isused for peripheral blood smears, is nicely describedin the literature. 6A drop of fluid is placed on a glass microscope slide, and the edge of a second slideis slid backward until the fluid spreads along thejunction of the two slides. The spreader slide isthen pushed forward to create a smear. It is usefulto create a margin (\"feathered edge\") that is at least1/4 the way from the end of the slide to allow themicroscope objective to reach it when the slide isplaced on the microscope stage. In practice, it is help-ful to prepare 3 to 5 slides so that a representativeevaluation of the fluid can be made. Slides shouldthen be air-dried and stained with a Romanowsky-type stain ato allow for evaluation and observation of cellular features (Fig. 7). Cytologic Examination Process The cytologic examination should take into accountthe total nucleated cell count and total protein con-centration as well as the clinical parameters of thepatient. To perform a cytologic examination, oneshould begin with a cursory screening of the slide onthe low-magnication (4/H11003) objective of the micro-scope. This will allow the examiner to gain an ini-tial impression of the overall cellularity of thesmear. Once regions of cellular interest or otherfeatures are identied, the examiner can apply im-mersion oil and then switch to the oil objective(100/H11003) for closer viewing of the area or object ofinterest. Following this pattern in evaluating aslide will ensure complete evaluation of the entiresmear. Peritoneal Fluid Evaluation The initial step in cytologic evaluation is to deter-mine whether the sample is representative of theactual constituents of the body cavity effusion.Blood contamination during the procedure is oftendetected by observing the fluid as it is being col-lected. This usually results in increased erythro-cyte numbers as well as platelets observed on theslide. Enterocentesis can also alter the cytologicndings and complicate the clinical evaluation when Fig. 5. Direct smear of normal peritoneal fluid (200 /H11003). The low cellularity of normal peritoneal fluid will make searching for cellsa difcult, tedious process, as demonstrated by the lone nucleatedcell and few erythrocytes in this direct smear. Fig. 6.

Enterocentesis may result in the pres-ence of protozoal organisms, plant material, andmixed bacterial organisms on the smear (Fig. 8).The task of the clinician is to differentiate entero-centesis from gastrointestinal rupture. The clini-cal condition of the patient combined with thediscovery of some neutrophils with cellular featuresconsistent with sepsis may be helpful in determiningthe presence of rupture if sufcient time has passedsince the rupture for an inflammatory response tooccur. In many cases of rupture, actual intact neu-trophils are rare. Cloudy peritoneal fluid samples typically have an increased nucleated cell count. The next step isdetermining the types of nucleated cells in thesmear. Normal peritoneal (Fig. 9) and pleural flu-ids contain a slight predominance of nondegenerateneutrophils with lesser to almost equal numbers ofmononuclear cells (which can be made up of macro-phages and mesothelial cells) followed by lympho-cytes. With inflammation, the percentage ofneutrophils increases according to the intensity ofthe inflammatory stimulus (Fig. 10). Cytologic dif-ferentiation between a septic and nonseptic exudateis a traditional process based on identifying micro-organisms in the cytology. An extensive micro-scopic search should be undertaken for evidence ofsepsis in fluid samples with elevated total nucleatedcell counts. Degenerative changes in the neutro-phils that suggest the presence of sepsis includechanges such as karyolysis, which is characterized Fig. 7.

When observed, it is important to per-form a detailed search for microorganisms. Al-though this classication of septic versus nonsepticfluids is based on identifying microorganisms (Fig.11, B) in the cytology, fluids with markedly elevatednumbers of neutrophils are generally considered aspotentially septic for clinical management. Thepresence of phagocytized microorganisms stronglysupports body cavity sepsis. Neutrophils can en-gulf extracellular bacteria that are present fromsituations such as enterocentesis while in EDTA-anticoagulated tubes over time, thus creating arti-factual intracellular bacteria. This can happen ifthe fluid sample is stored for a prolonged period oftime (truck or transport) prior to making a smear.Thus, it is valuable to make a smear as soon aspossible after sample collection to avoid such arti-factual ndings. In such circumstances, it is alsoimportant to search for other evidence of degenera-tive changes within neutrophils to differentiate exvivo engulfment of bacteria from true bacterialphagocytosis associated with a septic process. Thetype of microorganisms present may serve as a guideto the origin of the peritonitis. Mixed types of or-ganisms suggest gastrointestinal origin or contami-nation from enterocentesis. Single organisms suchas paired cocci may suggest an internal abscess.In postpartum mares, uterine tears are a commonproblem, and cytologic evaluation should include asearch for meconium fragments and squamousepithelial cells that could support the diagnosis(Fig. 12). Mesothelial cells are occasionally seen in body cavity fluids as individual cells or in cohesive sheets.Reactive mesothelial cells are frequently seen ininflammatory effusions and often require differenti-ation from neoplastic cells and thus been calledthe \"great impersonator\" (Fig. 13, A-C).

Cytologic evaluation is im-portant in attempting to make a diagnosis beforeexploratory surgery. Lymphoma is common in thehorse; however, neoplastic lymphoid cells may notappear in the peritoneal fluid as commonly as theydo in the pleural fluid (Fig. 14). In some cases,there is a secondary inflammatory response with apredominance of neutrophils. Squamous cell carci-noma of the nonglandular region of the stomach(Fig. 15) is another neoplasm that may involve theabdominal cavity and can be diagnosed while cyto-logically evaluating the peritoneal fluid.

Ma-lignant squamous cells can be identied by cytoplas-mic keratin formation and often appear as large,bizarre cells that are asymmetrical in size with mul-tiple nuclei. Nuclear features of malignancy areabnormal nuclear chromatin patterns and multiplenucleoli. Mitotic gures, some of which appearatypical, also indicate neoplasia. Serosanguinous fluids can occur with strangulat- ing intestinal lesions as well as with exudates.Cytologic evaluation can aid in differentiating anactive hemorrhage from an iatrogenic one, in which Fig. 13.

A longer- standing hemorrhage may result in erythrophagocy-tosis (Fig. 16). Biochemical analysis of peritoneal fluid creatinine and electrolyte concentrations is the commonmethod for conrming uroperitoneum in neonatalfoals and, less commonly, in adults. Cytology isoccasionally useful in supporting the diagnosis.The key cytologic feature of urine contamination ofthe peritoneal space is the nding of calcium carbon-ate crystals (Fig. 17). Pleural Fluid Evaluation Evaluating pleural fluid most often involves animalswith effusions that have been detected with diagnos-tic imaging techniques (ultrasonography or radiog-raphy). Horses with pleuropneumonia should havethoracocentesis to (1) remove the fluid if excessivevolume is present such that lung expansion is com-promised and (2) differentiate septic effusion fromnonseptic parapneumonic be useful in further dening the pathologicprocess. Pleural fluid from horses with pleuropneumonia can change in gross appearance over time with mat-uration of the pleural inflammatory process. In theearly stages, a parapneumonic effusion of a slightlycloudy, yellow appearance can be seen. Cytologicevaluation of this stage may characterize the effu-sion as a nonseptic exudate. Changes may differbetween pleural spaces that depend on the inflam-matory process within that lung (Fig. 18). Withmore chronicity, pleural effusions can become from the pleural space,a direct appropriate for cytologicevaluation. With chronic brinopurulent pleuro-pneumonia, it is also important to evaluate the pleu-ral space with diagnostic imaging for the presence ofloculation, because this could result in variable cy-tologic changes between fluid pockets. Detectingpleural abscess during diagnostic imaging mightguide the fluid collection process for cytologicevaluation. Pleural effusions associated with lymphoma within the thoracic cavity often serosanguinous(Fig. 20). Neoplastic lymphoid cells can vary insize, but a predominance of large lymphoid cells orpremature stages suggests lymphoma (Fig. 14). Fig. 16.

Discussion Cytology of body fluids is a valuable technique for clinical practice. Although often associated withpersonnel trained in pathology, it is also some-thing clinical practitioners can perform them-selves. Practice in slide preparation andlearning the technique for slide scanning will al-low for obtaining quality information. Perform-ing cytology in house allows for a real-timeassessment of a fluid instead of the time requiredto transport it to a reference laboratory. Thetime required for an assessment will becomeshorter as the practitioner gains experience eval-uating cytologic smears. When beginning to eval- uate cytology of fluid samples in practice, it may beuseful to refer fluid samples to a clinical pathologistwhen there is some question as to the cellular in-flammatory patterns or when there are cells thatappear atypical or possibly having features consis-tent with neoplasia. Comparing the in-house obser-vations to the pathologist's descriptions can be auseful learning process. Currently available refer-ence texts provide excellent photos of common cyto-logic ndings that can help practitioners assess thesmear. 3,5The goal of the practitioner is to classify the type of effusion based on total nucleated cellcount and total protein concentration and then topursue further information regarding the cytologicevaluation. As with other clinical examinations(lameness, reproductive, etc.), developing a routineprocedure for evaluating a smear will give the clini-cian a sense of completeness. In certain situations,the smear will conrm clinical suspicions (e.g., equi subspecies equi orRhodococcus equi, where the microorganism might be observed during the cytology). In somepatients, the cytologic evaluation will provide thecritical piece of information in making a correct di-agnosis, such as a horse with cranial mediastinallymphoma with voluminous serosanguinous pleuraleffusion, ventral edema, and weight loss. Finer de-tails of smear evaluation of septic processes include Fig. 19. Thick, opaque, purulent exudate from a horse withpleuropneumonia with pleural abscess formation. Fig. 20. Serosanguinous pleural neutrophils, stain precipitates, and other debrisfrom bacterial structures. The process of evaluat-ing a body cavity fluid from the initial clinical exam-ination to collecting the fluid sample and visuallyassessing and then cytologically evaluating it canprovide a more complete understanding of thepathophysiologic mechanisms underway and guidethe medical or surgical treatment process moredirectly.

Introduction The dynamic physiologic changes and unique diet during the neonatal period contribute to distinctivefeatures in clinical pathologic parameters of healthyfoals relative to healthy adult horses. When re-porting results, most diagnostic laboratories onlyprovide reference ranges for mature horses. Thusfailure to recognize the unique differences that occurin foals relative to adult horses can lead to erroneousinterpretation of neonatal clinical pathologic values.Methodology can also profoundly affect the valuesreported in a reference range, which can lead toerroneous interpretation when extrapolating resultsbetween laboratories. Ideally, normal referenceranges for foals should be established within each diagnostic laboratory. However, funding limitationstypically preclude provision of this data. Thus, themain objective of this session is to review distinct fea-tures of common hematologic and serum biochemistryparameters in foals relative to mature horses. 2. Materials and Methods Medline, Pubmed, Agricola, and CAB databaseswere reviewed. Inclusion in this review was basedon clinical applicability. To avoid unnecessary du- plication, common themes in difference or trends ofdifferences were extracted for this review. Giventhat methodology can influence the reported valueor range of values, reference to absolute values willbe limited. When applicable, breed differences willbe noted. 3. Results Hematology Red Blood Cell Parameters Red blood cell parameters are highly dynamic dur- ing the neonatal period. In general, immediatelyafter birth, the red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglo-bin (Hgb) concentration, packed cell volume (PCV),and hemocrit (Hct) are similar to slightly greaterthan adult horses. 1-4However, in most breeds, within 48 hours, these values decrease and continueto decrease to the low end or below the referencerange for mature horses. 5For example, it is not atypical for the PCV to decrease in the rst 48 hoursof life from values of approximately 45 to 50% at AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 125HOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGY NOTESbirth to 35 to 40%, whereas absolute RBC counts do not decrease as dramatically.1-4The higher PCV at birth likely represents terminal placental trans-fer of blood and the physiologic stress of parturitioninducing splenic contraction. The initial rapid re-duction in PCV is due to a combination of adaptationto extrauterine life and hemodilution from bloodvolume expansion after ingestion colostrum.The PCV, Hct, and Hgb continue to gradually de-crease through the rst month of life, most oftenwith values falling in the low-normal adult range orsometimes, slightly below the adult range. 1-4The absolute RBC count often stays within the normaladult range; thus, the decrease in PCV is mostly dueto the fact that neonatal erythrocytes becomesmaller (i.e., microcytes) and remain relatively uni-form in size compared with adult RBCs. This isreflected in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV)values, which are similar to adult values at birth,and then gradually decrease, reaching a nadir be-tween 3 and 5 months that is below the adult range. 5 The MCV can remain lower than adults for up to ayear. 1Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentra- tion (MCHC) the Hgb concen-tration by the Hct and is more hemoglobin (MCH). In foals, themean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration tendsto be slightly lower to within normal limits relativeto adults. Thus, collectively and compared withadults, foals often seem to be mildly anemic withsmaller RBCs with less hemoglobin. This physio-logic anemia is common and seems to be due toreduced stimulus for erythrogenesis and decreasediron availability. 2,6Hypoxemia is a stimu- lus birth, foal RBCs with phoglycerate facilitates the release of oxygen deliv-ery to tissue; thus, greater concentrations in theneonate may curtail erythrogenesis. Serum ironand ferritin concentrations decrease rapidly in therst few and total iron-binding capacity isgreater in the neonatal foal than the adult and maybe due in part to the low iron content of milk versuscolostrum and depletion of fetal iron stores. 5,6The concurrent presence of microcytes is supportive ev-idence for functional iron deciency. Relative lackof iron availability and the physiologic anemia asso-ciated with it rarely result in clinical abnormalitiesin the neonatal period. However, it would be atyp-ical for the PCV to decrease below 20% in a foal or todecrease rapidly, in which case additional diagnos-tics would be warranted. In light of the fact thatfoals have functional iron deciency, they may bemore prone than adult horses to the development ofiron deciency anemia, especially if concurrent dis-ease is present. 7 It should be noted that breed differences have been noted particularly in RBC indices in horses.Although there have not been direct breed compar-isons within the same laboratory setting, compari-sons between studies suggest that physiologicanemia and the changes in RBC indices may be lessdramatic in draft breeds compared with light-breedhorses. 3In one study, the degree of anemia in Ara- bian foals during the rst year of life was morepronounced than in Thoroughbred or Quarter Horsefoals. 8Donkey foals follow the same trend as light breed foals.4,9 Leukogram Total leukocyte and absolute neutrophil counts tend to be the same or slightly exceed adult valueswhereas lymphocyte counts tend to be the same orbelow mature horse reference ranges during the rstday of life. During the rst few days, absolute lym-phocyte counts may fall below 1000/ /H9262L. The higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio may be due in part tothe endogenous release of cortisol at parturition.In fact, lack of parturition cortisol surge inotherwise-healthy premature foals is typically ac-companied by neutropenia at birth,wherein the severity of the neutropenia correlateswith the likelihood of survival. 10Lymphocyte counts can remain at or below the lower end of theadult reference range for the rst few months of life.However, foals are also more likely to experiencestress when handled for venipuncture and physio-logic lymphocytosis subsequent to catecholamine re-lease can result in a rapid increase in the totallymphocyte count. Band neutrophils are expectedto remain less than 250/ /H9262L during pe- riod. Eosinophils are typically absent. Coagulation Coagulopathy is common in critically ill neonates with one recent study reporting at least one abnor-mal coagulation parameter in 64% of foals with sep-tic shock. 11Standard testing of the coagulation system would include determining the many clini-cal pathologic parameters, methodology can directlyaffect the absolute values determined, and this isparticularly true for coagulation testing. Plateletcounts are most accurate if the blood is collected intosodium citrate as the anticoagulant. Plateletcounts are the same or slightly greater in foals dur-ing the rst few days of life and then comparablewith adult values. 12,13Likewise, the prothrombin and activated partial thromboplasin times are thesame or longer and brinogen concentrations arelower than the adult horse in the rst few days oflife. 11-13Fibrin degradation products concentra- tions are signicantly greater than adult horses forat least 2 weeks. 12,13Antithrombin activity is sig- nicantly lower during the rst month of life, withmean values approximately one half adult values atbirth. 12,13 /H11408Vol. 61 serum protein concentration varies consid- erably in the rst 24 to 36 hours, depending ontiming of absorption of colostral immunoglobulin.Presuckle total serum protein concentration is usu-ally less than 5 g/dL and thus would fall below thenormal adult reference range. Post-suckle total se-rum protein concentrations usually are greater than6 g/dL, but may remain in the low to slightly belowthe normal adult reference range for several weeks.Albumin concentrations tend to stay within thesame reference range as adult horses, thus thealbumin-to-globulin ratio is usually normal orslightly lower than adult horses. 14Although abso- lute total serum protein concentration is not a reli-able indicator of transfer of passive immunity, a lowalbumin-to-globulin ratio may be supportive evi-dence for partial or complete failure of passive trans-fer 14and should be veried by a more specic test for immunoglobulin concentration.ElectrolytesThe only subtle difference in sodium concentrationin foals relative to adult horses is that the serumsodium concentration might be at the lowest end ofthe normal adult reference range in the rst 24 to 48hours. This most likely is due to mild hemodilutionfollowing osmotic fluid expansion after absorption ofcolostral immunoglobulin. Otherwise, serum so-dium, potassium, duringthe neonatal period with no signicant differencesrelative to the mature adult horse. 15Serum inor- ganic phosphorus concentration is similar to adultvalues at birth, and then gradually increases overthe rst 2 months and may be slightly greater thanadult values during the rst year of life. 14For ex- ample, adult serum phosphorus values usually areless than 4 mg/dL, whereas foal phosphorusconcentrations can range between 6 and 8 mg/dL inthe rst year of life. Renal Serum creatinine values are often greater than adult values in the rst 24 to 36 hours of life withvalues of 4 to 5 mg/dL, and as high as 27 mg/dL,without concurrent evidence of renal dysfunc-tion. 14,16Endogenous serum creatinine is removed from fetal circulation via the placental circulation.Thus, higher creatinine values in the rst day of lifemore likely reflect placental dysfunction rather thanreflect primary renal disease. Furthermore, foalsusually do not urinate until they are between 6 and12 hours old, which also delays the clearance ofendogenous creatinine. Spurious hypercreatinine-mia is commonly reported in foals with 16However, foals with spurious hypercreatininemia without renal disease typicallyhave normal concurrent blood urea nitrogen concen-trations, and the serum creatinine concentration usually steadily decreases to normal values withinthe rst 72 hours of life. 16Creatinine concentra- tions frequently fall below 1.0 mg/dL in the well-hydrated and vigorously nursing foal. Blood ureanitrogen values are equivalent to adult values atbirth and then tend to drop below the lowest end ofnormal adult range (12 mg/dL) from the rst fewdays of life to 5 months of age. 14 Hepatic The liver serves many diverse roles in normal ho- meostasis including protein, lipid, and carbohydratemetabolism, vitamin storage, hematopoiesis, detox-ication, excretion. is greater inneonatal foals than mature horses, peaking in therst week (up to 5 mg/dL) and remaining increasedduring the rst 2 weeks of life. 14,17,18Unconju- gated bilirubin values are often two to four times theadult mean value during this time. Physiologic hy- perbilirubinemia of neonates is primarily caused byreduced availability bilirubin-binding proteinthat is responsible for hepatocellular uptake of bili-rubin and can be further exacerbated by anorexia.Physiologic hyperbilirubinemia, coupled with phys-iologic anemia during this period can be miscon-strued as evidence of hemolytic anemia. Bilirubinconcentrations in donkey foals tend not to be as highas horse foals and often are within adult donkeyreference range. 9,19 Foals have less stored hepatic glycogen than adult horses and are not yet hindgut fermenters. Thusglucose concentrations tend to be highly variable,depending on demand, stress, and nursing fre-quency. In general, glucose concentrations areusually greater than the normal adult values duringthe rst month of life, often exceeding twice theadult upper range of values. Likewise, serum trig-lycerides are highly variable and reflective of nurs-ing. Values may be as high as 340 mg/dL inhealthy foals in the rst few months of life, whenadult values rarely exceed 50 mg/dL. 14,17,18 In general, liver-associated enzymes are greater in neonatal foals and have larger standard devia-tions from the mean compared with adults. 18,20 The liver-specic enzymes sorbitol dehydrogenaseand gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) are eitherunaffected or slightly increased in the rst 2 weeksand increased between 1 and 4 weeks of life, respec-tively. 17,18,20Unlike ruminant neonates, there is little GGT in colostrum and thus, GGT levels do notcorrelate with transfer of passive immunity in foals.Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity is very high therst week of life (up to 3000 U/L) and remains two tofour times the adult mean range (64 to 214 U/L) forthe rst year of life. 14,17,21The relatively higher ALP activity of neonatal foals is primarily due to thebone SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYwith osteoblastic activity during rapid bone growth and bone stress. Bile acids concentration is frequently used as a functional assay of the liver.18Bile acids concen- trations are signicantly greater than mean adultvalues during the rst 6 weeks of life, with radioim-munoassay values exceeding enzymatically deter-mined values. 18Increased serum bile acids concentration in the neonatal period may be due toupregulation of hepatic production, reduced excre-tion into the bile, unique intestinal floral effects onthe bile-acid composition of the neonate, or en-hanced intestinal absorption or uptake from the por-tal circulation. Collectively, greater bilirubin and serum bile ac- ids concentrations and greater serum GGT, sorbitoldehydrogenase, and ALP activities in the neonatalperiod, could erroneously lead to a diagnosis of liverdisease. Muscle Enzymes Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity is pri-marily associated with muscle, although some ASTactivity is also found in the liver. In foals, ASTactivity tends to be the same or slightly lower thanadult values during the rst week of life, but valuestend to remain within adult reference ranges as theycontinue to exercise and grow. 14,20Creatine phos- phokinase activity is fairly comparable with adultranges, although variation in foals' normal rangesmay dip below adult values in the rst fewmonths. 14Increased creatine phosphokinase activ-ity with neonatalencephalopathy. 22 Endocrine At birth and during the rst few days of life, thyroidhormones (T 3and T4) are at least ten times (991 ng/dL and 29 /H9262g/dL) greater than adult horse val- ues. Both T3and T4values gradually decrease, approximating adults values by 2 weeks (T4)t o1 month of age (T3), although values may remain two times greater than adult values for the rst year oflife. 23-25 A cortisol surge in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone is an important physiologic event at par-turition in both the mare and foal. Adrenocortico-tropic hormone concentrations are greatest at birth(up to 968 pg/mL), 26,27rapidly decreasing within hours to approximate adult values within 48hours. Likewise, cortisol concentrations are alsohighest in the rst 30 minutes after birth (6 to 13 /H9262g/dL), but drop within 48 hours, often falling below mean adult horse values during the rst fewweeks of life. 26,27Premature foals have signi- cantly full-term foals, indicating dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.10 4. Discussion Relative to adult horses, there are several uniquefeatures of neonatal clinical pathologic parametersthat must be considered for accurate interpretation.Table 1. Common Unique Differences in Equine Neonatal Clinical Pathologic Parameters Relative to Adult Horses Parameter Interpretation Relative to Adult Reference Ranges Packed cell volume Lower for rst few months Mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrationLower for rst few months White blood cells Variable, but tend to be the same or slightly greater. Lymphopenia or lymphocytosis is not uncommon. Prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times Same or longer for rst few days Fibrinogen concentration Lower for rst few days Fibrin degradation products concentration Greater for rst two weeks Total serum protein concentration Lower for four to six weeks Serum globulin concentration Lower for four to six weeks Creatinine concentration May be greater for rst 48 hours, then drop below adult values Blood urea nitrogen concentration Initially the same at birth, but may drop below adult values during rst few months Glucose concentration Same or greater during rst month Triglyceride concentration Same or greater during rst several months Total bilirubin and unconjugated bilirubin concentrations Greater during the rst 2 weeks of life Gamma glutamyltransferase activity May be slightly greater for rst 2 weeks Alkaline phosphatase activity Greater during rst year Serum bile acids concentration Greater during rst 6 weeks Phosphorus concentration Greater during the rst year Creatinine phosphokinase activity May be lower during the rst year T3and T4concentrations Greater than adults for rst year Cortisol concentrations Initially greater at birth, then often falling below the adult mean during the rst few weeks 128 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYFailure to recognize these differences can lead to erroneous interpretation. Ideally, age-related nor-mal values should be used from the laboratory per-forming the analyses for accurate interpretation.If age-specic reference data is not available forneonatal foals, some generalizations can be appliedrelative to adult reference values and are summa-rized in Table 1.

Introduction The role of the clinical veterinarian encompasses many features of medical practice, but in manycases starts with a simple dichotomization: is thisanimal normal or abnormal? This can include thequestion, \"is it lame or sound,\" but often also in-cludes, \"is it sick or well?\" A thorough history andphysical examination will often reveal how to strat-ify the patient, but in cases of subtle disease espe-cially for horses in high level competition, mild and early signs of infection and inflammation may beoccult yet signicant. A reliable test for infection orinflammation, therefore, can have an extremelyvaluable place in the clinician's armamentarium.Good tests allow for some degree of quanticationboth to allow the practitioner to assess the severityof the process and also to follow and document itsresponse to therapy and track its resolution overtime. The earliest of these tools was rectal temper-ature, in which fever signied a secondary indicatorof increased cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor(TNF)- /H9251and interleukin (Il)-1.1However, over the past century, blood analysis has allowed us to quan-tify multiple inflammatory markers including theacute phase proteins such as brinogen, haptoglo-bin, /H92511-acid glycoprotein, C-reactive protein (mainly in humans), serum amyloid A (SAA), and many oth-ers, as well as secondary indicators such as whiteblood cell count and serum iron levels. 2Of these, brinogen has probably been the most heavily relied on for horses. It can be easily and inexpensivelymeasured, but may be confounded by in vitro pre-analytical microclot formation. However, its con- centration only slowly increases in the 24 hours after induction of inflammation and often does not peak until 48 hours. In addition, there is often onlya small increase (often only a 1-2-fold difference)from baseline, 3and thus mild inflammation cannot reliably be distinguished from normal val-ues. Nonetheless, any method that detects inflam-mation in the horse probably must outperformbrinogen in one or more of these factors: accu-racy, ease of interpretation, cost, and ease of use. SAA is the major acute-phase protein of the horse (and most other mammals), and is produced pre-dominantly by the liver as a systemic manifestationof the body's response to inflammation. It exists inequine plasma as one of three isoforms of apolipo-protein and is complexed to high-density lipoproteinin circulating blood. 4First investigated in horses in the 1980s,5,6its clinical use as a marker of inflam- mation is probably eclipsed by brinogen as a func-tion of assay availability rather than diagnosticinferiority. The advantages of SAA over brinogeninclude that it has both low/undetectable constitu-tive expression in normal animals but reaches levelsof 100-1000-fold baseline values in clinical disease 130 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGY NOTESstates.3In addition, its rapid increase in concen- tration over 6-12 hours combined with a 30-120-minute half-life that serum values track disease severity closely,3and subsequent relapse or secondary infections result in similar response toprimary infections. 8SAA is stable both at room temperature and refrigerated,9can be measured us- ing a relatively inexpensive stallside test9or a vari- ety of laboratory-based assays,10can be performed using plasma as well as serum,11and may be as- sessed using noninvasive samples such as saliva.12 Although there is some difference in precision andaccuracy between assays, most available tests seemto be accurate enough within clinically relevantranges to be acceptable to the practitioner. 9,10,13 2. Materials and Methods A review of the literature reveals many publicationsthat evaluate the use of SAA as a tool for distin-guishing healthy horses from those with local orsystemic inflammation, and as a diagnostic andmonitoring tool for specic conditions. To maxi-mize utility of this compilation of clinical equineveterinary publications, they are presented by bodysystem or disease process, and the review focuses onthe most clinically relevant studies. The astutereader will notice that these references refer to SAAin mg/L, /H9262g/mL, and ng/mL; the rst two of these units are equivalent and the third represents onethousandth the concentration of the rst. The au-thors' original units are maintained throughout. 3. Results SAA to Determine Infectious/Inflammation Versus Normal Horses that are \"not quite right\" or performing poorly are often diagnostic challenges, and identify-ing mild inflammation and distinguishing it fromnoninflammatory differential diagnoses before itsclinical signs declare themselves can stymie eventhe most meticulous clinician. A recent large studyevaluated the SAA concentrations of hospitalizedhorses that had either local inflammation (gastriculceration, abscesses, Streptococcus equi subsp equi infection), systemic inflammation (disease accompa-nied by fever, tachycardia, leukopenia/leukocytosis)or were otherwise healthy or had noninflammatoryconditions. 14Patients with systemic inflammation had signicantly higher SAA (mean, 1583 mg/L;range, 688-4000 mg/L) than horses with local or noinflammation, had mean SAA concentrationsof 343 mg/L (range, respectively. discrim- ination was more distinct than that of brinogen,in which the mean values of the three groups were224, 181, and 128 mg/dL, respectively. Using re-ceiver operator curve analysis, SAA had the high-est accuracy for diagnosing inflammation (Fig. 1),but predictive modeling failed to generate usefulalgorithms. 14A similar study15dichotomized horses into \"clinically normal\" and \"clinically ab-normal,\" the latter colic and neoplasia,and orthopedic infections. The clinically normalhorses had a mean SAA of 6.8 mg/L (range, 0.1-26.6 mg/L), whereas the clinically abnormalhorses had a mean SAA of 71.7 mg/L with a rangeof 0.1-3,800. In the same abnormal horses, SAA had sensi-tivity of 53% and specicity of 94% (diagnosticaccuracy, 75%), plasma concentration andmean albumin:globulin ratio, accuracy rangedfrom 59 to 62%. The authors also showed datafrom six cases comparing the resolution of inflam-matory markers over time (Fig. 2) and concludedthat \"SAA concentration can provide valuable in-formation regarding the clinical state of horsesand may be more useful for patient monitoringand as a prognostic indicator than are traditionalmarkers of inflammation.\" 15 Foals have been shown to have similar baseline values of SAA compared with adults, the kinetics ofits rise and resolution seems grossly similar, 16-19 and SAA is higher in animals with bacterial infec-tions than in those with nonbacterial or uncertaindiagnoses. 18In the largest study looking at SAA in foals, 226 healthy Thoroughbred neonates had me- Fig. 1. Receiver-operating characteristic curves for myeloperox-idase index, brinogen, SAA, and iron for discerning horses withfrom those without inflammatory disease. Reprinted with per-mission by Hooijberg EH et al. 14 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 131HOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYdian SAA concentrations of 0.9, 4.5, and 2.5 mg/L on days 1, 2 and 3 of life, with the values on day 2 beingsignicantly higher than baseline. 17In 136 foals with clinical disease, median SAA concentrations ofcases with focal infections such as omphalitis were195 mg/L and those with septicemia higher still at280 mg/L. Foals with noninflammatory abnormal-ities such as failure of passive transfer and nonin-fectious disease had low SAA concentrations at 5.1and 3.1 mg/L, respectively. 17These data suggest that SAA can be used in foals even at young ages asan indicator of infectious or inflammatory processes,especially given that its quicker rise allows abnor-malities to be identied in the rst few days of life.Increased brinogen levels neonatal foals oftenindicate during prepartum exposure to infectious orinflammatory agents is not known. SAA and Gastrointestinal Disease The main applications for the use of SAA in colicwould be to assist in the ability to distinguish sur-gical vs nonsurgical disease, to identify infectiouscomplications, and to gauge prognosis and responseto therapy. A study assessing SAA in colic casesadmitted to two university teaching hospitals foundthat concentrations of SAA were signicantly higherat admission in horses with colic attributable in-flammatory causes (e.g., enteritis, colitis, peritoni-tis, or abdominal abscesses). This was most usefulin enteritis (median, 65.5 /H9262g/mL; interquartile interquartile range, 0.3-58.6 /H9262g/mL). A signicant difference was also seen in the SAA value between horses thatsurvived the colic episode (median, 1.4 /H9262g/mL) and nonsurvivors (median, 10.8 /H9262g/mL).20Looking atSAA levels in the peritoneal fluid of horses withabdominal pain, cases with various etiologies of colichad a mean SAA concentration of 249 mg/L in serumand 97 mg/L in peritoneal fluid, compared with lessthan 1 mg/L in both samples obtained from ahealthy control population. 21Furthermore, SAA was elevated in horses with equine grass sickness(median, 50 mg/mL) compared (median, inoc- ulation with equine coronavirus resulted in SAAlevels that mirrored clinical disease; although allthree challenged horses shed large quantities of vi-rus, only those that showed clinical signs of diar-rhea, fever, and anorexia had elevated SAA, whichpeaked at 200-400 /H9262g/mL.23Interpreting these data is tricky given that there is not clear consensuson the value of SAA in colics. However, based onthese studies and clinical experience, SAA does notoffer clear guidance in making the decision if a colicis surgical, nor should it be relied upon for prognos-ticating survivability when euthanasia is being con-sidered. However, colic cases that are admittedwith SAA well above the reference range (/H11022 20 mg/L) should have inflammatory gastrointestinal le-sions such as enteritis and colitis higher on thedifferential diagnosis, and SAA values in the hun-dreds should prompt a search for an infectiousetiology. SAA and Respiratory Disease SAA has been investigated as a diagnostic tool forboth noninfectious inflammatory airway disease andviral and bacterial infectious diseases. Horses withsevere bacterial pneumonia often present with SAAvalues well into the thousands, 15and even road transportation, the primary risk factor for pneumo- Fig. 2. Data obtained for 12 clinically abnormal horses in which SAA concentration was considered abnormal (n /H110056) or not abnormal (n/H110056) at the time of hospital admission to illustrate the variation in that variable and other markers of inflammation (plasma brinogen concentration, total white blood cell count, and albumin:globulin [A:G] ratio) depending on signalment, diagnosis, andduration of clinical signs.

This increase was abrogated by administration ofantimicrobials, 24and shorter-distance shipping (4 h) did not have an effect on SAA concentrations.25 In equine influenza, serum SAA increases duringthe rst 48 h of clinical signs and returns to baselinevalues in 11 to 22 days barring secondary infections,with maximum values of /H11011450 mg/L during the acute phase. 26In ponies experimentally infected with EHV-1, serum levels peaked at 100 to almost1000 mg/L in the week after inoculation. 5 Various methods have been evaluated to screen foals for sub-clinical Rhodococcus equi pneumonia including sonographic examination, hematology,and physical examination, but each have been foundto be imperfect with regard to either diagnostic ac-curacy or cost effectiveness. Acute phase proteins,especially brinogen, have been used as moderatelyeffective screening tools for foals on endemic farms.It would seem that with its greater sensitivity andmore labile kinetics, SAA would be a better bio-marker for this disease that often exhibits an ex-tended preclinical latency where detection is oftendifcult. Two recent studies have investigatedSAA as a possible predictor of R. equi pneumonia in at-risk populations. The rst of these studies useda large, well-selected population of affected foals andage-matched controls from endemic farms. No pre-dictive value was found in SAA levels in 212 foals 7to 14 days and 196 foals 21 to 28 days of age, nor atthe onset of clinical signs of pneumonia. 27The au- thors conclude that \"monitoring concentration ofSAA is not useful as a screening test for early detec-tion of R. equi.\" 27A subsequent smaller study also assessing weekly screening with SAA to identifypre-clinical R. equi infections found similar results. SAA concentrations did not show an associationwith the development of sonographic evidence oflung abscessation, and of six foals on an endemicfarm diagnosed with R. equi pneumonia, only two demonstrated elevated SAA concentrations and thiswas around the time that the disease became clini-cally evident. 28These results are surprising given that R. equi generally results in a robust increase in brinogen and leukocyte count, which for other in-flammatory diseases tend to be less sensitive thanSAA. In conclusion, one must wonder why SAA isnot a better aid in early identication of R. equi pneumonia; no completely satisfactory explanationis apparent for these results. Recurrent airways obstruction (\"heaves\") is a disease of the small airways characterized by neu-trophilic exudate within the alveoli and bronchi.Although it is not associated with explicit signs of inflammation such as fever or peripheral neutrophilia,SAA has the potential to be more sensitive for subtlealterations. A prospective, observational study usedsix healthy and six heaves-affected horses challengedwith hay and straw to examine a variety of acute-phase proteins. 29Although haptoglobin concentra- tions were higher in the heaves horses both before andduring an exacerbation, the SAA did not reliably in-crease, although there was a small but signicant dif-ference between heaves-affected horses and controlson (15.75 vs 3.22 /H9262g/mL, respec- tively).29Nonetheless, probably the main use of SAA in horses with recurrent airways obstruction is distin-guishing them from pneumonia cases, in which theSAA is likely to be much higher. SAA and Surgery However much attention is paid to careful tissuehandling and correct technique, surgery is an in-flammatory stimulus and this fact is revealed byelevations in SAA after even minor, uncomplicatedprocedures. 4,5,30,31Therefore, its more useful ap- plication is probably identifying postoperative infec-tions both earlier and with more accuracy than othermethods. A study looking at standing castrations,for example, found that all horses had elevations ofSAA to the 400-600-mg/L ranges at day 3 postop-eratively, but those that went on to developinfections (as evidenced by fever, swelling, serohem-orrhagic or purulent discharge) still had SAA valuesin this range at the eighth day whereas horses re-covering without complication were in the /H11011200- mg/L range by this point. The increased SAAvalues associated with infection were not reliablyreflected by increases in rectal temperature, leuko-cyte count, or brinogen, suggesting that SAA was asuperior marker for infection. 31A subsequent study found that perioperative treatment with penicillinreduced the SAA in horses undergoing castrationfrom a mean of 708 to 543 mg/L at day 3 postcastra-tion, and from 515 to 125 mg/L on day 8, 32support- ing the idea that even mild infections result inappreciable differences in SAA concentration.Looking beyond orchidectomy, the effect of minor surgical procedures on SAA shows that levels of 100to 400 mg/L that peak at approximately day 3 aftersurgery can be expected in cases uncomplicated byinfection. These include tibiotarsal arthroscopyand osteochodrosis fragment (peaked d tendon (peaked d2; normal by 7-14 d) 5and a variety of elective pro- cedures including minor airway and orthopedic sur-geries (peaked at 16.4 /H9262g/mL at 24 h, 15.5 on d 2).16 SAA was also signicantly lower in elective (dened asnoninflamed) vs nonelective (pre-existing inflamma-tory foci) cases 16as well as being able to delineate differing levels of surgical trauma based on the inva-siveness of the procedure. 30In several of these stud- ies16,30SAA response was found to be a more sensitive indicator of inflammation than a variety of otheracute-phase protein or leukocyte responses, and de-creased more quickly in response to resolution thanbrinogen (Fig. 3). This is particularly useful to thepractitioner who must decide whether hematologic /H114082015 of inflammation is simply a holdover from the effects of surgery or indicative of postoperative infec-tion that requires further diagnostic evaluation ortreatment. SAA and Joint/Synovial Disease SAA seems to be a sensitive marker of septic arthri-tis and tenosynovitis in adult horses. Healthy con-trol horses have serum and synovial concentrationsof SAA that are generally less than 1 mg/L. Re-peated arthrocentesis (which increases cell countand total protein) and intra-articular amikacin in-jection do not affect SAA, and this may be one of itsimportant uses in these cases given that the effectsor repeated sampling can confound assessment oftreatment efcacy and resolution. 33,34Although much of the SAA found within synovial fluid may bean ultraltrate from plasma, a joint-specic isoformof SAA is also produced by synoviocytes. 35As in other diseases, bacterial infection of joints and othersynovial structures seems to be the most potentstimulant of SAA production. SAA concentrationsin horses with bacterially contaminated (but notnecessarily septic) synovial with arthritisor tenovaginitis had varied SAA values that werepossibly confounded by prior treatment; the highestvalue in these horses was a serum SAA of /H110111700 mg/L and a synovial fluid SAA /H110111100 mg/L. In horses with noninfectious arthropathies such asosteoarthritis, SAA values were not different fromcontrol 33In experimentally induced chem- ical arthritis (amphotericin B, midcarpal joint), se-rum SAA peaked at day 2 with values of /H1101150-300 mg/L and returned to normal between days 7 and14. 4,36Although septic arthritis is rarely a diag- nostic challenge, SAA may provide the clinician withsupporting information regarding degree of inflam-mation and allow monitoring of resolution of time in conjunction with traditionally measured variablessuch as synovial fluid analysis. SAA and Laminitis/Endocrinopathy The question of how SAA changes in laminitis iscomplicated by the myriad inflammatory as well as noninflammatory etiologies of laminitis, as well asits varied chronicity and severity. A review of theliterature in this area does not show a consistentstory. For example, although SAA mRNA is in-creased in laminitic tissue in previously laminitic ponies currently inremission showed no elevation from baseline. 38 In obesity (which is associated with metabolic dis-eases and laminitis), increases in SAA were corre-lated with higher body condition score and higherplasma insulin. 39However, all of the horses had SAA levels that would fall within the referencerange of the clinical assay, with highest values ob-tained topping out at 3845 ng/mL, or 3.8 mg/L.However, even at these low values, the authors concluded that \"SAA concentration is a bettermarker of obesity-associated inflammation andlaminitis [and] ... is possible that SAA is a com-ponent of laminitis pathophysiology.\" 39 SAA and Exercise In Standardbred trotters and Arabian racehorses,SAA levels were unchanged in response to rac-ing. 40,41However, signicant ndings have been identied looking at the acute phase response ofhorses undergoing long-distance endurance ridingcompetitions and training. Although horses evalu-ated before an endurance ride all had SAA valueswithin normal limits, SAA was lower in horses thatsuccessfully nished a 120-160-km competitioncompared with those that are to0.4 and 5.8 mg/L). This study found that \"serumSAA level was the only laboratory parameter thatindicated most (66.6%) of the eliminated horses be-fore entering competition.\" 42After long-distance (/H11022100 km) but not shorter (30-60 km) rides, a 10-fold or greater increase in SAA to /H1101113,000 ng/mL (13 mg/L) was found,42although other acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein and haptoglobinremained unchanged. 43Looking beyond the mas- sive efforts of competitions at this level, there wereno changes in SAA concentrations after race andendurance training sessions in experienced horses.Interestingly, SAA values also increased duringtraining levels for inexperienced, early-career en-durance horses (from /H110111t o/H110113.5 mg/L), but not in experienced competitors. 41This suggests that us- ing SAA after training sessions may be a method ofdetermining preparedness for advanced competi-tion, but this has not yet been explicitly evaluated.

Re-printed with permission by Pollock PJ et al. 16 134 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYSAA and Reproductive Disease There is conflicting evidence on SAA in the peripa- turient period of healthy mares. One study foundthat SAA levels were low in the 8 weeks prepartumalthough increased slightly in some mares in theweek preceding foaling, whereas other studies havefound no change in SAA associated prior to normalparturition. 44,45At 12 and 36 hours postpartum, mean SAA increases to 62 mg/L (range, 0.7-305mg/L) and 189 mg/L (range, 0-1615 mg/L) and re-turns to basal concentrations by 60 hours. 45In mares with experimentally induced placentitis, SAAvalues peaked between 274 and 4385 mg/L zooepidemicus; mares gen- erally aborted within 2 to 6 days of the increase inSAA. 44,45Abortion was more likely in mares with high SAA compared with mares where the SAA re-mained within the reference range, 45and values increased steadily until abortion, when they thendecreased rapidly. 44In comparison, brinogen and white blood cell count were not found to be usefulmarkers of placentitis. 44 SAA and Parasites In a study using horses experimentally infected withboth small and large strongyles, acute-phase pro-teins were monitored over 161 to 164 days. Al-though haptoglobin, iron, and albumin/globulinratios were associated with strongyle burden, SAAwas not and remained low throughout the study. 46 In addition, no signicant change in SAA was seenafter anthelminthic treatment in a group of heavilyparasitized horses. 47This provides the practitio- ner with useful information as larval cyathstomiasisis a diagnosis difcult to make antemortem, and lowSAA may steer the differential diagnosis away frominflammatory causes of colopathy. SAA and Vaccination After vaccination using two different influenza andtetanus toxoid products, horses showed variableacute-phase responses with six of 10 developing SAAconcentrations greater than /H110115 mg/L which peaked at 48 hours after vaccination. Maximum valuesranged from /H1101130 to 175mg/L, and increased white blood cell counts and brinogen concentrations, anddecreased serum iron were also noted. By 96hours, SAA levels were returning to normal but hadnot quite reached baseline values. 48 4. Discussion SAA is a sensitive predictor of early inflammation,and due to its rapid onset and short half-life, tracksthe course of disease closely. In most studies itoutperforms the common variables of both brino-gen and white blood cell count, and also often theother measured acute-phase reactors of haptoglobin,C-reactive protein, and serum iron. In a generalsense, SAA can be used in most situations to obtainearly identication of an inflammatory process, toassess the effectiveness of a chosen antimicrobial orother treatment, to monitor the rate of improve-ment, and to mark resolution of disease. SAAshould be considered as an adjunct to diagnosis of awide variety of inflammatory conditions in thehorse, and may well replace brinogen in comingyears as the main acute phase protein monitored inclinical medicine. However, it is not useful to diag-nose specic diseases, and should not replace carefulphysical examination and identication of the etio-logic causes of the inflammatory response. Table 1shows a compilation of approximations of SAA val-ues for common scenarios encountered in both pri-mary care and referral equine practice. The main disadvantages of SAA at this time are a lack of complete standardization of assay tech-niques, which imposes on the practitioner the needto commit to the same assay throughout evaluationof a particular case; values obtained from different assays may not be completely interchangeable. Al-though there are differences in results and precisionbetween laboratory-based and in-clinic or stall-sidetests, studies comparing the different forms of assayhave found that the results given by each are clinicallycomparable. 9,10,13A newer stall-side assaya, can be read visually for semiquantitative measurement orusing a handheld reader for a quantitative results.No peer-reviewed data have been published demon-strating the accuracy of this kit. Although SAA has many advantageous characteris- tics, it is still not a diagnostic panacea. It seems tohave no validity in assessing foals for R. equi pneumo- nia, although it often increases to extremely high con-centrations in pleuropneumonia in adults and can bevery valuable in assessing response to treatment inthese cases. SAA does not reliably distinguish surgi-cal from nonsurgical colic cases, although it is probablysuperior to brinogen in identifying postoperative in-fections because it follows a standard increase-and-decrease pattern of peaking at day 2 postoperativelyand then returning to normal after approximately 1week. Any deviations from a steady decrease afterthe rst 2-3 days after surgery might prompt a searchfor infectious complications. Although published reference ranges of SAA vary somewhat, the vast majority of normal, healthyhorses tested in all these studies had SAA concen-trations of 0 mg/L, or at the most, low single digits;control horses that had SAA levels greater than thismay have been suffering from subclinical conditionsthat were not evident on physical examination.Most instances of infectious or inflammatory diseaseshow SAA levels greater than 50 mg/L, which leavesa gray area between where interpretation may bedifcult. SAA is still a relatively new techniquecompared with other measured indices of inflamma-tion, so less is known about how to interpret these values than older, more familiar parameters.Studies correlating SAA concentrations to a largenumber of diseases have been published every year over the last decade, and currently the body of liter- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 135HOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL expanding rapidly in ways that assist vet- erinarians in the application of this parameter.Overall, practitioners should feel comfortable usingSAA in lieu of brinogen for most cases in whichinfectious or inflammatory disease is suspected, al-though ordering both for a period of time is probablywise until the clinician develops the experience nec-essary to interpret the wide range of values seenwith this marker.

PPID re- sults in dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pitu-itary-adrenal (HPA axis) due to activity ofthe pars intermedia the anterior pituitary glandresulting in overproduction of adrenocorticotropichormone (ACTH) and other related hormones. Pro-gressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons in thehypothalamus with aging in some animals results inloss of dopamine-mediated inhibition of the parsintermedia, leading to hyperactivity, hyperplasia, ora functional adenoma of this portion of the pituitarygland. Specic mechanisms that cause this dopa-minergic neuron loss in the hypothalamus are notwell characterized, but long-term, low-grade oxida-tive injury may play a role and helps explain whyPPID is a disease of older horses and ponies. 2Per- sistently increased ACTH concentrations theoreti-cally should increase adrenal activity in horses and ponies with PPID, and some clinical features ofequine PPID are often attributed to increases incortisol levels or activity. However, increased cir-culating total cortisol is not a typical nding inhorses and with PPID, suggesting that othernoncortisol-mediated hormonal pathways may playa role in the clinical features of PPID. In contrast, whereas the pathophysiology of EMS is poorly understood, it is clear that it does not result from primary HPA axis or thyroid gland dysfunc-tion. EMS seems to be at least in part an adipose-derived endocrinopathy, in which abnormal orexcessive adipose tissue produces a hormonal and/orinflammatory environment that alters insulin re-sponses to feeding and the activity of insulin inperipheral tissues. 1,4Hyperinsulinemia and exag- gerated insulin responses to feeding is a key aspectof EMS pathophysiology. 1,4 However, despite their different underlying pathophysiology, these two diseases share severalcommon clinical features. Most importantly, acuteor chronic laminitis\u2014often seasonal or pasture as-sociated\u2014is a common and typical presentation forboth PPID and EMS, and the development of lami- 138 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGY NOTESnitis seems to be associated with underlying insulin dysregulation in both diseases.1,2Because of the potential career- and even life-ending effects of lami-nitis, and the distinct therapeutic strategies neces-sary to control PPID and EMS, accurate diagnosis ofone or both of these disorders in affected animals isparamount to successful management of thesedisorders. A number of different diagnostic strategies for PPID and EMS have been assessed in recent years.Although a single perfect test to diagnose and dif-ferentiate these disorders is not yet available, usinga combination of clinical features, measurement ofbasal concentrations of several hormones, and dy-namic tests to measure endocrine responses to var-ious stimuli, can permit accurate diagnosis of PPIDand EMS in most animals. This session will sum-marize currently recommended diagnostic strate-gies for differentiating PPID and EMS in horses andponies. 2. Materials and Methods The recent literature on diagnostic evaluation forPPID and EMS was reviewed to determine currentand practical recommendations for eld and in-hos-pital testing for these disorders. The rst, and ar-guably the most important, step in the diagnosis ofPPID and EMS is the clinical evaluation of the pa-tient to detect typical clinical signs. In some cases,clinical ndings alone are enough to make a diagno-sis of one or both diseases. However, in most cases,to distinguish between and denitively diagnosethese two disorders, and to assess response to ther-apy, further hormonal testing\u2014including screeningtests to measure resting hormone concentrationsand/or dynamic testing to measure hormonal re-sponses to specic stimuli\u2014is necessary. Thesetests are discussed in detail below and summarizedin Table 1. Clinical Findings Typical clinical features of classic presentations forPPID and EMS and predisposed breeds are outlinedin Table 2. The classic presentation of PPID is anolder animal (usually late teens or older) that pres-ents with pasture-associated or seasonal laminitis,generalized muscle wasting/weight loss, and haircoat abnormalities (delayed, incomplete, or absentshedding). In fact, the clinical sign of failure toshed (typically called hirsutism, but more appropri-ately termed hypertrichosis) is a more sensitive andspecic test for late-stage PPID than any hormonalassay studied to date. 2In contrast, the classic pre- sentation for EMS is also an animal that presentswith pasture-associated laminitis, but in contrastthis is a younger-to-middle-aged animal with a nor-mal hair coat that has always been an easy keeperand is clearly obese with obvious fat deposits in thecrest of the neck and tail-head. 1 However, these classic presentations are most helpful in horses with rather advanced stages ofeither disease; in early-stage disease, the only clin-ical sign of PPID or EMS might be an episode ofacute pasture-associated laminitis in a middle-agedanimal. Further, both diseases can have atypicalpresentations, so testing for PPID and EMS shouldbe considered in animals with unexplained laminitiseven if no other typical clinical signs are present.In addition, it is important to note that PPID andEMS can occur concurrently, so individual animalsmight present with signs consistent with both dis-eases. Thus, unless the laminitic animal is veryyoung and very obese (consistent with EMS) or veryold, muscle-wasted, and completely fails to shed out(most consistent with PPID), hormonal testingshould be performed to differentiate between thesetwo diseases. Screening Tests\u2014Measurement of Resting Hormone Concentrations The simplest approach to hormonal testing to screen for PPID and EMS in suspect cases is measurementof resting hormone concentrations. This can easilybe performed in the eld, and thus is not typicallysubject to confounding by stress or transport effects. PPID Screening At present, the best commercially available screening test for PPID is measurement of plasma adrenocorti-cotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration. Measure-ment of other hormones, such as plasma cortisol orinsulin concentration, are not as sensitive or specicfor diagnosis of PPID as measurement of ACTH.Measurement of another anterior pituitary hormone, /H9251-melanocyte stimulating hormone ( /H9251-MSH) is also a good test for PPID diagnosis, but at present this test isonly available in a research setting. To screen for PPID by measurement of resting plasma ACTH concentration, blood may be collectedat any time of day and the animal does not need tobe fasted. However, extreme excitement, trans-port, illness, and routine change can transiently in-crease ACTH concentrations, so testing under thesecircumstances should be avoided. The sampleshould be collected into a plastic tube with EDTA asan anti-coagulant given that glass seems to falselylower ACTH concentrations. 5ACTH is very labile at room temperature, so the sample should be re-frigerated or placed on ice immediately after collec-tion. For accurate results, the sample must becentrifuged to separate the plasma as soon as pos-sible after collection (within 4 h), and only theplasma should be submitted for analysis (ideally in aplastic vial). It is imperative that the plasma re-main cold on arrival at the testing laboratory: thiscan be ensured by either 1) freezing the sample andshipping it overnight on dry ice, or 2) freezing thesample and shipping it overnight with several frozenice packs in a styrofoam shipping cooler. ACTH is measured by immunoassay, several of which are well validated for equine samples. Anumber of commercial laboratories run 61 /H114082015 139HOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYTable 1.

Thus,cut-off values for diagnosis of PPID can vary sub-stantially among laboratories. It is important toknow which assay your laboratory uses to accuratelyinterpret your results. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated a substantial effect of season on resting ACTH concen-tration in healthy and PPID horses. 6-9In sum- mary, resting ACTH concentrations are increased inautumn (August through October in the northernhemisphere) in healthy horses and horses withPPID. 6-9This increase is greatly exaggerated, however, in horses with PPID.6Thus, whereas just a few years ago testing for PPID by measuringACTH concentrations was not recommended in theautumn months, with the recent development ofseason-specic reference ranges, 6autumn now seems to be the best time to screen for PPID withthis test because the difference in resting ACTHconcentration between normal and PPID horses isgreatest during this season. 10More research is un- derway to determine the effect of specic geographiclocation, age, and breed on resting ACTH to developlocation and population-specic diagnostic cut-offvalues. In the author's experience with clinical and re- search samples in the United States, it has beenfound that the veterinary endocrinology laboratoriesat Michigan State University and Cornell Univer-sity offer comprehensive testing for equine endo-crine disorders and offer helpful information ontheir Web sites to provide assistance with interpre-tation of results. There are certainly a number ofother good veterinary endocrinology laboratories,but the author has found these to be especially help-ful with test interpretation. In general, regardlessof assay and season, ACTH concentrations greaterthan 50 to 100 pg/mL are typically consistent withPPID, and normal horses, even those sampled every20 minutes over a 24-hour period, atypically have ACTH concentrations less than 20 to 30 pg/mL.6 However, horses with ACTH concentrations that fallclose to or in between these values can be difcult tointerpret and might require additional dynamictesting, or repeat ACTH measurement in 6-12months. EMS Screening Testing for EMS is more complicated than testingfor PPID, because EMS is best described as a collec-tion of hormonal abnormalities and clinical signsassociated with the development of laminitis inhorse and ponies, 1,4rather than as a distinct and well-dened disease with a single direct etiology.Ideally, diagnosis of EMS requires consistent clini-Table 2.

Thus, documentationof insulin dysregulation can be considered the min-imum diagnostic criteria for making a tentative di-agnosis of EMS. However, it cannot be overemphasized that a number of scenarios can result in insulin dysregu-lation in horses, of which EMS is only one. Stress,endotoxemia, pregnancy, and dietary factors can allaffect insulin regulation in horses, but most impor-tantly, insulin dysregulation is a common compo-nent of PPID. Thus, to diagnose a horse or ponywith insulin dysregulation due to EMS, these otherpotential causes must be excluded. Often, this canbe done based on the animal's signalment, history,and initial clinical exam, but in many cases (i.e., the14-year-old horse in normal body condition withslight regional adiposity who founders when turnedout on grass for the rst time in September in theSoutheast) PPID must be excluded as a cause ofinsulin dysregulation with the testing strategies de-scribed herein. The most straightforward screening test for insu- lin dysregulation is measurement of a fasted insulinconcentration. It is helpful to measure glucose onthe same fasted sample given that accurate inter-pretation of the insulin concentration requiresknowledge of the concurrent blood glucose level.A simple method for collection of this fasted sampleis as follows: 1. Have the owner feed the horse normally in the late afternoon/evening, and then place it in astall or dry lot. 2. At 2200 hours, give the horse a flake of grass hay, and then no further feed overnight (wateris ne). Horses that will eat their bedding (orstall walls) should be placed in a grazingmuzzle. 3. Arrive at the farm between 0800 and 0900 hours, and pull your blood sample, then havethe owner feed the horse normally and return itto its normal routine while awaiting results. Insulin and glucose can be run on serum or eth- ylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-plasma; thus,if you are also testing for PPID you can just submitone frozen EDTA plasma sample as described above.Either way, it is still important to keep the samplecool after collection, and separate the cells from theserum or plasma as soon as possible (and within 4 h)to ensure accurate measurement of the glucose con-centration. 11As long as the horse is fasted, season does not typically affect results of this test unlessthe horse has underlying PPID. 9 Most veterinary diagnostic laboratories use simi- lar methodology for measurement of equine insulin, soacross laboratories, a fasted insulin concentrationgreater than 20 /H9262IU/mL is generally considered con- sistent with insulin dysregulation/inappropriate hy-perinsulinemia. 1,12However, insulin concentrations should be interpreted in light of the glucose concentra-tion; an animal with a high insulin concentration anda normal-to-high glucose concentration is exhibitingevidence of peripheral insulin resistance, whereas ananimal with a low insulin concentration but hypergly-cemia is actually more consistent with true diabetesmellitus (rare but reported in horses). 1,12Further, some animals with EMS will have a normal fastedinsulin concentration but an inappropriate insulin re-sponse to feeding, which is not detected with this testbut can be detected with dynamic testing describedbelow. Finally, as mentioned above, horses with stress or ongoing systemic illness can have transient insulindysregulation and hyperinsulinemia, and could befalsely diagnosed with EMS based on a single in-creased fasted insulin concentration. When horsesthat are stressed (i.e., actively laminitic) or system-ically ill must be tested for EMS, concurrently mea-suring plasma leptin concentration can be helpful.Leptin is a hormone produced by adipocytes, and itis increased in horses with EMS. 12Its secretion also seems less likely to be affected by stress andsystemic illness, so it can be measured concurrentlywith insulin to provide additional information tosupport a diagnosis of EMS. Leptin can be mea-sured on serum or EDTA-plasma processed andshipped as for measurement of insulin and ACTHdescribed above. Dynamic Testing In general, dynamic testing measures the hormonalresponse to a specic stimulus to determine whetherthe endocrine response is appropriate or dysregu-lated. Currently recommended dynamic testingoptions for PPID and EMS are outlined below. PPID Testing A number of dynamic tests for PPID have been eval-uated in horses, including the overnight dexameth-asone suppression test (ODST), the thyrotropinreleasing-hormone stimulation (TRH stim) test, thedomperidone test, and the ACTH stimulation test.Current data do not support the use of the latter twotests as rst-line testing for PPID, due to either lackof sensitivity and specicity for diagnosis of PPID orlack of large-scale studies to determine optimal test-ing strategies and diagnostic cutoffs. 2 The ODST has long been considered the gold- standard antemortem test for PPID in horses. Thebasic premise of the test exploits the negative feed- 142 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL of steroid hormones on the pitu- itary gland. In a normal horse, administration ofan exogenous adrenal steroid hormone (e.g., dexa-methasone) exerts negative feedback parsdistalis of the pituitary resulting in decreasedACTH secretion. This of cortisol adrenal gland, and causes circu-lating cortisol concentration to decrease. horsewith of ACTH and does not respondvia this negative feedback mechanism. Thus, ad-ministration of dexamethasone fails to cause a de-crease in ACTH and cortisol concentrations inhorses with PPID. To perform the ODST, the horse is administered 40 /H9262g/kg dexamethasone (0.04 mg/kg) IM between 1600 and 1800 hours, then housed and fed normallyovernight. Nineteen to 20 hours later (/H110111100-1200 h the following day), a blood sample is collectedinto a red top tube for serum collection and measure-ment of cortisol concentration. A cortisol concen-tration greater than 1 /H9262g/dL is consistent with a diagnosis of PPID. This test is easy to do, as the owner can adminis- ter the dexamethasone, and thus only one trip to thefarm is required. Cortisol is quite stable and nospecial sample handling or processing is required.However, this test should not be performed in theautumn (August to October in the northern hemi-sphere) because normal horses can have a false-positive response. 7This test also performs best in horse and ponies with overt and often late-stageclinical signs of PPID such as hypertrichosis/abnor-mal shedding patterns. 2Because these clinical signs are already very sensitive and specic for mak-ing a PPID diagnosis, conrmatory testing with theODST in late-stage PPID may not be performance of the ODST in early- and middle-stage PPID does not seem to be as good, but addi-tional study is needed. 2Finally, given anecdotal reports of steroid-associated laminitis, some ownersare concerned about administration of dexametha-sone to horses at risk for or with active laminitis,which is often when testing for PPID is considered.Thus, the ODST, although still potentially useful forPPID diagnosis, has fallen out of favor as a test thatis useful for early-stage disease. Recent data suggest that the TRH stim test may be a more useful method for earlier diagnosis ofPPID. In this test, the innate cross talk acrossendocrine axes is exploited. TRH is generallythought of as activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, and that is its primary function. How-ever, TRH also up-regulates the HPA axis by actingon anterior pituitary cells to induce ACTH secretion.In normal horses this response is modest, but inhorses with PPID with hyperfunctional and/orhyperplastic pituitary tissue, is exaggerated.To perform the TRH stim test, a baseline ACTH sample can be collected at the start of the test,although this is not necessary if the horse has al-ready been screened for PPID with this test andfound to be within normal limits. Administer 1 mgTRH IV per horse (or pony) and collect blood into aplastic EDTA tube 10 minutes and 30 minutes later.Adverse effects of TRH administration in horsesseem to be minimal and most often include sweat-ing, agitation, and phlegmen response in the au-thor's experience. Handle the blood samples as forbaseline ACTH measurement by keeping them coldand removing the plasma as soon as possible forfrozen or chilled overnight shipment to the labora-tory. ACTH concentrations at 10 minutes and 30minutes greater than 100 and 35 pg/mL, respec-tively are consistent with a diagnosis of PPID. Ifdesired, the 30 minute sample may be omitted tosave time and decrease the test cost, as results atthis time point may be most useful. The TRH stimulation test using this protocol seems to have adequate sensitivity and specicityeven in earlier stages of PPID, although false posi-tives are still possible, 2and the effects of feeding and season are still not well characterized. Some stud-ies document an effect of season on ACTH responseto TRH, with higher values in the autumn even innormal horses, but large-scale studies to determineseason-specic reference ranges are not yet avail-able. 13,14Thus, at present, testing between Decem- ber and June is recommended using the above cut-off values. Horses tested in the autumn withborderline or slightly abnormal results should beretested in the winter or spring until seasonal ref-erence ranges are established. One issue with performing this test in practice has been the availability of TRH. Pharmaceutical-grade TRH has been either not available or prohib-itively expensive for equine use. The bulk of thepublished literature on this method has been per-formed using reagent-grade TRH that has been re-constituted with sterile fluid and then ltered in aresearch laboratory or large-scale pharmacy, thendivided into 1-mg aliquots and frozen for individualpatient use. We prepare it this way in our hospitaland have had good results with the test on researchand client animals. Until recently, because thenecessary equipment for this process is generallylimited to universities or large referral practices,this test has been impractical for general practitio-ners. Recently, however, compounded TRH bhas become available, and preliminary studies suggestthat it has comparable efcacy with the previouslyused reagent-grade product, cgreatly expanding the clinical utility of this test in general practice. EMS Testing The gold-standard dynamic test for evaluation ofinsulin regulation in horses and ponies is the eugly-cemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp method, which is notpractical for use in clinical practice due to its inva- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 143HOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYsiveness, intense sampling protocol, and complex analysis. A number of other dynamic tests to as-sess insulin responses and document insulin resis-tance or dysregulation in horses and ponies withsuspected EMS have been evaluated, and of these,the recently described oral sugar test 15is, in the author's opinion, by far the simplest and most usefultest for a eld setting. Indeed, this is the test wecurrently use in our hospital for assessing insulindynamics in horses and ponies because it directlyassesses the animal's insulin response to dietarycarbohydrates, which is a key component of thepathophysiology of insulin dysregulation in animalswith EMS. 4 To perform this test, the animal should be stalled and fasted overnight, with one flake of hay offered at2200 hours and nothing afterward as for measure-ment of resting insulin concentrations. At 0800hours, pull a blood sample for measurement of base-line glucose and insulin as for resting insulin con-centration above, then administer Light (not \"Lite\")corn (Karo) syrup orally at 15 mL/100 kg. The sim-plest post-sugar sampling protocol involves pullingblood again 60 minutes later for measurement of theglucose and insulin response to the sugar challenge.Blood may be sampled more frequently (every 30min for 2-3 h) to plot a response curve, but for mostsettings the single 60-minute sample will sufce.If the baseline sample insulin concentration isgreater than 20 /H9262IU/mL or the 60-minute sample insulin concentration is greater than 60 /H9262IU/mL, the animal is considered to have an inappropriateinsulin response to sugar consistent with EMS.Animals with 60-minute insulin concentrations be-tween 45 and 60 /H9262IU/mL are considered equivocal and should be retested.A common question from owners is \"will the sugar in the Karo syrup make my horse founder\" by stim-ulating an increase in plasma insulin in an at-riskanimal? To date, hundreds or more of these testshave been performed in normal and EMS horses at anumber of institutions to validate the test in re-search animals and in client animals, and to ourknowledge the risk of adverse effects seems to bevery low. 15 3. Results In general, there are two scenarios in which testingfor PPID and/or EMS should be considered: 1) in alaminitic animal, particularly when the develop-ment of acute or recurrent laminitis seems to beseasonal or pasture-associated; or 2) in a nonlamin-itic animal that presents with some other clinicalfeature of these disorders. Because insulin dys-regulation can be a component of both disorders andis associated with the development of laminitis, thegoal of this diagnostic approach is to assess insulinresponses and test for PPID. Even if the animal isultimately diagnosed with PPID, the presence ofconcurrent insulin resistance in horses with PPIDseems to be associated with an increased risk oflaminitis and decreased survival time. 2Thus, in- sulin dysregulation is an important prognostic fac-tor in a horse with PPID. Further, if the clinicalsigns of PPID are eventually well controlled withmedication but the animal continues to have insulindysregulation, that animal has both PPID and EMS,which requires additional therapy. To illustrate the use of the above testing strate- gies in a clinical setting, Figure 1 outlines the com-prehensive diagnostic approach to a horse or ponywith acute pasture-associated laminitis, to rule in Fig. 1. Diagnostic approach to an animal with suspected endocrinopathic laminitis to evaluate for PPID and EMS. 144 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYand out PPID and EMS. Portions of this approach can be applied to individual cases that require test-ing for one but not both of these diseases, but ingeneral, testing for both disorders is importantto avoid missing concurrent disease or atypicalpresentations. Determining ideal timing for endocrine testing can be problematic in the actively laminitic animalgiven that the pain and stress associated with alaminitis episode can result in HPA axis up-regula-tion that raises circulating ACTH concentrations orcan induce transient insulin resistance. 12Thus, test results in an animal with active laminitis can bedifcult to interpret because high ACTH and/or in-sulin concentrations could be indicative of endocrinedisease or a transient stress response. Unfortu-nately, the ideal timing for endocrine testing duringor after a laminitis episode that minimizes the like-lihood of false-positive results is not known, andlikely varies in individual cases. It is the author's opinion that initial endocrine testing should still be performed in actively lamin-itic animals fairly early on, usually within 1-2weeks of initiation of appropriate analgesic therapyand mechanical support of the affected feet, withfollow-up testing at a later duration when the ani-mal's laminitis is under control. False positives arestill possible during this time frame, but making anearly diagnosis to help direct therapy can often ul-timately limit the severity and duration of the lami-nitis episode. In addition, in chronic stress theHPA axis tends to be down-regulated over time, sothe plasma ACTH concentration is unlikely to befalsely increased much beyond 1 to 2 weeks after theacute laminitis episode. Stress-induced insulin re-sistance may still be difcult to distinguish fromtrue EMS at this time, but it is the author's opinionthat given the previously described links betweenhyperinsulinemia and laminitis, and the potentiallyfatal consequences of uncontrolled laminitis, stress-induced insulin resistance likelywarrants specic therapy with diet /H11006medication during an acute laminitis episode. Thus, in actively laminitic animals and border- line-positive results (such as moderately increasedACTH and fasting insulin concentrations), the au-thor generally institutes appropriate medical anddietary therapy for endocrine disease as well astreatment for laminitis, and recommends repeat en-docrine testing in 6 to 12 weeks once the laminitis is(hopefully) under control. However, this brings tolight the other problematic aspect of endocrine test-ing: if and how to test the animal that is currentlyon medications for PPID or EMS, such as pergolide,metformin, and/or levothyroxine. Such medicaltherapy is sometimes initiated at the request of theowner without conrmatory diagnostic testing, or asabove during an acute laminitis episode when testresults might be falsely positive. There is no perfect one-size-ts-all approach for this situation, and specic strategies depend greatlyon individual animal characteristics and owner per- spective. Testing can be performed while animalsare on medical therapy for PPID and EMS, butnormal results do not distinguish between animalswho do not have the disease and those who are wellcontrolled on the current medical regimen. If theanimal was started on medical therapy with no pre-vious testing, and the signalment or clinical signsare not consistent with the \"diagnosis\"\u2014such as anobese 6-year-old horse with laminitis diagnosed withPPID and started on pergolide, or a shaggy 28-year-old pony diagnosed with EMS and started on met-formin or levothyroxine\u2014the animal can most likelybe safely tapered off the medication over a period of3 to 6 weeks and then tested appropriately after 2 to4 weeks off of medication. Use caution, however, indiscontinuing medical therapy in an animal whowas started on it during an episode of laminitisbecause a flare-up of laminitis is possible when thetherapy is discontinued. In those cases, a discus-sion with the owner regarding the risks of anotherlaminitis episode vs the difculty of interpreting testresults in an animal on medical therapy is war- ranted and individual owner and animal factorsshould be considered. Once an animal has been diagnosed with PPID and/or EMS, it is important to consider strategiesfor monitoring and follow-up testing. In the au-thor's experience, monitoring clinical signs and se-rum insulin responses is most helpful in both thesediseases. In horses and ponies with PPID, restingplasma ACTH concentrations TRH stimulationtest responses tend to improve with pergolide treat-ment, but do not always return to normal and thedegree of improvement in endocrine testing does notalways correlate well with clinical improvement. 2 Thus, for animals with PPID, the author re-eva-lautes the horse in 6 to 8 weeks after initiatingtreatment to insure clinical signs of PPID, and in-sulin dysregulation, if present, have improved.Thereafter, annual or semi-annual monitoring forrecurrence of weight loss, hair coat/shedding ab-normalities, or insulin dysregulation/hyperinsu-linemia is most useful for determining when thepergolide dose should be increased in the author'sexperience. For a younger animal with EMS, ifits weight can be managed well and serum insulinconcentration and oral sugar test responses returnto normal when it is in appropriate body condition,simply monitoring with biannual physical examsto ensure continued maintenance of an appropri-ate body weight is generally adequate, with hor-monal testing only necessary if the animal gainsweight or has another episode of laminitis. Foranimals that remain obese or hyperinsulinemicdespite dietary and medical therapy for EMS, as-sessment of fasting insulin concentrations and/ororal sugar test responses every 3 to 6 months ishelpful for adjusting therapy.

Discussion Diagnostic testing for PPID and EMS is an area of active research with constantly rened understand-ing of the etiology and pathophysiology of these dis-eases. Thus, recommendations for diagnostic testshave changed over time. Both of these disordershave complex pathology that vary among cases andlikely occur on a spectrum of severity that changesover time as the disease progresses. Thus, it isunlikely that a single diagnostic testing approachwill ever be applicable to or useful in all presenta-tions of these diseases. It is important to remem-ber that all of the tests described above can havefalse positives and false negatives, and that testresults may be negative in the early stages of bothPPID and EMS. Repeat testing in clinically sus-pect cases with negative initial results is stronglysuggested.

Introduction Dermatologic disease is a common client complaint yet veterinarians often have difculty in establish-ing a denitive diagnosis. Techniques for samplingdermatologic lesions to aid in diagnosis are simpleand require limited equipment. Sample selectionsite, sample collection procedures, and sample sub-mission all influence the quality of results obtainedfrom a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. The pur-pose of this paper is to review sample collection andsubmission to maximize the ability of the diagnosticlaboratory pathologists to obtain and provide usefulresults to the submitting clinician. 2. Materials and Methods Medline, Pubmed, Agricola, and CAB databaseswere reviewed. The instructions for sample sub-mission for several veterinary diagnostic laborato-ries were obtained from their websites. A limitednumber of diagnostic laboratory microbiologists andpathologists were interviewed for best practices andcommon errors in sample submission. This infor-mation was coupled with the author's experience inobtaining dermatologic samples and the value ofinformation received from the diagnostic laboratoryin managing dermatologic conditions. Procedures Submission Forms Evaluation of samples submitted to a diagnostic labo- ratory is done with consideration of the history andclinical context. Most diagnostic laboratory profes-sionals agree that sample interpretation is 50-80%context. 1Thus, useful results obtained from derma- tologic samples are dependent on appropriate informa-tion accompanying submitted material. Submissionforms should include all patient information: ownername and animal name, species, age, sex, and breed.Submission containers should be labeled with theowner's name and sample identication. If multiplesamples are submitted, each container should also belabeled with the sampling location. Abbreviations oranagrams should not be used. What may be familiaramong working clinicians may not be to diagnosticlaboratory personnel. The history should be legible AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 147HOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGY NOTESand informative such that the reader has a complete understanding of the patient's circumstances and dis-ease progress. A good way to ensure complete infor-mation is provided on a diagnostic requisition form isto answer the following questions posed by Pinson. 1 What is the primary reason for evaluation?This helps to dene the problem for the labo-ratory diagnostician. Is the current skin le-sion unresponsive to previous therapy? Is thelesion or disease process very unusual? What is the duration and frequency of the prob-lem? Words such as acute, chronic, rapid, orslow have no specic meaning. Be precise indescribing duration, progression, or growth,and/or recurrence of the lesion(s). What are the objective clinical ndings? Theseare things that can be observed, described, mea-sured, or quantied. It is important to indicatewhether the disease is affecting the total healthof the horse or not. This information providesthe pathologist with important backgroundinformation. What are your differential diagnoses? It ishelpful to list these in order of probability. Ifthe lesions are unusual, or if you have specicconcerns about a possible differential diagno-sis, this information should also be supplied. What specically was sampled? For example,the junctional edge of a bullous lesion, a com-plete excision of a closed pustule, or a shavebiopsy of the coronary band provides neededcontextual information. If multiple lesions indifferent stages of development are biopsied,this information should also be included. What is the appearance of the tissue or lesion?In addition to a precise and concise writtendescription, photographs of the patient and aclose-up of the lesions and or biopsy site arehelpful. Photographs can be included on elec-tronic submission forms or, should the labora-tory use paper forms, the owner's name andyour name can be linked to photographs sub-mitted separately via email. If there is question about proper submission of sam-ples for a particular differential diagnosis, or un-usual lesions are present, calling the laboratoryahead of time for guidance could shorten turnaroundtime and decrease the need for additional submis-sions or tests. Cytology Specimens for cytological examination can be col-lected in a variety of ways. Glass slides with afrosted end are preferable for ease of labeling. Apencil, rather than a pen, should be used to labelslides as ink will dissolve during the automaticstaining procedures used in many laboratories.Similarly, tape or other labels should not be appliedto the slides because they might interfere with stain-ing procedures performed by machine. Tape thatencircles the slide will not allow the slide to lie flaton the stage of a microscope and thus will inhibitcomplete examination. If multiple slides are ob-tained, particularly if they are from different sites,the slides can be labeled with numbers or letters ofthe alphabet and a key provided with the submis-sion form. Impression smears are obtained by pressing rmly one or more times on a lesion that is wet ormoist. Alternatively, the slide can be pulled acrossa lesion once. Rubbing the slide back and forthmay disrupt cells and interfere with evaluation.Impression smears may also be made from the un-derside of crusts (e.g., when looking for Dermatophi- lus), from the cut surfaces of excised masses (such astumors) or from extirpated nodules. Alternatively,scrapings may be used to underneath crusts,vesicles, or peeling stratum corneum. 2,3Intact pus- tules can be opened with the tip of a small needleand contents applied to a slide and subsequentlysmeared. Cotton or nylon tipped swabs are usuallyused when imprints, scrapings, or aspirates cannotbe obtained, such as evaluating drainingtracts. The swab should be pre-moistened with iso-tonic fluid to minimize cell damage during samplecollection and slide preparation. The swab shouldbe rolled onto the slide in a single line to distributethe acquired material. 4 Fine-needle aspirates can be obtained using a 20- 22-gauge needle and a 6-10-cc syringe.3Enough suction should be applied to aspirate tissue into theneedle, but not so much that red-cell contaminationoccurs. Once the aspiration is complete, the sy-ringe should be removed and air drawn into thesyringe to expel the contents of the needle onto aslide. Very thick samples can be gently \"squashed\"between slides. The top slide is then pulled off theend of the sample slide to smear the material. 5 The objective, regardless of acquisition method, is toobtain a single layer of cells on the slide given thatmultiple layers of cells are difcult to interpret. Ideally several slides are made. Slides should be rapidly and completely air dried and submittedunstained. Slides should not be placed in a re-frigerator or freezer. The slides should be driedcompletely before packaging to avoid artifacts thatseverely distort the cells. 6One may wish to stain a slide (with Diff-Quickaor new methylene blue) at the clinic to ensure an appropriate sample hasbeen obtained. If the material collected is greasyor waxy, or if the slide is made from a moistenedswab, the slide should be heat xed prior to stain-ing or shipping. 3Heat xation can be accom- plished with a blow dryer directly on the slidefrom a distance of approximately 10 inches, a cig-arette lighter, or a match. The slide should beheld over the flame for 5 seconds without burningthe slide or damaging the sample by overheating. 7 If soot accumulates on the slide it should be wipedoff either before or after the slide is stained. 148 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYSlides should be packaged in a slide holder sur- rounded by bubble wrap or polystyrene packing mate- rial and submitted in a sturdy container to avoidbreakage during transport. Simple cardboard mail-ers or thin padded envelopes, even if labeled \"fragile,\"\"breakable,\" or \"glass\" are not adequate to protect theslides. Alternatively, slides may be submitted indi-vidually in a pill container prior to protective pad-ding. 4Slides should be protected against moisture to avoid artifacts and never submitted in the same con-tainer as formalin-xed tissue. Formalin fumes willx the cells and render them unstainable. 5 To collect hair for suspected dermatophytosis, hairs should be plucked from the leading edge of alesion. Alternatively, hair and crusts may be col-lected by brushing with a clean, small, stiff brush(such a toothbrush) or scraped with a scalpel at alesion edge. Collected material should be placed ina test tube with a cotton plug or in a paper envelope.Moisture in a sealed tube may result in a prolifera-tion of saprophytic fungi. 8These samples may be used for both cytology and culture. Microbiology Bacteriologic culture and sensitivity testing isnecessary when initial therapy does not work, indeep skin infections with draining tracts or gran-ulomas, when other bacteria besides cocci are seenon skin cytology, if methicillin-resistant Staph- ylococcus is suspected. 9Any moist lesion will contain bacteria after 24 hours; therefore, attemptto culture lesions as soon as they occur or byopening a closed pustule. Samples may be ob-tained with a moistened cotton or nylon-tippedswab, by aspiration or from a tissue biopsy. Ster-ile equipment and aseptic technique should beused. Swabs or tissue samples should be ob-tained from the tissue exudate interface where theproliferation of organisms 9Aspirated sam- ples of purulent exudate generally are sparselypopulated or devoid of live organisms. Multipleswabs should be obtained from the lesion sitegiven that the laboratory will often set up a num-ber of different tests on day 1 based on the infor-mation provided by the clinician. bSwabs should be immediately placed in a non-nutritive trans-port media (such as a commercial culturette,www.veterinarylabsupply.com/culturettes.htm),and kept cool, as microorganisms die rapidly indry conditions. Whenever possible submit tissuerather than tissue swabs. bTissue samples should be aseptically collected, wrapped in sterile gauzemoistened with saline or lactated solu-tion (LRS) and placed in an sterile con-tainer. A ring block or regional anesthesia ispreferred when obtaining a biopsy for culture be-cause inhibit mycobacteria, and fungi. 2An unstained air dried and or xed slide for a Gram stain shouldaccompany the samples for microbial propagation.Samples should be transported to the laboratoryas rapidly as possible; ice packs and overnightshipping are recommended. cKnowledge of the lab- oratory schedule is helpful if one can plan samplecollection. Samples should arrive, if possible, inthe morning so that tests may be set up on thearrival date. Ideally the diagnostic laboratorywould operate fully 7 days a week and on holidays;however, many laboratories have only one, or afew, personnel that set up tests received on Fridayafternoon or on Saturday, and subsequent testsare often delayed until the following Monday. b Limitations of bacterial culture include an over- growth of contaminating organisms, organisms thatdo not grow or are slow growing, decient culturetechnique, delayed shipment of the sample, and con-current antibiotic therapy at the time of sampling.Organisms that are hard to grow may be identiedby molecular techniques from tissue samples. 10,11If any unusual results occur, or if no growth occurs,consultation with the diagnostic laboratory microbi-ologist is advisable. Samples submitted for culture of dermatophytes should be collected as described above. If a deepfungal infection is suspected a tissue sample is bestfor culture and molecular diagnostic techniques.A sample of tissue for histopathological evaluationshould also be submitted to conrm that fungal pathogenic. 11 Biopsy \"When and pathologist truly work to-gether, the skin biopsy can reflect the dermatologicdiagnosis in more than 90% of cases.\" 2Yet many clinicians are frustrated with vague diagnoses ordescriptions of biopsies that leave the clinician andowner with the impression of little useful informa-tion. The selection of biopsy site, procurement ofthe biopsy, and proper handling and submission ofbiopsies are crucial to an informative interpretationof submitted material. A skin biopsy should betaken of any unusual or signicant lesions, lesionsthat do not respond to empirical therapy in 3 weeks,any persistent ulcerated lesion, all neoplastic or sus-pected the biopsy is likelyto be the denitive diagnostic test (such as immune-mediated diseases), and any lesions(s) where thetreatment is likely to be time consuming, expensive,or dangerous. 12 Biopsies are best obtained from early developing lesions and not chronic ulcerated lesions. This stepmay require a careful complete examination of skin,especially if there is a generalized distribution oflesions. Biopsies from excoriated or traumatizedlesions, found in many pruritic conditions, are notlikely to be informative. Anti-inflammatory medi-cations, especially corticosteroids, will alter an in-flammatory disease process, rendering a biopsy lessinformative. Most authors recommend discontinu-ation of oral corticosteroids 2-3 to parenterally, even if new lesions are occurring.2,12Lesions that are secondarily infected with bacteria or yeast should be treated prior tobiopsy so the primary disease process can beidentied. 2 All biopsies should include the dermis. Do not prepare or clip skin if the lesion is in the epidermisbecause preparation may remove important compo-nents of the lesion. For deeper lesions hair may beclipped with scissors. Instruments should not re-move any crusts or scales and should not touch theskin. After obtaining the biopsy, specimens shouldbe xed in 10% buffered neutral formalin (BNF).Formalin containers should have a top as wide asthe container (do not use glass), seal completely, andthe formalin solution should be no older than 1 year.If any precipitates are present in the formalin it isunsuitable for use. 13Autolysis of biopsy samples begins in less than 5 minutes; thus, biopsies shouldbe placed in xative immediately after they are ob-tained. If multiple biopsies are obtained, each bi-opsy should be placed in formalin in sequence,rather than waiting until all samples are collected. 14 Punch biopsies are useful for lesions of the epider- mis and dermis, but not if the disease extends into the subcutaneous tissue. A new punch biopsyshould be used for each patient. A minimum of a6-mm biopsy punch should be used, and an 8-mm orlarger punch is preferred. 15When obtaining a punch biopsy only abnormal skin should be included andthe punch should be centered over the lesion. Us-ing a permanent marker (such as a Sharpie) tomark the desired biopsy site prior to acquisitionensures the biopsy contains the part of the lesionselected. The junctional edge of a lesion should notbe sampled with a punch. During processing by thehistopathology laboratory, the circular sample is cutdown the middle and each half placed face down inthe cassette. Sections for slides are made fromthese cut surfaces. Skin coloration or other fea-tures that may be obvious on clinical examinationlose their color and distinction once xed in formalinand cannot be used for orientation. dIf it is impor- tant to examine the junctional edge of a lesion thenan elliptical biopsy should be obtained. If a biopsy is obtained from an area of alopecia the direction of the hair in surrounding normal skinshould be marked with a permanent marker beforetaking the biopsy. On the submission form, re-quest that the tissue be cut along the marked line.This will ensure that entire hair follicles are presentin the resultant slide and avoid cross sections of hairfollicles. 15 To ensure the disease process is properly repre- sented several punch samples should be obtained,preferably from lesions in different stages of devel-opment. A minimum of three samples is recom-mended and some authors recommend ve toeight. 15,16Most diagnostic laboratories have a single charge for three biopsies; some laboratories do notlimit the number of skin biopsies that can be sub- mitted from a patient on one submission form.e,f Care should be taken to ensure that local anes- thetic is placed in the subcutaneous tissue under thebiopsy site as inltration of the local anesthetic intothe skin will result in artifacts that can obscurepathological changes. 16The biopsy punch should be held perpendicular to the skin and turned in onedirection while gentle pressure is applied. The bi-opsy should be carefully lifted using small forceps ora small needle, handling the subcutaneous tissueonly, and cut by a scalpel blade (preferably) or smallscissors to avoid creating stretching or crushing ar-tifacts. If the crust detaches it should be wrappedin microscope lens paper and included with the bi-opsy. 12The submission form should indicate that the crust is separate and should be cut in. To avoidcurling artifact, punch biopsies 8 mm or largershould be placed subcutaneous side down onto card-board or a piece of a tongue depressor for a fewseconds prior to being placed upside down in forma-lin for xation. Any wrapped crust should also besubmerged into the formalin for xation. 12,15 An elliptical biopsy is preferable when the junc- tional area between normal and abnormal skin and/ or evaluation of structures deep to the dermis isneeded. The biopsy should include approximatelyone third normal skin and two thirds abnormal skinand be perpendicular to the lesion edge. Ellipticalbiopsies should be placed on a tongue depressor orcardboard, cut side down, with gentle pressure ap-plied to adhere the biopsy. Preferably, the sampleshould be pinned in place (25-gauge needles workwell) to avoid curling artifact. 12The entire unit is then placed in BNF, biopsy side down. The ratio ofBNF to tissue should be 10:1 or greater to ensurecomplete xation. Excisional biopsies may be preferred when a small, circumscribed lesion can be completely removed.A wedge biopsy may be used when a large lesion, suchas a tumor or other mass, requires deep tissue forevaluation. To avoid distortion of the tissue with lo-cal anesthetic an \"L\" or ring block or regional anesthe-sia should be used. Electrocautery or laser shouldnot be used when obtaining the biopsy. Submittedtissue should be no thicker than 0.5-1 cm, as that isthe limit of formalin penetration. If a mass largerthan 1 cm has been removed, slice through most of themass at 0.5-1-cm intervals to allow proper tissue x-ation. If the margins of a lesion must be examined todetermine whether a tumor has been completely re-moved, the edges may be marked with India ink(http://www.americanmastertech.com/india_ink.htm)by rst submersing the mass in ink prior to formalinxation. The ink will dry in approximately 60 sec-onds and the sample is then placed in BNF. Alterna-tively, each border of the sample may be marked withdifferent colors of ink (http://www.cancerdiagnostics.com/CDI_Products.aspx?pid/H11005 25) and a key provided on the submission form. 150 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYShave biopsies are often used on the coronary band due to concerns of subsequent abnormal hoof growth. Biopsies should be taken toward the heelbulbs. 16These small and fragile samples are best submitted on a sponge designed for histopathologi-cal use and placed in a cassette (http://www.mercedesmedical.com) prior to immersing in forma-lin. 6Plastic cassettes and sponges may be able to be obtained from the diagnostic laboratory on re-quest. Alternatively, the biopsy may be wrapped inlens paper. The sample should be pushed into for-malin to ensure xation. All samples containing biological materials or ma- terials considered injurious if leaked should complywith the latest U.S. Postal Service shipping require-ments. At a minimum, biological samples shouldbe double bagged and surrounded by absorbent ma-terial to contain any leakage that might occur intransit. Formalin containers should be taped shut,double bagged, and preferably shipped in leak-proof(plastic) containers. Packages should be labeled\"biological material.\" Shipping instructions maybe found on many diagnostic laboratory websites,such as https://ahdc.vet.cornel.edu/docs/shipping. 4. Discussion With careful attention to appropriate collection andsubmission practices, high-quality diagnostic sam-ples can be obtained. Samples should be submittedto an accredited veterinary diagnostic laboratorythat has a dermatopathologist or a pathologist witha special interest in equine skin on staff. 2How- ever, the quality of diagnostic services provided bythe laboratory is largely dependent on the clinicaland epidemiological information provided by theveterinary clinician. 1,9The best results from a diag- nostic laboratory are obtained when the veterinarypractitioner and diagnostic laboratory professionalswork together as a team. Time spent in developinggood communication, both written and oral, with vet-erinary diagnostic laboratory professionals greatly en-hances the effectiveness of diagnostic laboratoryservices.

Introduction Empirical antimicrobial therapy can often be used in practice based upon the body system(s) affected,most likely pathogen(s) involved, and their usualsusceptibility proles. However, in many situa-tions, culture and sensitivity are warranted prior toor in conjunction with starting treatment, or in casesthat fail to respond as expected. Susceptibility pro-les are particularly important for recognizing andmonitoring antimicrobial resistance patterns thatmay develop at a farm or in an equine hospitalsetting. Interpretation of culture and susceptibil-ity reports for clinical use is not always clear cutbecause efcacy of an antibiotic depends upon notonly susceptibility of the microbe in vitro, but alsoupon whether it is likely to reach high enough con-centrations at the site of infection when adminis-tered at a given dose and route. The objectives ofthis paper are to briefly clarify the designation cri-teria used on antimicrobial susceptibility reportsand their relevance to clinical use. 2. Materials and Methods Bacterial susceptibilities to antibiotics are deter-mined by assessing inhibition of bacterial growth invitro via one of three methods: 1) Disk diffusion(Kirby-Bauer method), 2) gradient method (e.g.,Etest strips) or 3) broth (or agar) dilution. 1The method used is not standardized across the boardand depends upon laboratory preference. 2Bothgradient and dilution methods produce a quantita-tive minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC),whereas disk diffusion only provides catagoricaldata. 1,2The MIC is the lowest concentration ( /H9262g/ mL) of the antibiotic that inhibits growth of a spe-cic bacteria. The sensitivity and accuracy of thesemethods are influenced not only by sample handlingin the eld, but also by the standards of qualitycontrol in the laboratory. 3. Results A culture and sensitivity report typically lists thebacterial species against a variety of antibioticsalong with the interpretive criteria of susceptible(S), intermediate (I), or resistant (R), and usuallyalso an MIC. Susceptible (S) indicates that at therecommended dose and route, the drug should beeffective in treating an infection due to the bacterialisolate. 1Intermediate (I) indicates that the drug should be effective clinically at high doses or if theinfection is at body sites where the drug is physio-logically concentrated. 1Resistant (R) indicates that concentrations of the drug required to treat aninfection caused by the bacterial isolate are too highto be achievable in vivo and clinical efcacy has notbeen reliable. 1Whether a bacterial isolate is des- ignated as S, I, or R depends upon whether the MICobtained is above or below the Clinical LaboratoryStandards Institute (CLSI) clinical resistancebreakpoint. Clinical resistance breakpoints are bacte- ria-drug combinations and take into account in-herent resistance, species, pharmacokinetics andsite of infection. This explains why a bacteriamay be designated susceptible to a drug with anMIC that is numerically higher than that for adrug it is resistant to. Unfortunately, there arerelatively few veterinary-specic CLSI resistancebreakpoints and thus sometimes criteria are ex-trapolated from human derived breakpoints.As such, some laboratories also use the designa-tion of no interpretation (NI) alongside an MICresult if there is insufcient evidence or lack ofestablished guidelines to assign an interpretivecriteria (S, I, or R) to the specic drug-bacteriacombination in that species. Equine specicCLSI clinical Streptococcus spp. in and soft tissue and and ceftiofur and S. equi zooepi- demicus in respiratory infections. 3 4. Discussion Wherever possible, drugs with the designation of Sshould be chosen in practice. However, if choicesare limited due to resistance, availability or signi-cant economic reasons a drug with the designationof I or NI may be useable. In these instances, tak-ing account of the site of infection (i.e., if the antibi-otic is known to be concentrated at the known site ofinfection such as beta-lactams in the urine 4), admin- istering by local delivery (e.g., intra-articular, intra-ocular), or increasing the systemic dose, ifappropriate, may well facilitate clinical efcacy.For example, penicillin against a Klebsiella obtainedfrom a urine culture in a case of cystitis may bedesignated /H110228 (NI) because the MIC is high but it may well be effective due to the fact that penicillin isso concentrated in urine. 4The important factor to determine in a case like this would be what theactual MIC was (i.e., was it 16 or did the laboratorystop diluting after 8?). In all cases, the concept ofthe mutant prevention concentration (MPC) andmutant selection window should always be kept inmind. The MPC is a higher concentration than theMIC and the range of concentrations between thesetwo values is termed the mutant selection window. 5 For example, if the MIC is 2 /H9262g/mL and the MPC is 4/H9262g/mL, the mutant selection window equals drug concentrations that fall between 2 and 4 /H9262g/mL. If drug concentrations in vivo fall into this rangethen the risk of resistance developing to the drug ismuch greater than either side of it. In general, thisis more likely to occur with drugs designated I thanS because drug concentrations at the site of infectionare likely to be closer to the MIC. Using the aboveexample of a mutant prevention window for 2-4 /H9262g/mL, antibiotic X is designated I on a susceptibil- ity panel and in a random sample of three horses,reaches concentrations of 2-5 /H9262g/mL at the site of infection depending upon the horse. In horse 1 itreaches concentrations of 5 /H9262g/mL and in this horse, antibiotic X will be effective. In horse 2 it reachesconcentrations of 3.5 /H9262g/mL and in this horse, anti- biotic X will also be effective; however, resistance ismuch more likely to develop during the course oftreatment in horse 2 than in horse 1. In horse 3antibiotic X reaches concentrations of 2 /H9262g/mL. In horse 3, resistance is no more likely to developthan in horse 2; however, there is a greater chance ofconcentrations falling below the MIC due to admin-istration errors, particularly if given orally. In con-trast, for the same bacterial pathogen, antibiotic Y,designated S on the susceptibility panel, reachesconcentrations of 7-10 /H9262g/mL at the site of infection in the same three horses. Thus, if available antibi-otic Y is the better choice because it will be effectivein all three horses and has the least chance of resis-tance developing during treatment. It is useful tonote that combining antibiotics can sometimes sig-nicantly decrease the MPC, e.g., a macrolide incombination with rifampin 6and thus improve the chances of treatment efcacy, especially in long-term treatment because the chances of resistanceemerging is greatly reduced. Unfortunately, theMPC is not routinely tested, but understanding ofthe concept helps with rational and responsible se-lection of antibiotics.

Introduction Sarcoids represent the most common skin tumor in horses. Multiple modalities are described in theliterature with no one treatment accepted as thegold standard. 2. Materials and Methods The medical records of all cases undergoing theautologous vaccination procedure from January2009 to May 2014 were reviewed. Using sharp dis-section, the lesion was debulked and the removedsarcoid was sectioned into multiple small-tissuecubes. The pieces were placed within liquid nitro-gen and then implanted in an area located just ven-tral to the nuchal ligament. The presence of multiple initial sarcoids, the initial tumor area in cm 2, the type of historical treatment, and the use of topical historical treatments were ana-lyzed by logistic regression to identify association withtumor regrowth or a decrease in tumor size. 3. Results The autologous vaccination procedure was per-formed on 15 geldings and three mares. The me-dian time to follow-up from the autologousimplantation was 10.5 months. Twelve of 16 (75%)cases demonstrated a decrease in number of sar-coids with 15 of 16 cases (93.8%) demonstrating adecrease in size of sarcoids. Complete regressionwas noted in 11 of 16 (68.8%) cases. Mild complications were noted in seven of 16 cases (43.8%). The most common complication reportedwas swelling. 4. Discussion Although the mechanism of the autologous prepara-tion is unknown, we suspect the tissue acts as animmunomodulatory agent to stimulate a host re-sponse not only against the debulked lesion, but onother lesions on the body.

Introduction Six horses originating from four different racetracks in California were submitted for necropsy and diag-nostic evaluation. The six horses had a history ofcollapse and sudden death during or immediatelyafter exercise. All horses showed massive hemo-peritoneum and/or hemorrhages in other cavities ororgans. Traces of the ARs brodifacoum, diphaci-none, or bromadiolone were detected in liver tissuefrom all six horses. The detected concentrations ofARs in the six horses were considerably less thanwhat is typically thought to be associated with tox- icity, 1although diagnostic liver concentrations have not been determined in most species. Other fre-quent causes of massive hemorrhages in horses wereexcluded in ve of the six cases. One horse had apelvic fracture that did not seem to be related to the abdominal hemorrhage. It is speculated that exer-cise-related physiological alterations or a combina-tion of exercise and other unidentied factorspresent in a racetrack environment may reduce thetoxicity threshold for ARs in strenuously exercisinghorses. The objective of this paper is to present thebasis for the conclusion that ARs pose a potentialand previously unrecognized risk to racehorses.Analysis of liver tissue for ARs should be performedwhenever idiopathic hemorrhage is found in equinesudden deaths associated with exercise. 2. Materials and Methods A full necropsy was performed on all six horses aspreviously described. 2All horses dying within Cal- Racing Board (CHRB) -regulated rac- ing or training racetrack facilities are required toundergo a necropsy. Necropsies are conducted un-der standard protocols designed for racehorses fromCHRB-regulated facilities by pathologists withinthe California Animal Health and Food Safety Lab-oratory System (CAHFS), which is managedthrough the University of California at Davis Schoolof Veterinary Medicine. The necropsies in thisstudy were conducted at the CAHFS laboratories atSan Bernardino for southern California tracks andDavis for northern California tracks. Between December 2012 and September 2014, six horses submitted for necropsy were diagnosed ashaving idiopathic hemorrhage, primarily in the ab-domen. No obvious cause for the hemorrhage wasidentied and AR testing was performed on liversamples. Traces of ARs were identied throughanalysis of liver tissue. A total of 374 horses, in-cluding the six reported here, were submitted fromCHRB racetracks for necropsy during the 22-monthtimeframe described. Three of the cases wereThoroughbreds dying during or immediately afterracing, one was a Thoroughbred training at a gallopand the other two were pony horses working on thetrack. A pony horse in the racetrack setting refersto a full-sized working horse that accompanies com-petitive horses during the post-parade and pre-racewarmup or during training workouts. One ponyhorse was a Quarter Horse taking a horse to the starting gate to race; the other pony horse was aThoroughbred working in the morning. TheThoroughbred pony collapsed on the track, wasremoved to the stable area equine hospital, anddied shortly thereafter. All other horses died onthe track. The six fatalities occurred at four dif-ferent racetracks. One horse had shipped from afth racetrack the morning of its fatal race. Anticoagulant screens were performed on pre- pared liver samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ausing a previously published method modied for tissue analysis.3 Any sample testing positive for an anticoagulantwas then quantitated by high-performance liquidchromatography busing either quantitation for these ARs varyaccording to their sensitivity to ultraviolet or flu-orescence detection. The reporting limits in livertissue are 0.01 ppm brodifacoum; samples from 27 racehorses euthanized due to catastrophic musculoskeletal injuries were ana-lyzed for ARs in the same manner as controls.The proportion of horses with idiopathic hemor-rhage that had detectable AR in the liver was com-pared with the proportion of control horses that didnot have detectable AR in the liver using Fisher'sexact test. CHRB personnel conducted eld investigations to determine AR use and identify possible exposureroutes at California racetracks. The specic objec-tive was to develop an understanding of all potentialAR sources, types, distribution methods, and theassociated risk of accessibility to the horses. On-site inspections of the stable areas were conductedat each track except one, Track A, which had closed.One horse had shipped into Track D in the morningfrom a fth track, Track E. That track was simi-larly inspected. Interviews were conducted withstable managers, trainers, barn personnel, and ei-ther commercial pest control vendors and/or trackpersonnel responsible for rodent control programs.Findings were recorded and evaluated relative tonecropsy results. 3. Results Case number, breed, age, sex, activity at time ofdeath, pathological ndings, AR identied at nec-ropsy, track, and AR in use by track are listed inTable 1. The ARs identied at nding in ve of the sixhorses in the current series was severe hemoperito-neum, with a variable combination of hemothorax,hemopericardium, and mesenteric, muscular dia-phragmatic, and/or pulmonary hemorrhages. hemorrhagic but The hemor-rhage into the abdomen, thorax, and pericardiumwas characterized by the presence of large quanti-ties of mostly free unclotted blood within thecorresponding cavity. The hemorrhage was char-acterized by approximately 8-20 liters of blood inthe abdomen (Fig. 1) except for Case 6, in whichthere was a minimal hemoperitoneum; approxi-mately 4-10 liters in the thorax except for Case 6, inwhich there was a minimal hemothorax; and ap-proximately 0.5 liters in the pericardial sac exceptfor Case 6, in which there was an estimated 2 litersof free blood. Case 6 was unusual in that it was theonly case that did not die immediately on the trackand showed a general hemorrhagic diathesis in mul-tiple organs and tissues. After careful gross exam-ination and detailed dissection of the main thoracic,abdominal, and pelvic blood vessels, no tears orother vascular lesions could be identied. Onehorse (Case 4) had an acute pelvic fracture withevidence of a pre-existing stress fracture with exten-sive hemorrhaging into tissues surrounding thefracture, but after careful examination, the extra-peritoneal hemorrhage did not seem to communicatewith the abdomen. Trace levels of brodifacoum were found in the livers of three horses; trace levels of bromadiolonewere detected in two horses; and a trace level ofdiphacinone was found in one horse. No traces ofARs were identied in the liver samples from 27 156 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYracehorses euthanized due to musculo- skeletal injuries used as controls. A Fisher's exacttest showed the probability of detectable AR inhorses with idiopathic hemorrhage (6/6) was signif-icantly higher (P /H11021.000001) than in control horses (0/27). The eld investigation identied the rodent con- trol program at each track, the AR used in thoseprograms and the specic ARs that were being usedduring the period during which each horse died.Track inspections were conducted at Tracks B, C, D,and E. Track A had closed but a previous investi-gation had gathered pest control program informa-tion. Tracks B, D, and E had pest control programsmanaged by commercial vendors. Track A had apest control program that used ARs in the stablearea managed by track personnel. Track C pro-vided mechanical traps to trainers and barn person-nel but did not use a commercial vendor in the stablearea. Commercial vendors are licensed and regu-lated in California by the Department of PesticideRegulation. The ARs were distributed in sealedand secured hard-plastic bait stations outside thebarns. The bait stations were not located nearstalls when horses were on the grounds. All com-mercial vendors reported that they had instances inwhich the bait stations had been broken open andthe bait looted or otherwise removed. Track A Track A used track maintenance personnel to man- age their pest control program with bromadiolone, asecond-generation AR, within enclosed, hard-plasticbait stations. Diphacinone, a rst-generation ARwas identied in Case 1. Track B Track B contracts with a commercial vendor for their pest control program. The vendor uses brodi-facoum in sealed and secured bait traps when horsesare present. When horses were not on the grounds,liquid diphacinone stations, including in stalls, wereadded to the brodifacoum program. Case 2 died atTrack B with a brodifacoum nding and Case 6 diedat Track B with a bromadiolone nding. Track C Track C does not use a commercial vendor in the stable area. Upon request, Track C managementprovides traps and labor support on an as-requiredTable 1.

Case 5 hadshipped from Track E the morning of his death torace at Track D. Bromadiolone was found at nec-ropsy in Case 5. Personnel Interviews Barn personnel interviews were conducted at TracksB, C, and E. Barn personnel provided statementsthat unauthorized and uncontrolled distribution ofARs was common. From statements made to inves-tigators, unauthorized AR distribution occurs be-cause barn personnel considered rodent controlefforts inadequate and believed it was necessary totake matters into their own hands. Based on inter-views, barn personnel were unaware that ARs pre-sented a risk to the horses. 4. Discussion Sudden deaths at California racetracks have been aparticular interest in recent years after an unusualcluster of cases led to national press attention.Sudden deaths in racing and race training are morefrequent than generally recognized. A review ofsudden death in racing horses identied a number ofcauses of death including internal hemorrhaging. 4 Excluding accidents and musculoskeletal-relatedcauses for Thoroughbreds, 23/475 racing fatalitiesand 55/507 training fatalities could be attributed tosudden death at CHRB-regulated tracks betweenJuly 1, 2007 and June 30, 2013. For Thorough-breds racing in California between July 1, 2007 andJune 30, 2013, that translates to one sudden deathfor every 8789 racing starts and an estimated onesudden death for every 158,000 Thoroughbred train-ing days. 5Case 1 was one of the horses in the aforementioned cluster of sudden deaths associatedwith one trainer. The nding of diphacinone in theliver of Case 1 was thought to be coincidental at thetime but led to an expansion of toxicology testing toinclude ARs whenever the pathologist observed un-usual hemorrhage. Five additional cases of ARndings in liver tissue of horses with sudden deathwhile racing or training and idiopathic hemorrhagewere subsequently identied during the next 22months. At gross necropsy, the most signicant nding in ve of the six horses was severe hemoperitoneum.The most frequent causes of hemoperitoneum inhorses are neoplasia, uterine artery rupture, mesen-teric injury, and trauma. Idiopathic hemoperito-neum is either the rst or second most frequentclassication of hemoperitoneum described inhorses. 6,7After gross and/or microscopic examina- tion of the tissue samples, common causes for hemo-peritoneum were eliminated with the exception ofAR intoxication and thrombocytopenia. Thrombo-cytopenia is an unlikely cause of hemorrhage due tothe lack of other pathological signs. In addition toAR intoxication and drug reactions, 8thrombocyto- penia is associated with disseminated intravascularcoagulation and some neoplasias, 9which were not present in these horses. Although the pathologistwas unable to identify a lesion into the peritoneumwith the pelvic fracture in Case 4, the possibility that a sharp bone fragment produced a vasculartear that was not detected cannot be completelyexcluded. ARs function as vitamin K antagonists by inhib- iting vitamin K epoxide reductase, the enzyme thatactivates vitamin K. Their main effect is due toinhibition of the prothrombin complex (coagulationfactors II, VII, IX, and X) as a result of interferencewith the action of vitamin K. The normal synthesisof coagulation proteins (factors I, II, VII, IX, and X)are in the liver. There is a latent period after ARexposure during which clotting factors already pres-ent are depleted but are no longer being produceddue to the AR inhibition of coagulation factor syn-thesis. ARs brodifacoum andbromadiolone. roden- ticides, rst-generation require multiple feed-ings to be effective. Several rst-generation ARshave been used medically, including in horses.In horses, these compounds have shown limited ef-fectiveness in the treatment of thrombotic diseasesor diseases suspected or perceived of being of throm-botic origin, such as navicular disease, thrombophle-bitis, chronic laminitis, disseminated intravascularcoagulation, and verminous aneurysm. none is one of the more toxic rst-generation ARsand does not seem to have been reported as beingused medically. Second-generation ARs were de-veloped to counter resistance of rodent target spe-cies to rst-generation ARs. Second-generationARs are highly toxic and have longer half-lives thanrst-generation ARs. As rodenticides, a singlefeeding of second-generation ARs can be effective.ARs can be detected for much longer periods of timein the liver than in serum. The half-life of second-generation ARs in the livers of horses is unknown,but has been reported to be greater than 300 daysfor brodifacoum in mice. 10 Despite the highly statistically signicant associ- ation between severe hemorrhage and detection oftrace amounts of anticoagulants in these horses, it 158 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYcannot be denitively determined the idiopathic hemorrhage in these cases.The nding of unclotted free blood in multiple bodycavities is consistent with an underlying coagulopa-thy. Blood clotting parameters such as activatedpartial thromboplastin time and prothrombin timecan be performed antemortem, but these tests can-not be using postmortem samples. Theconcentrations of brodifacoum, diphacinone, or bro-madiolone were all reported as trace levels in livertissue. Toxic doses for brodifacoum, diphacinone,or bromadiolone in horses must be extrapolatedfrom other species or from occasional clinical casereports and there is considerable species variability.Available toxicokinetics for ARs is primarily basedupon acute intoxications and serum concentrations.There is little information regarding chronic AR ex-posure and toxicity and how that relates to livertissue concentrations as reported here. Althoughthe AR concentrations were considered low, liver ARconcentrations indicative of intoxication are largelyunknown, and they are certainly unknown for thehorse. A common factor in these cases is that allsix horses died while undergoing exercise or imme-diately after exercise. Whether an unrecognizedexercise-associated factor or factors lowers toxicitythresholds is speculative, but horses undergo dra-matic physiological changes in response to exercise.There are well-documented marked increases inblood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature instrenuously exercising horses, and other physiolog-ical changes including pH alterations, release of va-soactive amines, or other metabolic mediators andbyproducts. A number of increase AR commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug phenylbutazone. 12Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase AR toxicity by dis-placing ARs from protein-binding sites. All three rac-ing horses had received phenylbutazone within 48hours of their deaths; the other three horses had eithera record of phenylbutazone administration or barnpersonnel recollections of having received phenylbu- tazone within 30 days of death. Other drugs usedon the racetrack that alter AR toxicity include phe-nytoin, salicylates, potentiated sulfas, and steroidhormones, but there was no specic history of any ofthese drugs being used in the six cases reported. ARs are highly effective, cost efcient, and widely used for rodent control. Commercial pest controlvendors interviewed were dubious that incidentallow-level exposure could be associated with toxicity.AR baits are made highly palatable by the additionof saccharose, grains, and other material meant toattract rodents. Domestic animals are typically in-toxicated accidentally by direct access and ingestionof relatively large amounts of the AR bait. Extrap-olating reported acute exposure toxic dosages at just10% of the lower LD 50reported in dogs1to horses with their respective AR bait concentration, a horsewould need to consume nearly half a pound of brodi-coum AR bait eor greater than 5 pounds of dipah-cinone AR baitf. Based on the investigation and interviews, horses did not seem to have had directaccess to large amounts of AR bait. An alternative explanation would be chronic, low-level AR expo-sure. Given the long half-lives for ARs in livertissue, especially the second-generation ARsbrodifacoum and bromadiolone, bioaccumulationof these ARs in liver from chronic, low-level expo-sure should be possible. Whether this would re-sult in an AR toxicosis is unknown and heretofore,unreported. The relationship between AR use at the tracks and the ARs found in necropsies from horses dyingat those tracks is inconsistent. In acute toxicosis,there should be a close relationship between thetrack's rodent control program AR and the AR foundat necropsy. That was not the case except for Case2 and Case 5, and only the latter if AR exposure isassigned to the track Case 5 shipped from the morn-ing of its race. Racehorses in California changestabling locations frequently, including periods atoff-track locations during rest periods, about whichno information concerning AR use was available.Given the long biological half-lives of ARs and thepossibility of bioaccumulation, condently identify-ing the location of AR exposure is problematic.None of the barn personnel interviewed could spe-cically name the AR product they had used and anunidentied environmental source of AR exposureseparate from the AR use in stables as describedcannot be completely eliminated. ARs have rela-tively long environmental half-lives and have beenidentied in many wildlife species, but usually insecondary and tertiary predators. 13 Rodent infestations in stables are common and difcult to control. Even with grains kept in rodentproof containers as required at California race-tracks, there is enough unavoidable spillage andother food sources to support large rodent popula-tions at racetrack stables. There are numerous ro-dent nesting locations in any barn, but especiallyolder wooden barns such as at Tracks B and E.Interviews with barn personnel made clear their useof ARs near horses was out of frustration with theirbarn rodent problem and from a lack of appreciationof potential horse health risks. Unauthorized anduncontrolled use of ARs by barn personnel is de-scribed as \"freelancing\" in communicating the ARrisks to regulators and horseman. The CHRB hasinitiated a backside education program in collabora-tion with track management and trainers at TracksB, C, and E. All personnel have been provided in-formation with regard to the potential risks associ-ated with AR use and have been instructed tocontact track management with all rodent controlconcerns rather than freelance AR use. There are the options to eliminate AR use at race- tracks. Track D, which has a relatively small rodentinfestation, has already discontinued use of second-generation ARs. At other tracks with signicant ro-dent populations, trapping operations would be labor AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 159HOW-TO SESSION: CLINICAL PATHOLOGYintensive, expensive, and of questionable efcacy. Barn personnel interviews suggest that without a ro-dent control program, rodent control measures will beinitiated independently. Alternatives to AR use be-sides trapping are the non-ARs bromethalin and chole-calciferol. The disadvantage and serious concern isthat there is no antidote for either of these rodenticidesand there is no information as to their toxicity levels inhorses. Whether these non-ARs would pose a greateror lesser risk to horses at racetracks is unknown.Non-ARs should not be considered a safe alternativewithout careful consideration of their potential risks. This study demonstrates a very strong association between sudden death with idiopathic hemorrhagein exercising horses at racetracks in California andAR ndings in liver tissue at necropsy. Toxicoki-netic information for ARs in horses is lacking, espe-cially as related to liver concentrations and chronic,low-level exposure. AR toxicity thresholds may belowered by exercise or by exercise in combinationwith other management practices at racetracks.AR exposure should be restricted at racetracks andother locations stabling strenuously exercisinghorses until further information is available. ARexposure should be considered and evaluatedthrough analysis of liver tissue whenever idiopathichemorrhage is found in equine sudden deaths atracetracks or other equine sporting events.

Usingan existing in vivo model of TMJ synovitis, theobjective of this study was to determine whetherunilateral inflammation of the equine TMJ wouldlead to alterations in the chewing cycle. 2. Materials and Methods Six horses free of dental abnormalities wereequipped with an optical motion tracking system.Horses were observed chewing grass hay over3-minute intervals. Regardless of the side ofmastication, all horses were injected in the leftTMJ with lipopolysaccharide (0.0025 /H9262g). Six hours post injection the horses were reassessed.All data were compared using paired ttests. 3. Results Four of six horses developed effusion of the injectedTMJs; two also began quidding. All horses injectedon the original side of the power stroke switched sidespost injection, the two injected on the contralateralside did not. All horses showed reduced vertical pitchof the mandible (mouth opening) but not lateral move-ment post injection. Overall rostrocaudal movementof the mandible did not change, but timing relative tothe opening and closing phases of the cycle wasdifferent. 4. Discussion Changes induced by TMJ inflammation were subtle inmost horses. Even in those with demonstrable aver-sion behavior, horses continued to eat.

Common clinical signs vestibulocochlear dysfunction, secondarycorneal ulceration, and head tossing; and less commonsigns include dysphagia and seizures. Both medicaland surgical treatment options are available. 2. Materials and Methods Medical records of horses diagnosed with THO wereretrieved and signalment, history, clinical signs, di-agnostic methods, treatment, and outcome were re-corded for assessment. Statistical analysis wasperformed to compare outcome between horsestreated medically and surgically. 3.

Theobjectives of this study were to review cases pre-senting with entrapment of intestine in the gas-trosplenic ligament and compare the signalment,diagnostic ndings, complications following sur-gery, and short-term outcome with EFE given thatit is the authors' impression that case presenta-tions for these two types of colic at our hospitalwere similar. 2.

Introduction NSE of the large colon is a common cause of colic in horses. The objective of this study was to deter-mine long-term survival and factors associated withtreatment success following NSE of the large colonand colic recurrence frequency following laparo-scopic ablation relative to an untreated cohort. 2. Materials and Methods Medical records of horses treated for NSE betweenJanuary 1, 1999 and June 1, 2014 were reviewed.Data collected included signalment, physicalexamination parameters, laboratory results, diag-nostic ndings, and treatments. Factors associatedwith surgical treatment and non-survival were ex-amined with separate multivariable logistic regres-sion models to determine the influence on outcomes.Change in colic scores between groups was exam-ined with a Mann-Whitney Utest. 3. Results During the study period, 247 NSE events were re-corded in 225 horses. Of horses admitted for NSE,90.2% survived to discharge, 86.2% survived 1 year,and 81.7% survived 2 years. Increased packed cellvolume after correction (P /H11005.027) and increased age (P/H11005.039) were associated with short-term and non-survival, respectively. Colic frequencyin horses undergoing laparoscopic ablation de-creased following the procedure when comparedwith horses without an ablation (P /H11005.003). After discharge for laparoscopic ablation, all 34 horseswith 1-year follow-up available were alive. 4. Discussion Survival is high following NSE correction. De-creased colic frequency following laparoscopic abla-tion suggests successful colic prophylaxis.

Introduction Acute abdominal pain, commonly referred to as colic, is frequently encountered in equine medicineand is most often caused by gastrointestinal disease.The reported incidence of colic in the general popu-lation ranges from 3.5 to 10.6 cases per 100 horsesper year. 1-3Most episodes of colic are managed without surgical intervention and involve diseasesof the large colon. 1-6In a study of 604 horses ad- mitted to an equine hospital in Canada, large colon impactions and displacements were the two mostcommon causes of colic, with colon impactions ac-counting for 38.4% of medically managed cases. 6 Of 935 horses admitted to a referral center in SouthAfrica, medical colic was caused by large colon im-paction, tympany, or displacement in 52% of cases. 4 Although the specic gastrointestinal lesions are notidentied in most cases in the primary care setting,20% of colic episodes were attributed to intestinalimpactions or primary tympany in one study. 5 Cecal and colonic gas distention occurs secondary to simple and strangulating large intestinal obstruc-tion or as primary tympany caused by abnormalfermentation of ingesta. Although gas can some-times escape around simple large intestinal obstruc-tions, complete obstruction results in rapid cecal and colonic distention as gas accumulates oral (proxi-mal) to the lesion. If bowel distention is severe,increased intraluminal pressure is transmittedthrough the intestinal wall, causing venous occlu-sion, mural edema, and eventual reduction in arte-riolar blood flow. 7,8Although ischemia of the bowel wall is more commonly associated with small intes-tinal distention, it has been observed after pro- longed cecal distention, and experimental distentionof the small colon to an intraluminal pressure of 40mm Hg has been shown to reduce mural microvas-cular perfusion. 9In one study of horses with stran- gulating large colon volvulus, colonic luminalpressures greater than 38 cm H 2O were associated with nonsurvival.10 Decompression of the cecum and colon can relieve pain associated with bowel distention and may pre-vent ischemia caused by high intraluminal pressure.Percutaneous trocarization of the cecum and largecolon through both the right and left paralumbarfossae has been described, 11and a recent report suggests that transrectal trocarization is safe andeffective in relieving cecal and colonic tympany. 12 Historically, trocarization largely been reserved AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 169THE THREE Cs OF GI: CHEWING, COLIC, AND COMPLICATIONS NOTESfor cases of severe abdominal discomfort when sur- gical exploration of the abdomen was not an option.Many practitioners perceive the risk of complica-tions such as peritonitis and abscessation at thetrocarization site as a signicant impediment toroutine application of the procedure. Althoughthese complications can occur, they are infrequentlyreported when percutaneous trocarization is per-formed properly. In the author's clinical practice,trocarization is routinely performed, and experiencesuggests that complications after the procedure arerare. This article will describe a method of percu-taneous trocarization of the cecum and large colon that can routinely be used in the management ofequine colic. 2. Materials and Methods When performed on the right side of the abdomen, a10/H1100310-cm area overlying the right paralumbar fossa is clipped of hair and prepared with povidone-iodine surgical scrub. The trocar insertion site isidentied at a point midway between the tubercoxae and the caudal rib, at the level of the cecalbase (approximately 5 cm ventral to the tuber coxaein a 500-kg horse). Transabdominal ultrasonogra-phy is not routinely used to determine the location oftrocar placement. The skin and body wall at theinsertion site are inltrated with 3 mL of 2% Trocarization is performedusing a catheter with an attached intravenous tub-ing extension set (Fig. 1). Using aseptic technique,the catheter is inserted with the tip oriented perpen-dicular to the skin or slightly ventrally. The freeend of the attached extension set is submerged in asmall container of water, and the catheter is slowlyadvanced until gas bubbles are seen escaping fromthe tubing. This position is maintained until gasceases to escape, and the trocar is not removed fromthe catheter during the procedure. If necessary,the catheter is partially withdrawn and repositionedseveral times to achieve maximal bowel decompres-sion. A suction device can be attached to the end ofthe extension set to hasten the procedure, with pe-riodic disconnection from the suction apparatus andsubmersion of the extension set end in water toensure continued appropriate catheter placement.At the end of the procedure, 300 to 500 mg (3-5 mL)of gentamicin sulfate is infused through the catheteras it is removed from the abdomen. Percutaneous trocarization on the left side of the abdomen is also performed within the paralumbarfossa; however, transabdominal ultrasonography isused to identify the precise location of trocar inser-tion and minimize the risk of inadvertently pene-trating the spleen. Trocarization is only performedif the gas-lled colon is ultrasonographically visual-ized adjacent to the body wall. 3. Results In the author's experience, percutaneous trocariza- tion and bowel decompression are effective in manycases, as determined by a reduction in abdominalcircumference and a decrease in palpable large in-testinal gas distention upon rectal examination.In addition, subjective assessment suggests that theprocedure frequently alleviates pain, although thismay only be temporary if the underlying cause ofcolic is not corrected. Although retrospective analysis of records is con- venient, determining the efcacy of percutaneoustrocarization in resolving intestinal disease is dif-cult using this approach; owner willingness to un-dertake exploratory surgery, the likelihood thatsevere lesions more frequently prompt decompres-sion, clinician preferences, and other undocumentedfactors confound any conclusions. Likewise, complications of the procedure is problematicbecause peritonitis, intra-abdominal hemorrhage,and leakage of ingesta from the gastrointestinaltract could result from the underlying disease orconcurrently performed procedures such as abdom-inocentesis or exploratory surgery. It is also possi-ble that minor complications such as local cellulitisat the trocarization site are not always noted in the Fig. 1. Proper placement and equipment used to perform percu-taneous cecal trocarization through the right paralumbar fossa. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE THREE GI: CHEWING, COLIC, AND COMPLICATIONSrecord, and subclinical peritonitis may not be iden- tied unless other factors prompt an analysis ofperitoneal fluid. That said, no catastrophic compli-cations were thought to result directly from percu-taneous cecal or colonic trocarization amongapproximately 100 horses medically managed forsigns of colic at the author's practice over the past 5years, some of which underwent the procedure mul-tiple times; the infrequent complications attributedto the procedure were minor and included local cel-lulitis at the catheter insertion site and mild perito-neal Discussion Percutaneous cecal in nonstrangu-lating gastrointestinal lesions with large bowel dis-tension and seems to be effective at reducing pain.Stress hormones and increased sympathetic tonecaused by pain decrease gastrointestinal motility,making pain reduction important in these cases.Decompression of the colon could potentially facili-tate correction of displacements without surgical in-tervention by decreasing colon size and allowing formore mobility within the abdomen; however, ef-cacy is difcult to assess using retrospective analy-sis of medical records. One report found that heartrate and the use of strong analgesic medication sig-nicantly decreased, and the number of horses not increasemorbidity or mortality in that study. Although an-other study demonstrated an association betweenrepeated decompression procedures and mortality, 14 a confounding factor is that horses with more severedisease require more aggressive care and are alsoless likely to survive. No serious complicationswere identied in either study; minor complicationsascribed to trocarization diarrhea,peritonitis, local inflammation, cellulitis, and hema-toma and abscess formation at the catheter inser-tion site. 13,14Although rare, life-threatening complications such as severe peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess formation, and severe intra-abdominal hemorrhage have occurred on occasion. 15 The overall complication rate is estimated at 5% to10%. 14,15The risks of the procedure should there- fore be weighed against its potential benets in eachindividual case. The occurrence of complicationsmay potentially be reduced by only performing theprocedure when the gas-distended large intestine ispalpable in close proximity to the body wall. Ultra-sound guidance can also be used to avoid perforatingorgans other than the intestine while inserting thecatheter. Although surgical intervention should not be de- layed in favor of bowel decompression, percutaneoustrocarization may benet horses that eventually re-quire abdominal exploration. The procedure caneven be performed while preparing for surgery.Intestinal viability may be preserved by decreasingintraluminal pressure, improving microvascularperfusion, and preventing bowel wall ischemia andnecrosis until surgical correction is performed.Prolonged large colon distention can also injure my-enteric plexuses and contribute to motility disorderspostoperatively. In addition, high intra-abdominalpressure hinders venous return under anesthesia and positioned in dorsal re-cumbency. Anesthesia risk may be further in-creased by acute lung injury secondary to bowelcompromise and systemic inflammation. Onestudy in which experimental distention of the smallcolon was maintained at 40 mm Hg for 4 hoursidentied histological evidence of neutrophil inl-tration and increased myeloperoxidase activity inthe lungs of horses euthanized 12 hours later. 16 Remote organ damage caused by systemic inflam-mation in these cases could also conceivably in-crease the risk of developing laminitis. Penetration of the cecum or colon likely causes mild localized peritoneal inflammation, and possiblygeneralized peritonitis, even in many routine caseswhere no clinically recognized complications havearisen from the trocarization procedure. Althoughchanges in peritoneal fluid nucleated cell countshave previously been attributed to \"uncomplicated\"cecal and colonic trocarization, 15The author is not aware of any studies that have systematically eval-uated peritoneal fluid changes over time after theseprocedures. Ventral colon enterocentesis has beenshown experimentally to increase peritoneal fluidnucleated cell counts and specic gravity within 4hours of intestinal puncture, with abnormalitiespersisting for at least 2 to 4 days in peritoneal fluidcollected from locations adjacent to the enterocenti-sis site. 17It is therefore conceivable that cecal and colonic trocarization could induce similar abnormal-ities and confound interpretations of subsequentperitoneal fluid analyses. However, the author hasnot recognized trocarization as a hindrance to inter-preting peritoneal fluid analysis when determiningthe need for surgical intervention. It is possiblethat peritoneal inflammation remains localized dor-sally at the trocarization site and is not reflected atremote locations in the ventral abdomen where rou-tine abdominocentesis is performed, at least for therst few hours after the procedure, which is oftenwhen decisions regarding surgical intervention aremade. Although no controlled studies have examined whether cecal or colonic trocarization increases therisk of intraoperative or postoperative complicationsin horses that eventually undergo abdominal sur-gery, the author has not recognized such an associ-ation in surgical cases. It is unlikely thattrocarization adversely affects surgical outcomes be-cause the puncture site is small and often difcult tolocate; if identied, it is associated with only mildfocal intestinal wall inflammation. Routine admin-istration of perioperative antibiotics likely mitigates AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 171THE THREE Cs OF GI: CHEWING, COLIC, AND COMPLICATIONSany additional risk of peritonitis attributable to the trocarization procedure itself. On the contrary, itis possible that trocarization reduces surgical risksby improving the safety of anesthesia in horses withsevere abdominal distention. It may also hastenrecovery by lessening intestinal wall injury. In conclusion, the benets of percutaneous cecal and colonic decompression include improvement in intestinal wall perfusion, andsafer anesthesia if abdominal surgery becomes nec-essary. Although not entirely without risk, anec-dotal evidence and personal experience suggest thatserious complications are rare when the procedure isperformed correctly and appropriate cases are se-lected for treatment. Careful monitoring of the pa-tient's systemic stability and viability of the bowel isessential after trocarization to ensure that surgicalintervention is not delayed in cases of strangulatinglesions due to temporary pain relief provided bylarge intestinal decompression. This percutaneoustrocarization procedure should be considered in thearsenal of therapies used routinely in the manage-ment of colic.

Introduction The inconvenience and poor performance of fecal egg counting methods has contributed to widespread pro-phylactic treatment and concomitant development ofparasite resistance to anthelmintic drugs. The avail- ability of a simpler, stall-side test could help veterinar-ians reverse this worrying trend of treatment withoutdiagnosis. Chitin represents a potential universalegg marker that could be used to develop a simpler andmore rapid test for parasite egg output. 2. Materials and Methods Parasite eggs were fluorescently labeled with chitinbinding domain. Eggs were imaged either by fluo-rescence microscopy or using a smartphone with a fluorescence gel imager. Eggs werequantied computationally using a particle analysis algorithm. 3. Results Chitin binding domain rapidly labeled ascarid,strongyle, trichostrongyle, trichurid, and coccidianova collected from horses, cattle, goats, and catswhen combined with a lter system to remove excessfeces and trap the eggs.

Formost drugs used to treat POI in man as well as in horses, conflicting data exist concerning theeffectiveness of these drugs and very frequently there is more evidence that a drug is not effectivethan the other way round, but still we use these drugs because we do not have a better, more effectivealternative. Furthermore, it is sometimes challenging to identify the species in which this informa-tion was generated. Therefore, POI remains a signicant clinical problem in man and obviously alife-threatening one in horses. Given that the pathophysiology of POI is a multifactorial one,multimodal prevention and treatment of POI is probably the most effective way to address thisproblem in man as well as in horses. Authors' addresses: Department of Surgery, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Marchioninistrasse 1. Introduction In man, postoperative ileus (POI) after abdominal surgery remains a signicant problem leading topatients' discomfort, morbidity, and subsequently toadditional costs in patient care estimated to be ashigh as $1B per year in the United States. 1During the last decades tremendous efforts have been madeto improve our understanding of POI in man usingbasic science in animal models (particularly rodent models) but also in clinical studies in man. Thisextended our understanding of the pathophysiologyof POI and enabled the introduction of mechanisticstrategies to prevent and treat patients with POI(see below). Nevertheless, POI remains a clinicalproblem in man, probably due to its multifactorialpathophysiology. The purpose of this review is to rst, give an overview about the current under-standing of POI from the perspective of a humansurgeon and scientist studying POI for several years(M.S.K.). Second, we want to summarize the pres-ent understanding and therapy of POI in horses toidentify further treatment options for POI for equinesurgeons. 2. Current Understanding of the Pathophysiology of POI It is of note that our understanding of the patho-physiology of POI is based mainly on observationsfrom rodent models in which POI was induced bystandardized mechanical manipulation of the smallintestine. POI in man is characterized by a bipha- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 177THE THREE Cs OF GI: CHEWING, COLIC, AND COMPLICATIONS NOTESsic response to the operative trauma with an early neurogenic inhibition of intestinal transit followedby a later paralysis of gastrointestinal motilitycaused by an intramural inflammatory response. 2-4 In the early neurogenic phase intestinal motility isinhibited by sympathetic reflex pathways as a re-sponse to trauma to shut down intestinal motility. 5 The extent of this reflex inhibition depends on theseverity of the surgical trauma. When the traumais great enough, even vagal inhibitory pathways areactivated and impair motility by mediators such as nitric oxide or vasoactiveintestinal polypeptide within the bowel wall. 3,6 Furthermore, intestinal manipulation leads to acti-vation of afferent vagal pathways and sensitizationof these leads toactivation vagal efferent neurons causing the re-lease of inhibitory neurotransmitters from the en-teric nervous system. 7-11 A couple hours after the incident, neutrophils in- vade the muscularis externa of the bowel wall fol-lowed by the invasion of mast cells and macrophages12 to 24 hours postoperatively. 11-14These inflam- matory cells cause the local release of inhibitorysubstances such as nitric oxide and prostaglandinsthat impair intestinal motility. 15,16Interestingly, this happens also in unmanipulated parts of theintestine where activated inflammatory cells invadethe muscular bowel wall. Dendritic cells, T-helpercells, and cytokines are involved in this homing ofinflammatory cells to the intestinal tissue and theexact mechanisms behind this so-called \"eld-effect\"have just recently been described in detail. 17,18 In the later inflammatory phase an interaction between neurogenic and inflammatory mechanismsoccurs, leading to an inflammation-induced activa-tion of vagal afferent the brainstem. 11 Furthermore, the so-called cholinergic anti-inflam-matory pathway has been described, which seems toenable the central nervous system to modulate andameliorate the inflammatory response within thebowel wall using vagal cholinergic efferent bers. 3,19 3. Treatment of POI in Man Besides normal laxatives and enemas a variety oftreatment options were introduced to prevent andtreat POI in man and most of them are at leastsomehow based on our understanding of the patho-physiology of POI as described above. Peridural anaesthesia is used to interrupt the communication between the enteric nervous system,the spinal cord, and the central nervous system toprevent reflex inhibition of gastrointestinal motil-ity. 20,21Laparoscopic surgery minimizes the surgi- cal trauma and reduces POI.20,22Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that restricted perioperativefluid regimens reduced POI. 23Early postoperative feeding is known to be safe and to increase intestinalmotility in the postoperative period probably by va-gal activation. 20,24,25Conflicting exists con- cerning gum-chewing (\"sham feeding\") as a vagalstimulus that reduced the duration of POI only insome studies. 26,27These interventions together with other crucial components of so-called fast-trackor enhanced-recovery protocols that aim to speed uppatient recovery, reduce the length of hospital stay,and subsequently reduce treatment costs withoutincreasing morbidity of the surgical procedure. 28-31 Although several pharmacological therapies are used to treat POI, the evidence for the positive effectof all these drugs is rather low. Neostigmine isfrequently used and has at least shown some effectin one of our studies in patients after colorectalsurgery. 32Some positive effect has also been shown for perioperative lidocaine, a drug that is alsocommonly used to treat POI in horses. 33Periph- eral /H9262-receptor antagonists can reduce POI not only by preventing the motility-impairing effects of opi-oids administered as pain medication, but also bypreventing the same detrimental effects caused byendogenously produced and released opioids. 34 Other drugs with prokinetic properties such as met-oclopramide and erythromycin act mainly on theupper gastrointestinal tract whereas POI in man isa particular problem of the lower intestine. Thisexplains the missing effect of these drugs on POI inman. Other drugs have been used to modulate the in- hibitory response within the bowel wall. Mast cellstabilization in man has little effect on POI 35 whereas inactivation of macrophages in animalsshowed a more pronounced effect 36; however, it must be kept in mind that this interference with aphysiological inflammatory response has the poten-tial to cause other problems (e.g., in wound healing).This is supported by studies exploring the effect ofinhibition of prostaglandin production by blockingcyclooxygenase (COX)-2. This treatment reducedPOI but increased leak rates after intestinal resec-tions in man. 37,38 Vagal stimulation (e.g., by high lipid enteral feed- ing during POI) can ameliorate not only the inflammatory response but also POI by thevagal cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. 39,40 Currently, potential of of the vagus nerve on POI (e.g., by stim-ulating its branches in the area of the ear) are beingexplored. 4. POI in Horses Although only little data exist on pathophysiology ofPOI in horses, the above-mentioned mechanismscontributing to POI in other species can probablyalso be applied to equine POI. A recent study de-termining the effect of different mechanical stimulito the equine intestine demonstrated that the intra-mural inflammatory response as described in ro-dents can also be found in the intestinal wall ofhorses. 41This conrmed the clinical observation of Blikslager et al42made 10 years ago already, whereas POI in man can usually be managed con-servatively with almost no increase in postoperative 178 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE THREE Cs OF GI: CHEWING, COLIC, AND COMPLICATIONSmortality rates, this seems to be different in horses where POI occurs more frequently (approximately18% of horses after celiotomy 43,44) and causes a high rate of repeat celiotomies and an almost 30-fold in-crease in postoperative mortality usually due to sub-sequent euthanasia. 45-47One reason why POI is more common in horses might be the fact that ce-liotomy is usually performed for colic surgery whereparts of the intestine are obstructed or strangulatedcausing a mechanical stimulus that can initiate theintramural inflammatory response and also the\"eld effect\" representing a pan-enteric inflamma-tory response and inhibition of gastrointestinal mo-tility to a localized intestinal trauma that are bothimportant in the pathophysiology of anti-inflammatory to be effective in treatment of POI inhorses although there is some benecial effect inrodents and man. 49 Although several drugs are used to treat POI in horses, the evidence for the effectiveness of thesedrugs is usually low and the data are conflicting, 50a phenomenon that is shared by the data for the treat-ment of POI in man. The positive effects of thecommonly used drugs can be summarized as follows:In a recent study intravenous lidocaine has beenshown to improve POI as well as survivalafter small intestinal colic surgery, 51which conrms the benecial effect of systemic local anesthetics asdescribed by others. 52Although metoclopramide, a peripheral dopamine antagonist ago-nist that increases the acetylcholine concentrationin the neuromuscular junction, has no effect on POIin man, it has been shown that metoclopramide canimprove POI in horses and can even improve sur-vival of POI in this species. 53The same is true for the macrolide antibiotic and motilin receptor agonisterythromycin that has no effect on POI in man, butseems to have at least some benecial effect inhorses. 54Cisapride has been shown to be very ef- fective in the treatment of POI in several humanstudies; however, this drug is not available any-more, at least in Germany, due to its detrimentaladverse effects in terms of cardiac dysrhythmia.Nevertheless, a few studies exist that describe apositive effect of cisapride on POI also in horses. 55 Drugs acting on serotonin (5-HT) receptors such asmosapride and tegaserod have some potential tostimulate intestinal motility, but these drugs haveonly limited or no proven effect on POI. 56Although frequently used to treat POI in man as well as inhorses because of its subjectively perceived effect onintestinal motility, there are very little data to sup-port a real benecial effect of neostigmine on POI inboth species from basic-science and clinical studies. Interestingly, a survey of Diplomates of the Amer- ican College of Veterinary Surgeons on the use ofprokinetic drugs for the treatment of POI showedthat lidocaine is most commonly used followed byerythromycin, metoclopramide, and cisapride al-though the dosage as well as the route of adminis-tration varied signicantly. 57 Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Authors declare that they have adhered to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction This section is intended to provide some guide- lines or recommendations on how to perform aneurologic examination and how to localize theobserved decits. The author strongly believes inlearning functional neuroanatomy because ithelps in understanding and interpreting the nd-ings from the neurologic examination. This isessential for localizing the affected area within thenervous system. All clinicians follow their ownmethod and order when performing a neurologicexamination. The examination will be successfulif it is thorough, follows a consistent order, andavoids overlooking abnormalities. Several au-thors have described how to perform neurologicexaminations in horses; each description variesslightly, and a few references are provided in sub-sequent sections. 1-7A complete neurologic ex- amination is warranted in horses with a suspectedneurologic condition, unusual gait, nonlocalizablelameness, unexplainable weakness and muscle at-rophy, and altered behavior or sleep, among oth-ers. The author also considers it important toinclude a neurologic examination in pre-purchase examinations to determine whether a horse isneurologically normal. It is essential before performing a neurologic ex- amination to obtain relevant information about thehorse such as signalment (breed, gender, age); phys-ical activity or intended use (athlete, companion,breeding, shows); a complete medical history thatincludes previous illnesses and/or any illnesses thehorse may have been exposed to while on the farm(and the age and activity of the animals affected);and preventive medicine (vaccinations, dewormingprograms, oral/dental and hoof care). It is impor-tant to know how many animals are affected, howold they are, and what their diet, water source, andhousing (e.g., stall, pasture, dry lot) consist of.Nutrition/toxic, infectious, and genetic disorders (inbreeding farms) must be considered as possiblecauses of disease if several animals are affected inclose proximity. Duration of disease (acute vs. chronic), progression of disease (nonprogressive vs.progressive), fever (especially important because ofthe potential risk of an infectious contagious dis-ease), and the presence or absence of apparent pain AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 181IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: NEUROLOGY that will aid the investi- gation of possible causes of neurologic disease.A full physical examination followed by a thoroughneurologic examination is essential because sys-temic illnesses can influence the neurologic status ofthe horse, particularly the status of neonatal foals.Furthermore, metabolic, nutritional, and/or toxicdisorders might present with neurologic manifesta-tions. Weakness is a sign that could present withsystemic illness and neurologic disease. Therefore,it is important to determine the overall health sta-tus of the horse before beginning the examination. 2. Key Points of the Neurologic Examination Key points of the neurologic examination are asfollows: 1. Safety rst.2. Observation is essential.3. Know what is normal.4. Tailor the exam to the individual horse (safety, domestication, lack of cooperation). 5. Perform more than one exam. It is necessary to emphasize the importance of safety. Because of a horse's size, level of domesti- cation, and neurologic status, not all components ofthe neurologic examination will be feasible (e.g., fullgait evaluation in a severely affected horse or per-forming a close examination in wild horses). How-ever, one essential component in performing aneurologic evaluation is observation. Examinerscan learn so much about the neurologic status of anyanimal just by carefully observing it. Knowingwhat is normal is paramount, particularly when itcomes to different gaits of various breeds. Tailorthe exam to the individual horse. For example, if ahorse is at risk of falling as a result of severe decits,it is not necessary to evaluate its gait on a hill orcurb; for safety reasons the examination for thatparticular horse is as complete as it can be. Fi-nally, performing more than one neurologic exami-nation is important and helpful. The examinermight observe decits that have gone unnoticed(mild decits), or, in the case of progressive dis-ease, the neurologic condition might change.This last point is important because neuroanat-omical localization depends on a thorough neuro-logic evaluation. A Cautionary Note About Rabies Even if the local prevalence of rabies is low or youhave not seen it in your area, if the horse developsacute progressive neurologic signs you should con-sider it as a possibility. The presence of wildlife,lack of vaccination in endemic areas, and increasedtrafc of animals across geographical areas (fromendemic areas) can pose a risk. Protect yourselfand others, minimize the number of personnel han-dling the horse, and wear protective clothing (do nottouch without gloves). In endemic areas with ahorse for which routine vaccination practices areminimal or nonexistent, wear gloves, protectiveclothing, and face shields when dealing with horseswith acute neurologic disease. Rabies often pres-ents initially with signs that are not perceived asbeing neurologic, such as lameness, fever, and colic;however, if undiagnosed, more obvious neurologicsigns will quickly begin to show. Goals The rst goal of the neurologic examination is to de-termine whether a neurologic abnormality is present.The second goal is to determine the neuroanatomicallocalization, which refers to the affected area withinthe components of the nervous system. Rememberthat the nervous system consists of central and periph-eral parts. The central components include the brainand spinal cord. The peripheral parts include thenerve roots and ganglia, nerves, and neuromuscularjunction. The neuromuscular system consists of cen-tral and peripheral components. All nerves are pe-ripheral (cranial nerves, spinal nerves). The caudaequina is formed by sacral and caudal nerve roots andnerves. Do not forget the autonomic nervous system, which includes the sympathetic, parasympathetic, andintrinsic/enteric plexuses. Functional neuroanatomiesfor neuroanatomical localizations are discussed later. 3. How to Perform a Neurologic Examination This section is merely a guideline and does not rep-resent the only way to perform a neurologic exami-nation. The rst thing to note is that minimalequipment is needed. Remember that the most im-portant equipment is your senses (i.e., sight [obser-vation], touch [palpation], and hearing). Usefultools include a strong light source (transilluminator,ophthalmoscope, or pen light) and hemostats or apen to assess pain sensation and to induce segmen-tal (spinal) reflexes. Additional tools could includea sound source such as car keys or a ringing object(bell) to evaluate for hearing decits. Examinationunder saddle is not recommended because of safetyconcerns. However, complicated cases or gait de-cits only observed under saddle might require arider, but the horse must be evaluated in hand be-fore being ridden to determine whether it is safe.An example of a neurologic examination form theauthor has used is provided in the Appendix. The examination consists of evaluating the neuro- logic status while the horse is at rest (static) and dur-ing movement (dynamic). Some authors divide theexamination in 4 broad categories: (1) evaluation ofmental status and behavior; (2) cranial nerveexamination; (3) standing exam of posture, segmentalreflexes, postural reactions, and muscle; (4) examina-tion of gait and posture during movement. 5The au- thor divides the examination in the following manner: 1. Behavior and mentation2. Cranial nerves3. Posture (head, neck, trunk, limbs, 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: NEUROLOGY4. Palpation7. Gait evaluation8. Nociception (pain perception) Behavior and Mentation Try to observe the horse in its own environment andnote its behavior and how it interacts with others(humans and animals). In referral institutions, allowthe horse to get some habituation (sometimes not pos-sible) to the surroundings and observe it in connedand open areas. Keep an open mind but listen towhat the owner has to say about the behavior of thehorse. Usually, subtle changes in behavior are rstnoted by the owner. Note that behavior alterationsmight not always be caused by a neurologic disease(i.e., pain, learned behavior). Behavior is importanteven if the horse is apparently bright and alert. Forexample, sudden aggression, fear, or docile behavior inhorses that usually have the opposite behavior shouldraise a concern. Horses with encephalopathies (braindisease) can manifest compulsive behavior such ascompulsive walking, yawning, biting, circling, headpressing, and appearing sleepy or blind. The 4 states of consciousness (mental status) are as follows: 1. Normal: Bright, alert, responsive.2. Obtunded: Quiet because of a neurologic dis- ease\u2014not a systemic one (this would be lethar-gic). Do not use the word \"depressed\" becausethis is a neurologic disorder in humans. Inthis state, the horse remains responsive tostimuli (visual, tactile, aural) and reacts to theenvironment. There could be degrees of ob-tundation such as mild, moderate, or severe onwhich the stimuli might have to be stronger fora response. These degrees of obtundation aresubjective. In mild cases, the horse might notrespond to someone walking in the stall butmight react to a loud sound. 3. Stuporous: Severely altered mental status; un- responsive to minimal-to-moderate stim-uli. Profound painful stimuli (pinching the skinor foot with hemostats) generates a response ofthe animal (\"waking up\"), but the response dissi-pates (goes back to stuporous) as soon as thestimuli stop. Horse appears as if dead. 4. Comatose: The horse is unresponsive to any kind of stimuli, including profound painfulstimuli. Do not confuse response and reaction with reflexivemovement when applying a painful stimulus. Al-terations in behavior and/or state of consciousnessindicate intracranial disease (forebrain, brainstem). Cranial Nerves Responses, reactions, and reflexes can be evaluatedin the standing horse at rest or in the recumbenthorse. Cranial nerves can be evaluated in orderfrom CN I to XII to avoid forgetting one or more orcould be evaluated to include all functional regions.The author prefers functional regions, starting withsense of smell (subjective); all eye functions dazzle reflex, pupillary light reflex, adaptationto light and darkness, globe position and retrac-tion, physiologic nystagmus, tear production); jaw/facial motor, eating/drinking (prehension, suction, tongue tone andmovement, gag reflex). Do not change your methodof evaluation, and always be consistent to avoidoverlooking abnormalities. The examination spe-cically covers the following: Olfaction (smell): CN I, subjective evaluationand interpretation. Horses infood might have normal olfaction. Menace response: forinner pinnae). Pupillary light and indirect):CN II and III. Corneal reflex: CN V, VI, and VII. Eye globe position: CN III, IV, and VI (VIIIalso contributes; rule out extraocular muscledisease or elevation, horses havemild ventral strabismus that is considered nor-mal, but if all you see is the sclera that isconsidered abnormal. Eye globe retraction: Gently press the eyeglobe for retraction; do not perform this task ifocular disease (i.e., corneal ulceration) or eyecontamination is a observe movements; move-ments should always be horizontal if head ismoved from side to side and synchronous withthe fast phase toward the direction of the headturn. Pathologic nystagmus, occurring atrest or when the head is held in a certainposition, is an indication of vestibular disease(central or peripheral). Gag reflex: Offer food and observe swallow-ing or palpate the larynx externally, notdi- rectly (orally) like in small animals, to induce agag\u2014this is very subjective and might not re-flect an obvious abnormality where there isone and denitively does not determine degreeor PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 to test olfaction (subjec- tively\u2014could cover eyes to see if the horse would smell), vision (visual perception of food), prehension(CN VII\u2014the horse has particularly mobile lips, es-pecially the upper lip), mastication (CN V), pushingbolus back to the throat (CN contributionsof V), and swallowing (CN IX-XII). Food packingcan also be seen with CN VII dysfunction. Theauthor provides small amounts of food of variouskinds (pellets, cookies, grain, mash, hay) and waterto look for abnormalities or difculty from suction,prehension, masticating, and swallowing that mightbe apparent with one type of food but not with oth-ers. The author has found this very useful for iden-tifying subtle decits. Do not forget to observe cervical musculature (CN XI). Do a fundic exam since the retina and opticnerve are a few of the structures from the nervoussystem that can be visualized. Nerves locatedwithin the guttural pouch can be visualized throughendoscopy. The slap test in the horse to assesspossible laryngeal function is subjective and can beevaluated in conjunction with endoscopy. Sympa-thetic innervation to the eye is also important (thirdeyelid, pupil size, palpebral ssure, eye lashes).Sympathetic denervation in as miosis, ptosis, protrusion of the third eyelidwith eyelashes pointing down, and sweating of thehead ipsilaterally. Posture and Postural Reactions The posture of the head, neck, trunk, tail, and limbsis important. Head tilt, neck turn, whole bodyleaning, trunk turn or scoliosis, lordosis, or kypho-sis, wide- or narrow-based stance, or tail down or upor pulled to the side could be observed with neuro-logic disease. Postural reactions, including propri-oceptive placing and hopping tests, can beperformed in the horse, but examiners must practice caution because of safety concerns. Proprioceptionis the sense of knowing the relative position of aparticular point or region in space (e.g., limbs; Fig.1). Foot placement is evaluated for the thoracicand pelvic limbs. Examiners can place one limb ata time in an unusual or uncomfortable position toassess recovery and how quickly the horse returnsthe limb to a normal position. This can be achievedby either placing one limb far apart from the other orby crossing one limb in front of the other and observ-ing when and how the horse replaces the limb.The author does this when proprioceptive decitsare not obvious and prefers simply to observe thehorse throughout the exam for foot placement.A repeated series of maneuvers followed by rest forseveral seconds to minutes to note foot placement provides reliable information of proprioception with-out exposing the handler and/or examiner to thepossibility of being crushed if a horse were to col-lapse. This also applies for horses for whose lack ofcooperation makes assessment difcult. Observinghow these horses stand at multiple time points dur-ing the examination gives an idea whether proprio-ception might be abnormal. Note that horses withpainful limbs might stand in an unusual or abnor-mal position to protect the affected limb. Further-more, a compliant or trained horse might hold anabnormal stance and thereby complicate how thelimb placement is interpreted. Horses with a me-chanical lameness can also present with abnormallimb placement that does not result from neurologicdysfunction. In some cases, although not always,these problems may be obvious. Proprioceptivedecits alone are not a localizable neurologic decitto a specic area because these areas can be seen inbrain, spinal cord, and peripheral diseases. Fig. 1. Horses displaying proprioceptive decits. Note the abnormal limb placement. 184 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: NEUROLOGYSegmental Reflexes The evaluation of segmental reflexes is limited in horses but should be tested whenever possible. Seg-mental reflexes that can be readily evaluated includecervicofacial/auricular, cutaneous trunci (panniculus),perianal, and perineal reflexes. Tendon and flexor(withdrawal) reflexes are not usually performed in am-bulatory horses. If the horse is young or recumbent,reflex testing, which includes triceps, biceps, patellar,and gastrocnemius reflexes, can be performed. Ten-don reflexes might be difcult to interpret in recum-bent adult horses, but withdrawal reflexes should beassessed. In general, the larger the horse, the hardertendon reflexes are to test and interpret. Rememberthat the horse must be relaxed and recumbent foradequate assessment. Palpation Palpation of the horse's body, including the head,can reveal abnormalities that are not obvious uponvisual inspection. Check for symmetry, shape,pain, swelling, temperature, sweating, and masses.Palpate muscles, bones, and joints; flex and extendthe joints to assess for pain and mobility. Examinethe horse carefully for any muscle atrophy. Checktail and anal tones. Look for any loss of skin sen-sation (hypalgesia or analgesia), increased sensitiv-ity (hyperesthesia), or abnormal sweating(sympathetic Evaluation The causes lameness or irregular gaits couldstem from an orthopedic, musculoskeletal, or neu-rologic disease. More than one system could beinvolved, which complicates gait evaluation andinterpretation. If safe, a full lameness examshould be performed, including observations atthe walk, trot, and canter, to investigate howother systems involved contribute to the abnormalgait. Horses with pain might alter their gait toprotect a painful limb. Caution must be takenwhen assessing gait because certain breeds ofhorses have been bred for a particular desired gait(e.g., \"floaty\" gait in Warmbloods, hyperflexiongaits in Paso Fino and Peruvian Paso, pacing inStandardbreds). There could be a ne line be-tween what is considered a desired (i.e., normal)and undesired gait when breeding horses for spe-cic gaits. Examiners must be familiar with thegaits of different breeds and be aware of what isconsidered an acceptable gait for a specic breed.For example, a floaty gait in an American QuarterHorse will be considered abnormal. An accept-able (or normal) gait is a topic of discussion anddebate among breeders, owners, trainers, and vet-erinarians. Gait evaluation could be challengingfor the reasons previously outlined but also be-cause horses could present with a concurrent or-thopedic or muscle disease that can make gaitevaluation even more challenging. There will besituations in which full gait evaluation might notbe possible because of safety concerns, horses at risk of falling as a result of the severity of decits,or lack of cooperation. Movement abnormalities include dysmetrias (ab- of movement: hypermetria, with nerves fem-oral, sciatic, peroneal, tibial). Horses can beevaluated at the walk, and canter when safe.Helpful maneuvers include the following: walkand trot in straight line, walk in serpentine (zigzag),walk with head elevated, walk while pulling tail ineach direction, spin in tight circles, walk on unevenground (back and forth over curb or cavaletti, up anddown hill), and walk backward. Using differentsurfaces (soft, hard, uneven, colored) can be veryhelpful to challenge locomotion skills, especially inhorses with subtle decits. If ataxia is noted, try to determine whether it is caused by cerebellar, vestibular, or general proprio-ceptive (GP; commonly known as spinal) disease. To determine the type of ataxia, look at the rest ofthe neurologic status of the horse. Does the horsehave cerebellar (hypermetria, intention tremors,lack of menace response) or vestibular (pathologicnystagmus, head tilt, body lean, circles in the direc-tion of the head tilt) signs? If the answer is yes toone of these questions, then you can answer the rstquestion. Horses with general proprioceptiveataxia can present with toe scufng, dragging of thefeet, delayed protraction, knuckling over, circumduction (\"swinging\" of the limb),or uneven/irregular stride length. Examples of GPataxia include horses of the spinal cord, amongothers. In addition to ataxia with spinal cord disease, paresis and upper motor neuron (UMN) or lowermotor neuron (LMN) decits depending on the loca-tion within the specic spinal cord segments can beseen. With UMN involvement, the gait/stridecould be exaggerated (\"upper\" /H11005hyper, exaggerated, elongated), whereas with LMN, the gait/stride isshort and choppy with weakness that can result in abase-narrow stance and muscle fasciculations if se-vere. In addition, pronounced muscle atrophy canbe observed. Horses with UMN decits can alsohave muscle atrophy, but this will be more gradualover time compared with atrophy from LMN injury.In chronic cases, the presence of muscle atrophyalone cannot help in distinguishing UMN from LMNinjury. See section on the spinal cord for moreinformation. AAEP /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 185IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: NEUROLOGYNociception (Pain Nociception or pain perception (conscious perception of pain /H11005cerebral awareness of pain) must be tested in horses with no voluntary movement or when vol-untary movement is questionable or not observed.When testing for nociception, two things are nor-mally expected: (1) a conscious response to painfulstimuli (e.g., head turn or any other response thatdemonstrates that the horse feels what we are do-ing), and (2) a reflex movement away from the pain-ful stimulus. To clarify, voluntary movement doesnot equal reflexive movement. Both are different,and each tests different things and nal pathways.This means that if you see movement of a limb beingtested in a recumbent horse, this might not neces-sarily be voluntary\u2014it may be a reflex. Neonatal Foals It is paramount to become familiar with what con-stitutes normal neurologic status according to age,especially during the evolving neonatal period.A comprehensive clinical history for both mare andfoal and periparturient events must be obtained inthe case of neonatal foals. A full physical examina-tion is essential for determining the overall healthstatus of the foal. It is important to determinewhether systemic disease is present and whetherthere is any cause or effect, association, or contribu-tion to the neurologic status. Common neonataldisorders manifest with similar clinical signs suchas weakness, reduced muscle tone, recumbency,reduced or absent suckle reflex, and dysphagia.Therefore, a meticulous clinical evaluation of thehorse and diagnostic workup to rule out commonneonatal disorders are crucial for directing propertherapy in addition to supportive care. There areimportant functional differences in the neurologicexamination of foals, especially in neonatal foals asthey mature, and adult horses. Therefore, recog-nizing what is normal according to age is essential.Alertness, responsiveness to the environment, andmovement are different in utero, during birth, andin extra-uterine life. Foals respond and move inutero but not to the extent of extra-uterine life.In the birth canal, foals appear to be in a drowsystate and become minimally responsive; movementis also depressed. During the rst few hours ofextra-uterine life, neonates must hit key milestonesthat will result in successful functioning and sur-vival. Furthermore, evolutionary differences be-tween prey and predators have resulted indifferences in neurologic function. For example,the menace response (a learned response) developsearlier in prey (e.g., 7-10 days in horses and cattle)compared with predators (several weeks). Preysuch as horses and cattle are born with more devel-oped brains than predators' brains. Prey havefunctional vision and hearing and can stand andnurse in a relatively short time after birth comparedwith predators. Although brain development con-tinues after birth, the cerebellar layers in prey arealready distinct histologically at birth, whereas cer-ebellar layers are not completely differentiated atbirth in predators. Cerebellar development andmyelination in various parts of the nervous systemmight explain the \"bouncy\" gait in neonatal foals. Appropriate neurologic function is not the only important component for successful effector func-tions such as suckling, swallowing, locomotion, andautonomic functions, among many others. All theanatomical and functional components must be in-tact (e.g., musculoskeletal, visceral). Failure of anyof these components will result in dysfunction.The next section briefly reviews key points of theneurologic examination in neonatal foals. As men-tioned for adult horses, the autonomic nervous sys-tem (parasympathetic, sympathetic, and intrinsic/enteric) is also part of the nervous system. Neurologic Examination in Neonatal Foals Here again, observation is paramount. The neuro-logic status of the normal neonatal foal goes througha transition from in utero to ex utero life. TheAPGAR (appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respi-ration) score developed for the assessment of neo-nates in the postfoaling period (one minutepostfoaling) consists of the following variables: 1. Heart rate (normal: regular, 60 beats per minute; abnormal: undetectable, irregular, or/H1102160 beats per minute) 60 breaths per minute; abnormal: (normal: pink)4. Muscle tone (normal: strong enough to able to be in sternal recumbency) 5. Responsiveness: nasal stimulation head shake); back scratch(expected response: attempts to stand) This evaluation can be repeated at 5 and 15 minutespostfoaling to determine whether veterinary inter-vention is needed. Important milestones includetime to sternal recumbency within 1 to 2 minutes,alert and responsive to external (tactile, visual, au-ditory) stimuli within 5 minutes, suckle reflex pres-ent within the rst 20 minutes, vocalizing inresponse to the dam's nickering within 30 minutes,time to stand within 60 minutes (longer than 2hours is considered abnormal), and time to nursewithin 2 hours (more than 3 hours is abnormal) afterbirth. The author performs a neurologic evaluationconcurrently with the physical examination in neo-natal foals. Similarly, multiple assessments of theneurologic status are done per physical examina-tions. The neurologic examination must cover allareas cited for adult horses. The determination of mentation, behavior, and posture can be done as the history is being taken oras the foal is being examined. States of conscious- 186 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: obtunded, stuporous, and comatose. Behavior includes brightalert and responsive to the environment, mare at-tachment, udder seeking, nursing, curious of theenvironment, and sleep. Head posture in neonatalfoals has a \"flexed\" appearance at the atlanto-occip-ital joint compared with adults, and their stance iswide-based and becomes narrower within days afterbirth. Cranial nerve decits might be apparentduring the initial observation before approachingthe horse. Palpation is essential for detecting ar-eas of apparent pain, local temperature, muscle toneand symmetry, joint extension and flexion, and tailtone, among others. Tactile stimuli result in briskexaggerated responses and reactions in normal foalscompared with older animals. Segmental reflexesthat can may or may not bepresent in the neonatal period. If present, it is notconsidered abnormal and will not be apparentwithin a few days after birth. An extensor thrustreflex can also be seen in normal neonatal foals.Neonatal foals have a hypermetric gait that becomesmore coordinated within 3 days after birth. Effectsof systemic disease, orthopedic disease, congenitalanomalies, motor decits (from initiation of move-ment by the forebrain all the way to the nerves,neuromuscular junction, and muscle as the execut-ers), and weakness can result in recumbency. Cu-taneous sensation can be evaluated to investigatethe presence or absence of sensory function. Noci-ception (conscious perception of pain) is only evalu-ated if voluntary motor function is absent or difcultto interpret. For the purposes of this article, dis-eases of neonatal foals will not be discussed, butconsider congenital/hereditary disorders and othercommon neonatal diseases that affect the overallneurologic condition in foals. Neuroanatomical Localization There are several ways of classifying the nervoussystem. This section will divide the nervous sys-tem into its functional areas to ease the interpreta-tion of neurologic ndings and to localize the lesion.The functional areas and their subdivisions areshown in Fig. 2. When localization to a specic or single area is not possible, consider diffuse or multifocal localization.Neuroanatomical localization along with the signal-ment and medical history (including information ofduration, progression, fever, and apparent pain) ofthe horse will aid in the formulation of a list of pos-sible causes of the disease. Based on this list ofpossible causes, a targeted diagnostic plan can bemade. Without an appropriate neuroanatomicaldiagnosis, it is pointless to start thinking about di-agnostic tests or treatments. As previously men-tioned, do not forget the autonomic nervous system(parasympathetic, sympathetic, intrinsic/enteric),which is also part of the nervous system. Next, themost common signs of each of the functional areaswill be mentioned. As a reminder, proprioceptivedecits alone are not a localizing sign because thesedecits could be seen in brain (all major functionaldivisions), spinal cord, and peripheral diseases. Brain The brain has three primary divisions: prosencepha- lon (forebrain), cerebrum, basal nuclei, limbic sys-tem, and thalamus. One or more signs might be ob-served, such as behavior alterations (compulsive,bizarre, manic); lack of initiation of movement; ignor-ing one side of the head and body (contralateral); cen-tral blindness; wide the but behaves func-tionally more like the forebrain. The thalamus is animportant relay center. Examples of trauma, neoplasia (rare), and hereditaryepilepsies (Egyptian Arabian foals), among others. The brainstem has components in the forebrain (thalamus), midbrain, and hindbrain (pons and me-dulla). Signs that might be observed include analtered state of consciousness or mental status (ob-tunded, stuporous, comatose), sleep, andmultiple cranial nerve decits. Ataxia with tracts within thebrainstem. Proprioceptive decits are ipsilateralin brainstem disease (except for thalamus as part of the cere- brothalamic area). Vestibular (central) dysfunctioncan also be observed with brainstem disease becausethe vestibular nuclei and part of the vestibular tractsare within the brainstem. Examples of diseases in- Fig. 2. Neuroanatomical localization based on major functionalareas: brain, spinal cord, and AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 187IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: NEUROLOGYclude EPM, West Nile virus and other of viral encephalitis, trauma, and neoplasia (e.g., melanoma ingrey horses), among others. The hallmark signs of disease in the cerebellum include intention tremors (tremors upon intendedmovement), hypermetria of all limbs (but particularlyin thoracic limbs), ataxia, and plus/minus menace def-icits. Furthermore, horses might rear up when beingwalked backward as a result of exaggerated and un-coordinated movement of the thoracic limbs. Exam-ples of diseases include cerebellar abiotrophy inArabian horses and cerebellar general proprioceptive paresis, and UMN or LMN decits depending on thelocation within specic spinal cord segments will beobserved. With the involvement of LMN, weaknesswill also be observed. Lesions localized in the fol-lowing spinal cord segments (not vertebral bodies)will present thusly: C1-C5/6: UMN decits (normal to exaggerated) of thoracic and pelvic limbs (sometimes also tail) C6-T2: LMN signs of thoracic limbs; UMN of pelvic limbs T3-L3: Normal thoracic of pelvic limbs L4-S2: Normal thoracic limbs; of pelvic limbs segments) S-caudal: Normal thoracic limbs; normal or of pelvic limbs depending on location be-cause the sciatic nerve originates from cranialsacral segments; cauda equina signs (e.g., uri-nary/rectal incontinence) UMN decits of the tail can be observed with lesions cranial to the sacral segments. A gradingsystem for neurologic gait decits and ataxia wasdeveloped by Dr. Mayhew and is currently themethod used by most clinicians. 2The author fol- lows his grading system but have modied it to help teach students and residents and to minimize dis-agreement among examiners. Even then, the grad-ing is still subjective and prone to individualinterpretation. The decits visible only under spe- cial circumstances and not always consistent. Grade 2: Mild decits but visible at all gaits and tests, including walking in a straight line. Grade 3: Moderate decits visible to any un- trained eye and from a distance. Anyone cantell that something is wrong with the way thehorse walks. Grade 4: Severe decits with risk of falling eas- ily even if just standing. Do not get close. Grade 5: Recumbent and unable to stand. Examples of diseases that affect the spinal cordinclude neoplasia, and vas-cular anomaly, among others. Polyneuritis equiis an example of a disease that affects the caudaequina. Neuromuscular System As mentioned earlier, the neuromuscular system has central (lower motor neurons) and peripheral(nerve roots, ganglia, nerves, neuromuscular junc-tion) components. Neuromuscular disorders can bediffuse or can involve only a single nerve. Diffuse Fig. 3. Functional areas of the brain: cerebrothalamic, brainstem, weight, base-narrowstance, paresis or paralysis, muscle fasciculations,and tendency to become recumbent. Segmental re-flexes can be decreased or absent in neuromusculardisease. The two most common diffuse neuromus-cular diseases of horses are equine motor neurondisease and botulism. Focal LMN disease or neu-ropathy lead to specic signs that pertain to theaffected region, such as specic gait decits andfocal muscle atrophy.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author declares that she has adhered to the Prin- ciples of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

The author tried toselect a few syndromes that seem to commonly cre-ate confusion among veterinarians as they go aboutthis process. Hopefully, working once againthrough selected clinical syndromes will help rein-force long-ago-learned principles of neurologic ex-amination and neuroanatomic localization. 2. Syndrome 1: Mentation\u2014Level of Consciousness and Behavior Level of consciousness and behavior are two distinct components that should not be confused; veterinar-ians, however, frequently conflate the former, i.e.,how alert an animal is, with the latter, i.e., how appropriately the animal interacts with the animateand inanimate environment. Although there areseveral overlaps between these two modalities of mentation, they are generated at separate sites:consciousness in the brainstem and behavior in thecerebrum (with assistance from the thalamus).Alertness: Consciousness \"originates\" in the retic- ular formation, a loose network of neurons that ex-tend longitudinally deep within the brainstem andcontinuously from the diencephalon to the medullaoblongata (Fig. reticular formation controlsor modulates many basic life-sustaining processessuch as heart rate and vascular tone, breathing andswallowing, maintenance of body tone, balance andposture, habituation to repetitive stimuli, and mod-ulation of pain. Among the more than 100 net-works that make up the reticular formation is theascending reticular activating system (ARAS),which gathers and integrates stimulatory and inhib-itory information from the internal and externalenvironments and converts all of this informationinto waves of signals that are projected rostrally viathalamic connections to the cerebral cortex to keepthe horse awake, i.e., conscious. The sources ofstimulatory input are illustrated in Fig. 1. Most\"alertness\" signals projected to the forebrain fromthe ARAS localization: As described in Dr. Monica Aleman's lecture, during the rst hour of this ses-sion, level of consciousness or alertness is evaluatedon a continuous scale from normal (i.e., bright andalert) to comatose. As shown in Fig. 1, the ARAS ismost active in the midbrain and progressively less soin more rostral and caudal sections. This knowl-edge can be used to predict the effect of a modelinjury at different levels of the brainstem. For ex-ample, a moderate bleed in the midbrain producesthe most profound obtundation (coma for a seriousinjury); the same injury to the rostral medulla mayonly cause lethargy, and there may be no effect onconsciousness if the injury were caudally in themedulla near the foramen magnum. The effect cerebral lesions has on consciousness is often verylittle unless there is a severe multifocal or diffuseinvolvement of the forebrain. In other words, it ispossible for a horse to have a large mass lesion onone side of its cerebrum (e.g., cholesterol granuloma,Streptococcus equi abscess) and be fully alert. More diffuse processes, especially metabolicencephalopathies such as those of hepatoencepha-lopathy or hypo-osmolality, are accompanied bymore profound obtundation, although there is likelyalso an effect on the brainstem. Behavior: Abnormalities of behavior may be termed dementia. Typical abnormal behaviorsthat result from central nervous system (CNS) dis-ease include self-mutilation, seizures, head-press-ing, compulsive walking (often in a circle), yawning,aggression (including unprovoked biting or kicking),timidity, loss of afnity of a foal for its dam, and lossof learned behaviors and skills. The inability orrefusal of a trained horse to follow when being led isa form of dementia that may be obvious during aneurologic examination. Lesion localization: It must be kept in mind that bizarre behavior may be seen in horses without or-ganic CNS disease. For example, such behavior isan appropriate response to an extreme stimulus(e.g., stinging nettle reaction), and stereotypical orotherwise destructive patterns of behavior such asself-mutilation syndrome can be extremely abnor-mal and difcult to differentiate from true CNS dis-ease syndromes. However, for those disturbancesof behavior that are caused by brain disease, theforebrain is almost exclusively the location. Focal,asymmetric lesions usually manifest with asymmet-ric abnormal signs. For example, the horse mayturn its head (usually, but not always, toward theside of the lesion) and walk compulsively in circles,often around the inside of an enclosure. Such le-sions also may cause partial (focal) seizures that atleast initially affect one side of the body. Althoughanatomic mapping of dementia syndromes has notbeen carried out in detail in horses, involvement ofthe various components of the nuclei of the extrapy-ramidal system in the forebrain (and possibly mid-brain) likely explains compulsive, repetitive, orbizarre motor activities such as fluphenazine reac-tion, compulsive circling, orofacial dystoniaof nigropallidal frontal andtemporal cortices are involved with learned behav-ior, and the limbic system is involved with inherentbehavior. 3. Syndrome 2: Menace Decit\u2014Where Is the Neurologic Lesion? Almost all neurologic lesions of the visual pathways can be localized by carefully evaluating menace re-sponses and direct and indirect pupillary light re-flexes (PLRs). Additional information on vision isprovided by obstacle tests. Accurate neuroanat-omic localization then is used to generate likely dif-ferential diagnoses and diagnostic plans. Thebasics of this approach are summarized in Table 1and Fig. 2, which together illustrate the effects of 6model lesions on left pupil size in ambient light;menace responses, vision, and direct PLRs, all per-formed on the left eye; and indirect PLRs performedon both eyes. Fig. 1. Control of level of alertness. The principal source of positive activating signals is shown as incoming green arrows. Inhumans and dogs, these have been shown to pass through hypothalamic, hypocretin-secreting nuclei before arriving at the ascendingreticular activating system (ARAS). The color gradient in the ARAS illustrates the relative activity of its different parts. 192 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: NEUROLOGYThe menace response can be interrupted any- where in its afferent (visual) pathway from the eye via the optic nerve to the contralateral optic tract,lateral geniculate nucleus, and optic radiation visual centers inthe occipital lobe of the cortex, the menace re-sponse pathway continues via the contralateralmotor cortex and then projects to the facial nu-cleus in the ipsilateral (i.e., same side) medullaoblongata (Fig. 2B). 1\u2014contralateral forebrain: At least 80% of nerve bers cross at the optic chiasm in horses;thus, for routine clinical purposes in horses, visionin one eye is assumed to be perceived completely bythe opposite visual cortex. If the menace responseis defective in the left eye but there is no sign ofcerebellar involvement and palpebral reflex (a test ofability to blink) and PLRs (II) are intact, then thecausative lesion is contralateral and most likely lo- cated in the forebrain. Look for other signs ofasymmetric forebrain disease such as compulsive walking in circles, other abnormal behavior, headand neck turn, obtundation, seizures, or reducedperception of touch to the side of the face oppositethe lesion (i.e., the same side as the defective men- ace). Subtle proprioceptive decits may also be ap-preciated on the side opposite the lesion. Clinical examples: (1) large cholesterol granu- loma in the right lateral ventricle in an agedmixed-breed mare and (2) a suckling foal kickedin the frontal/parietal area by a mare that is notits dam.

For example, in normal neo-nates up to 2 weeks of age and in Arabian foals withcerebellar abiotrophy, there is no menace response,but the horse can see. In these settings, vigorousthreatening gestures toward the eye may cause re-traction of the eyeball and evasive movements of thehead but not blinking. Head-bobbing, limb hy-permetria, and ataxia are expected in horses withabnormal menace responses that result from cer-ebellar dysfunction. Clinical examples: (1) melanoma in caudal fossa of skull that puts on gingivalis cross en masse at the chi-asm, transection of the right optic tract causesblindness and menace decit in the left eye. How-ever, enough \"light\" bers project ipsilaterally to themidbrain to sustain a normal PLR, and becausemany of these bers cross to the other side in themidbrain, both direct and indirect reflexes remainintact. Clinical examples: Pressure from (1) expanding local tumor (pituitary meningioma)and S. equi (strangles) cerebral abscess. Lesion 4\u2014ipsilateral optic nerve: With injury to the left optic nerve, sensory input to all reflexes fromthat eye are lost, so the horse has defects in directPLRs, menace and vision in the left eye, and indirectPLRs to the right eye. In contrast, motor innerva-tion of the pupil is intact, so pupil size (responding toambient light in the right eye) and indirect PLRs tothe left eye are present. Clinical examples: (1) a yearling colt that has flipped over backward while being handled,striking the poll, causing the cerebrum to\"bounce\" and tearing its connection to the leftoptic nerve; (2) a small ethmoid hematoma thatgrows backward in a Mammoth Mule molly andcompresses the optic nerve against the sphenoi-dal bone. Lesion 5\u2014ipsilateral oculomotor nerve: Motor function to the sphincter of the right pupil is lost, soleft PLRs (direct and indirect from the right eye) areabsent, and the pupil is dilated and xed; all otherfunctions are normal. Clinical examples: (1) peripheral: horse is kicked in the skull and fractures skull throughthe sphenoidal bone; the pupil is dilated andxed, eyelid is drooped; (2) central: aftertrauma to the left side of the skull, a portionof the left nerve: Inability to blink affects only the menace on the same side and isdetected independently by performing the left pal-pebral reflex. Clinical examples: (1) distal: horse cast in a stall overnight while wearing a halter and afterthrashing in lateral recumbency injures the fa-cial nerve behind the vertical ramus of the man-dible; (2) proximal: great petrosal branch ofthe facial nerve damaged within the petroustemporal bone when that bone is fracturedwhen temporohyoid osteoarthropathy is precip-itated by placing a stomach tube in a horse witha fused temporohyoid joint. 4. Syndrome 3: Exposure Keratitis Versus Dry Eye\u2014 Different Levels of Facial Nerve Paralysis With VeryDifferent Consequences for the Cornea Maintenance of a tear lm over the corneal surface is essential for normal corneal function and viabilityand requires both production of tear components(i.e., water, lipids, mucus) and their distributionacross the corneal surface. Functions controlled bymotor components of the facial nerve (VII) are in-volved in both phases: (1) a parasympatheticbranch (great petrosal nerve) of VII exits the facialcanal within the petrous temporal bone and inner-vates the water-producing lacrimal and nictitansglands, and (2) after the nerve emerges fromthe stylomastoid foramen of the petrous temporalbone, it gives rise to the auriculopalpebral nervecaudal to the vertical ramus of the mandible; palpe-bral branches of this nerve innervate the striatedmuscle that provides the blinking action\u2014the orbic-ularis oculi. Blinking in turn serves to distributethe tear lm and to squeeze out lipids from meibo-mian glands along the rim of the eyelids. Thus,injury of the facial nerve distal to the great petrosalnerve branch and proximal to the auriculopalpebralnerve causes eyelid paralysis and exposure keratitiswhile more proximal injury additionally causes dryeye (also known as sicca) keratitis (somatic motor VII denervation): In bright and otherwise healthy horses, eyelid pa-ralysis frequently has no clinical effect. Presum-ably, in response to the irritation of incipientdesiccation of the cornea in affected horses, there isfrequent reflex retraction of the eyeball (Figs. 3 and4). This is part of the corneal reflex that may beelicited during the neurologic examination and re-quires the trigeminal nerve (V) for its afferent com-ponent and abducent nerve (VI) for the /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: NEUROLOGYmotor Retraction of the globe pushes the third eyelid laterally across the entire cornea, anaction that likely provides adequate tear lm distri-bution. In obtunded animals, these protective re-flexes are much less active, and a topical ophthalmiclubricant should be applied several times daily toprovide additional lubrication and protection.Dry eye (parasympathetic motor VII denervation):This is a medical emergency. Without preventivetreatment, a deep horizontal corneal ulcer will formwithin 24 hours after cranial nerve VII denervation,and the eye will be irretrievably damaged withinseveral days. Before the cornea is injured, tear lmevaporation should be minimized by securing a par-tial third eyelid flap or split-thickness tarsorrhaphythat allows frequent Reinner-vation of the lacrimal gland by axonal sproutingfrom the uninjured segment of parasympatheticnerve is possible within a 6-month window after thetime of injury. If natural tearing does not return,parotid salivary duct transposition could be consid-ered, or the globe may need to be surgically removed. 5. Syndrome 4: Head Tilt and Circling\u2014Differentiating Vestibular, Forebrain, and Musculoskeletal Causes Combinations of a head tilt (i.e., rotation of the long axis of the head and not to be confused with a headturn caused by lateral bending of the neck) andrepetitive walking in circles, usually in one direc-tion, are often seen in horses suspected of havingneck injuries and/or brain dysfunction. The expla-nation for these signs usually can be determined bysuccessfully answering the three questions thatfollow.Is the head tilt of vestibular or musculoskeletal ori-gin? If it is possible to straighten out the head of a horse with rotational torticollis (i.e., rotation of thehead originating in the neck), the eyeballs are foundto sit correctly within the palpebral ssures, asshown in Fig. 5A. In contrast, the head of a horsewith vestibular dysfunction, when forced into anupright position with the chin elevated, reveals ves-tibular strabismus; i.e., the eye on the side towardwhich the head was tilted is now rotated down (i.e.,infraducted), and the other eye is in a normal posi-tion or rotated upward (i.e., supraducted; Fig. 5C).If the head of this horse is allowed to rotate back toits tilted position, the eyes will be in normal posi-tions relative to the long axis of the skull (Fig. 5B).Is the circling of vestibular or forebrain origin?A true head tilt is a consistent sign of asymmetricvestibular disease but is not a feature of forebraindysfunction; thus, a horse that circles and tilts itshead in the same direction shows asymmetric ves-tibular signs, whereas a horse that circles with itshead upright likely has asymmetric forebrain dis-ease.

Are the vestibular signs caused by a CNS or a pe-ripheral lesion? Spontaneous and positional nys-tagmus are always pathologic and indicative of alesion in the vestibular system. Peripheral vestib-ular lesions typically cause horizontal or rotatorynystagmus, although vertical nystagmus also is pos-sible. With central lesions, nystagmus is less likelybut may be in any direction when it occurs. In thecase of a peripheral or pontomedullary vestibularlesion, the fast phase should be away from the sideof the lesion. (This is shown in Fig. 5, which dem-onstrates vestibular strabismus with infraduction ofthe left eye and a head tilt to the left, consistent witha left-sided peripheral vestibular lesion. Such ahorse may have horizontal nystagmus with the fastphase away from the side of the lesion, which isindicated by the green arrows.) By contrast, inhorses in which the inhibitory vestibular compo-nents of the cerebellum are involved, the fast phaseistoward the lesion. This is known as paradoxical central vestibular syndrome. With central but notperipheral lesions, the direction of nystagmus mayvary with changing head position. Signs caused bycentral lesions are not likely to show signicantclinical improvement with visual compensation, asmay occur 2 or 3 weeks after peripheral vestibularlesions. If vestibular signs are accompanied byCNS-specic signs such as obtundation, limb weak-ness, nonvestibular ataxia, or dysfunction of cranialnerves other than the facial nerve, a central lesionshould be suspected.

Introduction Antemortem diagnosis of neurologic disease re- mains a frustrating challenge for practitioners, par-ticularly in eld settings. Even in hospital orreferral settings, denitive diagnosis frequently re-quires postmortem examination. However, clini-cians can improve accuracy of diagnosis by applyinga methodical approach to horses with potential neu-rologic disease. This approach begins with a thor-ough clinical neurologic examination to assesswhether the horse is truly showing signs of nervoussystem disease and the neuroanatomic localization(if appropriate). Based on this neurolocalization,the clinician can formulate an appropriate list ofpotential causative diseases. Season, geographicallocation, vaccination history, management/farm his-tory, and individual horse history can all influencethis list of differential diagnoses. After establishing a list of likely diseases, ancil- lary testing is usually indicated. Neurodiagnosticsfor living horses can be grouped into imaging studies(radiography, computed tomography, magnetic res-onance imaging, etc.), de-scribe available laboratory tests, specically thosefor infectious neurologic diseases given that they areoften most accessible to the equine practitioner. Although laboratory tests for infectious diseases are relatively easy to perform, interpretation of re-sults can be difcult. For example, the protozoalorganisms that cause equine protozoal myeloen-cephalitis (EPM) and the bacteria that cause Lymeneuroborreliosis (LNB) are endemic in many areas of the country. In these areas, equine exposurerates can be very high, with up to 80 to 90% of horsesbecoming serologically positive during their life-times. The vast majority of exposed horses neverdevelop clinical signs of disease. However, somehorses will develop central nervous system (CNS)infection with accompanying neurologic signs. Dif-ferentiating these horses from those that have beenexposed but whose clinical signs can be attributed toa different disease is a perpetual challenge. Theseproceedings focus on EPM and Lyme testing, re-viewing recommended diagnostic 197IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: NEUROLOGY NOTESratory testing, while also providing a brief review of tests for other infectious neurologic diseases. General Approach The majority of neurologic horses can be divided intothose with brain disease, spinal cord disease, ormultifocal CNS disease (neuropathies and neuro-muscular disease will not be discussed here). Brain disease: Adult horses develop brain disease most commonly due to metabolic, in-fectious, and traumatic causes. Recom-mended laboratory testing often includes serum biochemistry, blood ammonia level,CSF analysis (if available), and specic infec-tious disease testing (Table 1). Spinal cord disease: Adult horses developspinal cord disease most commonly due to ver-tebral problems (developmental, degenerative,or traumatic) and infectious causes, al-though degenerative myelopathies also oc-cur. Recommended laboratory testing oftenincludes CSF analysis (if available), vitaminE level, and specic infectious disease test-ing (Table 1). Multifocal disease: Adult mostcommonly develop multifocal disease due toinfectious causes. Recommended laboratorytesting often includes CSF analysis (if avail-able) and specic infectious disease testing(Table 1). Specic Diseases EPM EPM is most commonly caused by the protozoan parasite Sarcocystis neurona, although infection with other protozoa such as Neospora hughesi has also been reported.1Horses are infected by S. neu- rona when they consume food or water contami- nated with opossum feces containing sporocysts.The life cycle of N. hughesi is not well elucidated but vertical transmission likely plays a role. 2When these protozoa invade the central nervous system,they can affect any part, causing highly variableclinical signs that might manifest insidiously or sud-denly and subsequently progress slowly or rapidly.General proprioceptive ataxia is one of the mostcommon clinical signs of disease, and is often asym-metric, with a mixture of upper and lower motorneuron paresis. Muscle atrophy (again, oftenasymmetric) is also common. Antemortem diagnosis of EPM or PCR. Depending ongeographic location, a high percentage of horses canbe exposed to and infected by S. neurona, although only a small percentage of horses (estimated at /H110211% of exposed horses) develop clinical signs of neuro-logic disease. Factors that govern whether anyparticular horse is able to eliminate the infectionwithout developing clinical signs are unknown.Therefore, performing serology, regardless of test cho-sen, will only reveal whether the horse has been ex-posed to S. neurona orN. hughesi and does not indicate the current disease status of the CNS. Toachieve the best possible presumptive diagnosis in thelive horse, three criteria must be met: presence ofneurologic disease, exclusion of other likely causes,and conrmation of S. neurona- (or N. hughesi-) spe- cic antibodies in the CSF, serum, or both. 3 All of the commonly used diagnostic tests for EPM assess whether the horse has antibodies against theprotozoa in serum, CSF, or both. The differencesamong the tests include their methodologies (West-ern blot [WB], indirect fluorescent antibody test[IFAT], or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay[ELISA]) as well as which antibodies are recognized.A summary of commercially available testing op-tions for antibodies against S. neurona and reported test performance is shown in Table 2. 4-17There are two testing options for antibodies against N. hughesi: an IFAT at University of California atDavis and an ELISA at Equine Diagnostic Solu-tions. 18-19Neither has been fully evaluated using clinical EPM cases. General principles for interpretation of EPM test results are as follows: A positive serum test indicates exposure to theorganism but does not conrm CNS infection,regardless of the magnitude of the titer. A negative serum test usually indicates thatthe horse has not been exposed to the organ-ism. Exception: rarely, a recently infectedhorse might show clinical signs prior to sero-conversion, in which case repeated testing in10 to 14 days should yield a positive result. A positive CSF test is more likely to correlatewith an EPM diagnosis than a positive serumtest. However, false positives occur due toblood contamination (particularly with WB,less so with IFAT and ELISA) or normal diffu-sion of antibodies from blood to CSF. A negative CSF test usually means EPM is notthe cause of disease. Exception: as men-tioned above, in rare circumstances a recentlyinfected horse will show clinical signs prior todeveloping a measurable antibody level inCSF; retesting 10 to 14 days later should yielda positive result. The best way to diagnose active EPM is tosubmit serum and CSF for quantitative test-ing, which allows detection of intrathecal an-tibody production. 16,20 The author's current approach is to submit paired CSF and blood samples for an S. neurona SAG2, 4/3 ELISA (or Neospora ELISA) serum:CSF titer /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: NEUROLOGYTable 1.

The signicance of B. burgdorferi infection, however, remains unknown. As with EPM, one of themajor problems in diagnosing Lyme disease is thatmany horses seem to be infected with B. burgdorferi and undergo seroconversion without clinical signs ofdisease. Historically, clinical signs attributed to B. burgdorferi infection include chronic weight loss, spo- radic lameness, stiffness, arthritis, joint LNB in horses have beenpublished. 24-26Although certainly less common than many neurologic diseases, including EPM,LNB is regularly diagnosed at the author's practice(New Bolton Center, University of Pennsylvania),frequently with postmortem conrmation. toEPM, LNB can cause a variety of neurologic decits, including changes in mental status (dullness toincreased anxiety and hyperesthesia), gait abnor-malities (generalized stiffness to severe generalproprioceptive decits (reduced lip pa-ralysis, and dysphagia), neck stiffness, muscle at-rophy, and muscle tremors or fasciculations. 27 As with EPM, antemortem diagnosis of LNB is best achieved by fullling several criteria: potential B. burgdorferi exposure (via residence in or travel to an endemic area), presence of neurologic signs, diagnostictesting to rule out other potential diseases, and immu-nologic evidence of infection. 28Although identica- tion of the organism (via culture or PCR) in tissue orCSF samples from the patient provides strong evi-dence for active infection, positive results are uncom-mon even in horses with conrmed LNB, andimmunologic testing remains the mainstay of labora-tory diagnosis. Ideally, this immunologic testing doc-uments intrathecal antibody production, which isachieved by submitting paired serum and CSF sam-ples for quantitative antibody testing. 27CSF cytologi- cal analysis is strongly recommended for horses withsuspected LNB, as results are often abnormal (neutro-philic or lymphocytic pleocytosis with increased totalprotein). 27 Commercially available tests for B. burgdorferi include ELISA, IFAT, WB, tests. The SNAP testcan be performed in-clinic or stall-side, whereas theother tests are performed at reference laboratories.As with available EPM tests, all of these tests detectantibody production by the host\u2014the differences arein test methodology and which specic antibodiesare detected. Although the pattern of antibody pro-duction might help elucidate the chronicity of thehorse's infection, none of these tests will tell youwhether the infection is signicant (e.g., whether it isrelated to the horse's clinical signs or is just a redherring). General principles of interpretation for Lyme test results are similar to those outlined for EPM testing.A positive test usually indicates past or present infec-tion with B. burgdorferi, although vaccination can also cause positive results for some tests. Regardless oftest utilized, clinical Lyme disease cannot be con-rmed\u2014there is no gold standard test. Horses livingin an endemic area are frequently seropositive, so pos-itive results will have a low positive predictive value ofdisease. However, with the exceptions of acutely in-fected or immunocompromised horses, negative results will have a high negative predictive value. None of thetests demonstrate causation of clinical signs or predictwhether disease is likely to develop in the future. Thereis no known correlation between magnitude of titer andlikelihood of disease. It is unclear how well tests thatpredict stage of infection perform with horses that havehad repeated exposures. Several additional caveatsshould be mentioned: Knowledge of vaccination history will often aidin interpretation of results. There are fourcanine vaccines that are occasionally used inhorses. Three a,b,care two-strain bacterins that could induce antibody production againstmultiple antigens, including OspA and OspC(to varying degrees). One dis a recombinant pure nonadjuvanted protein that only includesthe OspA antigen. Although in theory documentation of intrathe-cal antibody production is recommended forthe diagnosis of LNB, in practice it becomesdifcult. Unlike with EPM, there is no estab-lished optimal cutoff for LNB using a serum:CSF antibody ratio. Horses with LNBfrequently have abnormal CSF cytology andhence might have an abnormal blood-brainbarrier, confounding results. Finally, sampledilution can complicate interpretation of re-sults the Multiplex assay tests serum at adilution of 1:400 whereas CSF generally runundiluted or at 1:2, and these dilution factorsare not reported with the results). Finally, the author knows of several horseswith concurrent diagnoses of neuroborrelio-sis and common variable immunodeciency; these horses (due to low B-cell numbers andhypogammaglobulinemia) have unreliable se-rologic results and might test negative for anti-Borrelia antibodies despite CNS infection. Viral Diseases In general, laboratory testing for viral neurologicdiseases is more straightforward than that forEPM and LNB (Table 1). Diseases of most con-cern in the United States include equine herpesvirus 1 myeloencephalopathy, West Nile for horseshave been fluorescent antibodytesting of brain tissue is required. Equine herpesvirus 1 testing has been revolutionized by thedevelopment of PCR tests; submission of nasalswabs and whole-blood samples allows rapid diag-nosis of active infection. Finally, IgM-captureELISAs are available for West Nile virus, EEE,and WEE; these tests are highly sensitive andspecic for active disease due to the kinetics ofantibody production after viral infection. 2. Discussion Although laboratory testing is often an important partof the neurologic evaluation, it cannot be viewed inisolation. Results must be interpreted in light of theclinical neurologic examination as well as in concertwith other test results (including imaging studies, clin-ical pathology, additional infectious disease testing,and even electrodiagnostic testing). The authorhighly discourages running EPM or Lyme tests as arst step in a neurologic workup because the resultsare meaningless without a clinical exam. Even in thecontext of a neurologic case, serologic test results canbe difcult to interpret without an understanding oftest methodology and reported performance. Know-ing which tests to submit and how to interpret theresults will lessen the stress involved in working onneurologic horses and improve antemortem diagnosticaccuracy.

Introduction There are a variety of surgeries that can be per- formed in the eld. Most are performed on rela-tively healthy patients. Some procedures are doneon patients that are awake using sedation and oftena local anesthetic technique. Other procedures re-quire general anesthesia. 2. Materials and Methods Short procedures can be done under /H92512agonist-dis- sociative combinations, which are widely used.In general, the /H92512agonist is administered rst, and then, after the horse is sedated, the dissociativecombination is administered. These combinationsare summarized in Table 1. If longer general anesthesia is going to be used, the most commonly used regimens include somecombination of guaifenesin, ketamine, and an /H92512 agonist. are guaifenesin, 1 which is commonly called\"triple drip.\" To make this drip, 10 mL of ketamineand 5 mL of xylazine are added to1Lo f5 %guaife-nesin. This can be used as a maintenance generalanesthetic after induction with xylazine and ket-amine. Immediately after induction, a small bolusof triple drip is often needed, and then it can beadministered at the maintenance rate of approxi- mately 2.2 mL/kg/h (1 mL/lb/h). If a long anesthe-sia is anticipated (more than 1 hour), the author willdouble the ketamine and slightly decrease the ad-ministration rate. The xylazine can be replacedwith detomidine (0.01 mg/mL 1 mL/L) or romi-dine (0.05 5 mL/L). The use of propofol for equine anesthesia is in- creasing as its cost decreases. It can be used as aninduction such as ketamine. 1,2 The quality of maintenance and recovery are com-parable to recoveries after triple drip. 3. Results and Discussion Combinations of an /H92512agonist and ketamine do not always work as well on donkeys and mules; often asurgical plane of anesthesia is not achieved or is of ashorter duration than that seen in horses. Don-keys have a more rapid clearance of ketamine thanhorses, and mules seem to be less sensitive to ket- amine and often require a higher preanesthetic dosefor adequate sedation. One induction techniquethat works well for is premedication with an /H92512agonist, and then 5% guaifenesin is administered 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY NOTESIV until there is an obvious effect (sagging). At that point a bolus of ketamine is administered IV. If possible, an assistant should monitor the depth of anesthesia and try to maintain the patient at alight plane of anesthesia. Minimal supportive careis usually provided for these patients because theyare healthy and the anesthesia is of short duration.Care should still be taken to correctly position thepatients to minimize the chance for neuropathies.Although intubation is not always indicated, it cansometimes be useful. In particular, nasotrachealintubation assures an airway during oral surgeries.Having the ability to intubate a patient if neededcan be benecial. Intubation and the use of a de-mand valve provides oxygen as well as maintainingan open airway. A standard E tank containsenough oxygen to provide assisted ventilation to anadult horse for 20 to 30 minutes or supplementaloxygen for approximately 1 hour when using a de-mand valve. There are high-flow demand valvesavailable for equine use. Obviously the demandvalve must be compatible with the endotrachealtube being used (Fig. 1). Human resuscitation kitscan be purchased that contain a small oxygen tank,demand valve (lower flow for human use), flowme-ter, and even a gas-operated suction unit.

Introduction There are a variety of surgeries that can be per- formed in the eld. Most of them are performed onrelatively healthy patients. Some procedures aredone on patients that are awake using sedation andoften a local anesthetic technique. 2. Materials and Methods Short standing procedures can often be accom-plished with a single injection of an /H92512agonist and butorphanol and analgesia. If an opioid is used, thelower dose of the /H92512agonist should be adminis- tered initially to prevent excessive sedation. If longer-term sedation is needed, xylazine can be ad-ministered as a constant rate infusion (CRI) at therate of 0.55 mg/kg/h or detomidine at the rate of 6 /H9262g/kg/h. Dexmedetomidine has also been given as a CRI at the rate of 2.5 /H9262g/kg/h after a loading dose of 2.5 /H9262g/kg IV. If an /H92512agonist CRI is used, an opioid such as butorphanol can be given intermit-tently or as a CRI infusion. Butorphanol is admin-istered as a CRI at the rate of 13 /H9262g/kg/ h. Morphine has also been used at a rate of 30 /H9262g/kg/h after a loading dose of 50 /H9262g/kg. Often local or regional anesthesia is used in conjunction with sedation. Although local blocks on the distal limbs are widely used, the authorwould encourage practitioners to also become fa-miliar with regional anesthetic techniques on thehead. Mental and infraorbital nerve blocks areuseful for procedures that involve the incisors androstral head (Fig. 1). Likewise, sensory blocksaround the eye can facilitate standing ophthalmicprocedures. Caudal epidurals are often used in conjunction with sedation for perineal surgeries. This is donein the traditional the sacrococcygeal orrst intercoccygeal intervertebral space. A doseof 4 to 10 mL of local anesthetic is usually recom-mended. The author usually uses the lower end of this dose range and prefers 4 mL of 2% lidocaineor carbocaine with 1 mL of 100 mg/mL xylazineadded. The needle can be inserted perpendicularto the skin surface over the space or at a 30- to45-degree angle, as shown in Fig. 2. Correct nee-dle placement can be conrmed by a loss of resis-tance as the needle enters the epidural space orthe use of the \"hanging drop\" technique. An al- 206 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 alocal inltration of the nerves lateral to the rec-tum. After appropriate skin preparation, a longneedle is inserted lateral to the rectum along ei-ther side to a point cranial to the surgical area. A hand inserted in the rectum can assist needle placement. Local anesthetic is inltrated as theneedle is withdrawn. Local anesthetic (20-40 mL)is used on each side (Fig. 3). Epidural administration of opioids works well to provide analgesia to the hind limbs and perinealregion. Epidural morphine is used most commonlyand typically provides 12 to 18 hours of analgesia;the most commonly used dose is 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg.The addition of 15 to 30 /H9262g/kg detomidine may in- crease the effectiveness and duration of analgesiaprovided by the morphine. If repeated doses are tobe administered, an epidural catheter can be placed,as shown in Fig. 4. The introducer needle is placedin a manner similar to a conventional caudal epidu-ral, and when the tip of the Touhy needle is in theepidural space, the catheter is advanced craniallyapproximately 10 cm. The catheter is then securedto the patient. The author prefers the noncoil-re-inforced catheters because they can be shortened toease maintenance. In localized areas, placement of a perineural cath- eter for continuous or frequent intermittent admin-istration of a local anesthetic can be an excellentmethod of providing analgesia. There are some dif-culties maintaining these catheters long term. Fig. 1. Innervation of the equine head. Fig. 2. Equine caudal epidural needle placement. Fig. 3.

Introduction Castration is one of the most common elective sur- gical procedures performed in the eld. The proce-dure is most often performed to abate unwanted aggressive, masculine behavior in horses not in-tended for breeding. Although the procedure isconsidered routine, various postoperative compli-cations including excessive swelling or recent retrospective study, 10% of equids undergoing routine, elective castration ex-perienced complications related to the procedure. 1 Seventy-six percent of these complications wereclassied as mild and did not require emergencytreatment. 1Although the vast majority of horses that experience complications are successfullytreated on the farm with no long-term adverseeffects, the increased morbidity and cost associ-ated with additional veterinary care for a proce-dure that is perceived as \"routine\" often results inadditional concern of the practitioner and clientdissatisfaction.For any surgical procedure, it is more desirable to minimize the occurrence of postoperative complica- tions rather than to have to deal with the associatedmorbidity, time, and effort in treating them. Athorough understanding of pertinent clinical anatomy,strict attention to asepsis and surgical technique, andproper postoperative exercise recommendations willminimize the incidence of complications associatedwith castration. 3,4However, when complications do arise, the practitioner must be able to quickly recog- nize and correctly and aggressively treat them toassure a rapid and successful outcome. Although acomprehensive discussion of pertinent equine maleanatomy is beyond the scope of this presentation,the principals of proper surgical technique, periop-erative care and recognizing and treating commoncomplications associated with equine castration willbe discussed. 2. Materials and Methods Perioperative Evaluation A complete history should be obtained including a query of any medical conditions that may predispose AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 209HOW-TO cryptorchidism, or previous unsuccessful attemptsof general thoroughphysical examination including palpation of bothtestes and supercial inguinal rings should also beperformed. Absence of one or both descended tes-tes, a history of congenital inguinal hernia, or ab-normal swelling or enlargement of the inguinal ringarea should alert the practitioner to an increasedrisk of postoperative complications at which timethey should strongly consider referral to a surgeryfacility. Horses should be current on tetanus pro-phylaxis, with perioperative antimicrobial therapyand perioperative analgesic therapy at the discre-tion of the practitioner. One retrospective studyperformed in the United Kingdom reported 45% ofpractitioners did not administer perioperative anal-gesics, with 18% occasionally,and 37% administering them routinely. 5The au- thor routinely administers a single preoperativedose of 12 h,for 3-4 d). Surgical Technique and Postoperative Care Castration may be performed in the standing horse,with the addition of incisional and intra-testicularlidocaine administration, or under IV general anes-thesia. The complication rate between these twoapproaches is not signicantly different. 4,6The ap- proach utilized is dependent on practitioner prefer-ence, and the size and disposition of the horse. From the initial scrotal incision to the nal stretching of the surgical incision to allow adequatedrainage, meticulous attention to asepsis and surgi-cal technique will help minimize many of the com-plications that can be associated with routinecastration. When making the scrotal incision bothtestes should be pushed rmly into the scrotum,tensing skin, tunica dartos, and scrotal fasciatightly over the testis (Fig. 1). This will minimizeincorporating multiple tissue planes in the incisionand the chance of excessive subcutaneous tissue orscrotal fascia becoming edematous and protrudingbeyond the skin edges during early healing. Eachscrotal skin incision should be made approximately1 cm from the median raphe, along the most depen-dent aspect of the scrotum, and extend from pole topole of each testis. This will allow easy exterioriza-tion of the testis and minimize the amount of ma-nipulation necessary to separate the scrotal fasciafrom the underlying parietal tunic in preparation ofapplication of the emasculators. In addition, longincisions allow for adequate drainage and preventpremature healing of the skin incisions that canresult in accumulation of contaminated debris andlocalized infection. A variety of emasculators may be used to perform equine castration. The author prefers the Serraemasculators because of their vertically orientedserrated crushing surface that provide excellent he-mostasis and long handles to provide adequate le-verage for emasculating larger-diameter spermaticcords of older stallions. Correct application of theemasculators is essential to provide adequate hemo-stasis. The emasculator is assembled to providecrushing of the proximally whilesimultaneously transecting the cord, distal to thecrush site. Four simple principals of emasculatorapplication: 1) nut-to-nut, 2) applying the emascu-lator perpendicular to the cord, 3) minimal tension,and 4) leaving the emasculators on for 2-3 minuteswill minimize complications associated with postop-erative hemorrhage. Regardless of the type ofemasculator, when correctly assembled, the promi-nent external assembly nut on the crushing appara-tus should be positioned adjacent to the testis to beremoved (nut-to-nut) (Fig. 2). This assures thatcrushing of the cord occurs proximal to the tran-section site. If the emasculators are appliedin the reverse orientation, the crush site would bedistal to the transected cord, and profuse hemor-rhage would ensue. The emasculators should beoriented perpendicular (90\u00b0) to the cord to preventpremature cutting of the testicular artery before it isfully engaged by the crushing apparatus. Minimaltension refers to the tension of the spermatic cordduring emasculation. The emasculators should beplaced, closed just enough to engage and secure thecord, then the emasculator and cord relaxed towardthe inguinal area (proximally), ensuring no skin isincorporated in the emasculation, before fully clos-ing the emasculator. This prevents the elastic tes-ticular artery from recoiling proximally beyond thegrasps of the emasculator during incomplete or slowapplication of the emasculator. Leaving the emas- Fig. 1.

Inolder stallions or donkeys, the author will leave theemasculators in place for 4-5 minutes, or transxthe cord with 2-0 polyglecaprone 25 abefore emas- culation. testicular vessels; 7therefore, the au- thor routinely ligates the cord to the emas-culation site with a single absorbable transxationsuture. Following emasculation, the parietal tunic of the spermatic cord should be grasped with Ochsner for-ceps before releasing the emasculator. Care shouldbe taken not to clamp across the entire width of thecord, because this would preclude being able to iden-tify a bleeder should it be present. The emascula-tor is released, the cord gently replaced into thescrotal incision to relieve any remaining tension onthe cord, and the end of the stump examined. If nobleeding is evident, it can be released. The end ofthe transected cord should not be blotted or manip-ulated because this could disturb the existing clotand predispose to hemorrhage. After both testes are removed, the scrotal inci- sions should be examined for any excessive or pul-satile hemorrhage. If excessive hemorrhage isidentied, it (see hemorrhage). The scrotal skin inci-sions should be manually stretched with two ngersuntil a sudden but small release in skin tension canbe felt (Fig. 3). This will allow for maximal drain-age and prevent premature healing of the incisions.Care should be taken to stretch only the skin, andnot the underlying subcutaneous tissues or vascula-ture that could result in inadvertent tearing of oneof the branches of the external pudendal vein. Postoperatively, the author prefers to keep the horse conned to a stall or small paddock for 24hours for close observation for hemorrhage, prolapseof subcutaneous tissue, omentum, intestine, on the testicular artery.After this 24-hour period, the horse should be ac-tively exercised (lunge or trot) for 5 to 7 days topromote drainage, prevent premature closing of theincision sites, and minimize scrotal swelling. 3. Results When complications do occur it is important that theclient or veterinarian recognize them early, and thatthey are treated promptly and correctly to minimizeprolonged morbidity and client dissatisfaction. Edema/Swelling Some degree of postoperative swelling and edema isexpected after routine castration; being most evi-dent 3 to 4 days after surgery with complete resolu-tion in 12 to 14 days. More severe swelling thatresults in clinical signs such as a stiff gait, reluc-tance to ambulate, or abnormal urination is consid-ered abnormal and should be evaluated. Excessivescrotal swelling is usually due to the scrotal inci-sions being too small or not being stretched ade-quately after surgery, or noncompliance of theowner related to active postoperative exercise rec-ommendations. This can result in premature clo-sure of the incisions and accumulation of serousfluid in the scrotum. Excessive swelling may alsobe a sign of a localized infection or abscess (seeinfection). Excessive noninfectious swelling ismost easily treated on the farm by sedating thehorse, aseptic preparation of the scrotal area, man-ually opening and stretching the scrotal incisionswith sterile gloved hands to facilitate drainage, anda 3-5-day course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs (NSAIDs). The owner should follow this upwith cold-water hydrotherapy and active exercise or Fig. 2.

This is espe-cially true if the median raphe has been excised orthe bottom third of the scrotum has been removed tofacilitate drainage. The source of this blood is oftensmall, subcutaneous vessels. However, hemor-rhage in the form of a fast drip or pulsatile stream,or of any kind that persists for more than 15 minutesafter the procedure is completed is considered ab-normal and should be addressed. 2,4Although the testicular artery is the most common source of sig-nicant hemorrhage, supercial branches of the ex-ternal pudendal vessels arterymay also be a source. Signicant hemorrhage mostoften occurs because of improper application of theemasculator (Fig. 4). Initial treatment is aimed atidentifying and stopping the source of hemorrhage.If the horse is still anesthetized, anesthesia shouldbe prolonged with additional anesthetic and thedistal aspect of the spermatic cord isolated with asterile gloved hand or curved Carmalt clamp. Ex-ternally directed tension on the transected stumpduring manipulation may be sufcient to signi-cantly slow or stop the hemorrhage associated withthe testicular or cremaster artery. Therefore, thestump should be closely examined under minimaltension before correctly concluding it is not thesource of hemorrhage. If the distal stump is iden-tied to be the source of hemorrhage, it may eitherbe re-emasculated, or more or 0-0 absorbable suture. stump has retracted too far proximally intothe inguinal canal and cannot be exteriorized forligation or emasculation, or the horse has alreadyrecovered from anesthesia, a large, curved crushingforcep(s) (Carmalt) may be used to isolate and se-cure the distal end of the stump. The horse is thenrecovered with the clamp(s) in place and maintainedin a stall for 24 to 48 hours for close observation,after which time the clamps can be removed with thehorse standing. In the standing horse, the authorprefers to identify and secure the source of hemor-rhage with curved Carmalt forceps rather than deal-ing with the frustration of trying to isolate andligate the specic source of hemorrhage. If the source of hemorrhage cannot be identied, the scrotum should be packed with a 5-7-meter-longpiece of continuous sterile gauze (crypt packing),sutured closed, and transported to the nearest refer-ral facility. Referral is also strongly encouraged in cases where considerable external blood loss has oc-curred or internal hemorrhage is suspected. Clinicalsigns associated with signicant blood loss and hy- povolemic shock include tachycardia, tachypnea,pale mucous membranes with an increased capillaryrell time, weak extremities, and some-times colic. Intra-abdominal may beconrmed in the eld by trans-abdominal ultra-sonography (swirling free peritoneal fluid) or an ab-dominocentesis. Monitoring pack cell volume andtotal solids will not reflect the severity of acute bloodloss because of fluid distribution across intravascu-lar and extravascular fluid spaces and hypovolemiainduced-splenic contraction. Changes in pack cellvolume and total protein (TP) may not be evident for6 hours and 12 to 24 hours, respectively. 2Before transport, the practitioner should consult the per-sonnel at the referral facility for recommendationson initiating intravenous fluid and broad-spectrumantimicrobial therapy, as well as additional consid-erations necessary to stabilize the horse sufcientlyfor shipping. Infection In a recent report, infection or abscess formation atthe surgical site occurred in 2% of equids undergoingroutine castration, with clinical signs developingfrom 3-21 days after surgery. 1Local infection most often results from premature closure of thesurgical incisions secondary to the incision being toosmall or not being in the most dependent part of thescrotum, or insufcient postoperative exercise. Fig. 4. Photograph demonstrating arterial hemorrhage from thescrotum following improper application of 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERYThe most common organism associated with these infections is Streptococcus zooepidemicus; however, other organisms may be involved. It is always rec-ommended to obtain a culture and sensitivity todirect appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Clinicalsigns associated with localized incisional site infec-tion include fever, swelling /H11006purulent discharge, lameness, or reluctance to ambulate. Treatment isfocused on opening the scrotal incisions sufcientlyto establishing ventral drainage and irrigation of thesite with sterile, balanced, isotonic fluids. This canbe accomplished on the farm with the therapy is initiated until results of theculture and sensitivity are available. Nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs are administered for anal-gesia and to promote ambulation. The ownershould actively lunge the horse twice daily untilthere is complete resolution of clinical signs. Forthe majority of horses, the above protocol shouldresult in resolution of clinical signs in 7 to 10 days. More chronic or systemic infections usually re- quire referral. Chronic Streptococcus sp.infection of the cord (Champignon) becomes clinically evidentweeks to months after surgery. These horses usu-ally present with a history of fever, a granulatinginguinal wound with purulent drainage, and a thick-ened spermatic cord remnant. Historically theseinfections have been associated with ligation of thespermatic cord with nonsterile suture materials.However, with the use of commonly available sterileabsorbable suture materials and proper aseptictechnique, ligation of the spermatic cord does notseem to be associated with an increased risk of in-fection. 9In these cases, infection is more estab- lished in the tissues and usually requires surgicalexploration of the area under general anesthesiaand resection of the residual infected cord deep inthe external inguinal canal. Long-standing chronic diffuse infection of the spermatic cord with Staphylococcus sp is known as a Scirrhous cord. In these horses, the scrotal incisionheals normally and the infection extends proximallyalong the spermatic cord remnant. Clinical signsmay not be apparent for months to years after cas-tration, and are dependent on the extent of infection.Horses usually present with fever and diffuse, rm,inguinal swelling /H11006single or multiple draining tracts (Fig. 5). These infections may ascend beyondthe level of the internal inguinal ring and involvethe peritoneal cavity, being palpable per rectum as arm, thickened swelling associated with the internalinguinal ring. Horses with peritoneal involvementmay develop septic peritonitis secondary to the pri-mary disease or subsequent to surgical treatment.Treatment involves en bloc resection of the af-fected spermatic cord and associated infected tis- sues to the most proximal extent of the infection,establishing ventral drainage, long-term intravenousbroad-spectrum antimicrobials, and NSAIDs. Horseswith infection that extends beyond the internal ingui-nal ring have a guarded prognosis because of poorsurgical access and the high probability of the septicperitonitis resulting in a severe systemic inflamma-tory response. Eventration of inguinal or abdominal orinquinal fat following castration is a rare and lessserious complication that, if it occurs, is usuallyevident within the rst 24 hours after castration.Acute prolapse (Fig. 6) can be quite extensive andalarming to the owner, whereas more chronic pro-lapse usually presents as cold, thickened, edematoustissue protruding beyond the skin margins (Fig. 7).Affected horses demonstrate no additional clinicalsigns except for the prolapsed tissue, in contrastwith horses with intestinal eventration, which dem-onstrate signs consistent with moderate to severeacute abdominal pain. A thorough physical exam-ination of the patient and tissue is necessary toassure that no important anatomical structures (in-testine) are contained within the tissue. Manualremoval by external traction should not be at-tempted because of the risk of enlarging the internalinguinal ring and predisposing to intestinal eventra-tion. Rather, the horse is sedated, the tissue isaseptically to to the level of the skinmargin. Antimicrobials and NSAIDs may be ad-ministered but are generally not necessary. Hydrocele Hydrocele is an accumulation of serous or peritonealfluid contained within the remaining closed vaginaltunic. Horses present with a flocculent, nonpainful Fig. 5. Photograph demonstrating chronic infection of the sper-matic cord resulting in a Scirrhous cord. Notice the diffusethickening of the spermatic cord remnant associated with theinguinal PROCEEDINGS /H114082015 213HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD scrotal area. It is a rare complica- tion that may become evident months to years aftercastration. It seems to occur more commonly afteropen (with respect to the vaginal tunic) castration.Treatment is not necessary unless the owner ndsthe swelling aesthetically displeasing. In thesecases the redundant tissue should be removed enbloc under general anesthesia. Fluid aspirationwith a sterile needle should not be attempted be-cause of the risk of causing a secondary infectionand inevitable likelihood of recurrence. 4. Complications in Which Referral Is Highly Encouraged Intestinal Eventration Eventration of intestine is a rare but serious com- plication of equine castration, occurring in 0.3 to4.6% of castrations, with Standardbred, draftbreeds, and horses having had a congenital inguinalhernia at an increased risk. Herniation usually oc-curs within the rst 4 to 12 hours after castrationbut has been reported to occur as late as 12 daysafter castration. 10,11There does not seem to be a signicant difference in risk of eventration betweenopen and closed castration techniques. 12Partial or complete inguinal/scrotal herniation should be sus-pected in any horse that demonstrates signs of acuteabdominal pain within 12 hours after castration.Ligation of the spermatic cord with a transxationsuture has been shown to reduce, but not completelyprevent, the risk of eventration. 9Horses deemed to be at increased risk of intestinal eventration shouldbe referred for castration and primary closure ofexternal inguinal rings. If a small section of intes-tine herniates through the inguinal ring during sur-gery, the intestinal segment should be thoroughlylavaged with sterile, balanced, isotonic solution, andreplaced into the abdomen. A second surgical ap-proach directly over the effected inguinal ring willbe necessary to replace the intestinal segment andclose the external inguinal ring (slit) in the aponeu-rosis of the external abdominal oblique muscle.The external inguinal ring should be closed with No.2 absorbable material. horses and NSAIDs, and conned to a stall for 7to 10 days for close observation. They may be handwalked after 48 hours. If intestinal eventration is evident after the horse recovers from anesthesia or a signicant length ofintestine has protruded through the inguinal ring(Fig. 8), the immediate objective should be to protectand preserve the exposed intestine and prevent fur-ther eventration of the intestine. The principals of\"clean, replace, and retain\" the intestinal segmentshould be employed by the practitioner in prepara-tion for transport to a referral facility. The exposedintestine should be thoroughly lavaged with sterile,balanced, isotonic solution. If the segment is smallenough to be contained within the scrotum, it maybe replaced in the scrotum and the scrotal skin ap-posed with suture or several towel forceps. Forlarger lengths of exposed intestine, a moist bedsheet or large towel maybe used as a sling to support Fig. 6. Photograph demonstrating an acute (/H11021 12 h) omental prolapse.

The prognosis is dependent on theamount of intestinal compromise, degree of perito-neal contamination, and overall systemic conditionof the horse at admission, with reported survivalrates from 36 to 87%. 2 Septic Peritonitis Septic peritonitis is a rare but serious complicationof castration. Clinical signs associated with septicperitonitis include fever, depression, anorexia,tachycardia, tachypnea, colic, and diarrhea. Be-cause the common vaginal tunic surrounding thetestes is an extension of the parietal and visceralperitoneum and directly communicates with theperitoneal cavity, a transient nonseptic peritonitis iscommonly associated with uncomplicated castra-tion. Blood contamination during the procedure isbelieved to elicit the inflammatory response. Intra-peritoneal nucleated cell counts of greater than100,000 cells/ /H9262L have been reported for 5 to 7 days after normal castration.13Nucleated cell counts and peritoneal protein concentration are not helpfulin differentiating between nonseptic and septic peritonitis in the early postoperative period(/H110215-7 d). Therefore, cytological evaluation for the presence of degenerative neutrophils and in-tracellular bacteria as well as bacterial culture ofthe peritoneal fluid should be performed to con-rm the diagnosis. Horses with septic peritonitisshould be immediately referred for treatment withintravenous broad-spectrum antimicrobials andsupportive Iatrogenic penile damage has been reported andusually occurs when an inexperienced surgeon mis-takes the shaft of the penis for the testis. Thisshould be completely avoidable with a thorough un- derstanding of the pertinent clinical anatomy and suf-cient surgical experience of the practitioner. Aswith any surgical procedure, meticulous, atraumatichandling of the tissue with minimal unnecessary tis-sue manipulation will minimize postoperative morbid-ity. Excessive manipulation and dissection of thesurrounding tissue may result in excessive inflamma-tion, swelling, and paraphimosis. This is treatedwith aggressive hydrotherapy, NSAIDs, and mechan-ical support of the penis until the inflammation sub-sides. If inadvertent direct penile damage (lacerationor transection) does occur, the horse should be trans-ported to a referral facility for further evaluation andtreatment. 5. Discussion Castration is one of the most common elective sur-gical procedures performed in the eld. Althoughthe procedure is considered routine, various post- operative complications including excessive swelling and edema, hernia-tion, eventration, hydrocele, or septic is more desirable to minimize the occur-rence of postoperative complications rather than tohave to deal with the associated morbidity, time, andeffort in treating them. A thorough understanding ofpertinent clinical anatomy, strict attention to asepsisand surgical technique, and proper postoperative ex-ercise recommendations will minimize the incidence ofcomplications associated with castration. However,when complications do arise, the practitioner shouldbe able to quickly recognize and correctly and aggres-sively treat them to assure a rapid and successfuloutcome.

Introduction A free skin graft is a section(s) of skin that has been completely detached from its vascular supply andrelocated to a distant site. The graft must establish a new vascular connection to the recipient woundbed to survive. Skin grafts are also classied ac-cording to the source of origination. An autographor isograph is a graft that is relocated from one areato a distant site on the same animal. Due to theminimal immune response induced by the host, thisis the graft type most commonly performed inhorses. An allograft is transferred between two an-imals of the same species, and a xenograft is trans-ferred between members of different species. 1 The use of island skin grafts in horses should be considered for full-thickness wounds that cannot beclosed primarily or heal by epithelialization and con-traction. In horses, these wounds typically occur ator distal to the tarsus and carpus. These areashave a paucity of soft tissues and the wounds aresubject to extreme tension and movement. It isimportant to communicate to the horse owner thatthe primary purpose of skin grafting of the distallimb is to increase the available surface area ofepidermis from which epithelialization can proceed,thereby decreasing the time to complete epithelial-ization and wound closure, not necessarily to signif- icantly improve the end cosmetic appearance of thewound. Improper graft bed or donor skin prepara-tion, hemorrhage, infection, and movement are themost common causes of graft failure, regardless ofthe type of graft performed. Two types of free skingrafts that are commonly performed in standinghorses are the punch graft and the pinch graft.With both techniques, careful case selection, metic-ulous preparation of the graft bed and surgical tech-nique, and proper perioperative care are imperativeto optimize graft acceptance and outcome. Graft Acceptance To maximize the acceptance of a graft, the woundbed must be well vascularized and free of infection.Although fresh wounds can successfully receivegraft, the severe degree of trauma and contamina-tion that accompany the majority of distal limbwounds in horses precludes them from being goodcandidates for grafting. Therefore, it is much morecommonplace to graft a wound later in the healingprocess, after an established bed of healthy granu-lation tissue has formed. Initial adherence of the graft to the recipient wound bed occurs through formation of a thin brinclot. Vessels and broblasts from the wound bed AAEP PROCEEDINGS 61 /H114082015 217HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY NOTESinvade the brin clot within 48 to 72 hours, with the graft rmly adhered to the recipient wound bed bythe tenth day after grafting. For the rst 48 hoursthe graft is nourished by plasmatic imbibition, dur-ing which small vessels in the graft passively absorbplasma via capillary action. The graft has no in-herent circulation during this period and becomesedematous. After 48 hours new capillaries in thecenter of the wound form and extend into the graft,anastomosing with existing capillaries in the graft.This process is called inosculation. During thistime, additional new capillaries from the recipientsite penetrate the graft and establish new microvas-culature, a process called neovascularization. Ef-fective revascularization and lymphatic flow occursby the leading to resolutionof the edema. 1The epidermis of the graft becomes hyperplastic and often dies shortly after grafting,leaving exposed pale-pink dermis on the wound sur-face. These dermal tissue plugs resemble granula-tion tissue but may be differentiated by their pale-pink color as compared with the deeper, darker redcolor of granulation tissue. Epithelial cells migratefrom the hair follicles and sweat glands within thedermis and soon cover the entire wound. Pigmen-tation of the graft site becomes evident approxi-mately 4 weeks after grafting, with the appearanceof hair 4 to 6 weeks after grafting. 1 Causes of Graft Failure The most common causes of graft failure are infec-tion, fluid accumulation under the graft, and motion.Granulation tissue is inherently resistant to infec-tion because of its abundant blood supply and highpopulation of phagocytic cells. However, when theconcentration of bacteria within the granulation tis-sue exceeds innate humoral and cellular defensemechanisms, the result is a localized infection.Although various types of bacteria may cause aninfection, /H9252-hemolytic Streptoccocus a partic- Streptoccocus organisms produce proteolytic en- zymes that degrade the early brinous attachmentof the graft to the recipient bed, thereby preventingearly adherence and subsequent inosculation. Thisresults in early graft failure. Clinical signs associ-ated with /H9252-hemolytic Streptoccocus sp.infection in- clude a glossy, friable appearance of the granulationwound bed, a wound surface that bleeds easily withminimal manipulation, and in more advancedstages, suppurative exudate. Although the goldstandard for diagnosing infection in chronic woundsis a quantitative tissue biopsy with greater than 10 5 cfu per gram of tissue of any organism, /H9252-hemolytic Streptococci sp.are the exception, with any level of the organism indicating infection.2 Fluid accumulation in the form of hemorrhage, serum, persistent inflammatory exudate, or exces-sive and prolonged edema prevents graft adherenceand vascularization by physically separating thegraft from the recipient wound bed. Minimizinginflammation, controlling hemorrhage, and rmlycompressing the graft to the recipient bed with abandage will help minimized excessive fluid accu-mulation. As opposed to full-thickness sheetgrafts, island grafts such as punch or pinch graftsallow excessive fluid to escape from the woundsurface between the individual grafts, and there-fore are less susceptible to failure secondary tofluid accumulation. Excessive motion at the graft site is another cause of graft failure. Movement leads to shear forces atthe graft-recipient wound interface, causing disrup-tion of the brin seal and new vessel anastomosesand growth, interfering with the vital processes ofplasmatic imbibition, inosculation, and neovascular-ization. This is of particular concern on woundsover high-motion areas such as the fetlock and tar-sal joints. When grafting over high-motion areas itis optimal to immobilize the graft site with a half-limb or tube cast. 2. Materials and Methods Case Selection/Preparation of the Graft Bed In horses, skin grafts are most commonly utilized in chronic, slow-healing wounds of the dorsal distallimb. It is important that the granulation tissuerecipient bed stays well vascularized and free ofinfection. If there is evidence of persistent inflam-mation, exudate, or a draining tract, it is imperativethat the wound be thoroughly evaluated to rule outthe presence of an underlying sequestrum or foreignbody. Radiographic evaluation of the underlying osseous structures or ultrasound examinationmay be necessary to fully assess the suitability ofthe wound for grafting. Wounds that appeargrossly abnormal or proliferative should be biop-sied and examined equine sarcoid cell carcinoma. Healthy, vascular,granulation tissue should be uniform, smooth,deep red in color and free of exudate. Morechronic, brous granulation tissue has a pale pinkto gray appearance, representing the brous na-ture of the tissue and is not a suitable graft bedwithout additional preparation. Once the recipient wound bed is deemed ready for grafting (healthy, adequate vascularity and free ofinfection), it should be lightly debrided with a scal-pel blade or non-guarded disposable facial razor to alevel just below the skin edge. This is performedapproximately 36 to 48 hours before performing thegrafting procedure. The sharp debridement servestwo primary purposes: 1) removing surface con-tamination and resident bacteria, and 2) stimulatesand provides time for new capillary growth to de-velop in the recipient bed. Fresh debridement ofthe wound bed can reduce the time from initialgrafting to inosculation (plasmatic imbibition phase)from 48 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO FIELD SURGERYdageais applied to the wound to promote hemostasis and protect the wound bed. The bandage is changed daily until grafting. The author oftenapplies Dakin's solution (0.5% dilute sodium hy-pochlorite solution), a topical antiseptic to the re-cipient wound bed for 1 to 2 days prior to grafting.This solution is relatively safe for living tissues,reported to hasten the separation of dead cellsfrom living tissue, and is effective in the presenceof blood and serum. The solution can be applieddirectly to the wound bed, or applied to a sterilenon-adherent dressing incorporated directly onthe wound during bandaging. Grafting Technique Both the punch and pinch graft can be performed inthe standing sedated horse. Horses should be upto date on tetanus prophylaxis. Preoperative pro-caine penicillin G (22,000 IU/kg, every 12 h, IM) andphenylbutazone (2.2-4.4 mg/kg, every 12 h) is ad-ministered for 24 to 48 hours. Horses are mostoften sedated with detomidine hydrochloride b(0.01- 0.02 mg/kg IV) and butorphanol taratec(0.01-0.02 mg/kg IV). The donor site is clipped and both thedonor site and the graft wound bed are surgicallyprepared. The donor site is desensitized with 2%lidocaine hydrochloride, usually in an inverted \"U\"block so as not to directly inltrate the skin that willbe incorporated in the graft. The common donorsites for directly obtaining punch grafts from thehorse are the ventrolateral abdomen, perineum, orportion of the neck that is concealed by the mane.Alternatively, an elliptical, 10-cm long /H110034-cm wide full-thickness sheet of skin may be harvested fromthe cranial-pectoral area. The segment of skin isstretched and secured epidermal side down to a ster-ile piece of styrofoam or polypropylene block. Thesubcutaneous tissues are sharply excised away fromthe graft and the punch grafts obtained from thestretched sheet of skin. Punch Grafts Punch grafts are small, full-thickness plugs of skinthat are harvested and implanted into the granula-tion wound bed using commercially available skinbiopsy punches. The recipient sites in the granula-tion wound bed are created rst to allow time forhemostasis prior to implantation. Because the skingraft plugs will undergo contraction after they areharvested, the biopsy punch used to make the recip-ient holes should be slightly smaller that the punchused to harvest the grafts. The author prefers touse a 5-mm punch to create the recipient holes anda 7-mm punch to harvest the donor grafts. It also isimportant to work from distal to proximal so thathemorrhage from creation of the recipient holes willnot impair visualization of the wound bed. Start-ing at the most distal aspect of the granulation bed,recipient holes are made approximately 5 to 7 mmapart and 5 to 7 mm deep in a symmetrical pattern.A common mistake is to make the recipient holestoo deep, in which case exuberant granulation tis-sue will cover the grafts and impede epithelializa-tion. A single horizontal row of recipient holesare created, then each site is lled with a broken-off cotton-tipped swab to help control hemostasis(Fig. 1). This process is continued until all therecipient holes have been created. The cotton-tipped swabs are left in place until they are re-placed with a graft plug. The donor punches are either removed directly from the horse (Fig. 2) or from a sheet of skin re-moved from the cranial pectoral area using a 7-mmbiopsy punch (Fig. 3). Removing the graft leaves asmall circular defect at the excision site, so theyshould be harvested in a symmetrical pattern, ap-proximately 1 cm apart to optimize cosmetic appear-ance. The grafts are harvested, the fascia andsubcutaneous fat sharply excised from the dermalside of the plugs to facilitate plasmatic imbibitionand revascularization, and then placed on sterile,saline-soaked gauze until they are placed in therecipient holes. The cotton-tipped applicator is removed, and the graft placed into the recipienthole. It is impractical and of little importance toattempt to line up the direction of the hair folliclesof each plug given that the wound will heal pri-marily by epithelialization with minimal hairgrowth. After all the graft plugs are inserted(Fig. 4), the wound is covered with a nonadherent Fig. 1.

The swabsare removed immediately before inserting the punch grafts.Photo courtesy of Dr. John Peroni. AAEP 219HOW-TO SESSION: bandage. The author leaves the initial bandage in place for 4 to 5 days to allow for undisturbed adherence and revascu-larization during the plasmatic imbibition, inoscu-lation, and neovascularization phases. If the siteis over a highly mobile area such as a joint, a castor cast bandage should be utilized for 2 to 3 weeksto immobilize the area and optimize graft adher-ence. The cast can be bi-valved to allow access tothe wound for bandage changes (Fig. 5). The donor sites can either be closed with a single suture d, staples, or left to heal by second intention. When a sheet of skin is removed from the cranialpectoral region en bloc, the incision should be su-tured closed with an appositional or sometimes a tension-relieving pattern. Fig. 2.

The grafts areplaced on saline-soaked gauze sponges until implan-tation. The horse, donor site, and recipient bed areprepared as for punch grafting. A No. 15 scalpelblade is then used to create small pockets in thegranulation recipient bed, in a symmetrical patternto receive the grafts. It is important to work fromdistal to proximal so that hemorrhage from creationof the recipient pockets does not impair visualiza-tion of the wound bed. Starting at the most distalaspect of the granulation bed, recipient pockets aremade approximately 5 to 7 mm apart and 5 to 7 mmdeep in a symmetrical pattern. The scalpel blade isintroduced at an approximately 45\u00b0 angle, in a prox-imal-to-distal direction (Fig. 6). With the pinchtechnique, hemorrhage from the graft bed is difcultto control and the recipient sites difcult to identifysoon after the recipient pockets are created. There-fore, the pinch grafts are immediately placed intotheir respective recipient pockets one by one as they are created. After all the pinch grafts have beeninserted, the wound is covered with a nonadherentdressing aand pressure bandage. If the site is over a highly mobile area such as a joint, a cast orcast bandage should be utilized for 2 to 3 weeks toimmobilize the area and optimize graft adherence.Perioperative care is identical to that of punchgrafting.Both punch and pinch grafts are relatively easy to perform, economical, and can be performed on astanding, sedated horse. Each graft is independentof the others, and failure of one graft does not ad-versely affect the remaining grafts. Pinch graftingcan be more tedious to perform and often results inan inferior cosmetic appearance compared withpunch grafting; therefore, punch grafting is themethod most often preferred by the author. Fig. 5. Photograph demonstrating the use of a cast saw to bi-valve a half-limb cast-bandage. This allows removal of the underlyingbandage and evaluation of the graft site. The bi-valved cast can then be reapplied over the new bandage and secured in place withinelastic tape, allowing continued immobilization of the graft site without the need to apply an entirely new cast.

Results With both techniques, 60 to 75% of the grafts can be expected to take (survive). The supercial, pig-mented, epidermal portion of the grafts will usuallyslough within the rst 1 to 2 weeks after grafting,exposing the pale underlying dermis and making itdifcult to distinguish between the graft plugs andthe surrounding granulation tissue. This shouldnot be misinterpreted for graft failure. By 3 weeksthe grafts become more readily apparent with pinkrims of epithelium migrating centrifugally fromthe grafts (Fig. 7). Epithelial from the wound periphery and circumferentially from eachgraft coalesces to cover the entire recipient bed withepithelium. The wounds heal primarily with anepithelial scar with variable amounts of pigmentand hair as the scar matures. The time requiredfor the wound to become completely covered withepithelium is inversely related to the number ofgrafts placed within the recipient bed. As a roughguide, epithelialization of the distal limb usuallyprogresses at a rate of 0.09 mm per day. 4 It is important to note that because the initial epithelium layer covering of the wound is thin andextremely friable, the horse should be restricted tostall or small paddock connement for an additional4 to 6 weeks after the wound has healed to allow formaturation and thickening of the epithelial scar.Premature return to unrestricted turnout or athleticactivity is a common cause for complete disruption ofthe epithelial scar, especially when located overhigh-motion areas, such as the fetlock, carpus, orhock joints. 4. Discussion The use of island skin grafts in horses should beconsidered for full-thickness wounds that cannot beclosed primarily or heal by epithelialization and con-traction. There are several advantages of punch/pinch grafting. They are relatively easy to perform;can be performed in the standing sedated horse; andare economic alternatives to more expensive sheetgrafting techniques. Additionally, each graft healsindependently of one another and thus 100% graftacceptance rate is not necessary to effectively en-hance the healing of the wound. 4It is important to communicate to the horse owner that the primarypurpose of skin grafting is to decrease the time re-quired for complete epithelialization and woundhealing, not to signicantly improve the end cos-metic appearance of the wound. The veterinarianmust emphasize to the horse owner that the woundwill heal with an epithelial scar and variableamounts of pigmented epithelium and hair. Although the grafting techniques are relatively straightforward, improper graft bed or donor skinpreparation, hemorrhage, infection, and movementcan result in graft failure. With both punch andpinch grafting techniques, careful case selection,meticulous preparation of the graft bed and surgicaltechnique, and proper perioperative care are imper-ative to optimize graft acceptance and outcome.

Introduction Intrasynovial sepsis in horses results in severe lameness and can potentially be career- and/or lifethreatening. In foals, infectious arthritis second-ary to the hematogenous spread of bacteria is themost common form of intrasynovial infections en-countered, whereas traumatically induced septic te-nosynovitis and infectious arthritis seem to be morecommon in adults. 1-3Successfully treating an in- fected synovial structure requires rapidly eliminatingthe infecting organisms from the synovial structurebefore irreversible damage occurs. andarthrotomies. 1-3Local antimicrobial administration has also been used to improve drug delivery to the site of infection in the form of antimi- crobial injections greaterthan 100 times the minimum inhibitory concentration(MIC) of commonly isolated bacterial pathogens. 12 To continuously deliver and maintain high intrasyno-vial antimicrobial MICs, a commercially available con-tinuous-rate infusion system ais available to treat a multitude of joints, tendon sheaths, and bursas (Fig. 1).10 2. Materials and Methods Pre-CRI Catheter Placement Synovial fluid should be aspirated for cytologic examination, bacterial culture, and sensitivity.Infected synovial structures should be drained, la-vaged, and/or debrided before placing the indwell-ing, intrasynovial CRI system. The intrasynovialCRI catheter placement system comes with a 14-gauge trochar that contains a peel-away introducer;this trochar can be used only once to lavage a syno-vial structure for a thorough lavage just before in-serting the CRI catheter. The pump of the CRI system, which is an elasto- meric balloon, should be lled with a concentration-dependent antimicrobial solution 10 to 15 minutesbefore placing the catheter to allow time for thesolution to ll the delivery tubing. The CRI admin-istration pump holds a maximum of 100 mL anddelivers antimicrobials at a rate of 0.5 mL/h. It isrecommended that the administration pump belled with 48 mL of either 100 mg/mL gentamicinsulfate bor 250 mg/mL amikacin sulfatec, thus 223HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY NOTEScan be relled if needed. It is likely that other antimicrobials (including time-dependent antimi-crobials) could be used as the CRI perfusate basedon bacterial culture and sensitivity results; however,no current referenced information is available.Avoid infusing air bubbles into the administrationpump to prevent air from entering the flow controltubing within the CRI system. Air bubbles can ob-struct the antimicrobial solution through the flowcontrol tubing. 9Before placing the CRI catheter, ensure that the antimicrobial solution is beading atthe end of the infusion tubing and flowing correctlybefore placing it within the synovial structure. CRI Catheter Placement The intrasynovial catheter can be placed after syno-vial lavage while under general anesthesia or usingsedation and local anesthesia. A synovial pouchshould be chosen that positions the catheter that the peel-away introducer into the infected synovial structure allthe way to the hub; it is easier to thread the indwell-ing catheter if the introducer is fully inserted intothe cathe-ter through the introducer until at least 5 cm of thecatheter is estimated to be within the synovial struc-ture. Once the catheter is placed, pull the blue tabson the introducer apart, up, and out of the synovialstructure (Fig. 2). Next, attach the CRI adminis-tration pump that contains antimicrobials and itsinfusion tubing to the CRI indwelling catheter.The indwelling catheter and infusion tubing shouldbe secured to the skin with a 2-0 monolament su-ture using a simple interrupted pattern (Fig. 3).A sterile, protective bandage is applied over theindwelling catheter and infusion tubing. The ex-cess tubing can be rolled up and placed along theoutside of the bandage; position the administrationpump on the limb so the tubing is pointed downtoward the insertion site to reduce air bubbles from Fig. 1. Continuous-rate infusion system. This system containsan elastomeric balloon (A) that can hold 100 mL of solution andhas a flow rate of 0.5 mL/h, infusion control tubing (B), a trocharthat contains a peel-away introducer (C), and a 16-gauge intra-synovial catheter (D).

Additional bandaging can be applied to each side and over the top of theCRI administration pump. This will allow thepump to be secured to the bandage and will permiteasy monitoring of the administration pump forfunctionality. The pump can be lled when neces-sary without removing the bandage from the cathe-ter insertion site. In general, bandages should bechanged every 2 to 3 days to check the entire system.In cases that require more aggressive wound ther-apy or synovial lavage, the bandages may need to bechanged more frequently. Most intrasynovial CRI catheters are left in place for 5 to 10 days. The longest time period that Les-cun et al. left an intrasynovial CRI catheter in placewas 15 days. 10The catheter can be removed once treatment has been completed. A sterile bandageis then applied for at least 2 days depending uponthe initial injury. Note that synovial fluid may beobserved egressing from the catheter site after re-moval when the catheter has been in place forgreater than 5 days. 3. Results and Discussion Following appropriate medical or surgical therapiesfor infected synovial structures, the use of an indwell-ing, intrasynovial CRI catheter is an excellent adjunc-tive modality of therapy. It has been shown that themean steady-state synovial fluid gentamicin concen-tration during continuous infusion is 1,069 /H9262g/mL, which is greater than 100 times the MIC of commonlyisolated equine bacterial pathogens. 12Because it is cost-effective and yields a high MIC, gentamicin is theauthor's antimicrobial of choice when using the intra-synovial CRI system. This antimicrobial deliverymethod avoids repeated injections, articular damagethat results from antimicrobial beads,damage associated with retrieval of nonabsorbablebeads, 7and the anatomic limitations regional lage or occurswith the continuous infusion of gentamicin. 13Two separate retrospective studies that investigated theefcacy of intrasynovial CRI antimicrobial infusionyielded resolution in 93% of horses with synovialinfections. 10,11 The advantages of using an intrasynovial CRI catheter include its ease of placement, ability tomaintain a high intrasynovial level of antimicrobialswhile periodically instilling other medications, andease of removal when therapy is discontinued. 10 If necessary, it is possible to lavage the infectedsynovial structure while the indwelling CRI cathe-ter is in place; however, you cannot lavage directlythrough the catheter system because the intralumi-nal diameter of the indwelling CRI catheter is toosmall. Disadvantages of using this CRI catheterinclude the inability to aspirate synovial fluidthrough the lumen for synovial fluid analysis be-cause of the small intraluminal-diameter of the CRIcatheter, unknown effect on articular cartilage if theindwelling catheter is placed against a weightbear-ing surface, and potential of developing an ascend-ing infection. Indwelling CRI catheters should beplaced within joints distant enough to avoid contactwith weight-bearing articular surfaces. The intrasynovial CRI system should are lavage,drainage, and regional limb perfusion. Intrasyno-vial CRI catheters have proven to be very effectiveclinically, and the author recommends implement-ing them in cases that present with chronic andcomplicated synovial structure infections. 10,11 Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author declares that he has adhered to the Prin- ciples of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

The most common distal limb injury isheel bulb or palmar/pastern lacerations. 1,2Pri- mary or delayed primary closure should be per-formed, when appropriate, before applying a footcast; however, distal limb wounds may be allowed toheal by second intention under a cast. Casts thatincorporate the foot and extend upward to the distalfetlock can substantially decrease the length ofconvalescence in horses by more completely immo- bilizing the distal interphalangeal and proximal or just castingthe hoof wall. 1Although the initial treatment of a distal limb injury may be performed under generalanesthesia, it can be more advantageous to apply afoot cast when the horse is standing. Applying afoot cast in a standing horse has the advantage ofenabling the proper hoof-pastern axis to be achievedand xed because the horse bears full weight on thecasted limb before the casting material sets, mini-mizing the likelihood of complications that developwith poorly conforming casts. 1In contrast, apply-ing a foot cast while the horse is under general anesthesia may result in an improper hoof-pasternaxis as a consequence of hyper- or hypoextension ofthe distal portion of the limb. 2. Materials and Methods Precasting Considerations A considerable number structures close to a distal limb injuryshould be thoroughly examined to determinewhether there is communication with the wound.Arthrocentesis and synovial structure distentionwith sterile saline may be necessary to determinesynovial involvement 1); radio-graphs, contrast radiographs, and ultrasonographyare adjunctive diagnostic modalities that may helpassess the severity of the injury and whether syno-vial structures are involved. If a synovial structureis involved, then appropriate therapy to treat theinfected synovial structure should be performed.It is important that the clinician is condent thatthe infected synovial structure has been eliminatedbefore a distal is applied. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 227HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY NOTESPatient Preparation The most common distal limb injury is heel bulb or palmar/pastern lacerations.1,2Primary or delayed primary closure should be performed, when appro-priate, before applying a foot cast; however, distallimb wounds may be allowed to heal by second in-tention under a cast. A light bandage that consistsof a nonstick pad, aelastic gauze,band a small length of elastic bandage materialcshould be applied over the lacerations. Before a cast is applied, the shoeshould be removed from the affected limb, and thefoot should be trimmed to avoid focal pressure alongthe edges of the cast. All casting materials shouldbe gathered in one location to expedite the cast ap-plication (Fig. 2). General Casting Recommendations General casting recommendations are as follows: Wear latex or nitrile gloves.Casting material should not be opened untilready to use. Submerge casting material in water for 10 sec-onds to activate cast resin. Shake off excess water from casting material. Warmer water typically results in faster cast-ing material cure times. Avoid wrinkles when applying casting material. Forelimb Cast With the horse sedated, an assistant should hold theaffected limb off the ground along the distal meta-carpus so the foot can position itself into a neutralposition (Fig. 3). A double layer of stockinette d (3-4 inches wide) is placed over the foot and ex-tended to a level 2 inches above the metacarpopha-langeal joint. A premeasured length of stockinetteshould be cut, and each end should be rolled towardthe middle; one end is rolled inward, and the otherend is rolled outward (Fig. 3). When applying thestockinette, it is important that it covers the sole(after one end of the stockinette is unrolled, twist Fig. 1. Arthrocentesis and synovial structure distention withsterile saline may be necessary determine interphalangeal joint is communicatingwith the palmar pastern wound in this horse. Fig. 2. Materials needed to apply a distal limb cast includegloves, stockinette, felt, white tape, 3-inch casting material,acrylic, aluminum foil, and elastic tape. Fig. 3. With the horse sedated, an assistant should hold theaffected limb off the ground along the distal metacarpus so thatthe foot can position itself into a neutral position. A premea-sured length of stockinette is applied, and orthopedic felt is tapedaround the pastern. Fig. 4. The last roll of berglass casting material can be fan-folded upon itself 5 to 6 times in 6-inch increments; this fan-folded portion of berglass casting material can be placed on thesolar surface of the foot and secured to the cast using the remain-ing portion of the casting material. 228 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERYthe stockinette at the toe 360 degrees and unroll the second end), extends just above fetlock, and is ap-plied wrinkle-free to avoid unnecessary focal pres-sure under the cast. A 1-inch strip of felt is placedaround the pastern just below the metacarpophalan-geal joint (Fig. 3). Three rolls of 3-inch berglasscasting material eare applied to include the foot and extend proximally to overlap only half the width ofthe felt strip. The palmar aspect of the cast shouldbe slightly lower than the cranial aspect of the castto allow for metacarpophalangeal joint extension.It is important to fold the stockinette distally atsome time during cast application so that it becomesincorporated into the casting material. The lastroll of berglass casting material can be fan-foldedupon itself 5 to 6 times in 6-inch increments; thisfan-folded portion of berglass casting material can be placed on the solar surface of the foot and securedto the remainder of the cast using the remainingportion of the casting material (Fig. 4). The foot isplaced on the ground during the nal curing processto allow the cast to conform to the normal hoof-pastern axis (Fig. 5). 1After the cast is cured, acryl- icfis placed on the bottom of the cast and formed around the edges of the cast to reduce wear. Oncethe acrylic is mixed in a disposable cup, it can bepoured onto a piece of aluminum foil and placed ontothe bottom of the cast; this allows even spreadingof the acrylic (Fig. 6). Once the acrylic begins toset, the foot can be placed on the ground, allowingthe acrylic to t the form of the bottom of the cast.Last, elastic bandage material should be appliedalong the top of the cast to prevent dirt, bedding, ordebris from entering between the limb and the cast(Fig. 7). Hindlimb Cast Stockinette and felt strip application principles arethe same as in the forelimb. Once the stockinetteand felt strip have been applied, the horse's hindfoot should be positioned with the toe of the affectedlimb resting on a board that is at least 2 inches thickand 4 inches wide 3; the contralateral foot should be placed on a board with the same dimensions (Fig. 8).The affected hindlimb should be maintained in aneutral position, with as much of the foot as possiblehanging off the back of the board. It is importantthat the solar portion of the foot remains parallelwith the ground and that the toe does not becomeraised off the board during positioning. 3Properly placing the foot to be casted is crucial because it allows most of the cast to be applied while the limbis fully bearing weight. Two rolls of 3-inch ber- Fig. 5. The foot is placed on the ground during the nal curing process to allow the cast to conform to the normal hoof-pastern axis. Fig. 6.

It should extendproximally to encompass the proximal pastern.The proximal aspect of the cast should overlap onlyhalf the width of the felt strip. It is important tofold the stockinette distally at some time during castapplication so that it becomes incorporated into thecasting material. The third roll of casting materialshould incorporate the toe and be applied with anassistant extending the limb cranially off of theboard (Fig. 10). 3It is important to extend the limb cranially to keep the limb in extension as much aspossible; pulling the hindlimb caudally to place thelast roll of casting material will result in too muchflexion of the distal limb. Flexing the limb whilethe casting material is not cured will result in wrin-kling; as a result, this will cause focal pressure tothe limb under the cast and not allow proper hoof-pastern alignment. A gure-8 pattern may be usedto adequately cover the toe and ground surface of the Fig. 7. Elastic bandage material should be applied along the topof the cast to prevent dirt, bedding, or debris from enteringbetween the limb and the cast.

After the toe has been sufciently covered with casting material, the foot should be placed backonto the board, and the remainder of the third roll ofcasting material should be applied proximally.The cast should be allowed to cure while the horse isfully bearing weight and with the casted limb in aneutral position. After the cast is cured, acrylic isplaced on the bottom of the cast as described for theforelimb cast. 3. Results and Discussion Treating distal limb injuries should be specic foreach horse; therefore, the original injury should de-termine the length of time the cast is worn. Ingeneral, only a single cast is required, and mostdistal limb casts are worn for 3 weeks. 1It is im- portant that horses be conned to a clean, dry stallwhile wearing a cast to minimize cast complications.Elastic bandage material around the proximal castshould be changed every 3 to 4 days but should bechanged immediately if it becomes wet. Casts needto be monitored daily for signs of fluid dischargefrom the proximal cast or through the cast, castbreakage, cast sore development around the proxi-mal cast, excessive cast \"wearing\" around the toe orsolar surface, or lameness development. 4If any of these abnormalities are noted, cast removal shouldbe considered. Foul odor alone without the pres-ence of these complications is not enough to warrantdistal limb cast removal; the foul odor could be theresult of sweating, production of granulation tissueexudate, or bacterial fermentation from the solarsurface of the foot. 3Distal limb casts less com- monly develop rub or pressure sores when comparedto half- or full limb casts; cases requiring half- orfull-limb casting yield 50% development of castsores. 4 Cast immobilization can be used to manage a wide variety of distal limb injuries and offers manyadvantages over bandaging. 1,3Distal limb cast im- mobilization enhances healing by limiting the move-ment of the injured tissue, decreasing tension onsutures, limiting the development of excessive gran-ulation tissue, providing a moist environment forre-epithelialization, and eliminating the time andcost associated with frequent bandage changes. 1-3,5 Treating uncomplicated heel bulb lacerations thatdo not involve synovial structures is associated witha good prognosis for return to soundness (90%) andan acceptable cosmetic appearance (90%). 1,2When used appropriately, distal limb casts can be appliedefciently and effectively in the standing horse tomanage distal limb injuries. Being able to apply adistal limb cast while the horse is standing is ad-vantageous because this allows the proper hoof-pas-tern axis to be established within a well-conformingcast.

Introduction Equine hoof boots have come a long way since the rst widely used and commercially successful hoofboot was unveiled by nuclear physicist Dr. NeelGlass in 1970. 1Developed to help his daughter's navicular horse, this original bootais still in produc- tion today. There are now numerous hoof bootmanufacturers producing a countless array of bootstyles and sizes. Boots have become commonly used for riding. This allows horses to remain bare-foot when not on the trail or in the arena. Horseshave won the grueling Tevis Cup 100-mile endur-ance race in a type of glue-on hoof boot bthe last 4 years in a row. Veterinarians often use hoof bootstherapeutically. From the author's personal obser-vations, the most common therapeutic use of hoofboots is for the treatment of acute and chronic lami-nitis. Their ease of use, adaptability, and cost ef-fectiveness make them a logical choice for thisdisease process. Paired with the right sole supportoption hoof boots can offer a laminitic horse much-needed comfort. Improved comfort is important from a humane standpoint and owners tend to use comfort as abarometer for treatment success or failure. A morecomfortable horse following boot application can,however, be deceiving. It is not uncommon for ahorse with chronic laminitis to get more comfortablein boots, but deteriorate radiographically. As the structural integrity of the digit diminishes, pain of-ten remanifests. This deterioration may be pre- vented or halted with a hoof boot that provides moreoptimal mechanics for the digit. Mechanics is aterm commonly used by foot care professionals.Generally speaking, altering the mechanics of a footinvolves trimming the hoof or applying a shoe or adevice in an effort to alter foot function. A wedgedshoe, rolled-toe shoe, and extended heel shoe forexample, each apply a different type of mechanics toa foot. What might constitute optimal mechanicsfor one disease process or injury may be preciselythe wrong mechanics for another. Hoof boots can be modied to optimize their support and mechanics.The objective of this approach is to achieve comfortwhile providing mechanics that improve the healthand integrity of the compromised digit. The authorrealizes there are vastly differing views on what con-stitutes appropriate mechanics for the treatment oflaminitis. The efcacy of the many shoeing ap-proaches as they relate to chronic laminitis remainsanecdotal. 2,3The beauty of this approach is that hoof boots can be modied to provide any support and me-chanical combination you desire. With a well-t bootyou can glue on, screw on, or bolt on any shoe you canthink of. Recently, interchangeable boot soles havebeen developed commercially (Figs. 1A and B) cto sim- 232 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY NOTESplify and improve the modication of hoof boots. Boot bottoms are modied by attaching one of veinterchangeable sole options with screws. The objective of this paper is to familiarize the practitioner with the modication of hoof bootsand the utilization of the commercially availableinterchangeable boot soles c. Photos and descrip-tions that follow show mechanical choices that theauthor commonly uses. The author encouragespractitioners to experiment with shoes/mechanicsthey have had success with. Addressing the un-derlying cause or causes of the laminitic episode iskey to success and quite possibly more importantthan the application of any trim, shoe, or boot. Fig. 1. A, Hoof boot with interchangeable solesc. B, Hoof boot with a variety of interchangeable PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 233HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERY2. Materials and Methods There are several key elements to the successful use of hoof boots for the treatment of chronic laminitis:1) Choose boots with a perfect t and solid construc-tion, 2) choose case appropriate sole support, 3) mod-ify the boots to improve their mechanics (anteriorbreakover, mediolateral breakover, and heel eleva-tion when necessary), and 4) mitigate rubs andmaintain skin and hoof health while in boots. Choosing a Boot With a Perfect Fit and Solid Construction A snug-tting boot is critical to the success of thisapproach. Because of the cylindrical nature of thehorse's hoof, boots that are too large tend to twistand turn. This tendency is compounded whenshoes are applied to the bottom of a boot. Imaginethe consequence of a boot that spins 180\u00b0 with a 10\u00b0wedged shoe on the bottom. Instead of heel eleva-tion and reduced tension in the deep digital flexortendon (DDFT), you now have toe elevation andincreased tension in the DDFT. Boots should beselected after the foot has been trimmed appropri-ately. Most boot manufactures have sizing chartsand other recommendations on their web sites.As you become accustomed to certain boots, ttingbecomes second nature. A well-constructed hoofboot is of paramount importance. From experiencewhen you add a shoe to a boot, you are asking thatboot to perform a task that it really was not designedfor. For example, the author uses heel elevation onmany horses with laminitis. The wedge placesadded strain on the toe of the boot and many bootsfail at the toe region over time. Choosing Case-Appropriate Sole Support Hoof boots are commercially available with a varietyof supportive insole choices. This gives practitio-ners the ability to customize sole support on a case-by-case basis. The author commonly uses ethylenevinyl acetate (EVA) foam pad material. This mate-rial can be purchased in bulk in a variety of densitiesand is surprisingly lightweight. The author hassourced a variety of EVA foam pad materials fromgym mat manufactures, stall mat manufactures,and even archery targets. Orthopedic felt cut to tthe boot bottom is an excellent choice as well. Theauthor typically uses felt when he feels a horse canhandle the rm support that felt provides. Theauthor has found that some horses prefer felt overimpression materials, silicones and urethanes, be-cause they do not apply much pressure to the medialand lateral sulci of the frog and sometimes bars(depending on hoof conformation). Hoof emol-lients, hardeners, and medications can also be ap-plied to felt pads. Felt padding for carpet and arearugs can be obtained from your local carpet store.Carpet felt is a plentiful and inexpensive felt option.Just as with more traditional shoeing approaches,tube-based silicones and urethanes can be used tomake custom sole and frog supports d,e. Jar-based two-part dental impression materials can be used aswellf,g. The author prefers to use two-part dental impression materials in boots over tube-based sup-port materials because they are neater, more userfriendly, and do not tend to stick to the boots or hoofas readily. Regardless of your preference, it is im-portant to understand that most support materialsare available in a variety of durometers (hard-nesses). In general, the harder the material, thehigher the durometer, and the more support it of-fers. For example, a support material with amarshmallow-like consistency offers little support tothe sole whereas a support material with a rubber-like consistency offers more support. The authoruses dental impression materials in the 50-durom-eter range on most horses with laminitis. The au-thor keeps material in the 25-durometer range onhand for horses that do not tolerate the rmer im-pression material (Fig. 2). Modifying Hoof Boots to Treat Horses With Chronic Stable and Chronic Unstable Laminitis Chronic laminitis is dened by the presence of me- chanical collapse of the lamellae and displacementof the distal phalanx. 4Simplistically, horses with chronic laminitis are those that have displacementof the distal phalanx combinationthereof). Chronic is further subcatego-rized as chronic compensated (stable) and chronicuncompensated (unstable). 5A chronic stable foot is no longer actively displacing and is growing walland sole whereas a chronic unstable foot is activelydisplacing. Both stable and unstable horses can besore but the unstable horse often suffers the conse-quences of the digital instability with secondary ab-scessation, seromas/hematomas, osteomyelitis,coronary band shear lesions, solar penetration, pro-lapsed solar corium, etc. Shoeing mechanics are Fig. 2. From left to right, EVA foam pad material, carpet feltpad material, two-part dental impression material. 234 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERYsimilar for treating the chronic stable and chronic unstable horse (with dorsal capsular rotation) butspecial attention must be placed on managing sec-ondary infections and complications in the chronicunstable horse. Horses with mediolateral and/ordistal displacement (sinkers) often require a differ-ent mechanical approach and will be covered sepa-rately from those with dorsal capsular rotation. Modifying Hoof Boots to Treat Horses With Chronic Stable and Chronic Unstable Laminitis That is PredominantlyDorsal Capsular in Nature With experience, hoof morphology (growth rings, stretching of the white line, solar prolapse, etc.) cangive the practitioner great insight into what is goingon inside the hoof capsule. A horse with unstablelaminitis can displace in a matter of days and evenhours. It can take weeks to months before hoofmorphology will reflect these changes. Consideringthis, the author prefers to take quality radiographsprior to trimming horses with laminitis. The author approaches the treatment of dorsal capsular rotation with well-recognized biomechani-cal principles as described previously by Morrison 5 and O'Grady.6The hoof boot is simply going to provide a novel means of applying shoeing mechan-ics. It bears repeating that the efcacy of shoeingapproaches as they relate to chronic laminitis re- mains anecdotal. 2Generalizing when talking about laminitis is dangerous given that each case isdifferent and deserves an individualized approach.Having said that, the process can be broken downinto the trim (wall sculpting and heel trim), support,and the application of mechanics (altering anteriorbreakover, mediolateral breakover, and heel eleva-tion when necessary). When treating horses withdorsal capsular displacement, the author trims theheels in an effort to recruit the healthier caudalportion of the foot to share more load (Fig. 3). Ex-cessively long toes and flares are sculpted with arasp. Because this technique is not dependent onthe hoof wall for shoe attachment, the ground sur-face of the wall can be rounded in an effort to moveweight bearing axially (Fig. 4). The frog and barsare often recruited to bear weight by adding supportmaterial (covered in the section above, \"ChoosingCase-Appropriate Sole Support\"). The foot iswedged to varying degrees in most cases. This is inan effort to get the solar margin angle of the distalphalanx near its pre-trim state (Figs. 5A and B).This negates the effects that the heel trim has ontension in the DDFT and consequently the dorsallamellae. A rolled and/or rockered toe is used toenhance digital breakover and reduce the momentarm around the distal interphalangeal joint. Thisis thought to decrease stresses within the dorsallamellae. In most cases the author chooses to placethe point of breakover as far back as possible with-out the horse tipping forward onto the rocker in thestance phase. The anterior coronary band can beused to approximate this point (Figs. 5A and B). 5A shoe is chosen or modied that ts the boot andeases mediolateral breakover in an effort to reducetorque placed on the lamellae in turns. Clogs, railshoes, and half-round shoes, for example, accom-plish this well. The shoe is rockered, rasped, orground to provide the desired breakover. Methyl-methacrylate hoof glues h,iadhere well to boot bot- toms constructed of polyurethane. You must alsobe sure that the glue will adhere to your shoe choice.Methylmethacrylate bonds well to aluminum, poly-urethane, and wooden shoes. Approximately 5 Fig. 3.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 235HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERYounces of glue is necessary to secure most shoes to a boot. The author prefers a swift-setting methyl-methacrylate with a 2-4-minute cure time. Shred-ding one square inch of berglass cloth material intoevery 2 ounces of glue increases the tensile strengthand will make it a nicer consistency to work with.It is helpful to place the boot in a clamp or vice withthe ground surface facing up. Masking the boot offwith duct tape prior to mixing glue ensures a nice,clean, nished product. Glue should be mixed thor-oughly and applied to both the boot bottom and shoe.The shoe is then pressed rmly into place and theexcess glue is sculpted to a nice cosmetic look.Excess glue can be wiped away with cotton 4/H110034gauze (Figs. 6A-D). The glue will go through anexothermic phase. When the glue has cooled, im-perfections can be rasped or ground if necessary.The boot can then be applied to the foot. Radio-graphs taken following boot application ensure thedesired mechanics have been achieved (Fig. 5B). To apply mechanics using commercial inter- changeable boot soles, bselect a compatible boot and choose a sole that provides the desired mechanics(Fig. 1). The interchangeable soles are currentlyavailable in ve options as follows: 1) 10\u00b0 wedgewith rolled toe, 2) 5\u00b0 wedge with rolled toe, 3) clog, 4)flat with rolled toe and heel extension, and 5) 5\u00b0wedge with rolled toe and heel extension. Selectthe desired sole and secure with three-quarter-inchNo. 14 Phillips head screws. Again, it is recom-mended to take radiographs following boot applica-tion to ensure that the desired mechanics have beenachieved. Breakover can be adjusted with a benchgrinder or a rasp. Modifying Hoof Boots to Manage Horses Receiving a Deep Digital Flexor Tenotomy Deep digital flexor tenotomy is indicated for horses that continue to rotate despite the application ofshoeing mechanics to address the collapse of thedigit. It is also indicated in horses that stabilize radiographically but remain signicantly painful.Sole and wall growth is typically diminished in thesehorses. Finally, tenotomy is indicated for horsesthat suffer from severe acquired flexural deformitythat can occur with chronicity. 6,7Transection of the DDFT is a serious decision that should not be taken lightly. Complications include distal in-terphalangeal joint subluxation, distal interphalan-geal joint arthritis, acute overloading of the heelsand/or quarters with further digital collapse, recon-tracture of the muskulotendonous unit, and overcor-rection resulting in a chronic negative solar marginangle and heel pain. There are two different approaches commonly used to shoe for a deep digital flexor tenotomy.Both methods use a heel extension to prevent hyper-extension of the distal interphalangeal joint. Bothmethods advocate trimming heel and propping thetoe in an effort to achieve a near-0\u00b0 solar marginangle relative to the surface of the shoe. Both tech-niques are commonly referred to as a form of\"derotation shoeing.\" The difference lies in the ap-plication of heel elevation to minimize distal inter-phalangeal joint subluxation. Some practitionersuse a flat shoe (usually an egg bar) leaving the solarmargin angle of P3 flat relative to both the shoe andthe ground. Horses shod in this manner tend toexhibit at least some degree of distal interphalan-geal joint subluxation post surgically (Fig. 7A).Other practitioners apply varying degrees of heelelevation until distal interphalangeal joint sublux-ation is eliminated post surgically (Fig. 7B). Thereis a commercially available shoe for this purpose.It is a rail shoe with 5\u00b0 of wedge and a sizable heelextension. jElevating the heels to mitigate joint subluxation is thought to prevent secondary distalinterphalangeal joint arthritis. The author hasused both methods extensively. Anecdotally, the Fig. 5. A, Chronic laminitic foot shown in an unmodied hoof boot prior to trimming the heels or sculpting wall.

Con-sequently, the majority of the author's tenotomiesare now performed with heel elevation. The authorhas not appreciated distal interphalangeal joint ar-thritis of major clinical with eithermethod. Both forms of derotation shoeing are tech-nically challenging requiring some experience withglue-on technologies. The use of a flat egg bar shoefollowing tenotomy was described by Morrison. 5 The use of a 5\u00b0wedged rail shoe with a heel exten- sion was described by Redden.8Either type of shoe can be glued to a hoof boot with methylmethacry-late h,ias discussed previously (Fig. 8). Commercial interchangeable solesccan be used post tenotomy as well. Select and secure either the 5\u00b0 wedged or flatheel extension (Fig. 1B). Fig. 6.

Notice the improvement in distal interphalangeal joint subluxation provided heel 61 /H114082015 237HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERYTrimming remains the same regardless of the method you prefer. With radiographic guidance, the heels are trimmed aggressively without invad-ing the live sole. Most cases are rarely trimmed atall forward of the widest part of the foot. Thisensures as much foot mass as possible remains be-neath the tip of P3. Some horses may require ad-ditional toe elevation to achieve a 0\u00b0 solar marginangle relative to the boot bottom. Cutting a wedgepad to match the interior of the boot and placing thethick portion at the toe accomplishes this well.The support option of choice can then be placedon top of the wedge pad. Radiographs should betaken to ensure that the desired phalangeal align-ment has been achieved. An extremely well-t bootis required for this technique. Without a snug t,the toe can flip up within the boot resulting in seri-ous heel bulb rubs or sores. In addition, the heelextension provides leverage that can predispose theboots to twisting on the foot. The author prefers touse glue-on shoes following a tenotomy because theyrequire less maintenance and he is comfortable withglue-on techniques. Boots with heel extensions areused by the author most commonly to give horses abreak from shoes. This is done for a variety of rea-sons including soreness, hoof wall deterioration un-der glue, etc. (Figs. 9A and B). Modied hoof bootsmay provide practitioners an alternative method ofderotation shoeing. This could be especially bene-cial in situations where the farrier and/or practi-tioner are not comfortable with the traditionalglue-on derotation technique. Using Hoof Boots to Treat Distal and Mediolateral Displacement (Sinkers) Distal and mediolateral displacement is the most challenging manifestation of chronic laminitis to Fig. 8. Tenotomy rail shoe glued onto a hoof boot. The wedgeminimizes distal interphalangeal joint subluxation post tenot-omy. The heel extension prevents hyperextension of the distalinterphalangeal joint post tenotomy. Fig. 9. A, Radiograph of a hoof 6 days post tenotomy of the DDFT. Laminitis was supporting limb laminitis due to a severe injuryto the contralateral limb. Shoe was removed due to unrelenting foot pain across the entire sole. B, Same foot in panel A is shownfollowing shoe removal and placement in a modied hoof boot. A hoof boot with a tenotomy rail shoe glued to the bottom was applied.A double layer of felt padding was used for support. The mare was more comfortable but not to a humane level. Boot was used fora couple of days at which time a transxation pin cast was applied. To date, 4 months later, she is expected to have a good qualityof life and be able to perform her duties as a broodmare.238 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD SURGERYtreat in author's opinion. A retrospective study by Bras9described a 53% mortality rate for sinkers that resulted from systemic disease.This was despite aggressive foot management.Foot casting with axial support has been describedfor the treatment of distal and mediolateral dis-placement of the distal phalanx. 9Hoof boots can be used but the author has been limiting their useto mild and moderate cases. Foot casts remainthe author's preferred method for treating severecases. The author does not believe hoof boots asthey currently exist will replace the need for footcasts to treat distal or mediolateral displacementof the distal phalanx. Foot casts are thought tostabilize the hoof capsule and minimize indepen- dent movement of the bony column within the hoofcapsule. 9Hoof boots can offer the same axial support but lack the rigidity and stability that footcasts provide. Hoof boots offer the advantage ofeasy access to the palmar veins at the pasternlevel for IV regional perfusions of antibiotics or forfollow-up venogram studies. This benet doesnot outweigh the superior immobilization of thefoot cast, but bears mentioning. For cases wherecasting is not an option (usually for monetaryconstraints) the author tends to apply hoof bootswith 1-inch thick EVA foam pad material. Thewall is rounded nicely in an effort to shift weightbearing axially just as it is done typically prior tofoot casting (Fig. 4). A boot should be chosen thatoffers enough depth in the bottom of the boot toaccept the thick pad material (Fig. 10).Managing Secondary Infections and Complications in the Chronic Unstable Horse With more traditional shoeing approaches unstable horses often require the fabrication of specializedtreatment or hospital plates to manage areas of sec-ondary subsolar abscesses, seromas, hematomas,osteomyelitis, solar penetration, prolapsed solar co-rium, etc. Hoof boots can be completely removedgiving total access to the solar surface. Similarly,boot removal allows easy and frequent access to thecoronary band and hoof wall. This allows the prac-titioner access to submural abscesses that drain atthe coronary band, partial hoof wall resection sites,or shear follow-up radiographs and venograms to becompleted. Easy and frequent access to the entiredigit is a signicant benet to this approach. Larval therapy has been described as an adjunc- tive therapy to treat secondary infections arisingfrom chronic laminitis. 10The author has utilized larval therapy with light foot bandages under hoofboots successfully. A light foot bandage is neces-sary, given that the larvae tend to escape the bootwithout it. Care must be taken to ensure that thelarvae are not crushed. Felt pads with materialremoved at the site of larvae placement is helpful ifthere is not a subsolar or submural cavity to placethem in. Mitigating Rubs and Maintaining Skin and Hoof Health While in a Boot Horses maintained in hoof boots for an extended period of time are prone to dermatitis, skin irrita-tion, rubs, and sores. It cannot be emphasizedenough how important a perfect-tting boot is. Hooves can become soft and water logged from sweat and environmental moisture. Commerciallyavailable hoof hardeners and sole paints are com-monly used to combat this. Baby powder applied toa felt pad works surprisingly well and is the author'spreferred method. In very moist environments it isbenecial to have a spare set of boots allowing care-takers to rotate to a dry pair. Interestingly, some horse owners use human socks on their horse's hooves prior to applying boots.There are several benets to using socks with hoofboots. Socks minimize rubs and sores and themoisture-wicking properties of some socks seem topromote better overall skin health. The authorroutinely dusts socks with baby powder prior to ap-plying them for even better moisture control. Inaddition, the upper portion of the sock can be foldeddown over the boot's straps. This protects thestraps from chewing or loosening by the patient (Fig.11). 3. Results Over the period of 1 full year from March 2014 toMarch 2015 the author used modied hoof boots totreat 16 horses with chronic laminitis. Modiedhoof boots were used primarily when other shoeing Fig. 10. A typical hoof boot capable of accepting the 1-inch-thickEVA foam pad material. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 FIELD SURGERYor proved Both ods of boot modication were used (gluing on shoesand the commercial convertible soles). Both meth-ods proved to be equally functional and reliable.Three horses were euthanized for humane reasonsin that time period. Two of the euthanized horseswere severe mediolateral sinkers and the other wassuffering capsular rotation with severeosteomyelitis. Boots with a 5\u00b0 wedge and heel ex-tension were used post tenotomy in three cases.The remainder of the horses received boots with a 5\u00b0wedge and rockered toe. Given the chronic natureof this disease many of the cases were still ongoingat the time of paper submission. Of the 13 surviv-ing horses eight were transitioned to various glue-onshoes when hoof health and comfort allowed. Theremaining ve horses were still in modied hoofboots at the time of paper submission. 4. Discussion Laminitis is a disease that requires the practitioner toreact and adapt quickly to the changing clinical pic-ture. Hoof boots allow sole support changes to bemade by loosening a couple of straps or buckles.This is a distinct advantage of using hoof boots overtraditional therapeutic shoeing methods. For in-stance, to change the density of dental impressionmaterial under a heart bar or heel plate, the shoe mustbe removed and reapplied in most instances. Simi-larly, to change the type of mechanics of many com-monly used therapeutic shoes, the shoe must beremoved, altered, and reapplied. With this approachpractitioners can make changes to support and me-chanics independent of each other and with ease. Pros of this approach: Modied hoof boots can provide treatment that is both comfortable and mechanically favor-able for the treatment for chronic laminitis. Modied hoof boots allow relatively easy appli-cation of good mechanical treatments withoutthe need for advanced farrier skills. Modied hoof boots allow you to be nimble.Changes to both mechanics and support can bemade quickly if current set up is not working. Modied hoof boots are applied with minimaltrauma. Boots can be altered off of the horseeliminating the need for a horse to stand onone leg while being shod. Modied hoof boots are cost effective whencompared with common glue-on meth- ods. Quality hoof boots have approximately3-4 months longevity with continuous use. Modied hoof boots allow the application ofgood mechanical treatments to feet that aresometimes too debilitated for nail-on or evenglue-on shoes. Modied hoof boots allow easy and completeaccess to the entire digit. Modied hoof boots can expand your ability tohelp horses that reside well beyond your prac-tice area. You can modify boots and ship toother veterinarians, farriers, trainers, andowners. Cons of this approach: There is the potential for needing a large in- ventory of boots given that there are manytypes and sizes. Rubs, sores, dermatitis, etc. can develop withprolonged or improper use of hoof boots. Modied hoof boots are relatively high main-tenance. Owner and staff compliance iscritical to success. Boots should be resetfrequently (at least every other day). Thisis challenging because owners often want a\"set it and forget it\" approach. Modied hoof boots as they relate to this paper were predominantly used when other methods hadalready failed. It is interesting to note that many horses became more comfortable in boots with nochanges to the previous mechanical approach.Meaning, the same shoe was often removed from the foot and glued to a boot bottom. The author spec- Fig. 11. A human sock has been slipped over the distal limb to minimize rubs.

The semi-soft construction of the boot bottom is likelydampening shock and absorbing vibrations pro- Fig. 12. A, Chronic laminitic foot in an unmodied hoof boot. Support material was EVA foam pad.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS 241HOW-TO SESSION: ground. Im- portantly, hoof boots allow impression material,EVA foam, felt, etc. to be placed between the hoofwall and the boot/shoe. The support material's lo-cation there also allows it to dampen shock andabsorb vibrations as they make their way to the hoofwall. The somewhat elastic nature of the boot'sattachment to the hoof wall is likely reducing torquethat is transferred from the shoe to the wall whenpivoting or turning. The author's overall impression of using modied hoof boots to treat chronic laminitis is very favor-able. In general, horses became more comfortableand hoof morphology improved. Due to the demo-graphics of the author's practice area the majority ofcases were Thoroughbred broodmares. Modiedhoof boots allowed many of these mares to carrytheir pregnancies to term with greater comfort (Fig.12, A-D). Modied hoof boots require a lot moreeffort on the part of caregivers than more traditionalapproaches. The author views them primarily as atemporary treatment for chronic laminitis. As hoofmorphology improves, he tends to transition them toshoes or barefoot. However, with a dedicated care-giver, modied hoof boots may provide a long-termsolution for severely compromised feet. The authorhas been managing a chronic laminitic mare withpost tenotomy complications for over a year in mod-ied hoof boots (Fig. 13, A and B). This techniqueis in its infancy but does seem to be a viable anduseful treatment option for chronic laminitis.

RLP using ceftiofur sodium has been studied but it is un-known whether this antimicrobial drug signi-cantly penetrates soft tissue and bone. Theobjective was to determine the concentration ofceftiofur in plasma, soft tissue, and bone inhealthy horses after RLP. 2. Materials and Methods Six healthy horses were used. Under standingsedation, a tourniquet was applied to the proximalmetacarpus. RLP was performed in both fore-limbs of each horse by injecting either 2 g ceftiofursodium expanded to 60 mL with sterile saline(experimental) or 60 mL saline (control) intrave- nously in the lateral palmar digital vein. Thetourniquet was left in place for 30 minutes postinjection. Plasma, soft tissue, and bone sampleswere collected at times 0, 12, and 24 hours post-RLP. Concentrations of ceftiofur and its metab-olites were analyzed using high-performanceliquid chromatography. 3. Results The median plasma concentrations were greaterthan 1 /H9262g/dL at time 0 and 12 hours. The median soft tissue concentrations were greater than 1 /H9262g/g at the three time points. The median bone concen-trations were greater than 1 /H9262g/g at time 0 and were below 1 /H9262g/g at 12 and 24 hours.

Introduction Fatalities are a recognized consequence of prolonged endurance exercise but data documenting incidenceand causes are limited. 2. Materials and Methods Numbers of starts and fatalities were obtained fromthe American Endurance Ride Conference Web siteand details regarding fatalities were obtained fromattending veterinarians. Annual incidence rates andodds ratios for region and ride length were calculated. 3. Results Seventy-one fatalities attributable to the demandsof endurance exercise occurred among 270,070starts in American Endurance Ride Conference-sanctioned rides (2002-2014). Fifty horses wereeliminated during competition while 21 completedthe ride distance and were deemed t to continue,thereby receiving completion awards. Fourteenhorses died and euthanasia was performed in theremaining 57, of which 50% had necropsy examina-tions performed, and 75% developed colic and nec-ropsy ndings included gastric rupture in ninehorses. Nineteen riders declined fluid therapy,referral, and/or surgery when recommended. Therewere no differences between years or regions. In con-trast, the risk of fatality was /H110112 (0.26 fatalities per 1,000 starts) and /H1101110 (1.46 fatalities per 1,000 starts) times more likely for participation in 50- and 100-milerides, compared with competition in limited-distancerides (25-30 miles, 0.14 fatality per 1,000 starts). 4. Discussion Overall fatality rates of endurance horses were lowbut increased with ride length. Fatalities associ-ated with 100-mile rides were comparable withthose for flat racing but considerably less than thatfor steeplechase racing.

Haymarket Veterinary Service opened its doors in 1997, when it was just me and one part-time asso-ciate. I started practice life in a conventionalequine practice with a 5-day workweek. I was therst female vet that stayed in that practice afterhaving a child. When the reality of having a kidand trying to balance it all hit me, I negotiated a halfday off instead of a pay raise. When my secondchild was born 6 years later, I negotiated the secondhalf day, allowing me to have a 4-day week. As fatewould have it, I started my own practice when thatchild was 9 months old. Of course, I was back tosquare one, but I knew that my goal would be tohave a practice with vets working 4-day weeks. We currently have 8 veterinarians, 8 technicians/ assistants, and 4 administrative personnel. We aredifferent from most large equine veterinary busi-nesses in that all of our employees are females.We have weathered internally many of the same challenges that face most equine veterinary prac-tices: personal health issues, change of maritalstatus, births, and deaths. Our external pressuresare shared by others in the profession as well andinclude declining horse populations paired withhigher customer expectations, nancial uncertain-ties among our clients, and increased costs thataffect our ambulatory practice. Despite these in-ternal and external challenges, we feel that we are doing something right in creating an excellent work-ing environment. For example, our employee turn-over is low\u2014we have had two vets leave us in nearly20 years of practice history. Our support staff also mirrors that statistic. This complex environment clearly requires simpli- fying strategies and tactics to meet our goals ofproviding timely, predictable, competent, and pro-fessional service while still nurturing the best work-ing environment for our veterinary and supportstaff. Perhaps counterintuitively, we've found thatby standardizing shared resources and processes wehave created a work culture that maximizes flexibil-ity. For example: Our ambulatory service trucks carry equip-ment and medications organized in a stan-dardized layout. Trucks are cleaned andrestocked each evening after service and re-main at the practice overnight except whenneeded on call. Although each of our vets hasa favorite truck, all trucks are available foruse. Veterinary assistance is provided by any of agroup of trained staff technicians so that the 246 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WOMEN IN PRACTICE - STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS NOTESabsence or unavailability of one person does not impede workflow. Veterinary assistants are cross-trained towork in the ofce, mitigates an \"us ver-sus them\" mentality, and gives the staff abroader view of the practice. Clients accept more than one doctor treatingtheir horse. This system allows for vets toshare cases and have real days off when theyare off duty. Regular updates and communi-cation between vets promotes condence thatthere is continuity of care. A good softwaresystem and laptops keep us all up to date onthe latest bloodwork and client communica-tions. Updates to patient records are com-pleted before a vet leaves for the day, alleviating lost information and lost revenueas a result of forgotten charges. Practice-owned cell phones are kept in thetrucks to minimize the personal cell phone um-bilical cord often seen between vet and cli-ent. Most communications come through theofce during regular business hours. Ofcourse, ofce staff must be very well-trainedand familiar with clients to personalize theexperience. Use of an iPad in the ofce allows easy com-munication between the vets on the road andthe team in the ofce. Group texting allowsfor all the trucks to know what emergencieshave come in during the day and which vetsmay be getting bogged down with calls andmay need help to nish their day. Textingthe veterinarian while the client is on thephone reduces the need to call the client backand gets the client answers sooner.All of these strategies have been ne-tuned over the years with an eye for exceptional customer service,patient care, and employee work-life balance. Spe-cically: 1. It allows veterinarians to work a 4-day week while taking great care of cases. 2. It allows for illness, injury, pregnancy, and child and elderly caretaking without a loss ofcontinuity in patient and client care, whichincreases our clients' condence in us. 3. It allows for vacations, horseshows, family events, farms, second careers, and just aboutanything that may catch the fancy of a groupof professionals who wants to be equine veter-inarians but not to the detriment of pursuingoutside interests. Most veterinarians in the practice were hired out ofinternships. This makes them especially gratefulfor the workweek, and they see the value of timeaway from their job. When interviewing, the prac-tice culture is emphasized, and we strive to hireveterinarians and staff that we feel would t in withour group. I think the practice works well becausethe employees are committed to having personaltime despite the fact that a different structure maybe more economically lucrative.

Introduction Creating a consistent and sound business philoso- phy begins with how you envision the growth of yourpractice while maintaining the client base you al-ready have. Female practitioners will likely haveeven more challenges in achieving this goal whenfactoring in family matters and career choices.Many of us would not have chosen a career as anequine practitioner if we didn't love working withhorses as well as medicine and surgery. The pur-pose of this article is to demonstrate how to success-fully chart your own path to achieve a solid work andfamily life. To achieve this in my equine ambulatory practice, I instituted the \"together everyone achieves more\" (TEAM) approach about 2 years ago. I have ownedthis practice since 1994 with a partner who doescompanion animal practice. Our practice startedout primarily with racetrack and Standardbredbreeding horses and now focuses on sport and plea-sure horses. We currently employ 3 full-time vet-erinarians, 1 part-time veterinarian, and a staff of 4receptionists and technicians plus 1 ofce manager.The TEAM approach was utilized at the middleschool where my children attended. It has beenutilized in many settings and can be adapted to anybusiness setting. The goal of the TEAM approachis to have the day fall into such a groove that it leadsto more time during the off-hours. The TEAM ap-proach focuses on all members to contribute to a positive work atmosphere and mutual respect.Although we all have different personalities, ourgoals are the same\u2014providing the best care forour patients and their owners. We rely on ourstrengths and help each other when needed. Whenteam members have the next day off, they relayinformation about ongoing cases to each other sothat when the client calls everyone is on the samepage. The doctor knows what information has been passed along and what the expectations are. Wealso keep a phone log with the receptionists showingwhat time the call came in, what the message was,and to whom it was directed to (vet, ofce manager,receptionist). The reply is then logged in the sameplace with the date and time the call was made.On a rare occasion, some information misses thebook\u2014after all, we are human. But all in all thissystem works quite well. The TEAM approach alsohelps with the billing by providing checks and bal-ances. By reviewing the Google calendar and spot-checking transactions, especially with lab work,missed charges can be identied. This contributesto the bottom line. The client who drops off a fecal but does not get charged may be spotted when thereceptionist adds the results to the patient record orwhen the ofce manager is paying the lab bill andsees that the charges have not been entered. As 248 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WOMEN IN PRACTICE - STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS NOTESrequired by law in New Jersey, all prescriptions must have a label, and by printing a label at theclinic, charges there will not be missed (plus theyare a vital part of the medical records). In ourambulatory trucks we carry premade labels with allthe required information: name, practice name andaddress, and license number. 2. The TEAM Approach in Action Receptionist Staff A receptionist staff is a critical component of the TEAM approach in veterinary practices. As such,clear guidelines should be established with your re-ceptionists so they understand what is expected ofthem. Although veterinarians generate incomethrough the services they provide, it is the reception-ist who often creates that rst impression forclients when they contact your ofce. You there-fore must have the right person in that position.This person must be someone who understands ba-sic veterinary and client terms, such as colic orsquinty eye, while also being sensitive regardinghealth matters. This person should also not be apushover because they will be training your clientsabout your expectations of them. The receptionist should gather as much informa- tion as possible during the initial phone call to im-prove organizational effectiveness and ultimately tohelp all involved parties, including the client, pa-tient, and veterinarian. Our staff routinely ad-heres to the following procedure when accepting anew client: 1. Obtain or review all client information, in- cluding home address, e-mail address, all rel-evant phone numbers, and credit cardinformation. Explain payment policy andwhich payment methods are acceptable. 2. Obtain the name, breed, age, and sex of the horse. Does the horse have any vices or al-lergies? Are there any past medical or surgi-cal problems? Record the show and barnnames of the horse. Make arrangements forthe owner to send any pertinent records to theofce before the rst visit. Ask if the horse isinsured and, if so, with which insurancecompany. 3. Obtain the name of the trainer, if applicable, the name(s) of any barn help, and the facilitywhere the horse is boarded (which may or maynot be at the owner's home). 4. Send a welcome e-mail or packet to new clients. 5. Provide a timeframe for the appointment. Avoid giving exact times, however. Becauseveterinarians routinely examine more ani-mals than scheduled on any given day, theyrarely can stay on a precise schedule. Thiscan be mitigated by asking the client if theveterinarian will need to see additional ani-mals during their visit. (If clients start tofuss with the window provided, we joke thatrepairmen give us wide time windows, andthey don't see the life-threatening issues thatwe see!) When running late, either the staffor the veterinarian should call with an up-dated timeframe. It helps to mention thatyou value their time too. No one likes wait-ing at the doctor's ofce or at their farm for theveterinarian, farrier, or feed man. Be re-spectful of your clients' time. 6. Set expectations with the client that the ani- mal is to be caught with a halter on andcleaned up (a quick brushing will sufce) be-fore the doctor's arrival. This is importantfor avoiding those instances when you arriveto photograph for a Coggins test, perform ayearly exam, and administer vaccinationsonly to nd that the horse has just been pulledout of the eld and covered with dirt ormud. If a client habitually is unprepared foryour visit, you may wish to inform that clientthat a $250 per hour charge will apply in thefuture if assistance is needed to catch andclean the horse. Make a note in the record sothat when future appointments are sched-uled, your staff can remind the client that thisfee will be incurred if the animals are notready. Scheduling A schedule that allows all veterinarians and staffreal-time access to changes helps everyone on theteam know how the day is evolving. Some practicesuse a Google calendar. Whatever scheduling sys-tem is used, it is important to have the staff recordas much information in the calendar as possible,including the reason for the call, the services to beperformed, special equipment that might be needed,and medications or supplies that are likely to bedispensed. The address of the farm and necessaryphone contacts should also be accessible in theschedule. Personalized Service It is benecial to use a form for the client to completewith their credit card information. This can belled out at the farm or sent back to the ofce inadvance. These forms can be electronic and avail-able on a website as well. Having the client's sig-nature on a form that gives you permission fortreatment and agreement to pay for such treatmentis recommended. Remember that credit card num-bers must be kept secure and that there are rigorousguidelines for such security; using a bank or othervendor for storing these numbers may thus be thebest solution. Clients may wish to share other information if they cannot be reached in times of emergency.They may wish to record their preference of referralhospitals if their horse needs to go to a clinic. They AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 249THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WOMEN IN PRACTICE - STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESSmay have a nancial limit on what they would be willing or able to spend. If the horse is insured, theinsurance information should be present in the re-cord. If a client does not want referral under anycircumstances, it is helpful to know the extent oftreatment they are willing to support on the farm ifthey cannot be reached. It is best, of course, tohave this communication prior to an unforeseenevent. Clients will frequently relay this informa-tion readily if they are asked. A good newsletteritem to include is a reminder to clients who might begoing on vacation to provide this information to thepractice or to their horses' caregivers. Giving Back In return for their dedication, consider allowing allstaff members 1 day off during the week, and try notto bother them during this time. Who wants tohave a doctor's appointment after a long day ofwork? Wouldn't it be nice to have your hair doneand come out of the salon during daylight hours?Wouldn't you like to ride your horse when otherpeople are around instead of closing up the barn atnight? Team members generally enjoy this policyand treasure days off. When team members arerefreshed, the practice runs more smoothly. Manypractices also stagger their veterinarians' workdaysso that each doctor also has a weekday off. To-gether, all team members take care of those itemsthat need to get done during their day off on aweekly basis. Self-Care As the leader, you too must follow these principlesand have a day off to take care of personal matters.Your health is important, and yearly exams shouldnot be skipped. You also need to attend familyactivities and events. It is perfectly acceptable tosay no to a client's party or to a request for service tobe with your family. You will undoubtedly havesome clients who won't appreciate your outstandingservice and commitment. At times, it is appropri-ate to simply inform them you will be unavailable oncertain days. There is no need to get into an expla-nation. Simply have them call the ofce the nextday to be scheduled. If you have a bad vibe about aclient, you are usually right. Just as you instinc-tively move out of the way of a striking or kickinghorse, you can sense when something is not rightwith a client. Many \"problem clients\" have used allthe other veterinarians in the area already. Whydo you want to be next? Go with your gut feeling.Call your colleagues to nd out their experienceswith a particular person that you are uncertainabout. Organization Being organized makes the day flow more efciently.Take adequate time to put things back neatly andexactly into the same spot. File paperworkpromptly. Do your billing regularly because astime goes by, charges are missed. The same ap-plies to medical records because information maybecome inaccurate or obsolete as time goes by.By accomplishing these tasks, you can enjoy yourday off. Organization also is needed for your home. Map out plans for the family for the week. Consider awhite board where everyone can write down theiractivities. Make sure that any major events go on abig wall calendar. In this way, there is no lack ofcommunication among everyone in the family.Make sure that you schedule time for your family.Plan vacations in advance so coverage can be easilyarranged. Being on emergency call is a serious commitment. Communicating that commitment to your partner isa key element to a successful relationship. Spendtime with them. Tell them what your schedule islike and how much you love your job. They must bewilling to understand this aspect of your profession.Likewise, you must also be flexible with their wantsand needs. Isn't that why you are together? Setrealistic goals for your future but don't be afraid todream big. 3. Summary As you strive for the TEAM approach that incorpo-rates clients, staff, family, and you, hopefully the practice will thrive and be a place everyone is proudto say they are a member. Your practice philoso-phy and training are key to getting the job done.But remember\u2014it all starts with you!

Rathgeber, DVM, PhD It is possible and pleasurable to have a happy family and be a successful partner in an equinepractice. There are some time management strategies that may help make this easier.

Introduction I was invited to be a partner at Hagyard Equine Medical Institute just before my second daughterwas born. After the birth of my rst child, I decidedI needed to work smarter, not longer, to try to beable to be a mom and spend time with my family.I was able to maintain my busy equine practice andstill have time for my children. 2. Solutions One of the most helpful things I did was to managemy clients' expectations. They were used to be-ing able to reach me 24/7. I told them that I wasgoing to work fewer nights and not be available onthe weekends while my kids were young. Someclients dropped me right away and found a newveterinarian. I tried to manage those clients andkeep them with another veterinarian within thepractice. Other clients were, and still are, veryrespectful of my personal life. They were happyto wait until the next morning for certain things orallow me to send another veterinarian from thepractice to help them. I also had to manage the clinic's expectations. At Hagyard Equine Medical Institute, we are lucky tohave an excellent and huge support staff, and Iutilized them as often as possible. I became morecomfortable with allowing our support staff to help me and as a result began to delegate more work tothem. There is denitely a learning curve to dele- gating tasks that you are used to doing yourself.The next step that I took was to hire a full-timetechnician and nanny. The nanny lived close byand was available for nighttime emergencies. Astime went on, and the kids were at school, I used herto help me run errands. She went to the cleaners,the grocery, the post ofce, etc. I made it a priority to do my best veterinary work and to be extremely organized and efcient. Hiringa full-time technician helped me achieve that. Vet-erinarians play a \"who can work the longest\" gamethat can be exhausting. I wanted to spend timewith my children and not be exhausted for work orfor fun. I feel strongly that I am a better veterinar-ian and a better mother for making this a priority.I tried to make the most of my driving time byhelping clients with scheduling, keeping track ofrecords for them, and calling them to check onhorses or cases and to see if they needed anything.I was surprised how helpful it was to contact clientsinstead of waiting for them to contact me. I couldschedule them easily and when I was in their loca-tion. I also tried to nish all of my reports, billing,and correspondence letters while my technician AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 251THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WOMEN IN PRACTICE - STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS NOTESdrove. This way when I got home I could focus on being a mom. I also utilized technology more than I ever had before. It is very easy now to have Internet accessanywhere you are. However, 17 years ago it wasnot as easy, and I tried every new bit of technology.I got a computer, and my technician used it all dayto keep track of records, billing, and appointments.I would schedule phone calls and recheck examina-tions in the calendar to help me keep track of cases.This technology was not as popular then as it is nowbut can be a very powerful and timesaving tool.It allowed me to keep efcient and detailed medicalrecords. This was helpful for the client, the prac-tice, and for me when I needed to reexamine a horseor send another veterinarian to examine it. The next thing that I tried to do was \"job crafting.\" I wanted to craft or create a practice or job where Iloved everything I did, so I started customizing myservices. I did not want to do any reproductivework or dentistry, so I would refer clients to someonewithin the practice. I focused on lameness, ultra-sound, and radiography. I also tried to build anacupuncture practice. I was amazed at how appre-ciative all the associates were when I delegated thethings that I did not enjoy to them, and I was moresurprised at how well the clients received it. I hadbuilt a relationship with most of them such that theytrusted me to allow another veterinarian to helpcare for their horse. The hardest thing I had to do was to learn to say no and to say it nicely. I think women in particularare afraid to say no\u2014somehow considering it impo-lite or unacceptable. Then they are left with toomany tasks and not enough time to do the thingsthey like to do. I learned to say to clients that whatthey were requesting was a great opportunity butthat I was already working on another project.It is still difcult for me to say no, but practicemakes perfect. Last, the part that I still struggle with every day is the balance between work and life. I love mycareer, but there still must be something else. Noone can balance this scale for you; you have to do ityourself, and you have to do it almost every day.It is different for all of us. You have to have some-thing you enjoy doing. For me, I nd that enjoy-ment in cooking, yoga, running, and riding. It hasbeen proven repeatedly that this makes us moreproductive, creative, and energized in our careers. The combination of these changes amazingly in- creased my productivity despite working fewerhours. This was the measurable parameter thatmade me feel like the investment in the veterinarytechnician and technology were worth it. I feel thatI am a good partner in a large equine practice andam able to participate in a large practice in a man-ner that I am proud of. I would be remiss not toacknowledge that I have a wonderful husband andparents that have been supportive every step alongthe way.3. Pricing for This Strategy Veterinary Technician Calculations for insurance, a 401k plan, and time off are based on $12.00/h and a work schedule of 40hours per week. All employees who receive benetsare classied as regular (not seasonal) full-time em-ployees and must work a minimum of 30 hours perweek to qualify for insurance and time-off benets. Insurance: Benets include medical, dental, a $30,000 life and accidental death policy, andlong-term disability at an annual cost of $4,907. 401k retirement plan: Employees are eligible on the rst day of the quarter following 1 year ofemployment and must be 21 years old. Theannual cost for the plan is $751. Time off: Paid time off for those who have less than 5 years of service include the follow-ing: 80 hours of vacation; 16 hours to be usedas a floating holiday; 32 and 48 hours, respec-tively, for personal leave and sick leave; and 64hours of designated holidays (New Year's Day,Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, Thanksgiv-ing Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, NewYear's Eve). This is a total of 240 paid hoursoff per year. Employees are allowed to buildup 480 hours of sick time in their time-off bank,which equates to 12 weeks of paid time off andis intended to serve as a short-term disabilitybenet. It requires 10 years of not using anysick leave to build up these hours. After com-pleting 5 years of service, vacation time in-creases to 120 hours annually; after completing10 years of service, it increases to 160. Theannual cost for these benets is $2,880. Payroll taxes are not a benet but an expense and are calculated at /H110110.0765% of the annual compen- sation. Continuing education can also be an ex-pense. For example, we send technicians to theHagyard Bluegrass Symposium or Kentucky Veter-inary Medical Association meeting in Louisville forthose who are seeking a veterinary tech license.Mileage at the current adopted rate can also be anexpense. Providing a cell phone could be consid- ered as an expense or benet. Nanny/Full-Time Childcare Provider Initially, I paid a full-time nanny $400 per week plusfree housing; eventually I increased her wages to$500 per week. I used an accountant to help withthe taxes, and that was an additional fee of $1,200.We had a place on the farm that she lived and whereshe could be available for nighttime emergencies.I did not include health insurance for the rst fewyears but nally got ahead enough to be able topurchase it. The nanny was responsible for laun-dry, feeding the kids, and sometimes driving them toactivities. I usually tried to come back home andtake them but often could not make it. As the kids 252 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WOMEN IN PRACTICE - STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESSgot older and were at school longer, the nanny was able to run errands and help around the house.It is really hard to nd someone to leave your kidswith, but it can be done, and the young lady thatworked for me is still part of our family even thoughshe does not work here anymore. Computer and Technology This will depend on your personal preferences for Internet services and for a computer or tablet.I have a billing program called HVMS. It workswell, but there are several other programs that maywork even better for your type of practice. The total cost was $1,500-$5,000; however, this couldvary. Computer software also may already be partof your practice and therefore not an additional cost.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 253THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WOMEN IN PRACTICE - STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESSStrategic Negotiation: Babies, Bosses, and Pregnancy Plans Charlotte Lacroix, DVM, JD This article focuses on empowering female veterinarians and staff to more effectively conduct strategicnegotiations with employers. Examples provided largely (but not entirely) focus on topics related topregnancy and childbirth, but these techniques can be applied to a far wider range of issues. Strategiesdiscussed include recommendations on how to prepare for a negotiation, dening appropriate accommo-dations to request, and presenting a strong case. Author's address: Veterinary Business Advisors, Inc.,24 08889; e-mail: clacroix@veterinarybusinessadvisors.com.\u00a9 2015 AAEP. 1. Introduction In 2009, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) reported that females outnumbered malecounterparts for the rst time. In 2010, the Associa-tion of American Veterinary Medical Colleges sharedthat 78% of veterinary students were females. 1With this evolution in demographics, increasing numbers ofveterinarians and their staffs must negotiate how todeal with accommodations needed because of pregnan-cies, which include medical leave and more. And yet,research shows that females, when compared tomales, lack the condence needed to effectivelynegotiate. 2 This article therefore shares empowering strategies that women can use to condently approach their em-ployers to discuss difcult issues and/or to ask for accom-modations. Although the examples largely focus onpregnancy and childbirth, these techniques can be ap-plied to a far wider range of issues, including salarynegotiations, sexual harassment, and more. 2. Strategies Preparation Before a woman approaches her employer with a topic that could prove challenging to discuss, she should rstconsult her employee handbook to determine practice policies that relate to her situation, which could includeaccommodations and medical leaves of absence. In thecase of pregnancy, this should be done early so that stepscan be taken to safeguard fetus health. It can also be helpful to understand basic rights provided under the Family Medical Leave Act(FMLA), which applies to people who work for privatecompanies with 50 or more employees. The FMLAprovides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for a serioushealth condition that prevents an employee from per-forming essential functions of her job. The FMLAprohibits employers from attempting to prevent aqualied person from taking this leave and from ter-minating an employee who legally takes this leave.An understanding of FMLA is crucial if a woman plansto discuss pregnancy or newborn child care issues,adoption or foster care, and serious health issues of herown or that of a spouse, child, or parent. The American Disabilities Act applies to people who work for private companies with 15 or morepeople and prohibits discrimination against peoplewith disabilities in employment, among other areas.Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not considered a dis-ability, but complications that occur during preg- 254 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: WOMEN IN PRACTICE - STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS NOTESnancy or childbirth could qualify. Many states also have laws that provide protections, including somefor companies with fewer employees. Once a woman has gathered relevant informa- tion, which could include consultations with anattorney, medical personnel, and more, then it istime for her to outline what she wants to achievewhen she meets with her employer and what sheneeds to say to effectively state her case. Somepeople nd it helpful to rehearse their presenta-tions in front of a trusted friend or family memberwho is willing to give honest feedback. This willhelp to make sure that important details are in-cluded and extraneous details are pruned from thepresentation. Accommodations An accommodation in this context is a request tomodify the work environment or the circum-stances under which a job is being performed.Generally speaking, these accommodations focuson physical demands of the job that the womancannot currently perform, such as lifting, standingfor extended periods of time, exposure to certainchemicals or temperatures, and so forth. Accom-modations may also involve a change in schedule,the ability to eat or drink more frequentlythroughout the day, taking breaks to elevate thefeet, the wearing of a fetal monitor, a temporarytransfer to another department or duty, and soforth. If a woman is pregnant, Tara Mah sharesthe following potential risks to a fetus in a typicalpractice: Radiation exposure Exposure to hazardous chemicals/drugs (e.g.,pesticides, hormones, chemotherapeuticagents, etc.) Exposure to anesthetic gases, especially dur-ing \"hard-to-scavenge\" procedures such asmasking, and waste anesthetic gases Exposure to infectious or zoonotic diseases,especially when handling fractious animals(e.g., rabies, tetanus, leptospirosis, chlamydiosis, etc.) Overexertion associated with lifting/re-straining patients 3 Presenting the Case The employee should then schedule a meetingwith her employer to be held in a private place,preferably when no time crunch exists for theemployee or employer. It can be helpful to bringnotes of key points to be made, and it is importantto present any documentation provided by medicalpersonnel in relation to the situation. It is alsoimportant for the employee to adopt the rightmindset before the meeting, \"detaching from theemotional impact of charged discussions withcareful preparation ahead of time...enter intothe discussion with an open mind, and the abilityto listen to the other party.\" 4 The woman should explain her point of view clearly, sharing specically what she is askingfrom her employer while not providing more infor-mation than is necessary. In the case of a medi-cal condition, this could serve as an openingstatement: \"Doctor Morton, I'm sharing this infor-mation because it's important for you to know.I have been diagnosed with overactive bladder andI am receiving treatment for the condition thatshould help alleviate symptoms but won't cure thecondition. I will need more frequent restroombreaks and it's possible that I may sometimesneed to briefly leave a meeting without muchnotice.\" For clearer communication, an employee should also give her employer specic requests in writing.If a situation is covered by state or federal laws,then the employer is required to participate in aninteractive process to make accommodations.Note that the employer can request reasonabledocumentation about a disability or limitation be-fore making accommodations, so the employeeshould be prepared to comply. An employee should listen carefully to the em- ployer's response and try to avoid being defensiveor argumentative. She should reframe any objec-tions to requests made and focus on the main goal:to negotiate a solution that is satisfactory to bothemployee and employer and that takes into ac-count any medical restrictions or other challengesinvolved in the particular situation. 3. Discussion This approach typically works well because of the ele-ments of careful preparation and clear communica-tion\u20142 key components of successful negotiations.By preparing herself by carefully reviewing the em-ployee handbook and applicable state and federal lawswhile gathering documentation and getting advicefrom medical and legal experts, a woman will have aclearer understanding of her rights. This helps her tocraft reasonable requests that can be formulated inconjunction with medical and legal professionals andempowers her to make a more condent presentation. Rehearsing the presentation in front of an appropri- ate test audience helps to identity its weaknesses andhone its strengths before the employee requests spe-cic accommodations and/or makes other requests.Choosing the right time and place is key, as is the rightmindset and the use of nondefensive communication.

Introduction Equine veterinarians can be faced with challenging cases that are outside the scope of their usual clinicalparadigm. Issues with breeding stallions oftentimesfall into this category, as breeding stallions are not acommon patient for many practicing veterinarians.This paper addresses three reproductive conditions of stallions that may require veterinary intervention.The accompanying interactive presentation willhighlight aspects of these topics through discussionof bona de cases. 2. Hemospermia Hemospermia refers to the presence of blood insemen. The amount of blood in the semen canvary from minute to large, with the amount ofblood giving some indication of the cause of thehemospermia. Blood-laden ejaculates are gener-ally detected easily by their pink to reddish tofrank red color. Less obvious contamination isdetected by microscopic analysis. A dispropor-tionately elevated ratio of neutrophils to erythro-cytes in semen or a brown or reddish brown semen color (often indicating presence of non-fresh blood)is suggestive of an internal genital infection, suchas that associated with seminal vesiculitis, epidid-ymitis, or orchitis. Stallions with overt blood in ejaculates have been reported to be highly subfertile to infertile 1,2; however, this is not always the case. For one Thoroughbred stallion breeding by natural cover, per-cycle preg-nancy rate was 67% (97/144) for covers with noblood in dismount semen and 64% (29/45) for covers in which the dismount semen contained blood. The following year, per-cycle no blood,slight blood, moderate blood, or extensive blood, re-spectively (D. Varner, personal observations). Thisdemonstrates that a certain amount of blood con-tamination of stallion ejaculates is compatible withgood fertility. Laboratory studies on the effect ofwhole blood on in vitro fertilizing capacity of bullsemen revealed that the presence of added blood had AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 257IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENT NOTESa negative effect as amounts of added blood in- creased from 0 to 1.5%.3 The effect of hemospermia on equine sperm qual- ity or fertility following cooled storage has not beencritically studied. When blood-contaminated se-men of one stallion was mixed with an extenderprior to articial insemination, a high pregnancyrate was achieved. 4Pregnancy rate was also not hindered for one stallion with frank blood in semenwhen extender was placed in receptacle of articialvagina prior to semen collection (T. Blanchard, per-sonal communication, 2015). There are many causes of hemospermia, but the condition is generally related to lacerations/abra-sions on the exterior penis or urethral process, ure-thral defects (rents), or infection/inflammation of the prepuce, penis, urethra, accessory genitalglands, epididymides, identied more frequently in geldings than stallions.6,7This is likely due, in large part, to the fact that most male horses arecastrated; and that geldings may accumulate moresmegma in the prepuce than actively breeding stal-lions. Smegma has been found to have carcino-genic properties. 8,9Although the glans penis, penile body, and prepuce are the most common sitesfor male genital SCC, primary SCC involvement ofthe urethral process resulting in hemospermia hasbeen reported. 10There has been a flurry of re- search in recent years on the pathogenesis and re-lationship between equine penile of penile and preputial theselesions vary from smooth raised hyperplasic plaquesto wart-like growths to irregular masses with ulcer-ation and secondary bacterial infection. Using mo-lecular techniques, the equine papilloma virus,EcPV2, has been found in all three in the region of the ejaculatory ducts has been described as a commonetiology for hemospermia, 1this cause may have been misdiagnosed. Habronema-induced granulo- mas of the urethral process (cutaneous habronemi-asis) were once a relatively common cause ofhemospermia, but their prevalence has reduced con-siderably in the past three decades, probably owingto the widespread use of ivermectin and, more re-cently, moxidectin, as parasiticides. The most common cause of profuse contamination of semen with blood is an idiopathic urethral defect(or rent) that communicates with the surroundingcorpus spongiosum penis. 13,14The defect is gener- ally associated with hematuria in geldings, but thepresenting complaint is generally profound hemo-spermia in stallions. Bleeding is profuse becausethe lesion communicates with the underlying corpusspongiosum penis. As such, bleeding typically oc-curs at full erection, when the glans penis andcommunicating corpus spongiosum penis (whichsurrounds the urethra) are fully engorged. Meanpeak pressure in the corpus spongiosum penis at thetime of coital ejaculation in a pony stallion is re-ported to be 762 mm Hg, compared with 17 mm Hgduring the quiescent state. 15The lesion(s) is (are) typically small (2-5 mm in length) and is (are) arealmost always located on the posterior surface of theurethra near the pelvic ischium. Diagnosis of hemospermia begins with an assess- ment of the quantity of blood in the semen given thatminute amounts of blood are oftentimes associatedwith abrasions or small lacerations on the surface ofthe penis. The penis should be visually inspectedand palpated, paying particular attention to the dis-tal end of the penis, including the urethral processand the fossa glandis. Lesions within the dorsalurethral sinus or the ventrolateral bedifcult to detect. Within the fossa glandis, urethral sinus seems to ofejaculation. To aid visualization of the fossa glandis, the penis can be rmly grasped at the time of stallion dis-mount from a mare or breeding dummy immediatelyfollowing ejaculation to maintain distension of theglans penis. This will allow easier visual and dig-ital examinations of the fossa glandis. The areacan also be balloted with a paper towel to removeany standing blood so that the origin of any bleedingcan be more easily recognized. Maintaining en-gorgement of the penis with digital pressure follow-ing ejaculation will also allow for better inspection ofthe surface of the glans penis for bleeding lesions. If profound hemospermia is detected and of ure- thral origin, then a urethral defect is a likely causeand should be included at the top of the list ofdifferential diagnoses. If the blood contains a dis-proportionately large number of neutrophils, thenseminal vesiculitis is a likely cause. Diagnosis ofeither of these conditions is best achieved using ure-thral endoscopy. The method for performing thisexamination was reported previously. 16 Treatment of the hemospermia is dependent on the underlying diagnosis. Surface lesions on thepenile shaft can often be treated with locally appliedemollient and sexual rest. Lesions that penetrateinto underlying cavernous spaces, such as those oc-curring with use of wire brushes to curb masturba-tion, may require surgical closure. Lesions withinthe fossa glandis can be difcult to treat. Surgicalablation of the dorsal urethral sinus has been at-tempted experimentally (J. Schumacher, personnelcommunication, 2014), but the effects of this surgery 258 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTon mating ability or ejaculatory bleeding have not been investigated. A stallion with refractory SCCinvolving the fossa glandis has been treated of bleomycin in con-junction with electrotherapy to improve drugpermeability (G. Kelly, personal communication,2014). Although outcomes have been variable formore generalized penile tumors, both nonsurgicaland surgical interventions have been attempted.Topical application of 5% 5-flurouracil (at 14-dayintervals), with or without surgical debridement, fortreatment of SCC of the external genitalia of stal-lions has been reported to be successful, 17as has intralesional injection of cisplatin.18Electropulsa- tion methods might ofless cell-permeable drugs such asbleomycin or cisplatin, but additional studies inhorses are required to determine effectiveness.Electrochemotherapy has proved to be advanta-geous in several species. 19The possible long-term negative effect of some cytotoxic chemotherapeuticagents on spermatogenesis must be considered be-fore implementing this form of therapy. 20 Surgical approaches are the best way to treat de- fects (rents) of the pelvic urethra, as sexual absti-nence alone, even when prolonged, is generallyunsuccessful. Subischial urethrotomy can be usedas a corrective measure, as subischial corpusspongiotomy (subischial incision that extends intothe corpus spongiosum penis but does not enter theurethral lumen). 13Either of these methods is thought to allow mucosal healing by preventing es-cape of cavernous blood through the urethral defectat the time of micturition. With these surgeries, aminimum of 60 days of postsurgical sexual rest isgenerally recommended prior to recommencement ofbreeding activities. Three refractory cases weretreated in our hospital (Texas A&M University) byprimary closure of the defect through a subanal sur-gical approach combined with urethral endoscopy toreadily identify the defect and monitor its surgicalclosure. Surgical correction was successful in allthree cases. Buccal mucosal urethroplasty was re-ported to be successful for treatment of hemosper-mia in one stallion with a urethral defect, but thesurgical approach included a subischial urethrot-omy. 21Others have reported excellent results with laser treatment in combination with subischial cor-pus spongiotomy; however, the value of laser as aprimary treatment for urethral defects remainsopen to question. 22Others have reported that en- doscope-directed laser tissue soldering is an effec-tive technique for surgical repair of hypospadias inhumans. 23 Seminal vesiculitis can be difcult to treat suc- cessfully, but it seems to be most effectively treatedwith voluminous lavage of the affected vesicularglands via an endoscopic approach, followed by in-stillation of antibiotics that are appropriate for theoffending etiologic agent. Subsequent massage ofthe vesicular glands per rectum may aid in distrib-uting the antibiotic within the glandular luminae.The procedure can be repeated daily for 5-7 days.Care should be taken to avoid use of antimicrobialdrugs that are caustic to mucosal tissues. Systemicadministration of antimicrobials is oftentimesunsuccessful because of inability of many of these togain access into the accessory genital glands. Thoseantimicrobials with high lipid solubility, high pKa(i.e., reduced tendency for proton dissociation), andlow protein-binding capacities are reported to dif-fuse most effectively into the accessory genitalglands. Fluoroquinolones reportedly meet thesecriteria, with good resulting concentrations in acces-sory gland fluids of rats, dogs, men, and horses 24-27; however, treatment of one stallion with systemicenrofloxacin did not correct the chromic seminal ve-siculitis long term. In men, incorporation of spe-cic oral nutritional supplements (saw palmettoextract, bearberry extract, and Lactobacillus sporo- genes) with systemic fluoroquinolone treatment im-proved elimination and recurrence rates of bacterialprostatitis, compared with fluoroquinolone treat-ment alone. 26 3. Poor Sperm Quality (Teratozoospermia, Necrozoospermia, Oligospermia) The equine breeding industry abounds with stal- lions with reduced semen quality, primarily owingto the fact that stallions typically become sires basedon their pedigree, performance record, and confor-mation rather than reproductive health. In addi-tion, many sires remain sexually active as theybecome aged, and such stallions tend to developage-related deterioration in testicular/epididymalfunction. As such, veterinary intervention andmore intensive reproductive management areneeded to maximize the fertility of these stallions. Poor semen quality generally presents itself in the form of oligospermia (reduced sperm number in se-men), necrozoospermia (elevated percentage of deador motionless sperm in semen), and/or teratozoo-spermia (elevated percentage of malformed sperm insemen). Logically, stallions that are affected byone condition oftentimes are affected by all threeconditions. Diagnosis is based on collection and microscopic analysis of semen. An important component of abreeding soundness examination is to determine thenumber of sperm produced by a stallion at dailysperm output (DSO). This entails depleting ex-tragonadal sperm reserves (by collection of semenfor 5-7 consecutive days) before determining actualDSO. 28Furthermore, measurement of testicular volume allows one to predict DSO.29-31Efciency of testicular function can then be determined usingthe following formula: (actual DSO/predictedDSO) /H11003100. Lowered spermatogenic efciency is indicative of a disruption in spermatogenesis and isassociated with reduced sperm output. 32,33This condition can be temporary if the underlying causecan be identied and eliminated. It can also be AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 259IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTpermanent, as is the case with age-related testicular degeneration, where reduced spermatogenic ef-ciency is an early change in the progression of thedisorder. 34It is can be coincident with a reduction in the percentages of morphologically normal andprogressively motile sperm. Total sperm number is determined as the product of gel-free semen volume and sperm concentration.To maximize sperm contained in the gel-free semen,semen should be collected in a receptacle that istted with a nylon-micromesh lter, as this type oflter will effectively separate gel from gel-free se-men, and will reduce loss of sperm within the lter.The most accurate method of estimating semen vol-ume is by weight (1 g /H110151 mL). Sperm concentra- tion is typically determined with a hemacytometercounting chamber, spectrophotometrically, or with asemiautomated fluorescence-based sperm counter. Reduced sperm motility can imply a reduction in the percentage of motile sperm, the percentage ofprogressively motile sperm, or the average spermvelocity. For objectivity, this analysis is best per-formed using a computerized sperm motility ana-lyzer. If unavailable, a phase-contrast microscopeequipped with a warming stage can be used forsubjective analysis, with the magnication set at200-400/H11003. For most accurate assessment of pro-gressive motility, the sample should be diluted withextender sufciently (i.e., to 30 /H1100310 6sperm/mL) so that one can more critically assess motion charac-teristics of individual sperm. As an adjunct to as-sessment of sperm motility, examination of spermmembrane intactness (a measure of sperm viability)can yield valuable information regarding spermfunction. 35,36One study revealed that sperm \"via- bility\" may be a more accurate predictor of the fer-tility of cool-stored semen than sperm motility. 37 Automated analysis of equine sperm morphology is unreliable, in the author's experience, but vividimages of sperm can be viewed using differentialinterference contrast microscopy at magnication of1000-1500/H11003. Such specimens are examined as awet mount after xation of sperm in buffered formolsaline. 38Phase contrast microscopy can be used if differential interference contrast optics are unavail-able. The authors consider either method to besuperior to microscopic examination of stained dry-mounted specimens. A minimum of 100 sperm areevaluated, and the incidence of each type of morpho-logic defect is recorded. The sperm defects that arethe most signicant predictors of fertility are normalsperm (positively correlated with fertility) and ab-normally shaped heads, detached heads, generalmid-piece abnormalities, coiled tails, and prematuregerm cells (negatively correlated with fertility). 39 The etiology of oligospermia, necrozoospermia, and/or teratozoospermia is variable. Testiculardysfunction is a leading cause of these clinical nd-ings. Although testicular dysfunction can be ge-netic, environmental causes are possible and includethose associated with various medications and con-ditions that cause an increase in scrotal tempera-ture (including an increase in body temperature).Age-related testicular dysfunction also results in aprogression of reproductive changes, beginning witha reduction in spermatogenic efciency and thenumber of morphologically normal, progressivelymotile sperm in ejaculates. These clinical changesgenerally occur prior to a marked decline in testic-ular volume in association with age-related testicu-lar dysfunction. 34 One relatively common cause of oligospermia, necrozoospermia, and teratozoospermia is a condi-tion called spermiostasis, or plugged ampullae.These stallions are sometimes referred to as spermaccumulators. With this pathologic state, spermtend to accumulate in the extragonadal ducts, pri-marily in the ductus deferens and glandular ampul-lae in the terminal segments of the ductus deferens.The condition occurs following extended periods ofsexual abstinence, and can affect sexually maturestallions of any age. Stallions with the conditionare more likely than the general stallion population tohave issues with recurrence. Although spermiostasiscan result in necrozoospermia and teratozoosper-mia, in the presence of extraordinarily high spermoutput, ductal blockage oftentimes results in con-current oligospermia, or occasionally, azoosper-mia (no sperm in ejaculates). A pathognomonicnding of severe cases is a high percentage ofdetached heads (tailless heads) in the ejaculate.High percentages of hairpin bent tails and/or distalprotoplasmic droplets are oftentimes indicative ofstagnant sperm in the extragonadal ducts and repre-sent a propensity for more pronounced clinical signssuch as oligospermia, a high incidence of detachedheads, or even complete ductal blockage if the stallionis not subjected to increased breeding frequency.Diagnosis is based on assessment of the ejaculate, incombination with transrectal palpation/ultrasono-graphic evaluation of the Degenerating sperm may be ejaculated in numerousclumps (or casts). These can be missed if an in-line gel lter is discarded before its contents are per reproductively nor-mal is quite variable (16.3 /H110063.6 mm) and the lumen can contain a small amount of echolucentfluid. 43The luminal can increase ducts, which can be visualized ul-trasonographically at the terminations of the am-pullae within the colliculus seminalis. 45 Treatment strategies for reduced semen quality are dependent on the underlying causes and therules and regulations of the breed registry involved. 260 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTAlthough stallions subjected to only natural cover conditions cannot benet from many laboratorytechniques that would likely improve their breedingperformance, one can still implement methods tocritically assess their fertility and devise strategiesto enhance their reproductive potential. 46An ex- ample is the use of \"reinforcement breeding\" to im-prove the fertility of stallions afflicted witholigospermia, necrozoospermia, and/or teratozoo-spermia. 47,48The technique involves collection of semen from the penis immediately upon dismount ofa stallion from a mare following an ejaculatory mat-ing. The protocol recommended by the authors is tomaintain the dismount semen sample at body tem-perature, strain it through a lter to remove extra-neous debris, and then mix the ltered semen with asmall volume (5-10 mL) of warmed good-qualitysemen extender. The extended semen is thenloaded into an all-plastic syringe and the lled sy-ringe is afxed to a standard insemination pipet.Covered mares are immediately placed in stocks andthe perineal area is prepared for insemination of theextended dismount semen sample. As the pipetand hand course through vagina, any fluids grosslyfree of urine or blood are also aspirated into thepipet, and then the contents are discharged into theuterine body. Approval of articial insemination by most horse registries has resulted in commercial application ofa multitude of assisted reproductive technologies tomaximize the reproductive efciency of stallions.Centrifugation of semen is a central component ofimproving the fertility of some stallions. One typeof centrifugation process (cushioned centrifugation)can be used to simply remove or reduce seminalplasma contribution to semen or to increase spermconcentration. This technique is typically usedwhen sperm concentration in semen is low (i.e., /H11021 100-125 /H1100310 6/mL) or when seminal plasma is known to possess factors that are deleterious tosperm. Another type of centrifugation process in-volves centrifugation of semen through a densitygradient (e.g., a silica particle solution) in an effortto enhance sperm quality prior to insemination. 48 Cushioned centrifugation of semen has generally replaced traditional centrifugation because this pro-cedure maximizes sperm harvest without associatedsperm injury. 49,50Investigations regarding centrifugation of stallion semen with the prod-uct, iodixanol, have demonstrated excellent yields ofsperm with no detectable damage from the centrif-ugation process. Centrifugation can be performedusing either plastic conical-bottom tubes or glassnipple-bottom tubes. The nipple-bottom tubes arerecommended over conical-bottom tubes forcushioned centrifugation when sperm number inejaculates is relatively low (e.g., /H110212/H1100310 9sperm), or when it is necessary to separate more seminalplasma from sperm following centrifugation than ispossible with cushioned centrifugation in conical-bottom tubes.Centrifugation of equine semen through a silica- particle solution has shown promise for \"selecting\"sperm with good motility, morphology, and chroma-tin quality, and enhancing the fertility of selectedsubfertile stallions. 48,51Given that this technique results in sperm separation based on sperm buoy-ancy or isopynic point, its use is most justied whenan ejaculate contains a high percentage of spermwith specically sperm withabnormal heads, abnormal midpieces, bent mid-pieces, bent tails, coiled tails, or premature (round)germ cells. However, the technique will also im-prove chromatin quality in the recovered sperm pop-ulation, regardless of sperm morphologic prole. When processing semen by centrifugation through a density gradient, the resulting sperm pellet mayonly contain a relatively small percentage of thesperm originally in the ejaculate. As such, insem-ination doses may contain low sperm numbers and alow insemination volume. The threshold numberof sperm that can be used to inseminate mares andyield a commercially acceptable pregnancy rate isnot known, but this number is certainly affected bythe fertility of a given stallion, and by the semenprocessing method that is applied prior to insemina-tion. Using customary methods, mares are typi-cally inseminated with 200 to 500 /H1100310 6 progressively motile sperm deposited directly intothe lumen of the uterine body when fresh semen isused. One study revealed no difference betweeninsemination doses of 50 or 300 /H1100310 6progressively motile fresh sperm from selected stallions.52How- ever, high pregnancy rates can be achieved with amuch lower inseminate number when low-dose in-semination strategies are used. In one study usinglow-dose insemination, pregnancy rate was high in astallion when only 1 /H1100310 6total sperm were used for insemination.53 Treatment of spermiostasis (plugged ampullae) can take several forms. Increased ejaculatory frequencymay, by itself, correct the problem. Administration ofoxytocin (20-40 U, IV) at 2 to 15 minutes prior tosemen collection attempts, or cloprostenol (125-250 /H9262g, IV) at 15-60 minutes prior to semen collection attempts, may aid further in resolving the problem.In addition, manual massage of the ampullae prior to semen collection attempts can aid in dislodging thesperm occlusion(s). 41The author (D.V.) had one refractory case that did not respond to the treat-ments listed above, but the occlusions were subse-quently dislodged when breeding the stallionimmediately following administration of phenyleph-rine (20 mg in 600 mL saline, IV, /H110225 min). 4. Scrotal Enlargement scrotal in sexu-ally stallions is ranging from bluntscrotal trauma, to orchitis/epididymitis, to testicularor scrotal area tumors to hydrocele to inguinal/scro-tal herniation. Diagnosis is based on visual inspec-tion of the scrotum and digital and ultasonographic AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 261IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE TO TREATMENTexamination of the scrotal contents. Transrectal palpation and ultrasound examination of the inter-nal inguinal rings also aids in identication of in-guinal herniation. Blunt scrotal trauma is often the result of a breed- ing incident, most commonly from a mare kick at thetime of natural mating. Scrotal contusions and lac-erations also occur when stallions unsuccessfullyhurdle fences or similar barriers. Blunt trauma tothe scrotum can produce an array of local distur-bances, including edema, dartos or scrotalhemorrhage, hematocele (blood or rupture of the tunicaalbuginea, which encapsulates each testis. Any lo-cal trauma may incite bilateral scrotal and preputialedema. Secondary bacterial infection is possible,especially when the skin is broken by lacerations orpuncture wounds. Initial examination of the scro-tal area may require animal sedation and physicalrestraint, as the area usually is quite painful. Phe-nothiazine tranquilizers should be avoided becauseof their propensity to induce penile paralysis or pri-apism. The scrotal surface should be examinedthoroughly for injuries, including abrasions, lacera-tions, puncture wounds, and foreign bodies, such asthorns. The scrotal contents should be evaluatednext. If the testes and attached epididymides arereadily palpable, with scrotal dartos hemorrhage, or he-matocele, but originates in the (es), as withorchitis. Conversely, inability to manually denethe testes and epididymides or theinvolved testis epididymis because ofextreme hemorrhage is edema testicular origin. examinationof an enlarged scrotum may help establish the un-derlying cause. Fresh blood that accumulates inthe vaginal cavity (i.e., hematocele) or scrotal walltypically has a homogenous anechoic appearance,even if freshly clotted. Conversely, a thickenedscrotal wall resulting from edema usually has amore heterogeneous pattern. Needle aspiration ofthe contents of the vaginal cavity helps with thediagnosis, if hematocele is suspected. It is manda-tory, however, that the external and internal ingui-nal rings rst be palpated thoroughly to ensure thatthe scrotal swelling is not associated with a scrotalhernia. The needle-aspiration technique should beperformed aseptically, and care should be taken toavoid laceration of vessels. Torsion of a spermaticcord also should be included in the differential diag-nosis of acute scrotal swelling. Intrascrotal hemorrhage, whether from the scro- tal wall, cord, or testis, becomes organizedto form brous tissue. Fibrin deposition in thescrotal fascia and vaginal cavity leads to adhesionsand immobilization of the associated testis. Thebrous tissue can also interfere permanently withthermoregulation of the especiallywhen it envelops the testis. Degeneration of theseminiferous testicularatrophy a result. Persistent scrotal edema alsocan promote tissue brosis; however, if arrested inthe acute phase, edema generally subsides withoutthis complication. Another consequence of uncor-rected edema is local hypoxia and cellular under-nourishment, causing cell death and sloughing ofscrotal tissues. Bacterial- or viral-induced forms of orchitis are rare in stallions. Local bacterial invasion of thetestes can be secondary to infectious peritonitis (viathe inguinal canal) or, more commonly, penetratingwounds of the scrotum. Retrograde transmission ofbacteria to the testes is rare, but can occur via theextragonadal ducts (e.g., an extension of seminalvesiculitis) and is associated with ipsilateral epidid-ymitis. Affected testes are hot, tense, slightly swol-len, and acutely painful. Testicular enlargement,due to orchitis. Testicular neoplasia of stallions is uncommon, but its actual incidence cannot be measured becausemost male horses are castrated when young. Tes-ticular tumors tend to be diagnosed more frequentlyin younger men (average age, 30 y). 54Interest- ingly, the spectrum of testicular tumors varies withthe age at which they develop in humans. Futher-more, teratomas are generally benign in boys andmalignant on older men. 55Primary testicular neo- plasms as origin. 56Germinal neo- plasms originate from germ cells of seminomas, embryonal car-cinomas, teratomas, and yolk Nonger-minal tumors include Leydig cell tumors and Sertolicell tumors. Secondary tumors include leiomyo-mas, leiomyosarcomas, mast cell tumors, bromas,and lipomas. A mixed testicular tumor (sex cord-stromal tumor with elements of Sertoli cells andLeydig cells) in a stallion has also been described. 57 In horses, seminomas are one of the most com- monly reported tumors. They have been describedin retained and scrotal testes and are more fre-quently diagnosed in older stallions. These tumorsare locally invasive, and progressive testicular en-largement occurs because of the sheets of neoplasticcells that gradually replace normal testicular paren-chyma. Occasionally, the tumor breaches the tu-nica albuginea and spreads to adjacent tissues.Widespread metastasis of seminomas to the thoracicand abdominal cavities has reported. 58,59 262 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTTeratomas can occur anywhere in the body, but are most frequently located in the gonads in horses, and have been identied in foals as young as 3 daysof age. 60They are classied as germinal tumors, as they are derived from pluripotential germ cells.In horses, teratomas are benign, but malignant tera-tomas (also termed teratocarcinomas) have beenreported. 61 Leydig cell tumors (also termed interstitial-cell tumors) are relatively common in dogs and bulls(especially the Guernsey breed), but are rare in stal-lions. 62This tumor type is generally benign, has been associated with undescended testes,63but can be associated with scrotal swelling and pain in de-scended testes. 64 Sertoli cell tumors arise of the seminiferous epithelium (Sertoli or sus-tentacular cells). This tumor type is rare installions and is generally benign; however, a malig-nant Sertoli cell tumor with metastasis to the lungs,has been described. 65 The risk factors associated with testicular tumors of stallions are poorly understood. Predilectionshave been identied in men and include certainoccupational and environmental exposures. 66In addition, genome-wide association studies have pro-vided some likely genetic mechanisms involved intesticular oncogenesis. 67Antigen expression has also been used for investigating early testicular tu-morogenesis in humans. 68In stallions, retained testes probably have increased risk for develop-ment of seminomas, teratomas, or Leydig cell tu-mors, but genetic testing and molecular probes forearly diagnosis have not been reported. Hydrocele refers to an abnormal collection of fluid between the visceral and parietal layers of the tu-nica vaginalis. The condition can accompany in-flammatory or noninflammatory types of scrotaledema and can also arise without concurrent scrotaledema. The vaginal cavity communicates with theperitioneal cavity, so abdominal fluid can transferinto the vaginal cavity, as seen in some cases ofascites. Local lymphedema has also been postu-lated to contribute to hydrocele. 62The fluid char- acter is usually serous, suggesting that it may occurin response to trauma to the visceral or parietalvaginal tunics. 69Uncomplicated hydroceles can also develop, acutely or insidiously, without an ap-parent cause. Disruptions of the secretory/absorp-tive functions of the tunica vaginalis are thought tocause noninfectious primary hydrocele. The condi-tion can be unilateral or bilateral, and temporary orpermanent. Hydroceles can occur in hot weatherconditions, resolving when the ambient temperaturedecreases. Initial diagnosis is based on palpationof the scrotal contents. When the condition is pro-nounced, the enclosed testis and epididymis may notbe easily palpable, but tend to remain freely mov-able within the scrotum. Ultrasonographic is based on aseptic needle aspiration of fluidfrom the vaginal cavity, and the volume may rangefrom 10 mL to greater than 1 L. Care should betaken to maintain asepsis and to avoid puncture ofthe testis or epididymis during this procedure. Inguinal/scrotal herniation involves protrusion of abdominal viscera, usually intothe inguinal canal or scrotum. Most inguinal/scro-tal hernias are indirect, i.e., they protrude throughthe vaginal ring into the vaginal cavity. Occasion-ally, indirect hernias may occur, where viscera rup-ture through the parietal tunic lie partiallyoutside the vaginal cavity. Inguinal or scrotal her-nias occur almost exclusively in intact males. Theycan be present at birth or develop soon after birth asa result of congenitally large vaginal rings. Ac-quired hernias may result from increased intra-ab-dominal pressure or alteration of the architecture ofthe inguinal canal, and predisposing conditions mayinclude exercise or breeding. In some horses, thesize of the vaginal ring seems to have no influence ondevelopment of the hernia. 70Acquired inguinal/ scrotal hernias are most commonly attended bysigns of acute abdominal pain, and should be con-sidered in stallions exhibiting such signs. If thehernia is inguinal, percutaneous palpation of theherniated viscera may not be possible, but ultra-sound examination may reveal the presence of in-testine. Palpation per rectum will generally allowconrmation for the diagnosis by identication ofviscera entering the vaginal ring. Strangulation ofhernia contents is likely, and immediate correctiveaction is required. Torsion of the spermatic cord refers to rotation of the spermatic cord about its longitudinal axis.Often, the condition is inappropriately called testic-ular torsion. Although only observed occasionallyin stallions, it occurs more commonly than in otherlarge domestic animals, probably because the longaxis of the testes is positioned horizontally in theequine scrotum. Torsions usually occur in de-scended testes, either unilaterally or bilaterally, andcan be transient or permanent. Chronic recurringspermatic cord torsions are also possible. Mostspermatic cord torsions range from 180 to 360 de-grees, but more pronounced torsions can occur.Clinical signs depend on the severity of the torsion.In most instances, 180-degree torsions are subclini-cal and found incidentally during examination of theexternal genital organs. In such cases, the torsionis usually not associated with pain, and semen ab-normalities are not present. In some stallions, thetorsion may only be transient. Infrequently, stal-lions with torsion of the spermatic corddisplay mild intermittent scrotal pain that becomesmost pronounced during athletic activity. Sper-matic cord torsions up to 180 degrees probably donot produce local circulatory disturbances and so aregenerally considered of minor consequence. A 270-degree torsion of the spermatic cord was reported toresult in preputial/scrotal edema in even AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 263IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS was not evident.71A 360- degree spermatic causes from localedema and hemorrhage from severe vascular com-promise. Unrelenting signs of colic and a stiltedgait may be evident. Typically this type of torsionis unilateral and permanent; however, temporarytorsions are possible and can result in recurrentattacks. Factors predisposing to spermatic cordtorsion are poorly understood. Elongation of thecaudal ligament of the epididymis or proper liga-ment of the testis and/or an excessively long mesor-chium reportedly spermatic torsion can be the vaginal tunic) (including the parietal vaginal tunic). Diagnosis of 180-degree torsion is relatively easy and based on identifying the location of the bulbouscauda epididymis and caudal ligament of the epidid-ymis within the scrotum. The caudal ligament ofthe epididymis is a remnant of the gubernaculumtestis. It typically remains as a small brous struc-ture attached to the cauda epididymis, and is gen-erally palpable through the scrotal wall. Undernormal circumstances, these structures are locatedon the caudal pole of the testis. Their presence inthe scrotum, with no attendant clinicalsigns, indicates a of the sper-matic cord. With a 360-degree torsion of the sper-matic cord, the cauda epididymis of the epididymis are palpated difcult asscrotal edema and swelling progress. A diagnosis of the spermaticcord is inguinal/scrotal herniation. Examination ofthe suspect vaginal ring by palpation per rectumhelps differentiate these conditions. Treatment strategies for an enlarged scrotum are dependent on the underlying cause. Treatment ofacute scrotal trauma initially is aimed at controllinglocal inflammation, edema and hematoma forma-tion. Gentle cold-water irrigation of the site is animportant, yet inexpensive, corrective action. Coldapplication sessions should not exceed 20 minutesand should be applied at 3- to 4-hour intervals.Local blood flow is reduced by using this cold appli-cation strategy, thus minimizing tissue edema andhemorrhage. Short-term topical cold applicationoffers benecial cooling effects that can last up toseveral hours, and also provides a degree of analge-sia. However, continuous application of cold tem-perature can actually increase local blood flow andlymphatic permeability. These changes can negatethe benecial effects. Cold water sprays are notrecommended given that they can cause additionalskin damage if tissue has been compromised. Sys-temic anti-inflammatory and diuretic medicationsare useful controllinginflammation and edema. Prophylactic antibiotictherapy also should be instituted to prevent second-ary infection. A tetanus toxoid booster is recom-mended if the horse has not been vaccinated againsttetanus within the past year. Emollients should beapplied to intermittently to hem-orrhage leads to the insulating effect of secondary brous tissueformation. To save the compromised testis, surgi-cal removal of the organized blood clot can be at-tempted 4-7 days after injury, but the prognosis forthe affected test is quite guarded. If the conditionis chronic, with pronounced atrophy of the ipsilat-eral testis, the affected testis could be removed sur-gically, along with any attendant brotic tissue.This may promote some compensatory hypertrophy(and increased sperm production) of the remainingtestis. 73Scrotal lacerations generally incite marked tissue swelling. Such wounds should becleaned thoroughly then treated locally to controlbacterial infection and progressive cellulitis. Lac-erations in this tissue generally do not heal by rstintention because of pronounced tissue compromiseand swelling. Nonetheless, wound closure is gen-erally indicated to cover exposed testes and theirtunics. When lacerated, the parietal vaginal tunicshould be sutured after thoroughly cleansing thevaginal cavity with balanced salt solution contain-ing antibiotics. Surgical debridement of subcuta-neous tissues should be skin closurewith nonreactive material.If a seroma forms in the subcutaneous tissue, drain-age should be established. Although targeted treatment of testicular tumors has been attempted to prolong the breeding life ofselected stallions with bilateral involvement,prompt orchiectomy is the primary treatment for alltesticular neoplasms, regardless of type. Ownersmust be advised if the neoplasm is potentially ma-lignant. As a precautionary measure, radical re-moval of the attached spermatic cord is advised andthe excised spermatic cord should be his-tologically for metastatic lesions. Rad-ical scrotal ablation should accompany orchiectomyif the tumor has invaded peritesticular tissues.Excision of adjacent lymphatic chains is indicated ifmetastasis is suspected. Chemotherapy is used inconjunction with surgery to treat men with meta-static testicular tumors, but this therapeutic strat-egy has not been perfected in the horse. Treatment of hydrocele is aimed at removing the underlying cause of the hydrocele, if it can be iden-tied. Hydroceles associated with some underlyingconditions, (e.g., infectious conditions, ascites, ormalnutrition) may take some time to resolve. Thefluid can be removed by aseptic needle aspiration.Exercise may help control fluid accumulation insome cases; yet improvement may only be transient.Fluid usually reaccumulates when drained from thevaginal cavity unless an inciting factor for the hy-drocele is identied and corrected. Mild cases of 264 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENThydrocele may not adversely affect fertility,74but accumulation of a signicant volume of fluid cancause heat-induced testicular degeneration. If apersistent hydrocele is the affected testis and surrounding tunics mayprevent/correct thermal injury to the contralateraltestis. Treatment of inguinal/scrotal hernias in newborn foals can oftentimes be corrected simply by applica-tion of a diaper\" with the foal area of exter-nal inguinal rings packed with cotton pledgets.Care should be taken to prevent occlusion of theanus, preputial orice, or penile urethra. The dia-per can be replaced at weekly intervals until thehernia is corrected. The external inguinal ringsshould be palpated intermittently under the diapereach day to ensure that herniation has not recurred.In foals, surgical intervention is generally notrequired. For acquired inguinal/scrotal hernias in adult stallions, surgical correction almostalways indicated. Retraction of entrapped visceraper rectum has been successfully performed in iso-lated cases where it was thought that the involvedintestine was uncompromised. 75,76This method has potential complications such as damage to therectum or entrapped viscera, lack of informationregarding degree of intestinal compromise, and her-nia recurrence rate after nonsurgical reduction hasnot been reported. Surgical reduction of the herniais indicated if manual reduction fails, if there isevidence of enlarged or damaged vaginal rings, or ifinfarction of the entrapped viscera is suspected.To surgically reduce herniated intestine, the stallionis placed in dorsal recumbency under general anes-thesia, and prepared for both and for celiotomy at the ventral midline. cutaneous incision over the ipsilat-eral supercial inguinal ring, the herniated intes-tine can be surgically exposed, evaluated forviability, and reduced through the vaginal ring intothe abdomen. Reduction of incarcerated bowel mayrequire manual traction through the ventral midlineceliotomy, and may also require surgical enlarge-ment of the vaginal ring. Resection and anastomo-sis of devitalized intestine can sometimes beaccomplished at the inguinal incision, but this pro-cedure is generally accomplished more easily withexterioration of affected intestine through the mid-line celiotomy site. Partial closure of the externalinguinal ring can be attempted if retention of theipsilateral testis is preferred; however, the testiscould be compromised by this procedure. As such,unilateral orchiectomy and complete closure of theexternal inguinal the best op-tion. Laparoscopic hasbeen performed successfully 76 Treatment of 180-degree spermatic cord torsions is generally not necessary given that the conditionusually does not interfere with reproductive or ath-letic performance. If necessary, orchiopexy can beperformed with the horse under general anesthesia.The spermatic cord torsion is reduced manually, andthen a small skin incision is made in the scrotumover the intended site of the epididymal tail. If thetorsion is judged to be intravaginal, an incision ismade in the underlying parietal tunic. The properligament of the testis is exposed through the the torsion be 360-degree (or greater) spermatic cord torsion is considered to be a surgical emergency. Unilateralcastration is generally recommended, as the affectedtestis is rarely salvageable. The spermatic cord isligated and transected proximal to the site of tor-sion. Early diagnosis and treatment are impera-tive if the affected testis is to be saved. Studies ofaffected men indicate that permanent testiculardamage is likely unless spermatic cord torsion iscorrected within a few hours of occurrence. 78-80 An early experimental study suggested that uni- lateral spermatic cord torsion can damage spermproduced in testis by an immuno-logic mechanism whereby anti-sperm antibodieswere produced to sperm liberated from the ischemictestis. 81More recently, other humoral and cellular immune-mediated factors have also been shown tobe involved in damage to the contralateral testis 82 Others have reported that ischemia-reperfusion in-jury leads to extension of the original tissue lesion tothe contralateral testis primarily though generationof reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.

I. The Enlarged Ovary 1. Introduction A mare is considered \"normal\" if she has regular estrous cycles, conceives, carries the foal to term,undergoes parturition, raises the foal, and continuesto have regular estrous cycles. When any of theseprocesses are associated with pathologic conditions,infertility may ensue. This article addresses com-mon pathologic conditions that may disrupt theseprocesses and require veterinary intervention. 2. The Enlarged Ovary Normal ovarian function is essential for fertility andreproductive efciency. Any ovarian disorder orpathology that disrupts the estrous cycle causes lossof time and the potential for pregnancy. Ovarianenlargement has been identied in barren, preg-nant, and maiden mares during routine reproduc-tive exams as well as in mares that present foranestrus, behavioral abnormalities, and colic. Ovarian enlargement is usually a unilateral con- dition that can can aid differentiating thesedisorders. 3 3. Ovarian Hematoma An ovarian hematoma results from excessive hem-orrhaging into the follicular lumen after ovulation. 10 As one of the common causes for an enlarged unilat-eral ovary, it is imperative to differentiate it fromneoplastic disease (i.e., granulosa cell tumors). Ovarian hematomas can be found in maiden, bar- ren, and foaling mares, although in the authors'experience foal heat ovulations tend to be the mostprone to formation. Clinical presentation can in-clude the presence of an enlarged ovary during aroutine reproductive examination, abnormally ag-gressive behavior, or colic as a result of pain fromthe weight of the ovary. 1 A diagnosis can be made by utilizing different techniques. Ultrasonographic evaluation of the en- larged ovary reveals hyper- or homo-geneous blood follicle \"spider web\" appearance that re-sults from a brin strand formation spans the 268 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENT NOTESdiameter of the structure. Theses hematomas can vary in size, ranging from 50 mm to the size of amelon. The affected ovary has an ovulation fossa that can clearly be identied upon transrectal palpation.The contralateral ovary is of normal size and func-tion, with mares continuing to cycle normally. En-docrine proles are normal. 1 Signs of colic or aggressive behavior can be ex- plained by the tension placed on the proper andbroad ligaments from the increased size of theovary. 1In most instances, the hematoma will re- gress in size and eventually return to normal func-tionality as long as the ovarian parenchyma is notcompromised because of the hemorrhage or in-creased pressure. 3The area of hemorrhage is lim- ited to the ovarian stroma, and bleeding from theovary is rare. Treatment aims at suppressing estrus to allow time for the resorption and regression of the hematoma. 1 This can be accomplished by either orally administer-ing altrenogest (0.044 mg/kg body weight) for 15 days (3 in 1) or injecting 150 mg of progesterone and 10mg of 17 /H9252-estradiol once daily for 10 days and ad- ministering prostaglandin F2/H9251on the last day (3 in 1). Alternatively, a long-acting progesterone andestradiol can be used. The hematoma should spon-taneously regress over time, during which a normalinterovulatory period should be identied. 11 If the hematoma becomes excessively large, it can destroy the remaining normal parenchyma and leavethe ovary nonfunctional, in which case removing thehematoma may become necessary. 3A standing-flank laparotomy approach can lead to identifying the ovary,draining the hematoma, and removing and visuallyligating the ovarian vasculature. 4. Anovulatory Follicles Hemorrhage into the dominant follicle with ovula-tion failure occurs when the follicle does not ruptureor collapse (Fig. 1). 13After acute hemorrhage, thecontents of the follicle are organized; on most occa-sions, this is accompanied of thefollicular wall. 14 Hemorrhagic anovulatory follicles (HAFs) autumn follicles,15persistent ovulatory follicles,16and hemorrhagic follicles.2 The presence of the hematoma can make the ovary sensitive upon palpation, functionally compro-mised, and enlarged. Although the overall HAFincidence is 5% to 8% of the mare population, it canbe a frustrating disorder because normal cyclicity isaffected. 16,17It has been suggested that the induc- tion of estrus with prostaglandin substantially in-creases developing HAFs. 14,18 With prostaglandin-induced luteolysis, progester-one drops rapidly, allowing for the removal of thenegative feedback of progesterone on the luteinizinghormone (LH) that causes an early rise during thebeginning of follicular deviation. 18This LH surge could interfere with intrafollicular metabolismof prostanoids and the proteolytic enzymes that arenecessary for ovulation and follicular collapse. 19 An increase in HAF incidence has been reportedafter the use of human chorionic gonadotropin toinduce ovulation. 20However, the mechanism re- sponsible for this increase is not clear.14 Diagnosis can be difcult because HAFs can ap- pear to be similar to (CH) (or hematoma) duringan ultrasonographic transrectal examination. A differentiating feature that may help is the thick-ness of the luteal border, with an HAF /H110213m mi n contrast to /H110225 mm in CHs. 13Vascular perfusion has also been identied as being different in HAFsversus CHs. Hormonal assays are usually normalpalpation of the ovulation fossa is possible with thecontralateral ovary of normal size and consistency. Treatment can be difcult. If the ovarian struc- ture is an HAF and has luteinized tissue with anassociated elevation in progesterone, administeringprostaglandin may illicit regression; otherwise, timewill be needed for the structure to regress naturallywith the development of a new follicular wave.The use of progesterone and estradiol with ovarianhematomas as described previously can also aid inHAF regression, with a return to cyclicity. 5. Ovarian Abscess Primary ovarian abscessation is rare.21,22It has been described as being associated with the aspira-tion of follicular \"cysts.\" 3Diagnosis is based on history and the ultrasonographic appearance of ho-mogeneous inspissated tissue mass. Ovariectomy via flank laparotomy is the treat- ment of choice because it avoids possible lacerationor contamination of the abdominal cavity. If theaffected area of the ovary is small, treatment withthe appropriate antibiotics may be possible. Thedifculty lies in identifying the bacteria without in-vading the ovary. Aspiration for culture sensitivityand drainage may - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTtion or seeding of the organism within the abdomi- nal cavity can be a life-threatening complication. 6. Granulosa Theca Cell Tumor Granulosa theca cell tumors (GCTs) are the mostcommon ovarian tumor reported in mares and rep-resent approximately 2.5% of all neoplasms in thehorse. 23They are up of granulosa cells or granulosa and theca cells.24Mares aged 2 to 20 years can be affected25and have been reported in maiden, barren, pregnant, and foaling mares.25,26 Clinically, diagnosing GCTs in mares is fre- quently based on behavioral changes (aggressivestallion-like, anestrus, or persistent estrus) depend-ing on the predominant hormone, unilateral ovarianenlargement with atrophy of the contralateralovary, ultrasonographic appearance of the affectedovary, and proles. 25,27Ultrasono- examination of the affected ovary usuallyreveals an enlarged multicystic structure but canvary, presenting in either the form of a solid mass ora single large fluid-lled cyst (Fig. 2). 28,29They are usually unilateral with a small and inactive con-tralateral ovary. 25,30Palpation of the ovulation fossa is not possible in the affected ovary because ofthe GCT emanating from that region. GCTs are hormonally active and produce variable amounts of testosterone, estradiol, and inhibin. 27,30 Increases in serum concentrations of and/ortestosterone combined with low circulating levels ofprogesterone in nonpregnant mares have been usedfor endocrine diagnosis of GCTs in mares. 30-33 Testosterone and inhibin were increased in 50% and87%, respectively, of mares with GCTs. 27Inhibin produced by the GCT is responsible for has for diagnosis of GCTs, interpretation of serum inhibinconcentrations can be confusing in pregnant mares(where both inhibin and testosterone may be in-creased), and early GCTs may require multiple sam-pling over time to detect increases in inhibin. 34 Anti-Mu \u00a8 llerian hormone is and antral ofinhibin/testosterone for detecting known GCTs inmares. 34 Treatment includes surgical removal of the af- fected ovary; approaches include colpotomy, decline theaffected ovary, and the contralateral ovary returnsto normal function on average 8.5 months after sur-gery in most mares. 25,30-32 7. Dysgerminoma A dysgerminoma is a germ cell neoplasia that is rarein mares; clinical history and presenting signs havenot been well described. 3,38In two reports, horses presented for signs of abdominal pain and weightloss and an abdominal fluid sample that was sero-sanguineous. 39,40In another report, a mare pre- sented with none of the described signs\u2014only alarge mass in the caudal abdomen. 5In mares as in humans, the mass may be associated with hypertro-phic osteopathy of the lower limb and loss of condi-tion and stiffness when walking; it is also thought tobe a more aggressive neoplasm with a potential formetastasis. 38,41,42 An abnormally large ovary can be seen during an ultrasonography and is characterized by an echogeniccavity surrounded by a thick wall. 5The contralateral ovary is active and of normal size. Transabdominaland thoracic ultrasonography as well as abdominocen-tesis may be warranted if metastasis is suspected.A denitive diagnosis is made is identied early,treatment can include unilateral ovariectomy with ap-proaches that are similar to those described previouslyfor GCTs. 8. Teratomas and Teratocarcinomas Teratomas and teratocarcinomas are other germ celltumors composed of multiple tissues that are foreignto the gonad. 7Tumors may be derived from 2 or 3 germ layers as well as sebaceous and sweat glands,respiratory epithelium, salivary glands, ganglioncells, nerve bers, hair, skin, cartilage, bone, teeth,or muscle and may be solid or cystic (Fig. 3). 3,43 Teratomas have been reported to be nonfuctionalwith regard to steroid hormone secretion; therefore,the contralateral ovary remains and reg-ular 44Their growth, how- Fig. 2.

They areusually reported in mares aged between 3 and 18years but most often in mares aged /H110215 years, an incidental nding discovered during slaughter or aroutine physical examination. 7,44 A diagnosis can be made with transrectal palpa- tion revealing an enlarged ovary with a change inconsistency; ultrasonography can be useful whenthere are structures of high echogenicity, such asbone and teeth surrounded by ultrasonographicshadows that indicate cystic areas. 7Laparoscopy has also been reported to be useful in diagnosingsuch tumors. 46Treatment includes unilateral ovariectomy, preferably via standing laparotomy,during which exploration for metastasis is possible. 9. Cystadenoma and Cystadenocarcinoma Cystadenomas are neoplasms of the epithelial com-ponent of the ovary and are rare in mares. 47Little is known about the origin of the epithelia involved, butthe epithelium is partly ciliated, which fossa) and cystadenomas. 47There- fore, the cystadenoma may arise directly from theepithelium of the ovulation fossa or indirectly fromfossa cysts. 8These may be identied per rectum, with affected ovaries being large and enclosing mul-tiple, large cysts that contain clear, yellow fluid.An ovulation fossa is palpable, which differentiatesit from GCT. Fertility of the other ovary seems toremain normal, and pregnancy may be uninter-rupted after the tumor is surgically removed. Cys-tadenomas may be associated with a high-plasmatestosterone concentration that, when present, mayaid in differentiating it from the normal activeovary. 8Papillary cystadenocarcinomas uncom- mon via vascular channels and morecommonly spread via the peritoneal cavity after acyst ruptures or content leaks. 49Ascites may arise as a result of the obstruction of peritoneal lymphat-ics, peritoneal metastasis, or both. 50Removing the affected ovary is necessary for treatment. Othermesenchymal tumors such as hemangiomas, leiomy-oma, broma, and lymphoma have been describedbut seem to be extremely uncommon.

Introduction Abortion, dened as the loss of a pregnancy between 150 and 300 days, has a severe economic impact onthe equine industry. Not only is a mare renderedunproductive for that year but also may be morereproductively inefcient the following year. Theincidence of abortion in mares ranges from 5% to15%, with the upper limit becoming alarming. 1 Older mares that potentially have decreased uterinedefense mechanisms and increased brosis seem tobe at higher risk. Although abortion \"storms\" areless common than sporadic abortions and noninfec-tious causes are diagnosed twice as frequently asinfectious, when one does occur it is imperative thatisolation protocols be implemented immediately. 1 Clinical signs of impending abortion vary consider-ably from none\u2014in which the mare is found emptyduring a late-term pregnancy check or immediatelyafter abortion has occurred\u2014to premature mam-mary gland development that commonly occurs withplacental inflammation and separation. Thesemares should not be moved or mixed with others onthe farm until testing for leptospirosis, herpesvirus,and equine viral arteritis is negative. Closemonitoring of temperatures, serum titers, and preg-nancy status should be instituted on exposed mares.The reported causes of abortion and stillbirths inmares change with time, but the differentiation be-tween infectious and noninfectious agents is stillcritical in the implications. Infectious agents that cause abortion can be more devastating and produce the most distress amonghorse owners, managers, and veterinarians. For-tunately, improved methods of preemptive monitor-ing, vaccinating, testing, isolating, and treatingprovide a new arsenal with which to combat thediseases. Of the infectious agents, Leptospira spp., equine herpesvirus, and EVA will be discussed in this article. 272 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENT2. Leptospirosis Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that affects many domestic and wild animals worldwide. Horses areincidental hosts of several leptospiral serovars; onlyserovar Bratislava is suspected be maintained inhorses. 11Serologic surveys demonstrate that lep- tospiral infection is common populations.However, most in the horseare subclinical. 12Clinical that include fever, hemoglo-binuria, jaundice, stillbirth, and abortion mainly inthe last trimester. 11There are more than 250 se- rovars of Leptospira spp., but equine leptospirosis has been to parts of the world. 11 Which serovar presents usually depends on thehost in a specic area. Leptospiral infection as acause of equine abortion has been reported as adiagnosis in 3.1% of cases in Hungary and 2.2% to3.3% in the United States, whereas in NorthernIreland it has been reported in 35% of cases. 11,13 In Kentucky, the source of equine infection isthought to come from the wild animal population,including raccoons, skunks, deer, opossum, andcattle and swine. The Leptospira spp. organisms are shed in the infected animal's urine and con-taminate water and feed, which are the probablesources of infection for the equine population.Environmental conditions with low-lying swampyareas and stagnant water such as ponds producehigher incidences of the disease. Abortion or stillbirth usually occurs from 6 months of gestation to term, with fetal autolysispresent as a result of death in advance of delivery.The mare usually displays no premonitory clinicalsigns before delivery but often has a high antibodytiter against one or more leptospiral serovars. Themare is exposed and then becomes infected and bac-teremic. The organism enters the placenta, caus-ing fetal infection with placentitis and funisitis.The in the allantochorion arethrombosis, vasculitis, cell in-ltration 2,15 The gross and of the umbilical cord include mild-to-severe edema, focal-to-multiplesacculations lled with fluid, and coating of the sur-face with a brinous exudate, without visible in- volvement of the three primary blood vessels. 2 A recent report revealed the surface of the umbilicalcord diffusely coated by a dense exudate and minimally into theWharton's jelly. 15Gross pathologic lesions of the and generalizedpetechial and mottled, and discolored yellow. Edema isevident in the kidney with pale white radiatingstreaks in the cortex and medulla. 2,15Microscopic changes show lesions in the liver and kidney to bethe most severe. Liver lesions consist of hepatocel-lular dissociation, giant cells throughout the paren-chyma, and leukocytic inltration be made by identifying Leptospira spp. in the allantochorion, umbilical cord, or fetalkidneys by fluorescent antibody tests (FATs), silverstaining, or immunohistochemistry. 2,15A recent study indicated that real-time polymerase chain re-action (PCR) is an effective method for diagnosingleptospiral abortion in horses on both placenta andfetal kidney (and liver when available). 16Expo- sure usually occurs 2 to 4 weeks before abortion;therefore, the affected mares have high serologicaltiters. Serology in the mare and fetus is based onenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and micro-scopic agglutination /H113501:6400. 2De- tecting leptospires a FAT is the method ofchoice for diagnosing leptospirosis in the kidney ofaborted fetuses, although immunohistochemistryhas shown to have a 78% sensitivity and 100% spec-icity when compared to the gold standard methodof culture. 2Culture, however, is not practical be- cause it takes 6 months for Leptospira spp. to grow. Once an abortion has occurred and leptospirosis is suspected, the mare should be isolated so infectiveurine and uterine fluids will not expose other maresto the pathogen. Mares that have been pasturedwith the aborted mare should have Leptospira spp. titers drawn to try to identify potentially exposedmares so treatment can be initiated and abortionhopefully prevented. Serial serum titers may bet-ter identify exposed mares. Sources of infectionsuch as wildlife (skunks for Kennewicki and rac-coons for Grippotyphosa), water, and contaminatedfeed should be identied so further exposure doesnot occur. Treatment is successful with 5 mg/kgoxytetracycline intravenously once a day, doxycy-cline 10 mg/kg orally twice a day, and 20 000 IU/kgpenicillin G procaine intramuscularly twice daily for7 to 10 days. Leptospira spp. titers remain high for long periods of time. In addition, naturally infected mares shedhigh numbers of nonhost-adapted leptospires inurine for up to 14 weeks; therefore, mares should notbe reintroduced to other mares until shedding hasceased and a FAT, silver stain, or PCR shows thatthe mare's urine is negative. 216To collect the urine, furosemide must be administered, and then AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 273IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTthe second void after administration must be col- lected because more mucous is present initially andmay not interfere with testing. Depending on theconcentration of the organisms, false negatives mayalso be a factor (D. Williams, personal communica-tion). Further evidence seen by the University ofKentucky's Livestock Diagnostic Disease Centersuggests that a good way to approximate the timewhen shedding ceases corresponds to decreasing ti-ters (M. Donahue, personal communication). Thismay be a more practical means of determining per-sistent shedding because the protocol of collectingthe urine sample for a FAT, silver stain, or PCR iscumbersome and precise. 3. Equine Herpes Virus Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) was rst isolated in1932 in Kentucky and has been recognized aroundthe world as a major cause of abortion. However,since the use of preventive vaccination, the inci-dence of loss has decreased over the years. Herpes-viridae characteristically infect a susceptible host,replicate, and establish a life-long latent infec-tion. 17,18This cycle of primary infection with peri- odic episodes of reactivation and shedding of virus toinfect a susceptible host is the hallmark of herpes-viruses and the mechanism by which they persist inthe host population. 17,18EHV-1 and EHV-4, both alpha herpesviruses, cause respiratory tract infec-tion. 19However, EHV-1 is involved in neurological disorders, equine abortion, and neonatal death. After respiratory infection or latent virus reacti- vation, uterine infection occurs via viremia. Trans-placental spread of the virus then occurs at sites ofuterine infarction after endometrial vasculitis andthrombosis, allowing whereby cell-to-cell spread or infected leuco-cytes transmit the virus to the intravillousendothelium and to fetal organs. 20,21A feature of spontaneous EHV-1 abortions in mares is the oftensudden and explosive nature of the event, in whichthe fetus is expelled without warning while stillenveloped within the fetal membranes. Some experimental and eld data suggest that the uterus and placenta become more susceptible toEHV-1 infection as pregnancy proceeds as a result ofthe local production of progesterone at the uteropla-cental junction, resulting in immunosuppres-sion. 20,21Transplacental spread of the virus occurs at sites of uterine infarction associated with throm-bus formation in endometrial arterioles. 20There- fore, when the virus is in the placenta, it should beconcentrated in those areas apposing sites of infarc-tion. Diagnosis can be made with PCR of fresh fetal tissues and parafn-embedded placenta. Becausethe virus is transmitted by close contact via aerosolexposure, respiratory secretions, fetal tissues, pla-centa, and uterine fluids from mares that haveaborted need to be disposed of and the mare isolated.The virus can be transmitted via organic material onclothes, shoes, and material inside stalls, trailers,water buckets, or feed. If mares have aborted inthe eld that area needs to be isolated from theremaining horses in the eld; however, those horsesshould not be moved or mixed with other horses.Horses that have been exposed to infected horsesbut have not developed any clinical signs within 21days of the potential exposure are unlikely to do so. Vaccination has decreased the incidence of abor- tion storms dramatically, with most affected maresexposed coming from na\u00efve herds. Initial recom-mendations to reduce the risk of abortion from EHV-1/EHV-4 included using a killed vaccine aat 5, 7, and 9 months of gestation. Recently, increasing the fre-quency to every 2 months year-round has been sug-gested on farms with large movements of mares orthat have had endemic problems. Modied live vi-rus vaccines have been used during gestation; how-ever, at this time it is an off-label use. Immunity tothe virus only lasts 4 to 6 months, so repeated abor-tions can occur in successive seasons. 4. Equine Viral Arteritis The causative agent of the respiratory and aborto-genic disease equine viral arteritis (EVA) is a smallsingle-stranded RNA virus (togavirus). 22Infection is believed to occur by direct contact via nasal drop-let spray during the acute phase of infection and byshedding the virus in the semen of an infected stal-lion. Susceptible mares that are then bred to ashedding stallion acquire the disease. Blood, lacri-mal fluid, urine, feces, vaginal secretions, abortedfetus, placenta, and amniotic fluid may also contrib-ute to horizontal virus spread. 23,24Two carrier states exist in the stallion: a short-term state dur-ing convalescence (weeks) and a long-term conditionthat may persist for years. 22The virus persists in the vas deferens, ampullae, seminal vesicles,prostate, and bulbourethral glands and seems to betestosterone-dependent. Mares neither seem to be-come carriers and shedders nor have been shown tobe infected venereally. Clinical signs range from subclinical disease rec- ognized only by seroconversion to acute illness andabortion. Signs are variable and include pyrexia,depression, anorexia, edema of scrotum, ventraltrunk and limbs, conjunctivitis, lacrimation, serousnasal discharge, and respiratory distress. Adulthorses usually make an uneventful recovery after aviremic phase that can persist for up to 40 days afterinfection. The incidence of abortion increases toapproximately 50% of exposed mares and generallyoccurs 10 to 33 days after equine arteritis virus(EAV) infection. 22Abortion may occur with or shortly after infection as a result of fetal infectionand death or myometrial necrosis and edema, whichlead to placental detachment and fetal death. 22,25 EAV can be isolated from both the fetus and pla- centa by isolating the virus, especially from the pla-centa, fetal spleen, lung and kidney, and fetal/placental fluids. Semen samples with sperm-rich 274 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTfractions should be collected for isolating the virus suspected of infecting stallions. Antibodies to EAVcan be demonstrated by complement xation (CF)and virus neutralization tests. The CF test is mostuseful for studying immunity to arteritis during therst 4 months after exposure because the titer peaks2 to 4 weeks after infection and decreases belowdetectable limits after 8 months. Virus neutraliza-tion antibody titers develop simultaneously, and CFtiters are maximal 2 to 4 months after infection andremain stable for several years. Previously in-fected horses are immune to reinfection with thevirus for up to 7 years. A modied live virus vaccine is registered for use in some US states. The use of the modied livevirus vaccine does not produce any side effects installions apart from a short-term abnormality ofsperm morphology and a mild fever with no overtclinical signs. The virus can be sporadically iso-lated from the nasopharynx and blood for up to 7 to32 days after vaccination, so vaccinated horsesshould be isolated for 1 month. Horses in contactwith and mares served by vaccinated stallions arenot infected with EAV. Vaccinated mares bredby positive stallions are protected from clinicalinfection. Prevention and control of the disease involves iso- lating and vaccinating stallions, mares being maintaining diligentmonitoring of seropositive nonshedding stallions.Stallions shedding the virus should be housed andbred in separate facilities. 5. Conclusion Infectious abortions in the mare should be identiedquickly and efciently. Isolation protocols shouldbe initiated immediately, and other exposed horsesshould be continually monitored and treated as nec-essary. These measures will potentially diminishthe effect and spread of disease.

Macpherson, DVM, MS, MS, PhD, DACVP, DACVM, DACT This manuscript will review commonly encountered reproductive pathologic conditions in the non-pregnantand pregnant mare. Conditions include endometritis, placentitis, and retained fetal membranes. Authors'addresses: University of Florida, College of Veterinary Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610-0125,macphersonm@ufl.edu (Macpherson); and T6-020 Veterinary Research Tower, or inflammation of the endometrium, is a condition that is costly and frustrating to mareowners. The condition is most commonly denedas either infectious endometritis or postmating-induced endometritis and can be caused by the in-troduction of pathogenic organisms, semen, urine, orair into the uterus. A variety of factors contributeto the development of endometritis, contractility, defective lymphatic drain-age, and degenerative changes in tissues that makeup the reproductive organs. Elucidating the rootcauses of endometritis can be challenging. Pathophysiology Because endometritis is a complex condition, thepathophysiology of the disease is as well. Althoughall mares develop endometritis as a result of breed-ing, 1the response to inflammation differs between mares (Fig. 1). Most mares are intrinsically pre-pared to eliminate contaminants after mating, thusresolving inflammation and preventing infection. 2 These mares are termed \"resistant\" to mating- induced endometritis. Other mares are more prone Fig. 1. Multiple sperm cells in the lumen of the endometrium ofa recently bred mare. In resistant mares, the amount of inflam-mation that results from the presence of semen in the uterus islimited, as is the case here. Susceptible mares respond moredramatically, which results in postmating-induced endometritis. 276 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENT NOTESto developing endometritis, and they are termed \"susceptible.\" Mares that are deemed resistant toendometritis have intact mechanisms for uterineclearance of contaminants after breeding via me-chanical evacuation of uterine contents as well aslymphatic drainage. Mares that are susceptible toendometritis suffer one or more defects in the sys-tem such as an anatomic abnormality, impaired me-chanical or lymphatic evacuation of the uterus, immunologic response to inflamma-tion. Under inflamed conditions, resident infec-tious 3or In some instances, both conditions coexist. To prop-erly diagnose and treat endometritis, risk factorscommon to all types of endometritis must beexamined. Risk Factors Risk factors for endometritis include mare age andparity, perineal and birth canal conformation, clear-ance of contaminants, and immune response to an-tigenic stimuli. Pluriparous mares frequentlyexperience trauma during delivery that can affectthe uterus or anatomical barriers to uterine infec-tion, including the vulva, vestibule-vaginal sphinc-ter, and cervix. Aberrations in reproductiveanatomy provide an opportunity for air, urine, andbacteria to contaminate and colonize the reproduc-tive tract. If the mare is free of other conditions,such as dependent uterine position or impaired lym-phatic drainage, she may be able to clear herself ofany contamination and inflammation. However,older mares often experience overall conformationalabnormalities that affect uterine position, uterinecontraction, and lymphatic drainage. 4,5These mares are prone to developing pendulous uteri thatfail to evacuate contents. 4Resulting inflammatory responses lead to luminal fluid production and accu-mulation. In addition, uterine dependency can re-sult in persistent urine pooling or pneumouterus,particularly during the postpartum period. Aged/susceptible mares also often suffer from defects inlymphatic drainage 6that compounds fluid accumu- lation during the periovulatory period. These fac-tors lead to a compromised uterine environment andthus make the mare more susceptible to uterineinfection. More recently, the role of mucus production 7,8and the presence of biolm have been examined in per-sistent uterine infections (Fig. 2). 9Mucus can both aid and impair pathogen clearance in systems with amucociliary apparatus. It has been postulated thatnormal mucus production facilitates cilia-propelledremoval of contaminants from the uterus afterbreeding. 8Under persistently inflamed conditions, excess or reduced function impairs postulated to to conditionsthat favor bacterial proliferation in the uterus ofsome mares. Under natural conditions, bacteriaexist in either a free-floating (planktonic) 11or sessile (adhered) state. The free-floating form allows bac-teria to proliferate and grow, whereas the sessilestate promotes persistence and long-term survival.The formation of a biolm is a complex process thatallows a bacterial population to transition fromplanktonic to sessile states, thus promoting sur-vival. Through the formation of biolm, bacteriaare enclosed in a biopolymer matrix that allowsthem to be adherent to inert surfaces (table tops,glassware, vascular catheters, orthopedic prostheticdevices, etc.) or to each other. Once attached, bac-teria grow and produce extracellular polymers 12 that facilitate long-term survival of the sessile bac-terial cells. In addition, the host produces antibod-ies to the bacteria (both planktonic and sessile), butthe immune response eliminates the planktonic bac-teria only. Sessile bacterial antigens, although rec-ognized, are impenetrable within the extracellularpolymeric substance (EPS) layer of biolm. As aresult, general immune responses to pathogenic bac-teria are diminished when biolm is present. Inaddition, antimicrobial susceptibility is affectedby biolm production. 9The thick EPS layer as well as proteins and lipids provide an effectivebarrier for antimicrobial penetration of sessilebacteria. Disease symptoms are often amelio-rated after antimicrobial-induced death of plank-tonic bacteria, but infection persists aftertreatment because the sessile bacterial populationis protected by the biolm. Recent data conrmbiolm production by bacteria (E. coli, Pseudomo- aeruginosa, pneumoniae) iso- lated from the equine uterus. 13Additional data A layer of REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENT(R. Ferris, unpublished data, 2014) showed that S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus obtained from equine uterine swabs also produced biolms. Ongoing work is examining effective treatments againstbiolm producing bacteria in the equine uterus. Diagnostic Tools for Endometritis The evaluation process always starts with an accu-rate history of both general and reproductive health,a full physical examination, and a thorough exami-nation of both the external and internal genitalia.Examination tools that are commonly used includeevaluation of the perineal area, transrectal palpa-tion and ultrasonography of the reproductive tract,sampling for uterine culture, cytology, endometrialbiopsy, and vaginal examination. Results fromthese tests help identify obvious, and often correct-able, problems. Additional tests such as low-vol-ume uterine lavage for cytology and culture,hysteroscopy, and karyotyping are sometimes nec-essary to gain needed information. General Physical and Perineal Examination Overall, good physical health and conformation are important for reproductive health in mares. Al-though perineal anatomy is often the focus of atten-tion when evaluating a mare for fertility, it isimportant to consider the impact overall body con-dition has on perineal anatomy. Underweightmares frequently have a pelvic tilt that results in adependent uterus and sinking of the anal sphincter,both of which indicate risk factors for uterine con-tamination. A rst step toward good reproductivehealth is good body condition, which can help correctperineal defects. Vulvar anatomy is a critical rst-line defense against uterine contamination. Poor perineal con-formation predisposes the mare to \"wind sucking,\"fecal contamination, and pooling of urine in the va-gina. The long axis of the vulva should be vertical,with no more than a 10\u00b0 angulation. Most of thevulva should be ventral to the pelvic brim. When 2ngers are placed on the pelvic ischium, no morethan 2.5 cm of the vulva should be dorsal to thepelvic floor. The vulvar lips should not have obvi-ous irregularities, and apposition should be good.When the vulvar lips are gently parted, no obviousinflux of air should be heard. The vestibule-vaginalseal can be evaluated through the parted vulvar lipsand should be intact. Transrectal Ultrasound Examination Ultrasound examination is an important and useful component for evaluating reproductive health inmares. Intraluminal uterine fluid around the timeof breeding and ovulation has an established rela-tionship to reduced pregnancy rates in cycling andpostpartum mares. 14-16Postmating-induced endo- metritis is the most common cause of uterine fluidaccumulation during the periovulatory period ofmares. 4Mares with delayed uterine clearance of-ten have defects in intrinsic myometrial contractil-ity 5and drainage through the lymphatics that is evidenced by lymphatic stasis.6The conditions fre- quently manifest themselves abnormal uterine edema patternsduring estrus. 7Specically, these mares often have an unusually large amount of uterine edemastarting early in the estrus period and persistingafter ovulation. Interestingly, mares with bacte-rial endometritis do not consistently develop in-traluminal fluid. Recent studies 8,9reported that mares that had uterine infections caused by E. coli were less likely to have intrauterine fluid accumu-lation identied by ultrasound and less evidence ofcytologic inflammation. Mares with uterine infec-tions caused by /H9252-hemolytic Streptococcus, K. pneu- moniae, Enterobacter cloacae, yeast higher incidence of ultrasonographically detectable uterinefluid. These ndings can be useful when determin-ing the need for additional diagnostic tests. Uterine Culture and Cytology Culture and cytology should be performed to eval- uate for potential endometritis. Uterine cultureand cytology can endometrial biopsy,or low-volume uterine cytol-ogy should be performed together because bothtests have a high prevalence of false negativeswhen used alone. Because the vagina is not asterile environment, false-positive culture resultsare common as a result of contamination from theperineum or the vagina. Conversely, aerobic cul-ture may fail to diagnose fungal or yeast infec-tions, which are more easily detected uponcytology. In general, any bacterial growth in con-junction with neutrophils upon cytology is consid-ered diagnostic for uterine infection. In addition,pure growth of a single organism, particularlythose that commonly contribute to endometritis,could arguably be considered diagnostic for infec-tion even in the absence of positive cytology.Commonly described reproductive pathogens inthe mare include S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. Historically, the presence of more than two neu- trophils per high-powered eld is diagnostic for en-dometritis. the cytologic sampling methodology interpretation of results, andcorrelation to endometritis mares. Conclusionsfrom this study were 2-fold: rst, endometritis di-agnosis was more when assessing the leukocytes (PMNs) inthe total the number of endometrial offered no advan-tage over cytology brush for diagnosing endometri-tis. These interesting data may help lead to moreaccurate endometritis diagnoses using traditional 278 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTtools. However, it has been shown that uterine in- fections with E. coli andP. aeruginosa are not easily detected by positive cytology using traditional meth-ods. Therefore, the growth of one of these patho-gens warrants further investigation in the marewith a history of chronic subfertility. Proceduressuch as low-volume uterine lavage can be caused by gram-negative organisms.Low-Volume Uterine LavageLow-volume uterine lavage can be performed to ob-tain a more representative sample of the uterinecontents. 10,19It has been postulated that this method allows for sample collection from the entireuterine lumen rather than an isolated sample usingan endometrial instrument (swab, brush, or biopsy).Low-volume lavage is best performed during di-estrus to allow complete dilation and exposure torecesses between endometrial folds. When thetechnique is performed during estrus, fluid tends tocollect in between edematous endometrial folds andcan be difcult to retrieve. After fecal evacuation and preparation of the per- ineal area, a sterile Foley-type catheter is asepti-cally inserted through the cervix and into a uterinehorn. Using transrectal guidance, the catheter isfed into the tip of one uterine horn. The catheterballoon is not inflated so that the catheter tip can bemanipulated easily to aid in fluid evacuation. intothe uterus. The fluid is agitated throughout theuterus using rectal massage for at least one minute.Oxytocin (10-12 IU) is administered intravenouslyto promote uterine contractility for fluid collection.Using transrectal manipulation, fluid is moved tothe tip of the uterine horn where the catheter tip isplaced. With the operator's hand cradling the tip ofthe uterine horn around the catheter, the fluid isallowed to drain out through the catheter and backinto the bag so that the system remains \"closed.\"Fluid is then transferred into conical 50-mL tubes.A minimum of 50 mL of efflux is needed for accu-rately representing uterine contents. Further-more, fluid should be processed for evaluationwithin 1 hour of collection to avoid iatrogenic cellu-lar changes. 10The clarity of the fluid is evaluated for mucus strands and cloudy contents that mayindicate endometritis. In one study, 20cloudy and mucus effluxes were highly correlated with the pres-ence of microorganisms (E. coli and /H9252-hemolytic Streptococcus). The contents are allowed to settlefor at least 1 hour, or the tubes are centrifugedimmediately for 10 minutes at 400g. Determininggforce on a standard benchtop centrifuge can be done with a nomograph and has been well de-scribed. 21After processing, fluid is decanted (if centrifuged) or aspirated (if allowed to settle), leav-ing 5 mL of supernatant and the pelleted cells.Two sterile cotton swabs are used to obtain samplesfrom the pellet. One sample is placed in transport media for bacterial culture; the second sample issmeared directly onto a slide for cytologicalevaluation. Low-volume uterine lavage provides a concen- trated sample of cells and debris that can helpidentify subclinical infections. Results from low-volume uterine lavage should be interpreted cau-tiously; however, because the concentration processalso increases the likelihood of isolating bacterialcontaminants. It is best to interpret the samplesfrom low-volume uterine lavage in conjunction withadditional evidence of endometritis such as abnor-mal intraluminal fluid accumulation (especially indiestral or early estral mares), exuberant uterineedema, and repeated pregnancy losses after usinggood breeding management techniques. Positiveindicators of subclinical uterine infection obtainedfrom low-volume uterine lavage include cloudy ormucus fluid, isolation of known uterine pathogens,and more than one PMN identied per high-poweredeld of concentrated cells. It is interesting to notethat the cytological interpretation method recentlyreported by Kozdrowski et al. 18may be perfectly suited for evaluating samples from low-volume uter-ine lavage. Endometrial Biopsy Uterine tissue obtained through endometrial biopsy is considered to be the gold standard for detectingreproductive pathologies in the mare's uterus. 22 Microscopic examination of the endometrium pro-vides the most accurate means of identifying inflam-mation and other pathologies in the mare's uterus.The endometrial biopsy should be taken at the baseof one uterine horn, and a single sample has beenshown to be representative of the entire uterus whenconsidering inflammation or periglandular brosis.The sample should be submitted to a laboratory inan appropriate xative (Bouin's solution, Davidson'ssolution, or 10% formalin) along with a detailedhistory of behavioral, ovarian, and uterine ndingsat the time of biopsy. Based on the degree ofchange in the characteristics that are described inthe sections that follow, a grade is given with themodied Kenney scoring system. Inflammatory Cells Types, location, and distribution of inflammatory cells in the endometrial sample are noted. Neutro-phils often indicate acute inflammation, whereaslymphocytes indicate chronic changes. The pres-ence of a signicant number of plasma cells is a poorprognostic sign because it indicates long-standingpersistence of antigenic stimulus\u2014usually bacteria.The presence of eosinophils indicates uterine irrita-tion such as urine pooling and/or pneumovagina.Treatment can resolve many types of inflammation. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 279IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTFibrosis Uterine brosis is essentially connective tissue for- mation and is a normal degenerative part of aging.Fibrosis can be widespread or focal. It is importantto note that brosis is untreatable and permanent.A mare with signicant endometrial brosis has amuch chance carrying a foal to term. Dilated Lymphatics Older, pluriparous mares tend to have large, pendu-lous uteruses that do not provide adequate lym-phatic drainage. Dilated lymphatics seen in theendometrium may be clinically signicant if pairedwith ndings such as uterine cysts or poor uterinetone. These ndings often are concurrent with edema, accumulation, or postbreeding endometritis. Glandular Distention This lesion, when not associated with periglandularbrosis, may indicate an inability to empty uterinecontents. Whether this is associated with decientuterine contractility or tone has not been studied.Chronic distention that results in glandular epithe-lial atrophy probably renders the glands useless, thus affecting their ability to provide nutritionalsupport to the developing embryo. Vascular Elastosis Degenerative lesions develop in vessel (arterial)walls in multiparous mares. Arteries in both themyometrium and endometrium are involved. Vas-cular degeneration has been shown to be statisti-cally correlated to the number of pregnancies. 23 Elastic bers within vessel walls become increasedin number and undergo fragmentation. Dopplerflow studies have shown that mares with vascularelastosis have reduced uterine perfusion. 24The authors of these studies hypothesize that compro-mised uterine blood flow could affect endometrialdevelopment, uterine clearance, endometritis, andgeneral fertility. Endometrial biopsy samples can also be used for culture and cytology. Recent studies suggest thatthe incidence of false-negative results is signi-cantly reduced when obtaining culture and cytologysamples directly from an endometrial biopsy speci-men. 25-27With this method, the endometrial tis- the aseptic technique and asterile equine biopsy forceps. Once the tissue isobtained, it is used to inoculate on a blood agar platefor culture and then smeared onto a glass slide forcytologic preparation. Samples are then processedusing traditional methods for microbial isolationand staining. The sensitivity for bacterial growthusing this method was almost 2.5 times greaterwhen using the endometrial biopsy sample com-pared with a traditional double-guarded swabsystem. 25,26Cervical Evaluation The cervix is an important barrier to uterine infec- tion. For multiparous mares, a thorough examina-tion of the cervix can reveal abnormalities thatcontribute to reduced fertility. Cervical lacerationsor damage to the cervical muscles after prolongedfoaling prevent proper closure of the cervix, leadingto uterine contamination. Conversely, mares thathave experienced severe dystocia, long-standing en-dometritis, or pyometra may have cervical adhe-sions that compromise cervical patency andevacuation of uterine contents. More recently (M.Macpherson, personal observation), a population ofmiddle-aged performance mares that were beingbred for the rst time and mares that had servedonly as embryo donors (i.e., had not carried a foal)revealed a phenomenon of poor cervical relaxationduring estrus. The reduced muscular relaxation inthese mares led to compromised uterine evacuationat the time of breeding, fluid accumulation, andendometritis. The cervix of a mare is best evaluated during diestrus. However, the typical breeding soundnessevaluation is performed during estrus when the cer-vix is relaxed and permits easy passage of diagnosticinstruments. In many cases, digital examination ofthe cervix at the time of breeding soundness exam-ination will be adequate for determining cervicalpatency, presence of adhesions, and large cervicaldefects. Estrus is the optimal time for detectingpoor cervical relaxation in mares. For assessingmuscular function or identifying smaller cervical de-fects, the mare's cervix should be examined duringdiestrus (when under the influence of progesterone)and tightly closed. The operator's index nger canbe carefully passed through the lumen of the cervixusing gentle digital pressure. Once the lumen ispenetrated, the operator can circumferentially ex-amine the cervix for defects with the index nger inthe lumen and the thumb at the vaginal wall andexternal cervical os. If cervical damage is sus-pected, it is important to perform a thorough cervi- cal exam before repeated manipulations, which cancause the cervix to soften and change shape. The prognosis for mares with cervical damage is often poor. Depending on size, a cervical lacerationoften will require surgical repair. Scar tissue for-mation at the site of the repair compromises theelasticity of the muscles required for dilation duringestrus and at the time of parturition. As a conse-quence, the tears frequently recur during foaling.Mares with cervical adhesions are at risk for loss ofcervical patency and pyometra formation. Early,aggressive treatment with cervical breakdown andapplication of steroid-based creams to prevent refor-mation are the rst line of defense with cervicaladhesions. In more advanced cases, cervical wedgeresections 28have been used to successfully maintain cervical patency and allow uterine drainage. Adhe-sions are prone to reformation even after complete 280 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTbreakdown, so owners should be advised that the presence of cervical adhesions signicantly reducesthe prognosis for fertility. When possible, assistedreproductive procedures are the best option forbreeding mares with cervical abnormalities. Hysteroscopy Hysteroscopy is the direct visualization of the inte- rior of the uterus using an endoscope. It is used toevaluate pathogenic conditions, including endome-trial cysts, retained endometrial cups, focal lesions,masses, and foreign bodies. Uterine adhesions,which may severely impact fertility, are best diag-nosed with hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopy is performed with a 1-m flexible en- doscope. Proper preparation of the endoscope iscritical for avoiding iatrogenic introduction of patho-gens to the urogenital system. Because of the del-icate nature of the ber optics in the endoscope, theequipment is generally cold-disinfected using a 2%glutaraldehyde solution. Immersion of the ber op-tic portion of the endoscope in glutaraldehyde for 12to 15 minutes will destroy most pathogenic bacteria,fungi, and viruses. Glutaraldehyde solution shouldalso be aspirated through the biopsy channel andplaced in the fluid receptacle of the system. Pro-longed exposure of the endoscope to glutaraldehydewill result in deleterious effects on the ber optics aswell as the rubber outer coating. All parts exposedto glutaraldehyde should be rinsed with copiousamounts of sterile water before being introducedinto the genital tract. If sterilizing the equipmentis necessary, ethylene oxide is the method of choice. The perineal region of the mare is aseptically pre- pared before introducing the endoscope into theuterus. The operator's arm is covered with a sterilesleeve, and the hand is covered with a sterile glove.A very small amount of lubricant is placed on theback of the hand to avoid smearing lubricant ontothe camera face and altering image quality. Theendoscope, trapped in the hand, is carried to theexternal cervical os. Introduce one or two ngersthrough the cervix while ensuring that overdilationis avoided. The endoscope is carefully placed intothe cervical os and passed into the uterus. Oncethe endoscope is in the uterus, the cervical os is heldtightly closed around the instrument, and the uterusis insufflated with air. In some cases, particularlyfor laser-assisted removal of endometrial cysts, theuterus is insufflated with fluid such as LRS or sterilesaline. After the uterus is insufflated, the endo-scope is guided up each uterine horn and back to theuterine body for full evaluation. Culture and bi-opsy samples can also be taken through the endo-scope using instruments specically tted for thispurpose. Endometrial biopsy samples an en-doscopic instrument are small and difcult to inter-pret. Recently, Card and Eaton 29described a method for obtaining an endometrial biopsy usinghysteroscopic guidance and a traditional biopsypunch. With this technique, the endoscope is usedto visualize areas of interest in the endometrium.The biopsy punch is then inserted alongside theendoscope, and a sample is taken under visual guid-ance. The advantage of this technique over a bi-opsy through the channel of the endoscope is thatthe sample size is much larger and useful for diag-nostic purposes. After hysteroscopy, air or fluid isremoved from the uterus. Prophylactic treatmentsusing uterine lavage and intrauterine antibiotic in-fusion are advised. Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have re- cently been investigated for their usefulness in di-agnosing uterine pathogens in mares. 13Using this sensitive technology, more than 30 uterine bacterialpathogens have been identied from mares. PCRhas also been used to identify fungal organisms fromuterine samples. An advantage of PCR for detect-ing fungal pathogens is the rapid turnaround timefor results. Traditional fungal cultures take 5 to 7days to grow organisms, whereas PCR can provideresults in 48 hours. Because of the sensitivity ofthe test, PCR is best reserved for difcult-to-detectuterine pathogens. Treatment Strategies for Endometritis Treatment approaches for endometritis are built onthe premise of correcting anatomic defects, remov-ing contaminants, and treating pathogens. Thefundamental principles have not changed dramati-cally over time. Anatomic abnormalities are fre-quently the source of genital tract contamination.Mares with poor perineal conformation and/or com-promise to the vulvar, and cervical benet from having their defectssurgically corrected. A Caslick suture is a simpleremedy for most anatomic defects. Less fre-quently, mares may require perineal reconstructionor cervical repair. Uterine Evacuation Promoting uterine evacuation through the adminis- tration of ecbolic agents (oxytocin, prostaglandin)and uterine lavage is important for treating problemmares. Affected mares frequently experience poorevacuation of uterine contents after contamination.In some cases, the use of ecbolic agents is sufcientto evacuate uterine contents. Oxytocin is a potentecbolic agent that promotes strong but short-liveduterine contractions. 30,31The traditional dose for oxytocin is 10 to 20 U administered intramuscularlyor intravenously. The half-life of oxytocin is short(/H110117 minutes 31), so it is generally used for its imme- diate effect (i.e., after uterine lavage). When ad-ministered intramuscularly, the interval is oftenevery 3 to 4 hours a few times a day. Mares withsignicant compromise to uterine contractility as aresult of poor muscle tone or lymphatic drainageabnormalities require the prolonged contractile ac-tion 281IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTtenol, a prostaglandin analog, has been shown to induce low-amplitude uterine contractions thatlast for 4 to 5 hours. 32Cloprostenol administered during the immediate periovulatory period hasbeen shown to affect luteal function and reduceprogesterone concentrations, which in some casesnegatively affected pregnancy rates. 33-35The 250 once or twice a day. Asuggested protocol 8for mares with poor uterine clearance or drainage is to perform uterine lavage 4to 8 hours after mating and to administer oxytocin tohelp completely evacuate uterine fluid. The lavageis followed by administering 250 /H9262g of cloprostenol intramuscularly 12 to 18 hours after mating. As described previously, ecbolic agents are rou- tinely used in combination with uterine lavage.Isotonic fluids such as 0.9% saline or LRS are the uterine lumen in 500-mL to 2-L incre-ments (depending on uterine capacity), and the fluidis siphoned off. The procedure is repeated until theeffluent collected appears to be relatively clear.Uterine lavage can be safely performed 4 to 8 hoursafter breeding. 36Mares that have a history of postmating-induced endometritis or chronic subfer-tility may benet from lavage immediately before 37and/or after38breeding. Vanderwall and Woods37showed that pregnancy rates were not affected inmares undergoing uterine lavage using1Lo fL R Swithin an hour before mating. This procedure canbe useful in problem mares that retain uterine fluidbefore mating or that are inseminated with a seconddose of frozen-thawed semen. Mares with 1 to4Lo futerinelavage (0.9% saline or LRS) 4 to 8 hours after breed-ing, when feasible. However, uterine lavage can beperformed up to 12 to 24 hours after mating. Uter-ine lavage therapy is often combined with repeateddoses of oxytocin or prostaglandin during the peri-ovulatory period. Uterine lavage is also frequentlyrepeated (for up to 3 days) in mares that retain fluidafter mating and ovulation. Antimicrobial Therapies Antimicrobials are often the rst line of defense in mares with infectious endometritis. Selecting theappropriate antimicrobial treatment should bebased on culture and sensitivity results. Antimi-crobial agents commonly used to treat mares withinfectious endometritis are shown in Table 1. Solvents and Mucolytic Agents Several novel therapies have recently been investi- gated for treating problem mares. These therapieshave been directed toward removing mucus or bio-lm, which are thought to protect bacteria withinthe reproductive tract. 8,39Proposed uterine thera- peutics for mares with persistent microbial infec-tions that may be associated with biolm orexcessive mucus production include the use of mu-colytics Several products, including dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), kerosene, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), have been instilled the mare's uterus to promotethe breakdown of mucus exudate seen in Uterine DMSO has beeninvestigated for its anti-inflammatory effects andability to reduce collagen formation in the equineendometrium. Inflammation was reduced insome mares after uterine treatment with DMSOwhile endometrial brosis remained 40,41Intrauterine the endometrialepithelium that regenerated within 21 days oftreatment. Pregnancy rates tended to improve inone population of barren mares. 42 Chemical curettage with kerosene has been dem- onstrated to produce glandular activation in mares,with improved conception rates in treated vs controlmares. 43Biopsy grades improved from Category III to Category I after treatment in some mares.Of 11 mated grade III mares, 9 conceived, and 5carried pregnancies to term. 43In a small, con- trolled study, intrauterine infusion of kerosene tomares resulted in the loss of ciliated cells 24 hoursafter treatment. 44From these studies, it is postu- lated that kerosene strips the endometrium of cili-ated cells, possibly cells,resulting in regeneration of the endometrium. Theeffects of kerosene treatment on fertility in maresremains poorly understood. More recently, the use of NAC has been investi- gated as a uterine treatment for reducing mucusexudate. 45NAC, known as the \"mucus dissolver,\" is widely used in human cough preparations becauseof its ability to break disulde bonds in mucus.Additionally documented benets of NAC when usedto treat human medical conditions include anti-in-flammatory and antimicrobial properties. 46The infusion of NAC before breeding has been advocatedin mares with exuberant mucus production or chron-ically barren mares. 39,45Thirty milliliters of 20% NAC solution is added to 150 mL of sterile saline toproduce a 3.3% solution. This solution is infusedinto the mare's uterus. Uterine lavage is per-formed the following day. If mucus is evident inthe uterine lavage effluent, NAC is infused into themare's uterus again. NAC infusions are routinelyfollowed with traditional uterine lavage 24 hoursafter treatment. Recently, the effects of NAC were tested in a population of barren mares to evaluateboth positive and negative properties of this prod-uct. 45Evaluation of endometrial biopsies did not reveal negative effects of NAC on the endome-trium of mares after uterine infusion with theproduct. Endometrial mucus thickness wasfound to be reduced in some treated mares. Lim-ited data regarding pregnancy rates after NACtreatment are available, and additional studiesare required to fully understand the value of this 282 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTTable 1.

For the most part, NAC infusions can be considered to be a harmless treatment thatmight impart positive effects for chronically bar-ren mares with excessive mucus production. Buffered Chelators Buffered chelating agents have been advocated for targeting resistant bacteria, particularly those thatproduce biolm. P. aeruginosa, E.coli, S. epider- mis, and both fungal and yeast species have beenidentied as potent biolm producers. 47Buffered chelators have been examined for treating persistentuterine infections in both cattle and mares. Earlystudies showed that rst-generation Tris-EDTA-buff-ered chelators used in the uterus of mares had no negative effects on the endometrium. 48In vitro, Tris-EDTA reduced the minimum inhibitory concen-tration of P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from mares with endometritis. 49These studies showed that the intrauterine application of Tris-EDTA wassafe and effective against a problematic reproduc-tive pathogen in mares. Additional studies in cat-tle 50showed that Tris-EDTA combined with an antibiotic was more effective at treating bacterialendometritis than antibiotics alone. More recently,a third-generation-buffered chelator ahas shown agentswhen applied to equine keratitis isolates in vitro. 51 Based on these promising results, the use of Tris-EDTA has been advocated for treating chronic uter-ine infections. To date, information about the useof Tris-EDTA for equine uterine infections is largelyanecdotal. The recommended intrauterine proto-col 52is to lavage the uterus with an isotonic solu- tion, infuse 250 to 1000 mL of Tris-EDTA(depending on uterine capacity) into the uterus, andleave overnight. The uterus is lavaged 24 hoursafter the chelator infusion. Antimicrobials may bemixed directly into the chelator solution at the timeof infusion or infused after the removal of the che-lator solution. This treatment is repeated as nec-essary. In most cases of chronic infection,intrauterine treatments are repeated for 3 to 5 days. Immunomodulators Both infectious and noninfectious forms of endometri- tis are thought to result from delayed uterine clear-ance and inflammation. The influx of inflammatorycells into the uterus is necessary for removing harmfulbyproducts of breeding. In some mares, inflamma-tion persists and becomes pathologic. Althoughclearing uterine contents is a central component oftreating this \"susceptible\" population of mares, con-trolling aberrant inflammation is tested for immunomodulatory effects in mares with persistentinflammation. Studies have been highly variable indesign, so the effect of these treatments is difcult todiscern. A recent study that examined the effect ofboth glucocorticoids and MCWEs on the endometrialgene expression of proinflammatory and anti-inflam-matory cytokines in susceptible mares showed a posi-tive effect of glucocorticoids for modulating theinflammatory response after induced infection. 58 Glucocorticoids both decreased proinflammatory cyto-kines and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines afteruterine infusion with E. coli. Both glucocorticoids and MCWEs had a signicant (positive) effect on fluidevacuation and clearance of pathogens after uterineinfusion of E. coli. Evidence-based results from this study implied that immunomodulators had a positiveeffect in improving fertility in previously barren mareswhen administered at the time of breeding. Autologous plasma has been used as an intrauter- ine treatment to supplement complement and im-munoglobulins. These factors are essential forbacterial opsonization which aids in the post-matingimmune response. An adequate response is essen-tial for clearing spermatozoa and bacteria from theuterus. In a large eld study, plasma was used incombination with antibiotics postbreeding. 59Preg- nancy rates per cycle were improved in lactatingmares but only tended to improve in barren maresand had no effect on maiden mares. More recently,platelet-rich plasma (PrP) was used as an intrauter-ine treatment in mares. 60Twenty milliliters of PrP was infused into the uterus of mares 4 hours after articial insemination. Uterine fluid volume, neutrophil, and nitric oxide concentrations were alllower in mares treated with PrP compared withuntreated mares. The authors concluded that treat- ment with PrP reduced the inflammatory responseafter breeding, particularly in mares susceptible toendometritis. In a similar study, mares dened asbeing susceptible to postmating-induced endometritishad better pregnancy rates after treatment withPrP. 61 2. Placentitis Placentitis has been well established as a signicantcause of pregnancy loss in mares. Data collected inNorth America shows that a third of foal deaths inthe perinatal period were attributed to placentitis. 62 A more recent study that examined records of 1800mares during a 24-year period showed a 64% inci-dence of pregnancy loss as a result of placentitis. 63 Of those cases, 80% were caused by bacterial spp., and Staphylococcus aureus are the organisms most often implicated in placentitis. Less commonly, fungal organisms(Candida and Aspergillus spp.) cause placentitis. In North America, particularly in central Kentucky,actinomycete bacteria such as Crossiella equi and Amycolatopsis spp. from placentitis (termed nocardioform placen-titis). More recently, a syndrome was describedin Australia that has components of nocardioformplacentitis and mare reproductive loss syn- 284 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTdrome.64The pathophysiology of this condition is poorly understood. Information from a well-established model of pla- centitis has provided a better understanding of the disease process.65-69Placental infection usually occurs in the last trimester of gestation. In mostcases, bacteria invade the caudal reproductive tractand migrate through the cervix to the placenta.Infective organisms colonize the caudal placenta atthe cervical star and disrupt the intimate contactbetween the allantochorion and endometrium. In-fection induces an inflammatory theproduction cytokines and prostaglandins. Mareswith induced placentitis showed higher and placentas, elevatedconcentrations of prostaglandins E 2and F2/H9251in al- lantoic fluid, and increased duration and intensity ofuterine contractions compared with uninfected, con-trol mares. Resultant uterine contractions causepremature fetal expulsion. Premature deliveryusually precedes fetal exposure to cortisol and mat- urational processes essential for survival. How-ever, activates thehypothalamic pituitary axis, stimulates cortisol re-lease, and induces maturation of the lungs and gutprior to delivery, thus improving foal survival. Histopathologic ndings from the placentitis model revealed bacteria on the chorionic surface,allantoic and umbilical inflammation, and bacterialcolonization in fetal lungs. 69It is postulated that fetal infection occurs when bacteria passes throughfetal membranes and into amniotic fluid that thefetus inhales or swallows. Not all fetuses becomeinfected with placentitis. This scenario is particu-larly true in mares infected with nocardia-type or-ganisms (actinomycete bacteria such as C. equi and Amycolatopsis spp.), in which there is signicant infection and inflammation in the placental tissuesbut not the fetus. Diagnostic Tools for Differentiating Mares With Placentitis Clinical Signs The most common clinical signs of placentitis in- clude premature udder development and purulentvulvar discharge. Vulvar discharge is often therst sign of infection but is frequently undetected ifthe mare's perineal region is not monitored daily. 70 Premature mammary gland development can occurin mares with twin pregnancies as well as in mareswith placentitis, likely as a secondary response toactivation of the hypothalamic pituitary axis. His-torical information regarding breeding and identi-cation of mares with twins helps differentiate thesemares from mares with placentitis. It is notewor-thy that some mares have scant to no vulvar dis-charge present and/or minimal udder developmentbut have fulminant Thesemares may suffer a subclinical infection that resultsin death of the fetus. Alternatively, some mareshave extensive placental separation as a result ofinfection but will deliver viable foals. Mares af-fected with nocardia-form placentitis often have sig-nicant placental compromise at the juncture of theuterine body and pregnant uterine horn and producecopious purulent material. Surprisingly, the fetusis not infected. The inflammation present in nocar-dia-form placentitis induces hypothalamic-pituitaryactivation, which promotes cortisol release and pre-cocious maturation of the foal. These events canimprove foal survival even in the face of earlydelivery. Systemic health is rarely compromised in mares with placentitis. Blood counts, serum chemistryvalues, and blood lactate usually fall within normalranges. Mares will rarely develop a systemic ill-ness similar to metritis when affected with placentalinfections. Transrectal Palpation and Ultrasonographic Examination Transrectal ultrasonography in late gestation is a useful tool for evaluating placental integrity (at thecervical star), fetal activity, and fetal fluid charac-ter. 71Fetal orbit diameter can be measured to es- timate fetal age. The diagnosis of late gestationaltwins is not reliable from a transrectal ultrasono-graphic examination. The caudal aspect of the allantochorion at the cervical star is the most frequently affected area inmares with placentitis because of the ascendingroute of infection. Thoroughly examining this areausing transrectal ultrasonography is critical whendiagnosing placentitis. In normal pregnant mares,the combined uterine and placental (chorioallantoic)unit is measured. Values of the combined thick-ness of the uterus and placenta (CTUP) for mareswith normal pregnancies have been established(Table 2). 71Mares with placental infection or in- flammation will have an increase in CTUP measuresor separation of the membranes with the presence ofpurulent material. 72A 5- or 7.5-MHz linear trans- ducer is placed in the rectum and positioned 5 cm cranial to the cervical-placental junction. The trans-ducer is moved laterally until the large uterine vesselis visible at the ventral aspect of the uterine body.The CTUP is measured between the uterine vesseland allantoic fluid. A minimum of 3 measures shouldbe obtained and averaged. Along with clinical signs,this tool is often the rst line of defense for detectingplacentitis. In one study, 73serial transrectal ultra- sound examinations were performed in mares thatTable 2. Normal Values for Ultrasound Measurement of CTUP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 285IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTwere considered to be at risk for pregnancy loss based on the previous three pregnancies. Treatment wasinitiated in mares with changes to the caudal placen-tal unit (thickening or separation). There was a 3-fold increase in foal survival from mares afterearly detection and treatment for placentitisbased on ultrasonographic changes. These dataillustrate the usefulness of early disease detection through regular screening of mares with a prior his-tory of pregnancy loss. However, there are limita-tions to transrectal ultrasonographic evaluations indetecting placentitis. Changes to the utero-placentalunit can be subtle and not readily detectable until thedisease has advanced. Operator differences or ultra-sound image quality when measuring and interpret-ing the caudal placenta can also affect an accuratediagnosis of placental infection. Ideally, ultrasono-graphic changes to the utero-placental unit should beinterpreted in combination with other diagnostic toolsbefore initiating treatment. Transabdominal Ultrasonographic Examination of the Reproductive Tract Transabdominal ultrasonography is an excellent tool for evaluating fetal well-being, fetal fluid char-acter, and some areas of the placenta. 74,75Fetal health can be assessed through transabdominal ul-trasonographic measures of fetal heart rate, tone,activity, and size. Ultrasonographic examination of the equine abdo- men should be performed using a 2.5- or 3.5-MHztransducer with a depth setting of 20 to 30 cm. 75,76 Although a 5-MHz transducer can be used to mea-sure fetal heart rates in late gestational fetuses, thelimited tissue penetration of this transducer typeprecludes its use for the thorough examination re-quired for detecting twins or performing a completefetal assessment. In most cases, a convex, curvilin-ear, or sector-scanner transducer is used for optimaldepth penetration and image footprint. All fourquadrants of the abdomen should be systematicallyexamined: right cranial, right caudal, left cranial,and left caudal. to the mare's mammary gland toensure that a fetus is detected as early as 90 days ofgestation. The abdomen is scanned in a sagittalplane through all four quadrants because this is themost common orientation of the fetus (cranial oranterior position, sagittal plane) late in gestation.Subsequent scanning in a transverse plane is nec-essary for imaging all aspects of the uterus andconrming the number of fetuses. Using thismethod, both the pregnant and nonpregnant hornscan be evaluated in their entirety and the fetal num-ber determined. Assessing fetal well-being is among the great ad- vantages of transabdominal ultrasound evaluation.The average heart rate in a fetus greater than 300days of gestation is cited as 75 /H110067 bpm, but signif- icant individual variation in heart rates occurs. 74 Fetal heart rate slows by approximately 10 bpm atgreater than 330 days of gestation. Activity levelcan affect fetal heart rate throughout late gestation.Consistently low (/H1102155 bpm) or high (/H11022120 bpm)fetal heart rates are associated with fetal stress andwarrant reexamination and possible intervention. 74 Transabdominal ultrasonography is the most ac- curate method for diagnosing twins in late gesta-tion. Conrmation of twins is generally made byidentifying two fetal thoraces and/or beating hearts.Measurements of fetal thoraces can be used to con-rm the presence of twins if thoracic size differsbetween fetuses. In addition, the orientation of thethorax can be used to verify the presence of twinfetuses. Care must be taken when attempting toverify late-term twins using transabdominal ultra-sonography because imaging through differentplanes can lead one to believe that twins are pres-ent. Systematically examining the maternal abdo-men is critical for properly diagnosing fetal twins. Fetal activity level and tone are easily determined while examining a fetus for heart rate. 74,75Fetal activity can vary during the examination period be-cause fetuses have periods of sleep and wakefulness.In response to the ultrasound beam, the normalfetus commonly becomes very active during the ex-amination period. Fetal \"tone\" is a subjective termthat describes the viability of the fetus. A live fetushas an excellent tone in that it is active and flexesand extends its torso, neck, and limbs. An atonicfetus is flaccid and lies passively within the uterusand may be folded in upon itself. Clearly identify-ing the atonic fetus can be difcult because tradi-tional landmarks, such as the heart, may beobscured by the limbs of the flaccid fetus. The character of the fetal fluids is also evaluated using transabdominal ultrasonography. Ideally,ultrasonographic examination of pregnancy, includ-ing fetal fluids, is performed in the quiet mare andnot immediately after transport or exercise. Theallantoic fluid is generally anechoic (black) toslightly echogenic in late-term mares. Echogenicparticles (snowfall appearance) can be noted aftermaternal or fetal activity but will resolve over time.The amniotic fluid is mildly to moderately echogenic(light gray) in a normal pregnancy. Fluids that arehighly echogenic or consistently have flocculent ma-terial present in the resting mare may indicateinfection. In mares with ascending bacterial pla- centitis, echogenicity of the amniotic compartmentusually increases before changes in the allantoiccompartment. Interestingly, in mares with no-cardia-form placentitis, the amniotic fluid tends toremain normal, but the allantoic fluid becomeshighly echogenic. In normal pregnancies, the chorioallantois is mately associated with the endometrium and cannotbe easily identied as a separate structure. Simi-lar to transrectal evaluation of the utero-placentalunit, mares with normal pregnancies should have aminimal CTUP of 7.1 /H110061.6 mm and maximal /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTphy is also useful for identifying placental thicken- ing and/or separation in mares with placentitisoriginating from a hematogenous infection. In ad-dition, mares infected with the nocardia-form bacte-ria will often have placental separation andpurulent material at the base of the gravid horn andjunction of the uterine body. 10The transabdominal approach is the most accurate means for diagnosingnocardia-form placentitis. Transabdominal ultra-sonography is not a useful tool; however, for evalu-ating the caudal portion of the allantochorion(cervical star area). This area should be evaluatedusing transrectal ultrasonography as described. 2 Serial ultrasound examinations should be per- formed to document changes in fluid character andto verify fetal well-being or distress. Once-dailytransabdominal ultrasonographic assessments arecommonly performed in high-risk mares. Fetusesexperiencing distress are often evaluated severaltimes a day to assess heart rate and activity level. Hormonal Assays and Biomarkers The limitations in sensitivity of clinical or ultrasono- graphic parameters to help rapidly diagnose equineplacentitis have led to the investigation of laboratory- based tests to improve diagnosis. Several hor- monal assays, and more recently blood-basedbiomarkers, contribute information that can im-prove the diagnosis of placentitis. Progesterone Assays Several progestagens are synthesized by the fetopla-cental unit to support pregnancy in the latter two-thirds of gestation. These progestagens aremetabolites of progesterone (P4) Ousey et chromatography- mass to measure serial concentrationsof progestagens throughout pregnancy in mareswith both normal and abnormal pregnancies. Allprogestagens except P4, which was undetectable atall measurement times, rose gradually in mare se-rum as pregnancy advanced. Mares with placenti-tis had higher levels of P4 or P5 compared withnormal, pregnant mares. Mild increases in P4were noted in mares with placental pathology otherthan placentitis. Mares experiencing stress otherthan placentitis (colic, orslightly lower, levels P5 accurate with by the feto-placental unit. To help detect placental pathologyand/or response to therapy, monitoring serial serumprogesterone concentrations 3 to 4 times at 1- to2-day intervals is recommended. These values canbe assessed for trends, including a premature, grad-ual rise (prior to day 300 of gestation) or rapid drop(impending delivery) that may be useful for direct-ing therapies.Estrogens Estrogens are broadly produced in equine pregnancyby the unit. The fetal gonads produceestrogen precursors that are aromatized by the pla-centa to produce a variety of estrogens, 17 /H9251- and 17 /H9252-estradiol, equilin, and equilenin. Estrogen production increases from ap-proximately day 80 of gestation, peaks at 210 days ofgestation, and gradually decreases prior to delivery.High maternal serum estrogen concentrations (usu-ally measured as estrone sulfate or total estrogens)indicate a functional fetoplacental unit and are astrong indicator of fetal viability. The usefulness ofthis tool in detecting and monitoring pregnancyhealth has been less well dened than the measure-ment of serum progestagens. Douglas 78reported that a total estrogen concentration of greater than1000 ng/mL was consistent with a normal pregnancybetween 150 and 280 days of gestation. However,an association was made in mares that had totalestrogen concentrations less than 500 ng/mL andpregnancy loss. The value of measuring estrogensas predictors of placentitis was recently investigatedby workers at the University of Kentucky. 79Es- trone sulfate and 17 /H9252-estradiol sulfate were mea- sured in normal pregnant mares and mares withascending placentitis. Estrone sulfate was notdifferent between groups. 17 /H9252-Estradiol sulfate dropped rapidly after bacterial inoculation in mares,suggesting that this hormone might provide diag-nostic information from mares with placentitis.The authors postulated that hormonal changes innaturally occurring infections might be more subtle,thus affecting the usefulness of measuring 17 /H9252- estradiol sulfate as a diagnostic tool. Relaxin Relaxin is a polypeptide hormone produced by theplacenta. In mares, placental relaxin productionbegins around day 80 of pregnancy and continuesuntil expulsion of the placenta. Relaxin concentra-tions have been advocated as a means of monitoringpregnancy health in mares and other species.Ryan et al. 80used a homologous radioimmunoassay to measure relaxin concentrations in mares withnormal pregnancies and in those with placentitis.They showed a positive relationship between lowmaternal serum concentrations of relaxin and poorpregnancy outcome and noted a high degree of vari-ability in relaxin concentrations in pregnant maresthat they felt negatively affected accurate assess-ment with relaxin. To date, a commercial assay ofthis hormone is not available. Biomarkers Serum biomarkers that reflect the health of the fe- toplacental unit are an area of great interest in bothhuman and equine pregnancies. The scope of bio-markers that have been identied in human preg-nancy is broad, yet similarities between species arelimited. Recently, acute-phase proteins such as se- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 287IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTrum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (indicators of inflammation) have been examined in normal andabnormal equine pregnancies. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent technology, da Silva et al. 81 measured SAA in normal pregnant mares and inmares with experimentally induced placentitis.SAA concentrations were shown to increase dramat-ically in the last 36 hours of normal pregnancy.Mares with placentitis demonstrated a prematurerise in SAA. When SAA concentrations were mon-itored in mares that were treated for placentitis,concentrations were shown to decline in somemares, presumably as a response to treatment.In a similar study, 82SAA, haptoglobin, brinogen, and white blood cell (WBC) counts were monitoredin mares with normal pregnancies and in those withexperimentally induced placentitis. Similar to theprevious study, SAA and haptoglobin increased rap-idly after experimental infection and stayed ele-vated until abortion. However, in contrast to theprevious study, SAA (and haptoglobin) did not riseprior to foaling in normal, pregnant mares. Fibrin-ogen and WBC counts were not affected by infection.Data from these studies demonstrate the usefulnessof SAA as a screening tool for mares with placentitis.Serial measurements that can reveal trends in SAAconcentrations as a result of infection, or in responseto treatment, will likely yield the most useful infor-mation. As with previously validated tests for pla-centitis, changes in SAA concentrations are bestused as an adjunct to ultrasonography and clinicalsigns. Treatment Strategies Therapies for treating mares with placentitis shouldbe selected for efcacy, known pharmacokinetics ofdrugs in pregnant mares, and client compliance foradministration. Although bacterial infection isthought to initiate placentitis, secondary inflamma-tion and prostaglandin production are likely culpritsin the premature delivery of foals. Treatmentstrategies are aimed at addressing infection, inflam-mation, and uterine contractility. Several drugsthat are commonly used in mares with placentitisare listed in Table 3. Some therapeutic agents that are used clinically have been tested for placental passage and improvedfoal viability in normal pregnant and mares affectedwith placentitis. Drugs tested in pregnant maresfor placental passage (with and without placentitis)are compiled in Table 4.

Ceftiofur sodium and ceftiofurcrystalline free acid were also not detected in fetalfluids or placental and fetal tissues. 85Firocoxib, a potent Cox-2-specic prostaglandin inhibitor has re-cently been shown to achieve concentrations in fetalfluids as well as fetal and placental tissues afterbeing administered to normal mares (M. Macpher-son, unpublished data, 2014). It is not clear whatprevented specic drugs from passing across thefetal membranes, but caution should be exercisedwhen using unproven drugs in pregnant mares, par-ticularly when treating for placentitis. Delayed delivery and improved foal survival are important endpoints when treating mares with pla-centitis. Foal viability after mares were treatedwith some drug combinations has been assessed us-ing a model of ascending placentitis. Long-termTMS and pentoxifylline administration tended (P /H11005 .07) to extend gestational length in mares with pla-centitis compared with infected, untreated mares. 86 However, foal survival was not improved in treatedanimals. When progestins (altrenogest) were added to the TMS and pentoxifylline treatment regimen, 10 of 12 (83%) mares delivered viable foals. 87All 5 untreated, infected mares aborted or delivered non-viable foals. This treatment regimen has beenbroadly adopted in clinical practice with varyingresults. One explanation for variations in efcacywhen treating mares for placentitis is the time in-terval from infection to initiation of treatment.In experimental studies, treatment protocols are im-plemented immediately after clinical signs are iden-tied in carefully monitored mares. This approachis difcult to adopt in a clinical setting, and subtlechanges are often missed. Work by Carrick et al. 73 demonstrated the usefulness of early, aggressive ul-trasonographic monitoring of mares in an at-riskpopulation and subsequent early initiation of treat-ment. Mares were examined starting from days150 to 180 of gestation and were examined at leastevery 28 days. Treatment using TMS and altreno-gest was begun at the rst sign of ultrasonographicor physical abnormalities (vulvar discharge, mam-mary development). Live foal delivery rate in thisclinical population improved from approximately25% to greater than 80% using this approach. However, there are limitations to using TMS as a rst-line treatment for mares with placentitis.Advantages of the drug are ease of use (oral), inex-pensiveness, and moderately broad spectrum of ac-tivity. However, studies have shown that TMS isnot consistently effective in eradicating S. equi subsp. vivo despite in vitro suscep- tibility of pathogens and high concentrations of TMSat the site of infection. 88In a placentitis model, more than half of the mares that had been admin-istered TMS had residual bacteria recovered fromthe uterus when cultured within 3 hours of deliv-ery. 87In contrast, uterine swabs obtained from normal foaling mares were negative.89Althoughbeing able to orally administer TMS is a clear ad-vantage, the inconsistent in vivo efcacy of this an-tibiotic against streptococcal organisms underminesits capacity for treating placentitis. Unfortunately,the options for effective antimicrobials that are safefor pregnant mares and are easy to administer arelimited. Parenterally administered drugs such aspenicillin and gentamicin are ideal antimicrobialchoices for the typical bacteria in placentitis, butfrequent dosing, expense, and/or intravenous ad-ministration limit their usefulness. In some cases,it may be prudent to initiate aggressive treatmentwith intravenously administered drugs for a shorterperiod of time (i.e., 2-3 weeks) and continue long-term treatment with orally administered drugs.Long-term therapy proved to be benecial in exper-imental placentitis. In summary, equine placentitis is a challenge both diagnostically and therapeutically. Data regardingtreatment are sometimes conflicting, and results af-ter treatment in a clinical setting can be disappoint-ing. However, salvaging a pregnancy can beenormously rewarding. Ongoing efforts by severalinvestigators are focusing on earlier diagnosticmethods that allow for a more rapid initiation oftreatment and, hopefully, more consistent effects oftreatment. 3. Retained Fetal Membranes Usually mares recover uneventfully after foalingand do not require any specic treatment. How-ever, pathologies that occur in the periparturientperiod can have great consequences for the mareand her future reproductive career. By far, themost common condition that affects postparturientmares is retained fetal membranes. Rapid diagno-sis, resolution, and treatment of retained fetal mem-branes will ensure systemic and reproductive healthof the mare. Etiology The placenta is normally passed between 1 and 3hours after foaling in mares. 90If the membranes are not passed by 3 hours postpartum, the conditionis considered to be emergent. Retained fetal mem-branes, no matter how small the tag of tissue, canresult in endotoxemia or septic metritis, both ofwhich are life-threatening to mares. With propertreatment, most mares will pass the retained tissueand not suffer signicant systemic illness. Retention of fetal membranes postpartum in mares occurs at a higher rate than normal depend-ing on the circumstances. Specic examples wherefetal membranes may be retained include after ce-sarean section, after dystocias or prolonged gesta-tion (such as in fescue toxicity), hydropic conditions,uterine inertia, and advancing age. The associa-tion of so many different conditions with placentalretention is evidence that there are many differentpathogeneses related to the failure of chorioallantoicrelease. The data in the literature about the mech- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 289IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTanism of placental retention are not consistent and contain many discrepancies. Some hypotheses that have been proposed include the following: (1) swelling and disruption of themicroscopic interface between the endometrium andthe chorioallantoic (e.g., inflammation that accom-panies endometritis and/or placentitis, ma-ternal blood flood to the endometrium, or fetal bloodflow to the chorioallantois); (2) abnormal placenta-tion or immaturity of the endometrial/chorionic in-terface; (3) hormonal imbalances that affect thebiology of endometrial epithelial and trophoblastcells; and (4) failure of normal immune/inflamma-tory components involved in normal induction, de-livery, and placental release. Studies that have compared microscopic changes in fetal and maternal tissues between mares thatdeliver their placentas normally and those that haveretained are very few. Some of the ndings aresurprising. A study of endometrial biopsies col-lected on days 3, 6, and 9 days after delivery fromboth normal deliveries (n /H1100529) and mares that went on to retain their placentas for at least 2 hours (n /H11005 9) quantitatively determined changes in granulo-cyte, lymphocyte, macrophage, siderophage, andmast cell populations. 91 In contrast to the expected assumption that one would likely nd differences in the presence of cel-lular inflammation in endometrial tissues of normaland retaining mares, granulocyte numbers decreaseover this time period with no difference betweengroups; in addition, there were no differences in theobserved increase in lymphocytes, macrophages, orsiderophages between groups. Surprisingly, thestudy nd signicantly lower numbers of mastcells in the endometria of retaining mares. Theauthors hypothesized that sufcient numbers ofmast cells are required in the endometrium for thereto be a normal postnatal involutionary period. Diagnosis of Retained Fetal Membranes Examination of the Placenta In the immediate postpartum period, the placenta should be protected from being torn by the mare sothat it can be examined after expulsion. In a nor-mal delivery, the amnion, attached to the umbilicalcord, is the rst portion of the placenta that is visu-alized protruding from the mare's vulva. A com-mon practice is to tie the amnion and any protrudingchorioallantois into a knot, which shortens the mem-brane length and reduces the likelihood of the marestepping on the placenta causing it to tear. Oncethe placenta is passed, it must be evaluated care-fully. The entire placenta should be weighed approximately 11%of the body weight of the foal at birth. 92 Thoroughly examining the placenta after it is passed is probably the most effective means ofdetermining whether a mare has retained fetal membranes. Training farm personnel to performplacental examinations is a simple, effective toolthat can prevent serious illness in mares. A sys-tematic examination of the placenta can be achievedby spreading the chorioallantois in the shape of theletter F, which allows for an inspection of complete-ness (Fig. 3). The amnion is generally attached atthe umbilical cord. It is important when examiningthe placenta to identify two intact and completeuterine horns and to ensure that both tips and anintact uterine body are present. The most commonplace for membrane retention is the tip of the non-pregnant horn (Fig. 4). The placenta should haveruptured at the cervical star region, and this areashould be avillous. Both the chorionic and allantoicsides of the placenta should be inspected for tears,discoloration, thickening, exudate, or plaques, and Fig. 3. Placenta (chorionic side outermost) spread in an F shapeto allow for systematic inspection for completeness. Fig. 4. Retained placenta: tip of nongravid horn. 290 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTthe chorionic surface should be examined for avil- lous areas. When examining a placenta from a mare sus- pected of having placentitis, special attention shouldbe given to abnormalities in the cervical star regionand areas at the base of the gravid horn (nocardia-form placentitis). The amnion should also be in-spected for transparency, meconium staining,plaques, and cysts. The umbilical cord should bemeasured. A common mistake made by farm personnel is to hastily examine the membranes and deem them in-tact or to assume that small tears or missing pieceshave been left in the stall or eld. As a rule ofthumb, one must assume that there are retainedfetal membranes if any portion of the placenta ismissing upon examination. Again, even a smallportion of retained membranes can lead to seriousillness in the mare. Examination of the Mare It is important to examine the overall systemic health of the postpartum mare to help rapidly diag-nose periparturient conditions like retained fetalmembranes. In the most straightforward cases, re-tained fetal membranes will be identied hangingfrom the mare, or missing pieces will be identiedduring the placental examination. Additional diag-nostic tools, including routine blood work and trans-rectal examination of the reproductive tract, can beuseful for determining the cause of postpartum ill-ness in mares. Routine bloodwork in the mare withsuspected retained fetal membranes should includethe following: Complete blood count with differential Blood chemistry Peripheral serum lactate Values from these tests are expected to be withinnormal laboratory ranges for immediate postpartummares. 93Baseline information can prove to be use- ful for comparison to subsequent tests if the marebecomes systemically ill within a few days of foaling.Additional tests that may be useful in the mare withmore advanced illness include abdominocentesis forcytological evaluation and possibly peritoneal lac-tate levels. Samples for microbiology should be col-lected if placentitis or endometritis is suspected.Transrectal ExaminationTransrectal evaluation of the reproductive tract bypalpation and ultrasound should be routinely per-formed in postpartum mares. However, this diag-nostic tool is not foolproof for detecting retained fetalmembranes. The reproductive tract during the im-mediate postpartum period is signicantly enlargedcompared with that found in normal cycling mares.The uterine horns will be enlarged with the previ-ously gravid horn generally twice the diameter asthe nongravid horn. 14The immediate postfoalinguterus will lack tone. Uterine tone increases overtime with the development of palpable rugae as theuterus involutes. In the case of retained fetal mem-branes, uterine tone can be increased or decreased.Interestingly, in some mares with retained pieces ofmembrane, the uterus will have extraordinary tone,possibly from contraction in an effort to expel thetissue tag. Conversely, some mares with retainedmembranes will have a greatly enlarged, fluid-lleduterus. Intraluminal fluid accumulation is simi-larly variable; in the postpartum uterus, 5 to 10 mmof intraluminal fluid is common. Mares with re-tained fetal membranes can have scant to exuberantproduction of fluid. Furthermore, the ultrasono-graphic character of uterine fluid can range fromecholucent to moderately echogenic. In some cases,a tissue piece can be visualized as an echogenicstructure in the uterine body or collapsed lumen of auterine horn. If the uterus is distended with fluid,placental tissue can sometimes be visualized float-ing in the fluid. Although useful at times, ultra-sonographic identication of placental tissue is not areliable means of diagnosing retained fetal mem-branes in mares. Treatment Strategies for Retained Fetal Membranes If fetal membranes are retained for greater than 3hours, treatment options will range from conserva-tive to comprehensive. In any case, the veterinar-ian is obligated to be proactive with treatmentbecause it is impossible to predict which mares willbecome seriously ill if membranes are retained.Oxytocin is often the rst therapy given for treatingretained fetal membranes. Oxytocin promotesuterine contractions and facilitates The duration ofuterine that 10 IU oxytocin administered intrave-nously to 4 normal pony mares 12 hours after foalingresulted in uterine contractions for up to 3 hoursafter administration. In some mares, prolonged,high-amplitude contractions were recorded for 8 to10 minutes after oxytocin administration. Thesedata illustrate how little is known about the effect ofoxytocin administration to mares during the post-foaling period. Practitioners vary greatly in theiruse of oxytocin for mares with retained fetal mem-branes, and delivery methods are largely anecdotal.Dose and route of oxytocin administration include(1) frequent boluses of to 20 IU intravenously or20 to 40 IU intramuscularly every 2 to 4 hours(usually performed in the rst 3 to 6 hours) and (2)a slow infusion of 60 to 100 IU in1Lo fsaline for 30to 60 minutes into5Lo fLRS and administered intravenously at a fluid replacement rate. Daily large-volume uterine lavages with 0.9% sa- line (NaCl) or LRS are a routine part of manage-ment for mares with retained fetal membranes.Sterile fluids can be used for uterine lavage but may AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 291IN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTbe unnecessary because the postpartum uterus houses a mixture of bacteria under normal condi-tions. 95For practical purposes, nonsterile saline can be made in large batches by mixing 35 g of table saltw i t h4Lo ft a pwater, resulting in an approximately0.9% NaCl solution. For most light-breed postpar-tum mares, lavage volumes of up to 10 to 12 L areinfused into the uterus using a sterile/clean naso-gastric tube and stomach pump (Fig. 5). Fluid vol-ume infused into the uterus will vary with mare sizeand uterine capacity. The fluid is delivered into theuterus using a nasogastric tube guarded by the op-erator's hand. Fluid volume is assessed subjec-tively by the operator, who maintains a hand withinthe uterus during the delivery. Once the uterus islled with enough fluid to cause moderate disten-tion, the operator carefully guards the tip of thenasogastric tube to prevent the uterus from beingdamaged during the siphon process. The tube isplaced ventral into the fluid pool, and fluid is si-phoned from the uterus with careful attention to bitsof tissue that are expelled. The procedure is re-peated several times until tissue is recovered or fluidruns clear. Recovering lavage fluid when retainedmembranes are present is often complicated by tis-sue occluding the tip of the tube, thus impedinglavage. Carefully guarding the end of the tube witha gloved hand allows lavage of the uterus; however,it may result in the recovery of small volumes offluid at a time. Although tedious, uterine lavage isessential for treating mares with retained fetalmembranes. Several additional procedures have been advo- cated to promote mechanical release of the fetalmembranes. One technique, termed the \"Burn'sTechnique\" 96involves distention of the chorioallan- tois to promote microvilli from theendometrium and subsequent placental release.The chorioallantois must be intact for this procedureto be effective. The chorioallantois is distendedwith large amounts (up to 12 L) of fluid through alarge bore nasogastric tube and tied with umbilicaltape or held closed with the operator's hand. Somehave suggested clamping the tube and allowing themare to exercise for several minutes in a round pen.The technique is thought to stimulate endogenousoxytocin and uterine contractions thus promotingexpulsion of the membranes. An additional benetis thought to be the natural separation of villi fromthe endometrium resulting in more complete re-moval of villi after lavage. The method is practicaland effective, particularly when used in uncompli-cated cases of retained fetal membranes (i.e., thosenot resulting from dystocia, placentitis, cesareansection etc.). The limitation of this procedure isthat it is only effective with intact fetal membranes. Recently, Meijer et al. 97demonstrated a variation on umbilical vessel infusion that has been used tosuccessfully remove retained fetal membranes inmares. This type of procedure has been describedin cattle 98and mares99,100using collagenase. The modied technique described by Meijer et al. utilizesa stallion catheter (or tube with a similar diameter)attached to a garden hose tting with a stopcock(Fig. 6) that is then attached to a simple gardenhose. An incision is made into one of the umbilicalvessels, and the stallion catheter is threaded intothe vessel as far as possible. The hose adapter isturned on, and the vessel is infused with waterunder low pressure while also occluding the outflowfrom the vessel. Infusion continues for approxi-mately 5 minutes or until fluid begins to reflux.At the same time, gentle traction is placed on themembranes. The membranes separate from the en- dometrium and are slowly removed from the uterus Fig. 5. Equipment for large-volume uterine lavage to aid in theremoval of retained placenta.

This procedure works most reliably with a placenta that has not been retained fora long period of time (8-12 hours or less). As withany removal procedure, the membranes should be ex-amined carefully once removed to ensure that pieceswere not retained. In the case of a small tag of placental tissue at- tached deep in the uterus, removal can be muchmore challenging. Routine procedures rarely workbecause the tag is often attached at the tip of auterine horn where it remains out of reach or ven-tral in the uterus. The tissue often remains in theuterus until necrosis of the microvilli occurs and thetissue is released. Even after release from the en-dometrium, the tissue is frequently not expelled be-cause of its dependent location in the uterine lumen.Daily uterine lavage is performed to encourage de-tachment of the tissue from the endometrium, re-move uterine contaminants, and aid in tissueremoval. Although somewhat controversial, exteri-orizing the tissue tag and placing a small amount ofweight on the tissue may facilitate release and re-moval. One approach is to attach a small plasticbottle with approximately 150 mL of water to theplacental tag with suture material or umbilical tape.Alternatively, some will use a rectal sleeve lledwith a small amount of lubricant gel (Fig. 7). Thegoal is to apply gentle but persistent tension onthe tissue tag to promote release. Caution must beused with the amount of weight attached to theplacental tag so that uterine eversion or prolapse isavoided. Mares with small weights attached to fe-tal membranes should be observed closely until thetissue is released. Manual retrieval of fetal membranes is another con- troversial means of removing retained membranes.Complications cited with manual removal include re-tention of microvilli and/or tissue tags, hemorrhage,and damage to the endometrium. 101More recent re- ports102,103suggest that, in experienced hands, man- ually removing retained fetal membranes does notimpair future fertility of mares. In both reports, theprocedure was performed during the immediate(within 2 hours) postfoaling period. In one study, 103 the membranes were removed from the recumbentmare immediately after foaling. The chorioallantoicportion of the placenta was grasped at the distal por-tion at the vulva or within the caudal vagina. was exteriorized by pulling gently but rmlywhile the villi detached from the endometrium. Oth-ers describe mild to moderate twisting of the chorio-allantois or manually separating the chorion from theendometrium by passing a hand between the two sur-faces. 94In all cases, excessive force or traction are not recommended. Other treatments that are frequently administered to mares include the following (particularly in cases ofdystocia, prolonged retention, or cesarean section): Systemic antibiotics to prevent bacterialgrowth for at least 5 to 7 days Anti-inflammatory drugs prevent endotox-emia and laminitis (flunixin meglumine, 23%calcium borogluconate added to 5-L fluids) Icing feet to prevent laminitis (ice bags orboots placed around the feet and changed ev-ery 2 hours) Exercise in mares with retained fetal membranes isessential for promoting uterine contractions and ex-pelling the membranes. Exercise should be con-trolled and in an area where the mare can beobserved for the possibility of uterine prolapse.Exercise is contraindicated in mares at risk forlaminitis. With prompt treatment and resolution, most mares that retain fetal membranes will return to good repro-ductive health. It has been suggested 91,104-106that mares with retained fetal membranes are not goodcandidates for breeding on foal heat. However, onestudy 102showed no effect of membrane retention on pregnancy rates when mares were bred on foal heat.Each mare should be approached individually whenbreeding after retained fetal membranes. A rea-sonable compromise would be to allow the mare toundergo a rst ovulation and induce luteolysis withprostaglandin, thus shortening the interval to a sec-ond estrus period postpartum.

Theriogenology Molecular PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH INTERACTIVE: REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS - PATHOLOGY TO TREATMENTWhy Are Working Equids Still Important to Us and Are We Forgetting Them? Derek C. Knottenbelt, DVM&S, DECEIM, MRCVS We need to care about the horses in our own countries but we also have to recognize that there arecountless millions of people who rely for their livelihoods, and even for their lives, on the strength andcompanionship of horses, mules, and donkeys. Author's address: Philip Leverhulme Equine Hos-pital School \u00a9 2015 There are estimated 100 million working equids in the world. Working equids are a source of nan-cial stability for families and they relieve humanburdens, for women and children in particular. Mules and donkeys in particular play a pivotal role in developing rural communities across theworld. They are indispensable as farming andworking animals and their health status is impor-tant to the owners/users. 1They play a funda- mental role in individual family prosperity and inthe local and national economies. Indeed, itcould be said that if the working horse (donkey)were to be removed from society, the economy ofthe world would collapse. Whereas in our devel-oped societies the horse has become a nonessen-tial, leisure part of society, the working equidremains one of the strongest pillars of society inthe developing world. The health and welfare ofhorses and donkeys relies upon available veteri-nary support, just as it does in our society. Al-though enormous resources and attention arefocused on ruminant medicine and disease control,very little effort or resource is applied to the work-ing horse. Very few countries and government leaders seem to recognize the value of the workinghorse. Almost every developing country has a state vet- erinary service and almost all have at least oneveterinary university (and often several/many).However, it is a matter of enormous regret andconcern that in the large majority of cases, neitherthe state nor the universitie seems to have a signif-icant grasp of the importance and relevance of theworking horse in their own societies. There is amassive need for a better \"image\" of the workingequid. Indeed, quite commonly, the owners of equids themselves have scant regard for the needs ofthe animal. Usually, it is only when things gowrong that the signicance of the contribution madeby the animal is appreciated by either the societyitself or the individual. What, for example, would happen if a devastating fatal disease such as African Horse Sickness were to decimate the working horsesand donkeys of Ethiopia? The state economy wouldsurely suffer, but more signicantly, the individualowners would suffer. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 297EQUITARIAN SESSION NOTESWhat is the Role of the Working Horse/Donkey? The working equid provides mobility and power and relieves human burden. A working equid requireslittle maintenance and certainly no spare parts orcarbon-based fuel. The working equid in particularrelieves the physical burden that is predominatelycarried by women and children. 2. What Key Veterinary Interventions Are Required? The health of the working equid is a veterinarymatter. Health is dependent upon many differentfactors including the prevention of epidemic disease,the control of endemic infections, and the provisionof emergency care for sick or injured equids. The truth is that most working equids are owned by people who lack the nancial means to pay for, orto access the information needed on harnessing, nu-trition, vaccinations and drug treatment. Single-owner farms are often remote from veterinaryservices, thereby requiring greater emphasis on pre-ventive measures and local remedies. There is no benet in gratuitous criticism or fail- ure to recognize the economic, social, cultural, andreligious environments in which the owners/userslive and prosper. Carefully planned, sympatheti-cally delivered programs for health care and welfareimprovement must be undertaken. This meansthat the needs of the animals and the people must beconsidered together by people who understand theinevitable constraints that face communities in thedeveloping world. 3. Why Should We Bother to Try to Improve the Welfare of Working Equids? It is certainly true that a healthy working animal contributes more to its owner and society than anunhealthy/injured one. In some countries manyolder, injured, or diseased horses and donkeys mustwork and so they are forced into a compromisedwelfare position. The challenges that face individuals and organi- zations that worry about the welfare of the animalsare enormous. It is easy to criticize the welfarestatus and care of the animals, but gratuitous, ill-informed, and domineering advice based upon littleunderstanding of the circumstances prevailing doesno service to the animals or the owners or, indeed, tothe critic. Over the next 50 years, if changes in climate and availability of fuels continue, it is likely that morepeople, not fewer, will come to depend on workinganimals. The Equitarian Initiative is the embryoof a philosophy and a working practice that needs tobe disseminated much wider than it is now. 4. How Can We Do Better for the Working Animals in the Developing World? First, individually and corporately, we can recognize the pivotal role the horse/donkey has in local andnational economies, and acknowledge that these an-imals are owned by individuals who depend on theseanimals for their livelihood. The concept held bymuch of the developed world that the use of workingequids is basically cruel is fundamentally wrongbecause it takes no account of the particular circum-stances. There is personal responsibility and a cor-porate/national obligation to further the welfare ofworking animals in particular. Even if it is simplya pragmatic nancial decision rather than an emo-tive/empathetic one, we have to do better. The veterinary profession must be proactive in education of equine veterinarians and technicians,owners, and ultimately, of course, of the major deci-sion makers and law makers. These are enormouschallenges for the veterinary profession. Thereare, for example, religious and cultural taboosagainst euthanasia, as well as a vast array of irra-tional treatments given to sick or injured animals.It is easy to criticize such treatments and taboos, butunless we are willing to devote time, energy, andresources into changing attitudes and behaviors,and we are willing to engage nonjudgementally andpositively with societies, it is not productive to sim-ply criticize them. The level of service and the choice of treatment available to a horse in the United Kingdom orUnited States are impressive. The array of diag-nostic tests, procedures, and evidence-based thera-peutic interventions means that equids in theseplaces get the very best care and chance of recoveryfrom disease that is available. However, criticizingpeople for doing what they have done for centuries isneither helpful nor will it bring any change. Onecould make a persuasive argument that the bestavailable veterinary attention should be transferredfrom the multi-million dollar racehorse (upon whichlavish attention is applied but which is a playthingwithout real social value in human terms) to theworking donkey (upon which the education and pos-sibly the lives of four small children depend). To positively affect change, engagement and dia- log with practical, positive, and achievable advice isrequired. Recent intervention studies relating tothe perceptions and needs of simple people who relyon working equids have conrmed that appropriateand focused engagement brings welfare, social, andeconomic rewards. 2Set against that, there is much evidence that supports the concept that some inter-ventions do not help. Random anthelmintic treat-ments and the irrational use of multivitamins andantibiotics to horses and donkeys clearly serve nouseful purpose in improving either general heath orwelfare. Indeed, the irrational or irresponsible useof drugs of any sort could be seen to be actuallycounter to the long-term health of the population. Simply offering advice will not bring sustainable change. A rural farmer in Mali or Ethiopia or Indiawho has little education and even less understand-ing of the concepts of animal welfare (in respect ofhis/her equid) does not want words. He wants ac-tion and solid evidence that what is being suggested 298 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEQUITARIAN SESSIONis both realistically achievable and benecial. If welfare organizations fail to provide a \"flagship\" ser-vice that demonstrates the benet of veterinary in-tervention, there will be no sustainable response.The provision of \"primary rst aid\" and routine pro-phylactic treatment for working animals servesmany purposes, even though it does itself not bringhuge benets. There would seem to be little pointin treating an individual donkey for parasites whenhis environment is worm ridden and he gets littleother help. However, visible veterinary attention does have many benecial effects, including improving respectfor the animal, elevating the position of veterinari-ans and in the end, increasing the job satisfaction ofthe veterinarian. If any animal in the world needsthe very best diagnostic and therapeutic interven-tions it is the working animal, an animal upon whichlives and opportunity depend. Key veterinary interventions will vary widely ac- cording to the local circumstances. Broster et al 3 identied the extent of the veterinary welfare issuesfacing working horses. In some circumstances,vaccination against epidemic disease or against dis-eases that are locally signicant can be critical.For example, historically in Mali, tetanus was a verysignicant cause of both morbidity and mortality inthe working donkey population. A simple vaccina-tion program rapidly resulted in a virtually 100%prevention of this otherwise highly fatal disease. 4 This simple intervention brought signicant bene-ts but required signicant logistic organization andsome investment. Did it work? Yes it did. Wasit worth it? Yes it was. In Ethiopia, epizootic lymphangitis (histoplasmo- sis) is a massive issue. It is clear that vaccinationwould require considerable development involvingsignicant funding, so a policy of euthanasia of se-verely affected horses has been introduced and issupported by government. This has resulted in sig-nicant benet with fewer new cases being reported.Better awareness has signicantly improved thewelfare situation for all animals. In a study by Popescu et al, 5697 working horses were assessed by using observation, behavioraltests, clinical examinations, and questionnaires.In working horses, it is clear that the heavier thework they perform, the more important it is forhorse owners/breeders/farmers to ensure that theirwelfare needs are addressed to help them cope withthe multiple specic risks imposed by their work.In recognizing this, we raise the standard of animalwelfare while reducing human burden at the sametime. There are few studies on the benets of either education or veterinary input. The need for moni-toring has been highlighted by Upjohn et al. 6Pear- son7described the outcomes of interventions directed at health and husbandry improvements toworking animals in Africa and suggested that inter-ventions were capable of bringing long-term im-provement in both the welfare of working animalsand the economic circumstances of the users. The challenges that face all of us who work with working equids in the developing world are enor-mous. The rst priority is to identify the problems(local and regional) and then devise denite, achiev-able, sensible, and legally binding strategies to ad-dress them. Without that fundamental legalsupport, it is hard to see how progress is going to bemade. Continued reliance on nongovernmental or-ganizations that depend on donation income will notbring permanent change. Governments must rec-ognize the need and the obligation to address thebroad issues relating to working animal welfare.Education is probably the most basic requirementbut education alone does not always overcome habit,prejudice, or antagonism. Education needs to startwith children but must involve all levels of society atthe same time. It is easier to \"teach\" a child empa-thy than it is to get an old farmer to change hisdonkey's harness, even if there are nancial re-wards. Old habits die hard. 5. How Can Veterinary Interventions Be Better Coordinated With Other Intervention Methods? Given that it is clear that the use of working animals is going to continue into the indenite future world-wide, 8we have to make critical decisions on the roles that each of us, individually and corporately, canplay in this overall situation. We can individuallyand corporately put pressure on governments tosupport sensible preventive medical and veterinarycare. We must emphasize the role of the workingequid in society and we must try to generate legis-lative support for the equine species in the economicstructure of the countries concerned. Although wecan cynically suggest that the development of a vac-cine for African Horse Sickness and epizootic lymp-hangitis would be best driven forward by the fearthat these infections would spread to the developedworld, it would be far better if the vaccines weredeveloped to improve the societies where the diseaseis endemic, and so by extrapolation, reduce the riskof spread of the disease. Burn et al 9explored environmental factors asso- ciated with potential welfare problems in workingequids, with the laudable intention of targeting wel-fare interventions toward the most vulnerable ani-mals. In this study, hoof and limb problems werefound in 90% of animals and 85% of working equidswere thin. Older, thin animals in poor conditionhad the most problems. Equids used to transportpeople or goods by cart, or by pack, or those requiredto work in brick kilns had more problems than oth-ers. Rural horses and donkeys had more problemsthan urban ones, but urban animals had more obvi-ous skin and other lesions, and were generally lesswell behaved. All equids were signicantly thinnerin warmer climates. These results provide signi-cant guidelines for potential interventions leading toimprovements in welfare. However, the complexity AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 299EQUITARIAN SESSIONof the circumstances and the wide variations in en- vironmental conditions, workload, management,and veterinary care availability make it almost im-possible to create standardized measures that wouldbe applicable in every circumstance. The only peo-ple qualied to provide individualized advice andsupport are the local veterinary and paraveterinaryprofessionals. That means they must be properlysupported and trained as well. We understand the balance between a horse and the owner/user. We understand the needs of the injured or sick animal and the consequences of thaton the owner. If we help one family, we have madea contribution. If we help hundreds, we have donewell. If we help millions, we can stand proud andproclaim that we have made a difference to theworld. Governments and communities must be encour- aged to support the working horse. We should beproud of our relationship with horses and we shouldstrive to develop a universally more sympatheticattitude. The drive for this must come from gov-ernments and from international organizations suchas the United Nations and Organization of AfricanUnity.

Lifestyle, economics,and the conditions in which people live and work strongly influence their health. When a person'slivelihood is dependent on a working equid's contributions to the household, one can understand howworking equid health, human livelihoods, and ultimately human health are intimately linked in manycommunities.

Introduction A working equid is any horse, donkey, or mule that provides labor for its human counterparts and com-munities. Working equids and other draft animalsremain essential forms of labor, draft, and income inmany communities around the developing world.In 2013, the Food and Agriculture Organization re-ported that there are approximately 112 millionworking equids in the developing world. 1Up to 80% of work power on farms in developing countriesis provided by draft animals and humans. 2 In some countries, the number of working equids is increasing despite advances in mechanization andurbanization. 1These animals provide draft power; work in the tourism industry; transport produce andgoods to market; and function as the school bus,water tanker, tractor, milk truck, and garbagehauler, among other tasks. Up to 28% of theworld's arable land is worked by draft animals; thisdirectly or indirectly serves up to two billion people. 3 To replace this animal labor with mechanized, mod-ern power equipment would be extremely costly,unsustainable in its reliance on mechanical mainte- nance and fossil fuels, and cause a loss of the tradi-tional methods and values of farming. Manyfamilies in disadvantaged, marginalized communi-ties are heavily dependent on the income providedby the power and work of their working equids.An African proverb illustrates the importance ofworking equids well: \"A woman who has no donkeyis a donkey.\" 4 The labor of a working equid is particularly useful for reducing the burden of work for women and children performing daily chores. If the animal isunable to work, then the labor is frequently per-formed by a woman or child in the family, therebyremoving them from other activities such as wageearning or attending school. Researchers from TheBrooke have found in some communities that own-ing a working equid improves social standing andprovides opportunities to contribute to the commu-nity within certain social circles. 5 Conversely, dependence on working animals in many countries can carry a stigma that may be AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 301EQUITARIAN SESSION NOTESdifcult to overcome. Media and society around the world often associate animal traction as old fash-ioned and associated with poverty and ignorance. 4 In many societies, donkeys are traditionally per-ceived negatively. This in turn, adversely affectshow their owners and users are perceived by societyat large, and can explain, at least in part, why thissubsection of society could be neglected by policies orsocial schemes. 6 2. Social Determinants of Health Lifestyle and the conditions in which people live andwork strongly influences their health. A person'slivelihood may be directly dependent on a workingequid's contributions to their household survival.Working equids may also enable access to health services or social support networks. Consideringthe social determinants of health as outlined inthe World Health Organization document, The Solid Facts, a strong case can be made for therelationship between working equids and humanhealth with nine of the 10 social determinants ofhealth, including: 7 The social gradient: disadvantaged and mar-ginalized communities have worse outcomes. Stress: anxiety, insecurity, social isolation,lack of control over work and more can causelong-term stress with powerful negative effectson health. Early life: multiple long-term health effectsare a result of poor antenatal and early child-hood health. Social exclusion: poverty and social exclusionhave negative effects on health. Work: workplace stress increases the risk ofdisease. Unemployment: higher rates of unemploy-ment are related to increased illness and pre-mature death. Social support: strong support networks andfriends improve health. Addiction: drug, alcohol and tobacco use isinfluenced by the individual's environment. Food: food security and a nutritious diet areessential for health and wellbeing. Transport: healthy forms of transport in-clude walking, biking, and public transit use. Although working equids are essential to some people's livelihoods and survival, there is sometimesa stigma faced due to that dependence. Workingequid owners are often lower in the social gradient,under social and economic stress, and may be so-cially excluded. If a working equid is unable toperform, a child or woman may have to take overthat duty, which can adversely affect their early life. Nevertheless, the use(s) of a working equid con- tribute both to work and employment in the familyor community. If a working equid is injured orunable to perform, and if a replacement is not read-ily available, this may immediately translate into unemployment or lost income and time. Workingequids are essential for providing food and for trans-port in some communities. They have an unquan-tied but essential contribution to food security onboth a local and global level. Working equids cancontribute to a household's social capital and respectwithin a community. Not forgotten is the human-animal bond that can be particularly powerful be-tween an owner or caretaker and their equid. 3. A Selection of Recent Evidence Invisible Helpers, Voices from Women InternationalReport: Women's views on the contributions ofworking donkeys, horses and mules to their lives. 5 This qualitative research project was based on focusgroup discussions and interviews with women-onlygroups in Ethiopia, Kenya, India, and Pakistan.The data revealed the critical nature of workingequids in supporting household livelihoods. It alsochallenged previous assumptions and preconceivedideas about livestock and gender roles in the fourcountries evaluated. Potential relationships be-tween working equid health and human healthcould be extrapolated from two of the primary re-search objectives. These were to understand, froma women's perspective: \"The specic roles thatworking donkeys, mules and horses play in support-ing the lives of women across four countries,\" and\"How the welfare status of working equids affectsthe amount and type of support they provide towomen.\" 5 Quotations from focus group discussions provided substantial evidence to support associations be-tween working equids, livelihoods and the health ofwomen and children. \"The donkey affects each and every aspect of my life as a woman. On a typical day, the donkey fetcheswater, which I use to do the laundry, to do the dishes,to clean the house, and for bathing. It also fetchessawdust which I use to cook all meals, then I hire itout and it brings in income on a daily basis that I useto buy flour for the evening meal.

Understanding the Association Between WorkingEquid Health and Human Health in RuralNicaragua A mixed methods (both quantitative and qualitative) research project 8was performed in two rural regions of Nicaragua in January 2014. Data were collectedat an annual mobile veterinary clinic for equidsworking predominantly as pack animals carryingagricultural goods (coffee, plantains, milk, etc.) inmountainous environments. A cross-sectional, ver-bal, Spanish-language survey was given to a conve-nience-sampled population of owners (n /H1100570) presenting to the clinic. Information collected in-cluded basic demographics, standard-of-livingmarkers, access to health services, perceptions ofworking equid value, and human personal health-related quality of life measures. Anthropometricgrowth data on children (n /H1100520) of the families who completed the survey were also measured. A 25-point grading scale for measuring working equidhealth, based on ve separate criteria (includingbody condition score, integument, lameness, har-ness/tack sores, and hoof quality) was developed bythe author. The criteria were chosen based on pre-vious working equid health assessment research,existing literature, and clinical experience. Thisgrading scheme was applied to animals (n /H11005132) presenting to the veterinary clinic. Results A total of 70 surveys were completed. Twenty-twopercent of respondents who reported an annual in-come (n /H1100531) lived on less than $1.25/day. Seven- ty-four percent of respondents strongly agreed thatthe health of their working equids affected thehealth of their family. The most common humanhealth concerns were upper respiratory tract infec-tion, cough, fever, and diarrhea. Nineteen boysand one girl between 6 and 14 years of age wereevaluated for anthropometric growth indicators.Two children (10%) were classied as underweight,with a weight-for-age z score (WAZ) less than /H110022 standard deviations. WAZ is a measure thatindicates either past or present undernutrition. 9 One of these children was classied as stunted,with a height-for-age z score (HAZ) less than /H110022 standard deviations, indicating chronic malnutri-tion. 9Seven additional children (35%) children had HAZ and WAZ between /H110022 and /H110021. One hun- dred thirty two working equids (81% horses, 14%mules, and 5% donkeys) were scored using the 25-point scale. Mean working equid health score was19.19 (of 25), with a mean body condition score of 3.8of 9 (range, 1-7 using the Henneke Scale). Themost common equid health concerns reported werehoof problems, ticks, respiratory illness, and lame-ness. Bivariate analysis between working equidhealth score and human health score showed a sig-nicant association (P /H11005.052). This association remained positive but lost signicance after control-ling for age and education. There was a strongtrend toward a signicant association between meanworking equid health score and childhood malnutri-tion (P /H11005.2); however, small sample size precluded rigorous statistical analysis for this aspect of thestudy. No signicant linear association was foundbetween working equid health score and wealthindex. This study was limited by several factors, primar- ily sample size, sampling technique, the presence ofmultiple sampling locations, and the use of an un-validated scale for working equid health. However,based on this author's clinical experience, the mostcommon health concerns facing the majority ofworking equids in developing areas are similar, es-pecially in other areas of the world with limitedroads and high human dependency on the labor ofworking equids. The relationships explored in thestudy are, in the author's opinion, mediated largelythrough livelihoods. Research into the relation-ships between livestock, livelihoods, human health,food security, and nutrition is a growing eld withinthe development community. Needless to say,these are complicated relationships with many vari-ables that are difcult to tease apart from one an-other; this study provided some insight into theserelationships but also opened the door for morequestions. 4. Conclusion Growing numbers of veterinary and animal welfaregroups are becoming involved with working equidsby providing humane treatment, owner education,and policy advocacy in support of working equidsand their owners worldwide. These efforts are wor-thy, essential causes in the elds of animal welfare,poverty alleviation, and sustainable development.Such work should continue to be supported by pri-vate donors, as well as garner increased supportfrom governments and international aid agencies.Many of the working equid welfare groups cite notonly the obvious animal welfare concerns, but alsoowner dependency on their horses, donkeys, andmules for household survival, as key reasons to workin these elds. The complexity of the relationships between work- ing equid health, socioeconomic status, and humanhealth is clear. The body of evidence documentingthe importance of working equids to human liveli-hoods and less directly, human health is growing;however, much more work is needed. Respect forall living beings and a love of working equids andtheir owners drive those working in this eld. Thislove and respect could inspire additional studies inpopulations of working equids and their owners.

Merriam DVM, MS The goal of most relief or humanitarian works or projects on a global scale is to provide immediate aidor support for crises and follow on with support that allows capacity building from within the affectedarea. The long-term goal is often to empower local or national infrastructure to continue once theshort-term support is ended or transferred. And yet for many reasons, this is very rarely the casethat a clean end to a project is actually achieved and local providers sustain long-term rebuild-ing.

Background Project Samana was begun in 1993 with the supportof the Massachusetts Veterinary Medical Associa-tion (MVMA) in response to a request received froma Dominican veterinarian seeking assistance in an-imal control and humane issues including workingequids in distress. The MVMA was actively seek-ing a partner for some organizational outreach andthe call came in at an opportune time. Three mem-bers and two technicians went on the rst visit toassess and begin the work. Samana is a peninsula well known for its beauty, beaches, mountain water-falls, and a heavy concentration of agriculture in theform of coconuts, cacao, plantain, coffee, and ba-nanas. These were all moved on the local workingequids, primarily horses, a few mules and some don-keys. In addition, tourism was growing as roadsbecame passable and the working animals often diddouble duty carrying tourists up steep trails to thewaterfalls, or on beach rides. There was consider-able concern from the government tourism ofcialsabout stray dogs scaring tourists, as well as being apool of endemic rabies. An ecotourism agency inSamana, El Centro para la Samana \u00b4 su Entorno(CEBSE), was working on regional water quality.However, CEBSE was mainly concerned with thelocal marine environment and its effects on whale watching in the Bay of Samana. Exploitation of thewaterfalls by overzealous tour operators offering AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 305EQUITARIAN SESSION NOTEShorseback rides on chronically malnourished and overworked animals also was recognized by CEBSEas a critical problem. Thus, Project Samana wasformed with local support and understanding thatMVMA would provide otherwise-unavailable veter-inary services and training once and later twice ayear. We agreed to work with and under the direc-tion of our local veterinarian and the internation-al nongovernmental organization (NGO) CEBSE.They provided follow-up and logistical support. 3. Results As Project Samana matured, it became the largestand most active committee in MVMA. It was oftenoversubscribed with potential veterinary and tech-nician volunteers and evolved a strong donor basethat allowed equipment purchases and student sup-port. Project Samana soon overwhelmed the capac-ity of the original local organizers to absorb all of theaid. Formation of a local Humane Society, a gov-ernment-backed rabies immunization program, andthrough CEBSE, the formation of a horse tourismorganization, began to help local individual animalowners to join together to provide healthy animalsfor work. The CEBSE group, with our help, began to keep records on each animal seen, especially with regardsto body condition scoring, presence of saddle sores,lameness, hoof problems, and general health. Theteam was able to inspect animals at each visit andprevent those with sores from working until healedand cleared by a CEBSE volunteer. This alone wasincentive to use proper tack and feeding. Ourteams provided anthelmintics, appropriate care ofsores and other problems, as well as nutritionaladvice and support. The team veterinarians wereable to introduce \"chop and carry\" (Fig. 1) with in-troduction of appropriate grasses and encourageowners to purchase and store hay when available.Other local feedstuffs such as coconut berries, ricehulls, and some pelleted feeds became available asdemand grew. Proper farriery was introduced via several work and training days (Figs. 2 and 3). A skilled farrierfrom the show horse region near the capital, SantoDomingo, was hired to come and work with ourvolunteer veterinary podiatrist in several differentlocales. Ultimately, one local student was selectedfor a 6-month preceptorship with the farrier in thecapital, and supported by team funds. The planwas for him to then come back to his village andwork for the tourist horses. This was not successfuldue to injury, but is still an ongoing effort. The project partially succeeded in its early goal of training Dominican veterinarians and students inclinical skills appropriate to their own levels. There Fig. 2.

Most graduatesare didactically competent, but have little clinical ex-posure. Many go on to become proprietors of dispen-saries that sell antibiotics and supplies and mayprovide some vaccinations. Others go on to servelong preceptorships with the few established practicesor work in regulatory capacity for the government.Only a few of the students who visited had any interestin equine practice. One of the most requested ser-vices was castration and to date the team has cas-trated well over 1200 animals. Team presence in thearea two times a year has put the few local (nonvet-erinary) \"castrators\" out of business for the most part.Clients are now used to the bloodless Henderson pro-cedure and wait for \"la machina\" until the team comesagain. The U.S. veterinarians have trained severalDominican veterinarians in the Henderson proceduresand they are totally competent. There is twice-yearlyinteraction with the Universidad Pedro HernandezUriel veterinary school in the form of clinical skillsseminars and lectures (Fig. 4). There are usually oneor two vets or vet students present at all our clinicalsites. Over the 23 years of Project Samana, more than 240 veterinarians have come at least one time, manyhave continued as regular participants. Studentnumbers have been even greater. Veterinary tech- nician numbers have been fewer, under 200. A par-allel team of small-animal veterinarians haveperformed an average of 250 surgeries per trip.Each trip also entails administration of direct careand some preventive treatments to an average of225 working equids (based on actual counts in re-cent years, and doses of anthelmintic in earlieryears). They are now widely available, affordableand effective. With the local availability of anthel-mintics, this service is no longer offered. For the long term, the use of working equids in the communities served is slowly changing tourism-based economy, with crop transport occurring asneeded seasonally in most areas. Mechanization isunlikely due to terrain and economics. There willbe a demand for more veterinary services as the Project Samana team works to transition to morelocal providers. One local mixed animal practice iscurrently subsidized. Current investigations andsurveys of the population are being conducted fol-lowing the models of other organizations, to assessfuture needs and planning. 5-7 The leadership of Project Samana is looking at several potential models to create sustainability.Community interviews and needs assessments areongoing to determine which model or combination ofmodels will be most effective: Direct payment to a local veterinarian for eachanimal operated or treated. (This is beingdone currently by a German charity for small-animal spay/neuter.) Subsidization of an ambulatory unit, includingsupplies, by a hired or per-diem Dominicanveterinarian. Continued support by visiting teams, with feesbeing charged and donated to the local hu-mane society or horsemen's cooperative. The success of Project Samana presents the questionas to why the team veterinarians are still doing this.First, capitalism only works in situations wherethere is sufcient disposable income to be applied toa desired procedure or action that will allow a directreturn on the investment. Deworming a horse andfloating its teeth will show some benets over time,but will not make the animal immediately moreattractive or usable for work. Second, local or na-tive veterinarians must be paid sufciently for thework or they will gravitate toward more lucrativevenues. Third, if free or low-cost/high-quality in-terventions are available twice a year, waiting forthem is a desirable option. Fourth, training veter-inarians and students is a desirable and achievablegoal as they become familiar with the great needsand are motivated to do more throughout their ca-reer. Teaching altruism through action is a validoutcome. Fig. 4. Professionals pass along their skills. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 307EQUITARIAN SESSION4. Conclusions The Project Samana veterinarians will continue and perhaps even escalate their presence in the regionuntil the local horsemen can support local, well-trained vets. The needs of working equids throughout the world are real and veterinarians have an obligation toassist in their care. Opportunities for learning, cul-tural exchanges, and real, signicant changesabound and will continue to attract participants.Like projects and programs should continue as longas there are ways to channel resources and educa-tion across borders to benet working equids.

Introduction The purpose of this presentation is to describe the program of Rural Veterinary Experience Teachingand Service on the Indian Reservations of the North-ern Plains, and to suggest how improved veterinary care for reservation horses might become sustain-able in the future. 2. Background and History Over the last 19 years I have been working on In-dian Reservations primarily in North and SouthDakota, but also in Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho,Washington, Nevada, Utah, Minnesota, Wyoming,and Wisconsin. This began as a combination ofpublic health and companion animal work, but be-cause I am an equine practitioner at heart, the pro-gram morphed into our current all-equine operationcalled Rural Veterinary Experience Teaching andService. Although the basis of our work is provid-ing veterinary care in these underserved reservationcommunities, we also found that by incorporatingveterinary students in our clinics there is an addedbonus of skill acquisition and broadening of horizonsfor the next generation of veterinarians. Hence, wehave developed a curriculum that provides pre-trippreparation, closely supervised technical practice, and daily discussions and rounds. It goes without saying that horses and plains In- dians have had a long history. The Equus caballus' reintroduction into the Western Hemisphere in the fteenth century made it possible for the people whoinhabited the enormous prairies of central NorthAmerica to range across the great \"sea of grass,\"moving, hunting, and warring at will. Althoughthe zenith of the great \"horse nations\" of the Plainslasted only approximately 200 ofthe Lakota, Oglala, Hidatsa, Arikara, and Mandancommunities remain. These traditions are thatmuch more important after years of governmentmismanagement, and the social problems that comefrom poverty and marginalization. This is espe-cially true of youth who use horses to participate inrodeo, horse racing, and ultimate warrior challengecompetitions, or just nd that being able to get outon the prairie \"a horseback\" gives them connectionto their ancestors and a very positive identity.The skilled horsewomen pictured on the StandingRock Reservation (Fig. 1) are an example. Many of the Plains Indian communities that we service are at the very bottom of the economic scale.For instance, the median income for a household on AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 309EQUITARIAN SESSION NOTESthe Pine Ridge Reservation was $21,089 in 2014. And the per capita income was $6,067. Approxi-mately 61.0% of the population lives below the na-tional poverty line, including 74.6% of those under18 years of age. Deplorable numbers for life expec-tancy, incarceration, and infant mortality follow.These truly disturbing statistics mean that resi-dents have few opportunities and resources. Whatthey do have is a lot of open-range and free grazing.Horses thrive in an environment to which they arewell adapted and with a people who honor them. Working equids come in several forms on the res- ervations. Many serve as recreation and sportshorses for youth (rodeo and racing). Several tribalmembers raise \"rough stock\" for rodeos. Fromsmall contractors who use the low-cost grazing priv-ileges to maintain small bands of bucking horses forlocal junior and amateur events to individuals withserious breeding programs who aspire to havingsome of their saddle broncs make the National Fi-nals, these Indian ranchers provide income and jobsto reservation residents. Cattle ranching is an-other use for horses in the Dakotas, even thoughmuch of the work once done by horses is now givento the easier to train and faster all terrain vehicle(ATV). In addition, there are many horses that arebred on tribal lands simply because feed is inexpen-sive and because extended families have alwayskept and raised horses. Many of these animals arenever trained and some certainly enter the slaugh-ter horse market. A nal category are the \"ditchhorses\" who are abandoned on tribal lands, usuallynear roadways, and have to be herded onto commonpastures to prevent trafc accidents and damage toinfrastructure. In fact, nobody knows how manyhorses are actually on the ranges of the Dakotatribes. Services provided by volunteer veterinarians, reg- istered veterinary technicians, and students includecastration, lameness diagnosis and treatment, her-nia surgery, dentistry, hoof trimming, acute care forwounds and injuries, and occasionally, humane eu-thanasia. The approximately 500 castrations and 50 cryptorchids that we do a year in the Dakotas areparticularly important. Although many ranch andreservation residents still \"cut their own colts,\"there are fewer and fewer individuals who can do anunanesthetized castration safely and effectively.We certainly do not condone surgery without anes-thesia or analgesia, but several families have beendoing their own procedures with a good horse, arope, and a knife for years. A few feel that thishelps maintain their culture. However, most rec-ognize the added safety to all of proper anesthesia,even if they do not necessarily worry about humaneconcerns. We vaccinate for tetanus and dewormhorses on which we do other procedures. How-ever, doing large-scale vaccination and deworming,(something that most tribal members can do them-selves) draws resources from other activities thatrequire more skilled veterinary personnel. Paren-thetically, most of the dentistry we do is for majorabnormalities (fractured teeth, abnormal eruption, extractions in older horses, etc.), with most of thehorses presenting for examination having reallygood mouths, presumably due to a very natural dietof long-stem grass. Given that most of the horsesare of the same Quarter Horse breeding seen else-where in the country, genetics probably plays a lessimportant part in dental health. On the \"rez,\"wounds and hoof problems tend to go unattendeduntil they are fairly severe due to a lack of localveterinary service, lack of a basic level of training inthe reservation animals, and the fact that many ofthese horses live on open ranges without frequenthuman contact. Caring for these injuries can bechallenging; however, using the principles of woundhealing, techniques such as regional limb perfusion,have resulted in a fair amount of success. Humaneeuthanasia is occasionally required though, usingtechniques that do not leave a toxic carcass on theprairie. Hoof trimming of young horses that are not trained (or never will be) is another important func-tion. Soft spring ground and excellent forage tendsto make really serious hoof overgrowth common.Often anesthesia is the only option for dealing withbadly overgrown, distorted, or cracked hooves. All these procedures provide a wealth of experi- ence for veterinary students. To optimize theirtraining and to insure that the horses get the bestcare possible, it is essential that a teaching programfollow the following principles: Detailed curriculum which students muststudy prior to their eld experience Thorough orientation introducing techniques,protocols, and expectations Supervision by staff experienced in eld med-icine and surgery Record keeping on all horses treated Followup both in the immediate (daily rounds) Fig. 1.

Funding and Sustainability The word sustainable is dened by Merriam Web-ster as \"able to be used without being completelyused up or destroyed\" or \"able to last or continue fora long time.\" Given this denition, nearly two de-cades of care in return for providing training forveterinary students, with support from charitywould seem to qualify as \"sustainable.\" We do rec-ognize the substantial difculty in raising donationsfor equine projects vs companion animal, especiallyspay/neuter programs. Although individual veter-inarians and technicians will donate time and equip-ment, and some pharmaceutical corporations willdonate product, the large funders of \"animal wel-fare\" and \"animal protection\" generally do not seereservation equine veterinary aid projects as being\"saleable\" to their donor base and therefore havelimited interest. When one talks of sustainability, most would look for a business model that goes beyond an outsideorganization motivated by altruism as a long-termsolution to the lack of veterinary medical care onreservations. Although our experience is that ex-ternal nonprot funding is required to initiate aprogram in communities where no standard veteri-nary practices have existed, other internal fundingparadigms can be developed. Some examples in-clude tribal government allotting funds for vaccina-tion of animals for specic disease threats (rabiesand West Nile virus); and community support forsupplies, accommodations, and transportation whenlocal leaders approach ranchers and wealthier mem-bers of the tribe to raise a veterinary support fund.Finally, we have found that charging on a slidingscale for services has been a successful approach tosupport in communities where we have a long-standing reputation. This is done by simply tellingowners what our services cost and then asking themto pay what they can afford. Some actually volun-teer to pay extra so that community members withfewer resources can have services too. This uniquemodel has worked well in at least one communityand we plan on expanding it to others. The really hard step is to develop interest in young people from Native communities to take aninterest in veterinary medicine or veterinary tech-nology, share the challenges and joys of our profes-sion, and bring a consistent animal health resourceback home to the Reservation. All parties (thehorses and owners, the young people, and the veter-inary profession) would gain from this. However,there are major hurdles to bringing more NativeAmerican youth into a veterinary practice. Notonly do we nd the usual impediments to developinginterest in veterinary medicine (cost of education,eventual income, lifestyle, and contact with the pro-fession), but all the very basic problems in science,technology, engineering, and math (STEM) educa-tion also apply. These are areas of very active re-search because they have been identied as seriousstumbling blocks to the education of minority ethnicgroups and women in STEM subjects. Identieddifculties include lack of role models, perceivedlack of relevance to real life in STEM education, andinability to nd community in science or profes-sional school. For reservation youth, one must addthe fear of severing the attachment to a strong ex-tended family structure at home. Finally, our vet-erinary profession is recognized as the least diverseof all elds of science, with students identifying asequine emphasis being even more limited to uppermiddle class socioeconomic status and ethnic West-ern European descent. Bridging this gap will bethe focus of our program in the future. Simply talk-ing to high school assemblies and other youth groupsis notoriously unsuccessful in actually bringing mar-ginalized minority students to STEM education,much less professional school. Better organized,more aggressive, and more expensive projects arerequired. Research experiences for undergradu-ates have demonstrated efcacy in improving inter-est in and successful completion of STEM curricula.Perhaps a program patterned after one of the Na-tional Science Foundation's research experiences forundergraduates programs and directed at studentsfrom remote rural communities may be a viableapproach.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 (Eq Med) This presentation discusses the unique set up and aims of the Fondouk and looks in detail at some ofthe most important pathologies that we encounter among According to recent Food and Agriculture Organiza- tion of the United Nations (FAO) estimates there are15.5 million equids in the developed countries of theworld. In comparison, there are more than 100 mil-lion equids working in the developing world, 27 mil-lion of which are in Africa (FAO statistics, 2000). a It has been estimated that working animals areresponsible for 75% of traction energy in the devel-oping world 1and that 50% of the world's population depends on animal power as their main energysource. 2Recognition of the economic advantages associated with donkey ownership has led both gov-ernment and nongovernmental organizations(NGOs) to encourage the use of donkey traction inAfrica, seeing it as gender friendly, low mainte- nance, and relatively disease resistant. 1Despite this, it is still surprising that the use of workingequids, far from decreasing with increasing motor-ization, is actually on the increase. The global don-key population of 44.3 million animals (95% of whichare found in the developing world), has increased by15.6% over the last two decades (FAO statistics2000). a The threats to the welfare and productivity of this population of equidae are substantial and theeconomic effects of health challenges can be cata- strophic to individual family units. In disenfran-chised communities, the wellbeing of an ownerand his family is intimately linked to the wellbe-ing of their animal. Drought, poverty, ignorance, epidemics, disease, increasing motorization, andincreasing environmental pollution are all riskfactors that cause signicant morbidity. Ad-dressing the health needs of these animals andtheir owners has been an issue largely ignored bygovernmental and supranational bodies, whichhave tended to concentrate veterinary resourceson improving the health status of production ani-mals. It has fallen to the NGOs to take the leadin dening and implementing strategies of veter-inary support for working equids in some of theworld's most disadvantaged areas. The ultimategoal of these programs is to improve the healthand welfare of equids in targeted zones, andthereby improve the productivity and longevity ofthis form of traction. In turn, this should aid inthe maintenance of stable and self-sufcient agri-cultural and periurban populations. This presentation offers an introduction to the work of the American Fondouk. It highlights someof the challenges faced by our veterinarians in at- 312 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEQUITARIAN SESSION NOTEStempting to provide husbandry advice, prophylactic care, and individual treatment to large populationsof equids and their owners with only limited re-sources and facilities. It discusses the dominantpathologies seen among these equids, many of whichare specic to this population, and it discusses pos-sibilities for the global veterinary community tomake an impact. 2. Inadequate Husbandry Equates to Morbidity Much of the equine pathology in the developingworld is the direct or indirect result of inadequatehusbandry techniques and \"traditional\" therapeuticpractices. As a result, the work of the equine NGOs necessarily involves not only the treatment of af-fected individuals, but also mass education and in-formation campaigns to try and change establishedbehavior. Studies from Mexico 3and Ethopia4conrm that poor husbandry leading to harness sores, wounds,foot problems, and heavy worm burdens are an im-portant cause of compromised welfare. In manycountries, these problems are compounded by en-demic disease such as babesiosis, trypanosomiasis,and epizootic lymphangitis, which are often difcultor impossible to control or treat. Inadequate husbandry is not the only culprit that affects the health of the working equid. Horses andmules in the developing world also suffer from allthe usual pathologies that equids suffer all over theworld, the only difference being that these patholo-gies have often been allowed to run out of control asaccess to veterinary care is sporadic and limited.So any owner of a working equid in Morocco mayhave to deal with a horse that has injured itself in afall or a spook, a donkey that has sarcoids or mela-nomas, or a mule that suffers from recurrent airwayobstruction or colic. It is difcult to quantify the magnitude of each of the above threats to the working equid given thatdiscrete geographical populations face different dif-culties. However, in Morocco, analysis of our pa-tient population, both inpatients and outpatients,have suggested that approximately 50% of pathol-ogy is caused by poor husbandry, and the other halfof our patients suffer from disease or pathology thatis a direct result of simply being an equid. The success of any clinical intervention depends on the veterinary skills and the facilities available.This is as true in Kentucky as it is in Timbuktu.It is important to recognize that we cannot makeanimals better through provision of poor medicinewith minimal diagnostic facilities and limited veter-inary experience. The author believes that work-ing equids deserve the same standard of care as wewould expect for our equids in the West. The dif-culty, of course, is in how to achieve this, how tomaintain it, and how to pay for it.3. The American Fondouk A global network of working equid hospitals exists across the world, most of which were establishedand run by the three largest working equid chari-ties: The Brooke, Society for the Protection of An-imals Abroad (SPANA), and the Donkey Sanctuary.The American Fondouk is the only non-British hos-pital that exists in Africa and was established by anAmerican tourist to Fes, Morocco in 1927. TheAmerican Fondouk is administered by Massachu-setts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-mals (MSPCA) Angell. The Mission Statement of the Fondouk is to pro- vide help to the vulnerable sectors of the communitywho rely on working equids for income generationthrough the provision of free veterinary care to theiranimals. Thus, we are as much a humanitarianorganization as an animal welfare organization. The Fondouk aims to provide excellence in veter- inary care. This is backed up by a comprehensiverange of diagnostic and imaging equipment and isachieved in collaboration with close specialist adviceand support from both the United Kingdom and theUnited States. The Fondouk works with seven Moroccan veteri- narians, of whom ve are following an internshipprogram with us. The interns spend 1 year at theFondouk in Fes and are then sent to a centre ofexcellence in Europe to carry out another year'sinternship. After this period, they return to Mo-rocco to work independently. The Fondouk hopesthat facilitating access to specialist training foryoung Moroccan vets will have far-reaching implica-tions for the welfare of equids in Morocco in thefuture. In addition to this educational initiative,the Fondouk has established a contract with theUniversity of Glasgow veterinary school whereby weprovide a rotation in equine medicine to 50 of theirnal-year veterinary students each year. Studentsvisit the Fondouk in groups of four and each stay fora 4-week period. This is a formal part of the Glas-gow veterinary school curriculum and the incomegenerated from this contract pays a substantial partof the running costs of the hospital. This relation-ship brings other signicant advantages to the Fon-douk and its patients. For example, each month aspecialist from Glasgow accompanies the studentsfor a week. We also have the support of a team ofspecialists via weekly Skype ward rounds as well asimmediate access to specialist advice as needed.Telemedcine has become integrated into the dailyroutine at the Fondouk through the sharing of dig-ital radiographs, ultrasound images, and biochemis-try/hematology data. There is no doubt that thishas improved therapeutic plans in many cases andoptimized the chance of successful outcomes. This kind of partnership is currently unique in the working equid world and ensures clinical standards and enthusiasm is maintained in what are oftendemanding circumstances. Unlike many of the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 313EQUITARIAN SESSIONworking equid charities, the Fondouk is a single-site organization. For nearly 100 years, we have onlyhad one hospital and that is in Fes. Although theimplications of this are that we are able to invest allour resources into building a center of excellence,the flipside of course is that only a relatively smallnumber of animals are able to benet. The Fon-douk hopes that by providing an excellent practicalexperience for veterinary students from Moroccoand elsewhere, and through the provision of highquality continuing professional development in thecountry, we will be able to widen the circle of influ-ence. The learning experience for all visiting vol-unteers and students is exceptional, due to the highcaseload and extreme pathology that is seen at theFondouk. Most days we have 15-20 outpatients inthe morning, and 30 patients in the hospital thatrequire ongoing and sometimes intensive care. Many of the animals present with colic, usually caused by severe colon impactions, often compli-cated by plastic bags, rope, and other foreign bodiesthat the animals have scavenged. Volunteers andstudents at the Fondouk get extensive hands-onpractice at passing nasogastric tubes, performingrectal examinations, and belly taps, which makes ita unique learning experience. Another area where visitors are able to gain ex- perience is in lameness diagnosis. Studies carried out by the Brooke have shown that more than 80% of working equids have limb pathol-ogy and many have multiple limb lameness. 5Cat- astrophic farriery techniques such as toe dumpinglead to chronic pastern arthritis in huge numbers ofworking mules. Diagnosing these multiple limbproblems can be challenging, particularly so becausemules usually object violently to nerve-blocking at-tempts. The Fondouk is well equipped with digitalradiography and ultrasonography and this facili-tates accurate diagnosis, but therapy remains chal-lenging. Very few owners can afford the luxury of\"box rest,\" and horses are obliged to keep on workingeven in the face of severe orthopedic issues. TheAmerican Fondouk owns a number of working mulesthat we loan to owners in an attempt to buy time fortheir own animal to recover. Sometimes we evencover an owner's daily earnings for a week to per-suade them to leave their lame animal at the hospi-tal to recover. The Fondouk staffers are real advocates for the working equid and we try all strategies to ensurethat we can deliver care where it is needed. 4. The Way Forward Ensuring an adequate standard of welfare in theglobal population of working equines is a dauntingtask. It requires coordinated efforts, not only of theveterinary NGOs, but also all stakeholders with aninterest in agricultural development in Africa andAsia. These include local and national govern-ments, supranational organizations, veterinary andagricultural institutions, and the agricultural com-munities themselves. It is time that microtrans-port took its place alongside micronance andmicrobusiness development as a priority issue onthe development agenda. Primary objectives should be to improve accessi- bility to both preventive husbandry education and toessential care for the common causes of morbidityand mortality within zones of heavy equid utiliza-tion. Many countries within Africa and Asia stillhave no access to such support. Secondary objec-tives should focus on ensuring delivery of appropri-ate and effective care, including choice of safe andeffective drugs, appropriate equipment scale, suf-cient veterinary and para-veterinary training, andsufcient funding for the clinical population. Thegold standard for any working equid organization isto try and insure a sustainable provision of care thatimproves the overall welfare of the population intothe future.

Introduction An original social service initiative of the National University of Mexico (UNAM) was adopted andmaintained by all public universities in Mexico.Social service is a requisite for obtaining any bach-elor's degree. All undergraduate students com-plete a 6-month period of community service thatreciprocates society's support of their universitystudies. There are more than 50 veterinary schools in Mex- ico, most of which belong to state universities thatcreated a veterinary program to primarily addressneeds in animal production to uphold food security.Currently, the importance of animal welfare andhealth is also recognized, as well as the opportuni-ties future veterinarians have for earning a living inveterinary practice. The College of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science of UNAM runs a project with the DonkeySanctuary that, in collaboration with World HorseWelfare, assists equids in Mexico. The original ap-proach involved visiting communities to implementtreatments and preventive medicine with some ex- tension work. The current approach focuses on es-tablishing community partnerships for sharingexperiences and disseminating knowledge whilending areas of opportunity for veterinarians intheir own communities. These veterinarians even-tually will facilitate welfare outreach to moreequids. Inspired by the model of Catley et al. 1and taking advantage of the universities' programs of social service, the Donkey Sanctuary-UNAM teams havebeen involving social service students (SSS) in theirprojects since 2008, encouraging them to live in avillage to play the role of community-based promot-ers of animal welfare in areas where human liveli-hoods rely on equids. The strategy has been successful in strengthening the link between the community and teams but hasmostly represented a milestone for future veterinari-ans because some have envisaged a specic directionto take in regard to their professional development,whereas others have simply developed the condence AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 315EQUITARIAN SESSION NOTESrequired for establishing a practice of their own in their particular area of interest. This article presents the experience of the Donkey Sanctuary-UNAM joint program on how the man-datory social service program may positively affectthe professional development of veterinarians inMexico to either become involved in equine practiceor succeed in organizational work. 2. Materials and Methods SSS are recruited twice a year. One group startsbetween February and March and nishes betweenAugust and September; the second group starts be-tween August and September and nishes betweenFebruary and March of the following year. The Donkey Sanctuary-UNAM joint program has projects in more than 250 communities in 13 prov-inces throughout Mexico. Students are assignedback to their communities (i.e., university or geo-graphical) to an area of their particular interest(e.g., equids in rural or peri-urban areas or thoseworking in small-scale dairy production systems oragriculture systems for subsistence), or to an area ofthe Donkey Sanctuary-UNAM program's own needs(e.g., investigating socioeconomic contribution ofequids, reducing disease occurrence, improving har-nessing, etc.). Once the area is dened and a workplan is produced, the SSS get involved and are inte-grated into three stages: induction, training, andin-community experience. 3. First Induction Induction a 2-week period during which studentsare introduced to equine welfare concepts and as-sessment. Because managing project cycles is cen-tral, the SSS are trained in needs assessment,planning, implementation, evaluation, and monitor-ing. Appropriate extension methods, participatoryresearch methodology, community partnership tech-niques, training of trainers practice, and how toidentify main actors and to build relationships andnetworks are all taught during this rst stage. 4. Second Stage: Training This is a 6- to 8-week period during which studentswork with the team of eld services, learning fromveterinarians, farriers, harness makers, and behav-iorists on topics such as medicine, surgery, and man-agement for equine practice and welfare. Everytraining lesson is delivered in the context of thewhole life of the equid, the local culture, and theagricultural and working practices of that culture,all of which are in reference to the 5 animal-basedindicators of welfare per the Donkey Sanctuary's\"Hands-On Donkey Welfare Assessment\" frame-work: (1) equine behavior and equid-human inter-action, (2) nutritional state and feeding practices, (3)physical integrity and basics of harnessing, (4) lame-ness management and foot care, and (5) diseaseoccurrence and management. 2It is also during this time that the student interacts with the com-munity team, which includes social scientists. Insummary, this time empowers the student to beeffective in the community. 5. Third Stage: In-Community Experience This is a 4-month period during which the studentlives in the community and plays the role of veteri-narian for equids, a role that very well may includecare of any species in need. Assisted by the guid-ance of the team leader in charge of the project, thestudent performs basic procedures of diagnosis andtherapy. When more complex cases are faced, suchas those requiring surgery, the team veterinarian iscalled in for support. As part of providing help inhealth care and management, the student uses thetools provided to obtain information necessary tocomplete the study of the region. 6. Results and Discussion The social service program is a key step in the pro-fessional development of veterinarians in Mexico.This particular program provides the opportunityfor many future veterinarians to become involved inboth rural development and equine practice. It hasproven to be effective in facilitating the involvementof those future veterinarians in their own communi-ties\u2014now as professionals with the experience andcompetence required for dealing with conditionsthat put equid welfare at risk. Students developthe necessary skills for understanding welfare, put-ting into practice knowledge of clinical medicine andsurgery, expertise in equine management issues,experience in extension methods, and the ability tointeract with people. For the Donkey Sanctuary-UNAM program, the involvement of SSS has been helpful in (1) providingelements for understanding the socioeconomic con-tributions of working equines, (2) nding areas ofopportunity for the professional development of vet-erinarians, and (3) raising the quality of life in theeld of working equines. In Mexico, like in other countries, there are many human livelihoods that rely on equids. Equids areinvolved in supporting the livelihoods of the humanpopulation\u2014most for subsistence, some that fosterself-employment, and a small percentage that gen-erate income. Types of livelihoods vary from small-holder units in remote, poor rural areas, such as incountries with similar ecological and economic con-ditions, to entities in forsaken, underprivileged peri-urban areas of cities, such as in countries withchallenging social and economic circumstances.Equids bring complementary benets to agricultureand livestock, generating cash when sold or rentedand becoming a way of keeping assets by reducingexpenses. Depending on the geographic character-istics and type of system, workloads can increaseduring a specic time of year, thereby reducing peo-ple's vulnerability but increasing that of equids.The effect of this may be addressed by owners whoseek the services of veterinarians, who in turn aim 316 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEQUITARIAN SESSIONto promote all aspects of welfare\u2014a fact that de- mands that the institutions that produce profession-als to address national needs reinforce their visionregarding the balance between the productivity of asystem and the welfare of the animals. This isbecoming an exigency of society. Therefore, a program of social service that sup- ports the professional development of future veteri-narians interested in equids allows students toreceive training that enables them to develop skillsin veterinary medicine and animal science for equidsand other animals. Students learn appropriate ex-tension methods for equine owners and communitypartnership methods for introducing knowledge,both of which enable them to recognize needs and todevelop strategies in systems that include equids. 7. Conclusion The social service experience has a positive impacton both the professional and personal developmentof future veterinarians. On the professional side,veterinary students who have been involved in thisprogram agree that their level of competency in-creases by facing real cases in a sector of the equinepopulation with demanding needs. These equidsbelong to a sector of human population in need,where owners must stay vigilant to ensure equidquality of life. In the particular case of veterinari-ans, their level of competency in approaching condi-tions that affect the health and welfare of equidswith a medical, surgical, or management solutionconsiderably increases to the extent that they canestablish relationships between those conditionsand the root causes that lead to their occurrence andseverity. On the level of personal development, thestudents highlight the satisfaction they get fromproviding rural and peri-urban communities withskills and knowledge, as well as nding how reward-ing humanitarian work is not only in regard to peo-ple but also to equids.

AAEP. 1. Introduction The health care needs of the estimated 90 million working equids are largely unmet because of econom-ics, a lack of training of owners and veterinarians insitu, cultural differences, and government disinterest.Nonprot welfare organizations dedicated to workingequids internationally have been well-established inGreat Britain for decades. These include the Societyfor the Protection of Animals Abroad (1923); WorldHorse Welfare (WHW, 1927; formerly known as theInternational League for the Protection of Horses), theBrooke (1934), and the Donkey Sanctuary (1969).All have programs with a veterinary component butprovide little opportunity for veterinary volunteerswho wish to donate their time and expertise for short periods. In contrast, the American Fondouk in Mo-rocco (1927) provides a permanent veterinary care fa-cility that also serves as a teaching venue forveterinary students from multiple countries. The Donkey Sanctuary in Mexico chose to augment itsprogram by incorporating veterinary students withobligatory social service requirements. Through thiscollaboration, teams of veterinary students and veter-inarians provide working equid health care to enrolledcommunities every 6 months. In the United States,Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association's Ru-ral Animal Veterinary Service (HSVMA/RAVS),Christian Veterinary Mission, and Project Samana 318 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEQUITARIAN SESSION NOTEShave supported small groups of equine veterinarians and American veterinary students in providing work-ing equid health care internationally. However, nocomprehensive program to expressly train equine vet-erinarians to improve working equid welfare andhealth has existed. 2. Partnership Development A group of American equine veterinarians joinedtogether in 2009 as the Equitarian Initiative (EI) toserve the common purpose of improving health carefor working equids. The American Associationof Equine Practitioners Universidad Nacional Auto \u00b4noma de Mexico(UNAM), and WHW. Working together, the Equi-tarian Workshop was developed to train veterinari- ans and other equine professionals to understandthe needs of working equids and learn best practicesfor health care delivery. Utilizing the communityservice model of the Donkey Sanctuary in Mexico,workshop participants learned through a combina-tion of didactic presentations, discussions, andhands-on health care delivery to working equids inpoor communities. American veterinarians withexperience in international equid work served asinstructors alongside faculty andfarriers as part of their program of training localindividuals to take up these professions and subse-quently invited EI veterinarians to partner withthem in Central America and Haiti. The resultantproject in Honduras included that country's new andrst veterinary college at the Universidad Nacionalde Agricultura (UNA). 3. Results The growth of the fledgling EI has been rapid andcatalyzed by mentorships and partnerships withlike-minded organizations and universities in devel-oping countries. Five annual equitarian work-shops have been held to date: 4 in Mexico inconjunction with the Donkey Sanctuary and UNAMand 1 in Nicaragua led by American equitarians.These workshops have been nancially supported byregistration fees from participants and grants fromthe American Association of Equine PractitionersFoundation. Participants have included veterinar-ians from the United States, Canada, Mexico, Pan-ama, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the United Kingdom,Portugal, and India. Equine science professionals,veterinary students, veterinary technicians, a hu-mane agent, and other supporters have alsoattended. The Donkey Sanctuary Mexico taught the Equita- rians three key points about executing programs toimprove working equid health:Concurrent participation by in-country veteri- nary students is mutually benecial: theworkshop provided unique learning opportuni-ties for the students, who in turn served astranslators for non-Spanish speakers to moreeffectively communicate with owners and whowere indispensable in several of the roles typ-ically delegated to veterinary technicians. Cultural differences and owner expectationsneed to be recognized to effectively deliver bothhealth care and targeted education. In Mex-ico, this critical component is led by social an-thropologists who spend additional time in thecommunities. These same personnel alsospend time educating children and someadults at the work sites. Veterinarians expe-rienced in equine behavior are very importantin demonstrating much needed, gentle retrain-ing of resistant and aggressive horses. Theyalso address the owners who believe misbehav-ior and aggressive correction are acceptable. Effective organization of a community work-site enhances workflow. The site should in-clude specied zones to address the multipleneeds of the animals. Grassy athletic eldsare optimal, but shade should be considered insite selection. Zones or stations that are com-monly included are registration, vaccination,deworming, dentistry, surgery, internal medi-cine, reproduction, farriery, saddlery, and anowner education station. The strong bonds that have emerged among collab-orating welfare organizations were evident at the5th Equitarian Workshop, where 8 nonprot orga-nizations discussed best practices for effectivehealth care delivery, education, and sustainability.These included the EI, WHW, the Donkey Sanctu-ary, HSVMA/RAVS, RVETS, Sustainable VetsInternational, Christian Veterinary Mission, andWorld Vets. Leaders from these organizations con-tributed to the curriculum and eld work in commu-nities. The nal partner in this workshop was theveterinary college at Universidad de Ciencias Com-erciales (UCC), 1 of 7 veterinary colleges in Nicara-gua. UCC provided lecture facilities for part of theworkshop and 2 faculty members and 20 studentswho participated in both lectures and communitywork. The caliber of the teaching at the workshopand value to veterinarians interested in becomingskilled in equitarian work was recognized with Reg-istry of Approved Continuing Education (RACE) ap-proval for continuing education hours. The equine science professionals who have partic- ipated in equitarian workshops have undertakenseveral small research projects that evaluated work-shop behavior and body condition scoring. Onesuch participant subsequently created a 4-H projectto make a coloring book to increase children's aware-ness of equid health needs. This coloring book ofhealth lessons is now widely used AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 319EQUITARIAN SESSIONects and has been adapted to three different cultures in two languages. Mentors and collaborators have supported 5 new international veterinary programs launched by par-ticipants in the equitarian workshops: Costa Rica,Honduras, Mexico, Guatemala, and Haiti. CostaRica is a weeklong annual project that was startedin 2011 and is supported by the participating veter-inarians and grants from the AAEP Foundation.Similarly, Honduras is a weeklong annual projectthat was started in 2012 and is partially nanced byprivate donations. Mexico's project is typically a5-day annual project that began in 2012 and is par-tially funded by donations from the leader's clients.Guatemala's project began 3 years ago and includes2 annual work weeks. It is supported by FullBucket, members of the Texas Equine VeterinaryAssociation, MWI, and the AAEP Foundation. TheHaiti project began 2 years ago and continues with 2weeklong visits a year. It is primarily funded bydonations and fundraisers supported by the leader'sclients. Veterinarians from Project Samana and HSVMA/ RAVS, now also equitarian leaders, have mentorednew project leaders, helping each develop supplylists and plans for negotiating permits and passagethrough customs. WHW has been an invaluablepartner in Honduras and Guatemala and an in-creasingly important one in Costa Rica and Haiti.Individual workshop attendees have gone on to gainadditional experience by volunteering for otherworking equid health care projects sponsored byHSVMA/RAVS in Peru, Nicaragua, and Guatemala;Project Samana in the Dominican Republic; andSustainable Veterinarians International in Nicara-gua. Several Mexican veterinarians from the pre-ceding workshops have joined a number of theseprojects. Two Americans have been inspired tochange their career path, seeking advanced trainingin international public health to better understandits link to the welfare of working equids. One pastparticipant now works full time for the Brooke in theUnited Kingdom. Equid health programs on Amer-ican Indian reservations have benetted from par-ticipant training, including a new one that wasinitiated after the workshop. With the support of WHW's infrastructure, the equitarian project in Honduras has become themodel for effective in-country engagement to bothbenet working equids and provide valuable clinicaltraining to future veterinarians. WHW initially in-vited a team of equitarian veterinarians to join theirfarrier and saddler training program for 4 days inSan Pedro Sula, Honduras, in 2012. Concurrently,the new UNA veterinary college faculty were in-vited to bring their charter class of students (n /H11005 10) to join the US veterinarians to gain clinicalexperience. This new veterinary college is in avery poor country and has no teaching hospital, soclinical skills must be gained by external rota-tions. Local veterinarians (n /H110058) also joined inand actively discussed the health problems ob-served and new veterinary techniques. Healthcare services included vaccination against tetanusand rabies, deworming, harness sore and woundcare, dentistry, castrations, lameness evaluations,and disease diagnosis. Evening seminars on den-tistry, parasites, colic, and lameness were pro-vided to the veterinary students and localveterinarians. Very positive feedback on thevalue of the learning experience was receivedfrom the veterinary college, encouraging furthercollaboration. The evolution of the WHW program model has shaped EI's perceptions of program components toaugment impact and sustainability. In 2013,WHW chose to move its Honduras program toCholuteca based on strong support of the mayor,high number of working equids, and need for greatersafety of the participants as a result of rising crime.The new model is based on a 3-year plan to supportmore than 20 communities that rely on workingequids to haul rewood, building materials, trash,and agricultural products. A subset of equidsworks as personal transportation and/or herdingcattle. This model, in addition to training farriersand saddlers, includes training a person to become acommunity-based equine advisor in each commu-nity. These individuals become a resource forworking equid owners on subjects of animal healthand welfare. WHW's annual invitation of UNA and the equita- rian team to work together for a week has had asignicant impact on UNA's veterinary students.UNA leaders have chosen to bring the entire 3rd-year class each year: 23 students in 2013 and 27 in2014. At the start of the week, several veterinarystudents were frightened by horses, and most lackedphysical examination skills. By the end of theweek, however, the students had participated in thetreatment of hundreds of working equids, developedphysical examination skills equivalent to US veter-inary students at the beginning of their senior year,and experienced an effective form of community ser-vice. Equine veterinary topics were taught inclassroom lectures and wet labs at WHW's ofce.For better efciency, the lectures were provided onthe rst 2 days of the week in 2014, and the wet labswere held in the mornings before traveling to thecommunities. Community-based equine advisors,farrier and saddler trainees, staff, and local veteri-narians were also invited to these educationalactivities. The equitarian veterinarians were inspired by the veterinary students' eagerness to advance theirknowledge and skills. The equitarians learned thechallenges of working in extreme tropical heat, theimpact of cultural differences in horse handling, andthe limits of availability and affordability of medi-cations. American veterinarians new to the teamquickly became familiar with pervasive issues suchas harness sores, seasonal recurrent airway obstruc- 320 2015 /H11408Vol. /H11408AAEP The Americans' dedication to volunteer communityeducation and female gender modeling by the proj-ect leaders was commented upon by the veterinarystudents and somewhat of a cultural surprise for theworking equid owners. The strong focus on Honduran veterinary student education led to an invitation of a subset of Hondu-ran veterinary students to join subsequent equitar-ian projects in Nicaragua and Guatemala. Thesestudents integrated readily into these teams andwere immediately able to provide support to veteri-narians while continuing to learn from them. Vet-erinary students from other Central Americancountries also participated, resulting in a friendly,enthusiastic network of students interested inhorses. This network may serve as a future focusfor mutual support and learning after graduation.Externships in the United States are planned forsome of the most dedicated students. The success of the Honduran model of equitarian work has led to an increased effort to collaboratewith in-country veterinary colleges. As a result,more students have become involved in equitarianwork in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Costa Rica.In Costa Rica, animal science students have alsobeen included. Greater effort to nd funding forAmerican veterinary student participation in theseprojects is anticipated. 4. Discussion Cornerstones for sustainable international develop-ment have emerged from the decades of work andresearch of the British nonprot organizations thatfocus on international working equid welfare. Thesefoci must become components of sustainable equitar-ian work. Recent research by the British groups fo-cuses on their role in human livelihoods. In areas ofpoverty, donkeys, horses, and mules have been shownto be the most important livestock for assuring stablefamily income. Economic studies have estimatedtheir contribution to total family income to be 14% inEthiopia, 57% of total productive assets in Guatemala,and nearly 80% of the annual income for purchasingfood in India. 1-3Similarly, the Brooke has clearly shown that community-led actions are more effectivefor lasting change than short-term foreign assistance. 4 Emerging work suggests that these communities maybe most effective with a matrix of support beyond thehealth care of working equids, including micronance,public health, social services, and training to enhancetheir economic productivity. 5Future and existing eq- uitarian projects should consider linking their veteri-nary care to other organizations and governments thatcan sustain infrastructure to help provide these ser-vices continuously. Building capacity within thecommunity is also critical for sustainability, as exem-plied by the training of farriers, saddlers, and com-munity-based equine advisors in WHW's project inHonduras and the augmentation of the training ofin-country veterinarians in most existing programs.Mentorship and collaboration have enabled rapid growth and success of the EI. Veterinarians fromdeveloped countries have had much to learn in re-gard to sustainable development and the impactcultural differences and varied owner expectationscan have. The opportunity for equine veterinari-ans to train for and provide this level of support toworking equids is unprecedented. For veterinari-ans who work full time and want to volunteer theirexpertise and vacation time, the challenges of tryingto plan and execute a successful veterinary aid pro-gram are daunting. However, these challenges canbe surmounted by partnering with larger organiza-tions that provide infrastructure and a much morein-depth program that will benet by veterinaryteam support. The health of hundreds of working equids can be improved by simple interventions, demonstratingthe value of routine health care to their owners.Many equid owners lack basic husbandry skills, es-pecially in urban areas. This decit can be ad-dressed by owner education and by providingtraining in critical skills such as farriery and sad-dlery in the local community. Equine health les-sons for children should not be overlooked becausethey are often the daily caretakers and may be moreopen to positive change. Working equids are a mainstay for the survival of many small farmers who struggle to afford any vet-erinary care\u2014if, that is, care is even available.Veterinary colleges in developing countries arepoorly funded and typically weak in curricular sup-port of equine medicine and surgery. Provision ofequine-specic education for local veterinarians,veterinary students, and working equid owners isone tool that is essential for sustainability. Al-though a veterinarian in these countries cannotprot signicantly from working equid care, somemay choose to support working equid health by vol-unteering their time or offering low-cost services.Government or private sector nancial support israre but should nonetheless be encouraged. Manyof the basic skills emphasized in programs such asthe one in Honduras can be extrapolated to otherspecies and will be useful to the veterinary studentsupon graduation. Long-term measures of impactstill need to be developed to further rene both theequitarian workshop and the Honduras model. 5. Conclusions Long-established nonprot organizations such asWHW and the Donkey Sanctuary have enabledAmerican equine veterinarians to rapidly and effec-tively develop both a training program and diversecountry projects. The preexisting and growing in-frastructure of these nonprots in areas of greatneed of working equid welfare improvement greatlyfacilitates team planning and community work.For sustainable impact, veterinarians must simul-taneously provide educational opportunities for in-country veterinary students, veterinarians, and AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 321EQUITARIAN SESSIONhorse owners to care for the working equids when the equitarian team cannot be there. Internationalefforts of collaboration strengthen all of those in-volved and should be encouraged. The model of partnership between EI, WHW, and UNA in Honduras met shared goals to synergisti-cally create a program to more sustainably improveworking equid health. The strengths of this collab-orative model should be emulated in other regions ofneed.

Telemedicine is dened by the American Telemedi- cine Association as \"the use of medical informationexchanged from one site to another via electroniccommunications to improve a patient's clinicalhealth status.\" aTelemedicine can be as simple as a landline consultation or as complex as computer-based real-time videoconferencing but at all levels,the goal is to allow patient data to be reviewed and examined by experts far away from the patient. 1 The human medical world has been quick to imple-ment telemedicine to help close the socioeconomicgap in medical care. 2But veterinary telemedicine is still used mainly to bring expert consultation toveterinary clinics within the industrial nationsrather than extending the reach of specialists to thedeveloping world. 3 Working equids remain important to the economy even in rapidly developing countries such as Mo-rocco, where agriculture continues to employ a large part of the population.4Despite the cost of these animals, their owners often lack the nancial means to provide even basic veterinary needs. In additionto their value in delivering basic and preventivecare, with the advent of increasingly sophisticatedequipment and telecommunications technology, probono hospitals also strive to deliver sophisticateddiagnostics and treatment. We report collabora-tion and experiences with 137 patients sharedamong specialists at Cummings School of Veteri-nary Medicine at Tufts University and the Equitar-ian Initiative in conjunction with the Director of theAmerican Fondouk, termed Patients Without Bor-ders. This collaboration allows timely intervention in complex cases and gives working equids and theirowners access to specialist care that would other-wise be out of their reach both spatially and nan-cially. We describe the types of cases that most AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 323EQUITARIAN SESSION NOTEScommonly require consultation, and the type of elec- tronic communication that is seen to be most bene-cial in these cases, as well as the educationalbenet to students in the United States. 2. Materials and Methods The American Fondouk, a pro bono hospital forworking equids in Fes, Morocco, was founded in1927 by Emily Bend Bishop, and is afliated withthe Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cru-elty to Animals. This busy hospital is operated by alimited number of qualied veterinarians workinglong hours. The Fondouk serves both the local ur-ban population of equids working in the Medina, aswell as those from the rural outskirts that travelmiles to access the excellent veterinary care avail-able. The Fondouk has an onsite laboratory and asmall surgical facility as well as hospital accommo-dations. Diagnostic equipment includes digital ra-diography, endoscopy, and ultrasound. 3. Origin of Patients Without Borders Patients Without Borders originated with email con-sults done on an ad-hoc basis, but our group quicklyrealized that regularly scheduled, real-time roundsusing free videoconferencing services would be of begreat benet to the Fondouk patients, and a twice-monthly video-rounds was established. E-mailconsults continue as needed in between the rounds. Several obstacles were recognized and largely re- mediated in these long-distance rounds, such as theneed for high-speed Internet access and allocation ofall available bandwidth to the rounds. We had tobe cognizant of important local events that mightuse up available bandwidth. Creativity in acquir-ing data are important, and forethought and timingis important. Although most recommendations aremade during video conferencing, when cases falloutside the purview of general internal medicine orgeneral surgery, Cummings faculty participantsthen query other veterinary specialists at the Uni-versity including radiologists, ophthalmologists,neurologists, and surgeons. There is never acharge for these services, rather, Cummings facultyprovide consultation on a pro-bono basis. 4. Data Analysis Cases seen over a period of 1.5 years were organizedaccording to body system and broad causes, such astrauma, infectious, neoplastic, etc. The type of dig-ital information that was given in different types ofcases was also delineated. It is important to re-member that these cases represent only a smallfraction of the cases seen at the Fondouk, and thuscannot be taken as a representation of the mostcommon pathologies of working equids in Morocco,rather, it is a representation of cases that requireconsultation. The body system that was most commonly involved was musculoskeletal, followed by gastroin-testinal, integument, respiratory, neurologic, hema-tologic and genitourinary. The most common causeof referral within each category was as follows:musculoskeletal infection;neurologic-infectious; respiratory-infectious; gastro-intestinal-infectious; integument-neoplastic, genito- urinary-miscellaneous; of frequency, were as follows: Musculoskeletal: septic arthritis secondary to trauma including street nail, bacterialor babesia, neoplasia Genitourinary: The interventions made as a result of telemedicinerounds were divided into four broad categories:Further diagnostics, surgical advice, modication offluid therapy, or modication of drug treatments,which in turn encompassed recommendations forfurther imaging, surgical techniques and guidelines,analysis of fluid therapy outcomes, and antibiotic,chemotherapy, and anthelmintic use. 5. Discussion The vast majority of equids lives in the developingworld, and those animals are critical to the tractionneeds of both rural and urban populations. Few ifany specialists are employed at the pro bono hospi-tals in these regions. Although telemedicine hasbeen used increasingly as a tool to advance the qual-ity of medicine, especially expert consultation, forhumans in the developing world it is an underdevel-oped resource in veterinary medicine. The authorsherein offer their experiences to others wishing todevelop veterinary telemedicine for the developingworld. Personal initiative and contacts were important in this case for initiating our veterinary telemedicineproject. Two of the authors (J.G.M., one of thefounders of the Equitarian Initiative, http://www.equitarianinitiative.org, and G.K.) worked to-gether in person at the Fondouk and rstestablished mutual interest, trust, and enthusiasmfor the mission of the Fondouk. This project thenextended to Cummings faculty. On the Cummingsside, there was both the desire to make a differenceto the developing world, and there was a perceivedbenet to students given that they were able toparticipate in rounds and learn through furtherreading and guided discussions. Students werealso able to participate by developing electronic 324 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEQUITARIAN SESSIONcases for use by other students. On the Fondouk side, there was the benet of collegiality and theperceived benet of acquiring opinions from multi-ple experts on many varying cases. Above all, theremust be an intrinsic, self-motivated desire to con-tinue any such work that is outside the scope of anordinary working day. In order for telemedicine, or e-medicine, to be effec- tive, there must be an available, solidly establishedinformation communications technology (ICT) infra-structure. 5This may be as simple as email accessi- bility or as sophisticated as use of videoconferencing.Lack of bandwidth is a persistent problem that affectsreal-time telemedicine more than it does transmissionof images or written information, which can be sent attimes when Internet demand is lower. Although the healthcare needs of working equids in the developing world have been described as pri-marily those associated with poor husbandry or rou-tine preventive care, for the nongovernmentalorganizations that provide the majority of veteri-nary care for the working equid population in thedeveloping world there is both pressure and merit totending the needs of the individual animal. Thispresents a need for intensive care and sophisticatedcase management. The effectiveness of telemedi-cine can really only be as good as the informationthat is delivered; the absence of a strong basichealthcare system is the most important limitingcapacity for collaboration with specialists in humanmedicine in developing countries. 5The American Fondouk is thus an ideal partner because it hasunusually good diagnostic capability and strong vet-erinary capacity. In summary, long-distance veterinary medical col- laboration, or veterinary telemedicine, provides thebenets of expert consultation for hospitals in thedeveloping world. A sense of collegiality and part-nership arises when videoconferencing is pursuedregularly, and learning becomes very much a sharedenterprise as those of us in the developed countrieslearn about disease and ingenuity from our partnersin the developing world, and indeed, the world growssmall when the problems are shared.

Introduction The purpose of this presentation is to provide aspiring equitarians with the material and regulatory require-ments for successfully accomplishing an internationalproject to benet working equid health care. Strongleadership and detailed advance planning are critical. 2. Materials and Methods The information presented herein represents con-clusions drawn from 14 years of trial and error eq-uitarian work in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras,Mexico, Costa Rica, and two distinct regions of Peru.It may not be as applicable in settings outside LatinAmerica. Some of the guidelines simply reflect per-sonal opinion and preference. Each country pro-vides unique challenges, particularly as a newproject begins, but these are easier to overcome withthe assistance of experienced project organizers. 3. Results Essential supplies include anthelmintics; ectoparasi-tacides; tranquilizers; general and should be sourced in the host country(availability varies by country), with exceptions only for donated supplies and prohibitive host country cost(e.g., tetanus toxoid cost in Nicaragua is $5/dose vs.$1.40/dose in the United States). Care should betaken to ensure that supplies both donated and ob-tained in the host country have not passed their expi-ration date and that the concentration of themedication is specied. As programs recur, eventu-ally inventory will accumulate in the host country foruse in subsequent years. Gloves and suture, in par-ticular, do not stand up well to storage in the tropics,but all other accumulated inventory is useful in casethere are import delays because of a failure to obtainpermits, permits not honored at the point of entry, orcustoms impediments. Permits should be sought for the importation of all supplies brought from the United States, although they may not be attainable in some countries and atsome times. It must be recognized that absent per-mits (and sometimes even with permits), importattempts may fail. The government agency fromwhich the import permits must be sought is the hostcountry's rough equivalent of the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture. Examples are Ministerio Agropec-uario y Forestal Agraria (SENASA) inPeru and Honduras. Successful application forpermits is only possible with the help of diligent and 326 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEQUITARIAN SESSION NOTESpersistent local contacts, preferably veterinarians. This is important because the government agenciesinvolved may not respond promptly (or at all) tocommunications by telephone or e-mail. The per-mits should be sought at least a month in advance ofthe start of the equitarian work, with the exceptionof Nicaragua, which will not accept permit applica-tions more than 30 days before the import date.Everything to be imported should be undamaged,unopened, and within the expiration date. The pre-cise quantity and concentration of each importshould also be specied. The same informationshould be included in packing lists that can be pre-sented to customs ofcials by suitcase or box. For several reasons, legal export of controlled sub- stances from the United States is not practical andshould never be done illegally. Ketamine can be ob-tained in all Latin American countries. All other con-trolled substances are not essential, and other optionsare available for euthanasia, including transrectal lac-eration of the abdominal aorta, rapid intravenous ad-ministration of a saturated solution of magnesiumsulfate (Epsom salt) or potassium chloride, and intra-thecal injection of lidocaine through the foramen mag-num. All three of these methods should only be usedfollowing deep general anesthesia with xylazine andketamine, and all three will also leave the carcassnontoxic to scavenging dogs and wildlife. Essential equipment components are as follows: basic surgical instruments, including the Equi-twister for to charge equip-ment batteries from vehicle batteries. All suppliesand equipment must be organized and packed toconform to airline size and weight constraints.Rubbermaid's 24-gallon \"Action Packers\" are justwithin the size limits imposed by airlines, are wa-terproof, and can be modied with drawers and com-partments to organize supplies for eld deployment.One of the basic challenges of equitarian work issimply keeping equipment and supplies organized,dry, clean, and safe from theft, insects, and rodents. Logistical details will vary by country and location. In all cases, arranging transportation, housing, com-munication, advance work in communities, and liaisonwith host country government agencies will absolutelyrequire one or more local contacts, with whom tele-phone and e-mail communications are possible. Thelocal contacts should be known personally by the tripleader as a result of a brief pilot trip that precedes therst fully engaged intervention. Ideally, local logis-tics are best left to collaborating local, nongovernmentorganizations (NGOs) and universities. Examples ofthis collaboration working well are the NGO Yana-pana Peru and Universidad Nacional de Agriculturain Honduras. Absent such support, the trip leadermust take responsibility to arrange rental vehicles,lodging, and meals with the assistance of local con-tacts. This may involve, for example, nding unusedchurches and school rooms where participants can beallowed to spend the night on the floor in sleeping bagsor in hammocks. Medical treatment facilities may be distant and rudimentary in many areas where equitarian workis indicated. Illness and injury do occasionally oc-cur, so emergency planning must take place in ad-vance of the project. Participants may need to behospitalized for fluid therapy for dysentery, contractDengue fever, or be injured by kicks or vehicle acci-dents, for example. Therefore, all participantsshould be required to have medical evacuation in-surance policies for the duration of the trip that canbe purchased short term and at reasonable costsfrom companies such as International SOS, 1World Nomads,2and Medijets.3Such policies are avail- able from other companies as well. The trip leadershould maintain a le on each participant with thatinformation, color copy of the passport picture page,information about ongoing or recurrent medicalproblems, and emergency contacts at home. A legalliability release form should be signed by each mem-ber of the team. Similarly, all participants mustconsult their physician to determine whether ma-laria prevention or vaccines are warranted beforedeparture. A management plan should also be dis-cussed for diarrhea prevention and treatment. The trip leader must assume the responsibility of becoming and remaining informed of possible sourcesof danger or dysfunction in the host country in themonths leading up to the trip. The leader must dowhatever is necessary to keep participants safe, manyof whom may be traveling outside of developed econo-mies for the rst time. On past trips, this has attimes not been an issue and has been as simple, forexample, as staying off the roads at night; at othertimes, hiring off-duty police ofcers as armed policeguards was necessary. Participants should registerfor the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program 4through the U.S. Department of State to receive travel advisoryalerts. Occasionally, it will also be prudent to notifythe U.S. embassy in the host country of the equitarianteam's presence and itinerary. 4. Discussion Equitarian work in Latin America is important bothfor the equine and human populations of the hostcountries. This form of international communityservice has many benets for program participantsas well but presents a myriad of organizational chal-lenges. These challenges can effectively be metwith a systematic approach and attention to detail.Laying the correct groundwork with participantsand the host country in the initial stages of a pro-gram will maximize potential for effective longevityand minimize it for disruptive and dangerous error.

Equitwister MS, DACVS, DACVSMR*; DABVP (Eq) The Equitwister is an ideal instrument for use in Equitarian work. The instrument is inexpensive andeasy to use. Thus far there have been no complications to castration using the Equitwister. Studentshave found this an easier technique to master than either emasculators or the Henderson castrationdevice. Authors' delivering health care to working equids, castra- tion is the most common surgical procedure per-formed. In Equitarian work, castration is typicallydone on a single day in a community during a yearlyvisit. Due to the lack of ability to follow up on thesepatients, it is imperative that reliable techniqueswith few complications be used. In addition, thesetechniques are often simultaneously taught to localveterinarians or veterinary students. Ideally, thetechniques should be simple, easily repeatable, anduse equipment that is affordable. The most common perioperative complication of castration is hemorrhage. 1Other post castration complications are swelling, infection, and eviscera-tion. Swelling and infection are directly related topostoperative care, but hemorrhage and eviscera-tion are directly related to the procedure. Interest-ingly, closed castration techniques have fewercomplications than other techniques. 2However, the size and contents of the vaginal tunics preventthe use of closed castration techniques in some in-stances. 1This is usually due to the fact that withlarge vaginal tunics, emasculators cannot achieve sufcient crush to prevent excess hemorrhage.The Henderson tool castration method is a solutionto this problem. The technique uses a clamp thatcan accommodate the entire cord. The instrumentis then attached to a battery-powered drill and thetesticle is twisted off. 3The twisting technique is not new and has been used on swine for years, notonly to reduce hemorrhage, but also to reduce thepossibility of evisceration (a common problem inswine). The twisting of vessels to stop hemorrhagewas the preferred surgical technique for hemostasisuntil the advent of absorbable suture for ligatures.The Henderson tool has become a popular method touse for equine castrations, particularly in Equitar-ian work because of its reliability. Sustainability is an important goal of Equitarian work. In this context, sustainability may be de-ned as the ability to continue the spectrum of vet-erinary work after the Equitarians leave. In thiscase, the local veterinarians or animal health work-ers should be able to continue to perform excellentquality castrations. This can be difcult for no AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 329EQUITARIAN SESSION NOTESother reason than equipment is unaffordable, as good-quality emasculators will cost several hundreddollars. Although cheaper ones can be obtained, ithas been the author's (Turner) experience thatcheap surgical tools fail to function properly muchmore often than expensive instruments made ofgood materials. In the case of the Henderson tech-nique, the Henderson clamp is expensive, the powerdrill is expensive, and castrations may be performedin areas without access to recharge batteries, mak-ing the tool unusable. The purpose of this paper is to describe how the Equitarian Initiative and Christian Veterinary Mis-sion developed the Equitwister, the technique forusing the instrument, and its successful results. Instrumentation The authors developed and tested an instrument thatwould twist the spermatic cord like the Hendersoncastration tool but required only manual effort andcost only a few dollars to make. An 18-in., 5/16thstainless steel rod is bent at two right angles so thatthere is a 9.5-in. shaft, 3.5-in. Crank, and 5-in. handle.A 6-in. piece of the 5/16th-in. steel is bent at an acuteangle and welded to the end of the shaft. One-inchPVC is used for the sleeves, which are placed over theshaft and handle that prevent surgical gloves frombeing entrapped in the instrument as it is turned (Fig.1). Total cost of materials to make one Equitwister is$4.71 and a couple of hours of time. 2. Materials and Methods Before performing a castration in the equine patient, apreoperative examination is performed. The scrotummust be palpated (under sedation, if necessary) to con-rm the presence of one or both testes as well as todetect any indication of inguinal herniation. 3The presence or history of inguinal herniation is to help avoid evisceration postopera-tively. Evidence of inguinal herniation or the ab-sence of one or both testes requires a different surgicaltechnique. preoperative considerations antimicrobial administra-tion, and preoperative administration of nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs. The authors prefer to use general anesthesia when castrating in the developing countries because surgicalexposure is improved. In addition, it carries less riskfor the surgeon and patient. Various drugs and com-binations of drugs can be used. Drug combinationfamiliarity is essential for proper patient monitoringand safety. In addition, one should use only drugsthat are locally obtainable. Most commonly, a com-bination of xylazine and ketamine hydrochloride isused to induce and maintain anesthesia. After induc-tion, the patient is positioned in lateral recumbency.The upper hindlimb is secured with a rope around thepastern and hock. The limb can be secured in anynumber of ways to protect the surgeons. After re-cumbency, an antimicrobial scrub is performed on thescrotum and surrounding area. Local anesthetic(10-20 mL lidocaine hydrochloride) is injected intoeach spermatic cord, the testicular parenchyma, orboth. This reduces the need for additional doses ofanesthetics as well as retraction of the cord by thecremaster muscle. Standing over the dorsum of thepatient, the surgeon has good access to the surgicalsite and is in a safe position. The midline of thescrotum is cross clamped with two large hemostats orcarmalt clamps, and a 5-cm diameter section scissors. Minimal skin bleeders result.Both testes can be exteriorized from this opening. The scrotal fascia is stripped from one exteriorized testicle using a dry piece of gauze. The fascia isstripped from the spermatic cord as far proximallyas possible. The same procedure is performed onthe second testicle. After testicular exteriorizationand stripping of the spermatic cords, the most ven-tral testicle's cord is wrapped between the forks ofthe sterile Equitwister castrating tool with the tes-ticle preventing the cord from sliding free (Fig. 2). Fig. 1. The Equitwister. Fig. 2. This illustration shows the testicle wrapped between thetines at the end of the shaft. Light pull on the instrument keepsthe cord straight, the cord is then twisted by turning the handle. 330 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEQUITARIAN SESSIONOne hand holds the Equitwister and mild tension is applied to the instrument so that the spermatic cordremains straight. The other hand turns the Equit-wister like a crank. As the Equitwister is turning,the spermatic cord will retract into the scrotum as itinitially shortens when it begins to twist. Lighttension is maintained on the cord to prevent the cordfrom twisting upon itself. The cord will continue totwist until it fatigues and separates with only min-imal tension by the operator, typically in 15-25turns. The testicle is removed from the castratinginstrument, leaving behind a tightly coiled andsealed segment of the closed spermatic cord. Thesecond testicle is removed in the same fashion.The horse is then recovered. Horses are observed for 1 hour after surgery for potential complications. Further followup is byphone call assessment via local animal health careindividuals. Complications were noted that con-sisted of continued bleeding after recovery, any tis-sue hanging from the scrotum or excessive swellingduring the rst 3 days after surgery. 4. Discussion The authors have successfully castrated more than100 horses this past year using the described tech-nique without any complications. The averageweight of the horses was approximately 300-370 kgand they included a wide range of ages. We haveused the technique for standing castration but havenot yet tried to use it for removing a retainedtesticle. As previously stated, in Equitarian work, followup of horses can be difcult. Therefore, it is impera-tive to use reliable techniques with as few potentialcomplications as possible. It is also important thatthe technique be simple so as to teach others, andinexpensive so that the service is sustainable. Inaddition to the safety of the patient and surgeon, theprimary advantage of the Equitwister technique isthe perception of signicant reduction of intraoper-ative and postoperative complications. After 100horses, we have not had a complication. There isminimal, if any, bleeding. Like the Henderson tool,the Equitwister instrument coils and seals the tes-ticular artery and spermatic cord. 3Clamping the scrotal skin eliminates most scrotal skin bleeders.2 The sealing of the spermatic cord seems to reducethe possibility of evisceration. 2,3The large scrotal opening allows for excellent drainage.3Castrated horses are allowed to return to light work the dayfollowing surgery, thus reducing postoperativeswelling. The Equitwister costs just a few dollarsto make compared with hundreds of dollars to pur-chase a Henderson tool or a good emasculator.More than 50 veterinary students have been trainedto use the tool and when asked they have found thetool easier to use than either the emasculator orHenderson tool. In the authors' opinion, the slow twist of Equit- wister is superior to the power twist of the Hender-son tool because the spermatic cord is less likely todouble on itself and the slower speed provides atighter twist. Experience with this instrument indeveloping countries suggests this may be a superiortechnique for routine use, and the authors encour-age others to try the instrument.

Introduction Equitarian Initiative or projects of this nature were designed to target working equids in developing orimpoverished countries throughout the world. Aworking equid could be dened as an animal (horse,mule, or donkey) that performs physical work thatprovides income for a family and in some cases sus-tains an entire family. The duties performed bythese animals are varied dependent on the locationbut could range from family transportation, tourism,all aspects of agriculture in poor countries, and in-dustry such as the brick kilns in Egypt and commer-cial taxi horses in Ethiopia. It is obvious thatanimals performing physical work require routinehoof care and it is just as obvious that the lack ofsuch care can and will cause immeasurable hoofproblems and lameness in this population of work-ing equids. Therefore, the importance of farriery inall these countries must be realized. The approachto improving foot care is difcult as it not only in-volves care for the animals while there, but instruc-tion of the local populace in the importance of goodfarriery, and also how to implement it in a very basicmanner. The approach to accomplish this will varyfrom country to country but the general theme willalways revolve around teaching.2. The Approach Poor countries have not been introduced to goodfarriery or the benets of such farriery. Ownersgenerally perform it (if at all) in a primal mannerwith primitive or makeshift tools (Fig. 1). For oneto perform and teach farriery in these countries,the veterinarian must be adept at farriery or havea farrier join the group. With the language bar-rier that often occurs, even with an interpreter,these people must learn by observing. A 1-day-or-longer farrier course designed for the locals hasbeen rewarding and has yielded long-term benets(this will be described later). Appropriate farriertools are important and usually not available inthe various projects. We have addressed this inmany instances by having farrier supply compa-nies donate shoes, nails, and tools. Lately, wehave even asked farriers to donate used tools thatcould be used by the local farriers while we arethere and then left for them to continue what theyhave been taught. Finally, a very basic, understandable approach to basic trimming and placing a shoe (when necessary)must be taught in a very limited amount of time.Bringing these three concepts together creates thechallenge. 332 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEQUITARIAN SESSION NOTES3. The Basic Technique The author has been involved in Equitarian projects with the Sioux Indians in South Dakota, theHavasupai Indians in Supai at the bottom of theGrand Canyon, and citizens of the Dominican Re-public, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Ethiopia. The tech-nique used will be based upon what type of work theanimal performs, the amount of work performed,and the surface upon which the animal works.Therefore, a generalized statement can be madethat not only applies to working equids, but to allequines, and that is: to remain comfortable, whenwear on the bottom of the foot exceeds growth at thecoronet, some form of protection is necessary. Inthis category are equids that do strenuous hauling,tourism, and provide taxi services. All of theseequids are asked to perform on hard surfaces. Incontrast, there is a large population of horses thatare able to exist without shoes. However, the lackof foot care or the lack of knowledge and tools toperform said farriery care, leads to severe hoof dis-tortions. The overgrown horn that causes the hoofdistortions often results in abscesses, separations,and/or cracks and places abnormal forces on thedigit above the hoof. The basic technique begins with a very simplied version of the trim. The trim can be further modi-ed depending on whether it is an extremely dis-torted and overgrown foot or whether it will be a footthat will receive some type of protection. The rudi-mentary trim used with the working equid is basedon proportionality of the foot rather than teachingthem how to do a step-by-step trim. For example,the frog is rst located, the hoof wall next to the frogis trimmed (by whatever means) until all structuresare on the same plane. A line is then drawn acrossthe apex of the frog (or this area is just pointed out)and then the toe is reduced (from the outside wall orthe bottom of the foot) until there are approximateproportions on either side of the line or point of thefrog. It must be remembered at all times that youare generally teaching an owner or caregiver withperhaps little interest and no farrier skills. I willuse Equitarian projects in two totally different coun-tries to expand on this concept. 4. The Dominican Republic There has always been a multitude of foot problemsencountered during Project Samana in the Domini-can Republic. Our farriery efforts here have beenrewarding as there have been observable positiveresults over the past few years. In 2009, we de-cided to do a very basic farrier course for the horseowners and caregivers. We started by having twomajor farrier product distributors donate shoes andnails. This material was shipped to a container inFlorida and sent on to the Dominican Republic toawait our visit. We generally set aside 1 day of ourschedule during the week to teach this course, whichconsists of demonstrations in the morning and thenhands-on training in the afternoon for the partici-pants. A Dominican veterinary student acts as theinterpreter, which is ideal because they understandboth the foot anatomy and the farrier terms. During this course, instruction was given and re- peated constantly on how to use the hoof knife, thenippers, and a rasp. With feet that are markedlyovergrown, the heels grow tall and the frog recedesdown below the hoof wall at the heels. Our ap-proach is always to nd, identify, and lightly trimthe frog as the frog will always show the amount ofhoof wall that has grown forward. aUsing the nip- pers and a rasp, the heels are taken down to thepoint where the hoof wall at the heels and the frogare on the same plane, which makes this section ofthe foot load sharing. Something as simple as astraight piece of wood is laid across the heel area todemonstrate all structures on the same plane (Fig.2). Next, the same piece of wood or the edge of arasp is placed across the foot at the point of the frog(Fig. 3). This shows the student how much exces-sive hoof wall or toe is present in front of this line.Modestly using the nippers, the hoof wall at the toeis reduced and the entire foot is rasped as level aspossible. Dividing the foot into approximate halves Fig. 1. The three tools used by farriers in Ethiopia. Fig. 2. A simple piece of wood used to demonstrate the frog andhoof wall on the same plane. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 333EQUITARIAN SESSIONseems to demonstrate how to perform an acceptable trim in a relatively brief period of time. The application of shoes was the second part of the demonstration. The selection of shoes here is verylimited, almost to the point of one size tsall. Many of the lamenesses we saw in shod horseswere from misplaced shoes. Shoes were too smallfor the foot so when shoes were nailed on, the nailswere placed well behind the sole wall junction, in-vading sensitive tissue and causing infection (Fig. 4,A and B). So when applying shoes, I emphasizedchoosing a shoe that was large enough to cover thesurface of the trimmed foot. I was not as emphaticabout the t of the shoe as I was about selecting theappropriate size (Fig. 5, A and B). The other im-portant part of nailing was to teach that the designon the head of the horseshoe nail must be facingtoward the frog so the nail would go in the properdirection and exit through the hoof wall when thenail was hammered into the foot. Finally, when thenails were all placed in the foot, the students weretaught to give three taps on each nail head whendrawing the nails tight so as not to overtighten thenails. In subsequent years, when we returned andwatched the same individuals shoeing their horses,every one counted \"one, two, three\" out loud as theytightened the nails. It is amazing how a few simplefun maneuvers keep the technique fresh in theirmind and they adhere to the few important stepslaid out in the initial course. It is remarkable howmuch the quality of hoof care has improved on thisisland. 5. Ethiopia Ethiopia is a very poor country and animal sufferingis rampant. The people do not have enough to eatlet alone the means to feed their horses properly.I traveled to this country on behalf of the Society forthe Protection of Animals Abroad (SPANA), a char-itable organization based in the United Kingdom.The mission was to spend a week there to improvethe foot care by teaching the farriers. The horsesprovide the sole income for their owners and areused to haul cargo or as taxi horses. This projectwas a real challenge as the tools and materials usedin this country could not be changed (Fig. 1). Inthis country, pieces of tires are nailed to the horse'sfeet for protection instead of steel horseshoes. Aslittle in the methodology or equipment could bechanged, I set out as usual to teach farriery princi-ples. Principles were how to evaluate the foot,guidelines for trimming (with their tools) and how tot (proper size) and place their shoes (tires). 1,2 Ten farriers and ve technicians (who teach thefarriers) from the university attended the farrieryseminar, which was held in a classroom at a littleschool house in the middle of a town called DebereBerhan. There were 2 hours of lectures in themorning, which consisted of mostly pictures but thelanguage was translated very effectively by Dr. Fig. 3. Rasp placed across the widest part of the foot to demon-strate proportionality. Fig. 4. A, A shoe much too small for the foot.

When being shod, the animal is never taken out of the cart. The owner holds the horse's foot and thefarrier kneels down behind it. The entire foot istrimmed with a hammer and toeing knife. The far-riers were taught the bare basics of trimming andhow to remove flares from the outer hoof wall usingthe toeing knife (Fig. 6). Their method of nailingwas so different as they place nails in the foot in avertical direction far from the perimeter of the foot(actually on the inside of the white line); they thenslant the nails and drive them partially through thesole and then exit out the hoof wall (Fig. 7). Thismethod of nailing is not always successful, so obvi-ously, foot abscesses are epidemic. Another majorcomplication is that the round carpenter nails usedto attach the shoes cannot be imbedded in the outerhoof wall or 'clinched'. So when the animal trots,the nail sticking out will often strike the oppositelimb causing a severe laceration. This was furthercomplicated by the fact that these horses were somalnourished, which caused a very narrow chest,which made the animal more prone to strike theother limb. By the second day, we started to see results. The farriers would look at the foot, start to trim theheels/remove flares, and cut out shoes that actuallyt the foot. The larger pieces of tire actuallyseemed to help the nailing process and keep thenails in the insensitive horn. The farriers com-plained that the small shoes were necessary becausethey had to get so many shoes out of a given tire forwhat they paid for the tire - so we bought some tires(20 Bir each which is equal to $2) and they werehappy to cut out the proper size.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 335EQUITARIAN SESSIONEach day we went to a different taxi station and by the end of the week, I could readily see that we made a difference (Fig. 8, A and B). Two steps herethat would help would be some type of funding oroutlet for a cheap source of tires and the importationof some type of cheap horseshoe nails (possibly fromChina) that could be used in the rubber shoes.The head of the horseshoe nail could be imbedded inthe tire better and the flat thin shank of the nailcould be placed closer against the hoof wall andwould not be sticking out. 6. Conclusion Farriery in developing countries is such an impor-tant aspect of not only relieving pain, suffering, andlameness, but also increasing the productive life ofworking equids. The challenges here are immensebecause the local culture, education of the caregiv-ers, language, tools, and equipment must be takeninto consideration. Teaching the local owners somevery simple, understandable principles seems to bethe most successful approach to improve farriery.The instruction must be given in a very understand-able manner by either a veterinarian who under-stands farriery or a farrier versed in this type ofwork and who understands the principles. The lastpoint is to provide some equipment and shoes sowhat has been taught can be continued. On a per-sonal note, participating in these projects allows oneto provide quality veterinary and farriery care tothese animals, the personal satisfaction is huge andit is a way of giving back to one's profession.

Although no single factorcorrelated directly with body condition score, the study provided a more complete picture of the healthproblems facing this population of horses. In the context of Equitarian work, even basic diagnostictesting and epidemiological investigations have great potential to inform clinical decision making andhelp prioritize allocation of resources. Author's address: Sustainable Veterinarians International,10249 6th Street SW, ND AAEP. 1. Introduction Thin or emaciated body condition is one of the most visible welfare problems of horses used for pulling,plowing, or carrying heavy loads. It is upsetting toobservers, and may serve as a trigger for Equitarianintervention. A commonly identied cause is insuf-cient caloric intake for the amount of work that isrequired of these animals. In addition to malnutri-tion, other major contributing factors include infec-tious diseases, parasitism, and severe dentalabnormalities. This paper summarizes a pilot proj-ect undertaken to better understand the infectiousand parasitic causes of poor body condition amongworking horses in Nicaragua. The specic objec-tive of this project was to estimate the local preva-lence of several regionally important infectious andparasitic conditions, and then compare these nd-ings to physical examination parameters such asbody condition score. This investigation was undertaken after the au- thor had participated in various equitarian projectsin Nicaragua and other Central American countries.Frequently, owners would voice nonspecic com-plaints such as poor appetite, lethargy, and ill thrift.An absence of diagnostic capabilities, coupled withlittle or no evidence-based knowledge of local dis-eases made it difcult to offer appropriate treatmentto these animals and advice to their owners. Dis-eases of interest were chosen based on conversationswith local veterinarians, reports from other coun-tries, 1,2and the availability of serological testing. 2. Materials and Methods Cases were selected at random from among thehorses presented for routine and preventive veteri-nary care during the Equitarian Workshop in Octo-ber 2014. At each of four clinic sites (Granada,Managua, La Paz Centro, and Ometepe) the horseswere numbered on admission; every other horse wassampled until the number reached approximately10% of the caseload. Each animal underwent a fullphysical examination by one of ve United States- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 337EQUITARIAN SESSION NOTEStrained veterinarians with the help of Nicaraguan veterinary students. At a minimum, the followinginformation was collected: the horse's age in years,body condition score (BCS) from 1-9 on the HennekeScale, temperature (in Fahrenheit), pulse, respira-tion, mucous membrane color (MM), and estimatednumbers of external parasites (ticks) were recorded.Whenever possible, photos of the horses were takento help ensure that body condition scoring was con-sistent across the different veterinarians. Blood and fecal samples were taken to be pro- cessed or submitted for the following: Packed cell volume (PCV) Plasma total solids (TS) via refractometer Blood smear evaluation Quantitative fecal flotation PCR followup Samples were processed the same day they were collected. Serum was separated and refriger-ated, and whole blood was used to make a bloodsmear and determine PCV and TS. All readings forPCV and TS were performed by the author. Bloodsmears were later stained band evaluated by the author for presence of hemoparasites. Differentialcounts were not performed. All serology was per-formed the following week, at the diagnostic labora-tory of the Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica inHeredia, due to lack of diagnostic capabilities inNicaragua and difculty in obtaining permits tobring samples back to the United States. Fecalsamples were refrigerated during storage and pro-cessed by the author using standard technique forquantitative fecal flotation using a McMaster count-ing chamber. 3. Results The sample set of 35 horses included 10 mares, 10stallions and 15 geldings (Table 1). Ages rangedfrom 1 to 19 years with an average of 8.4 years.Body condition ranged from 1.5 to 5 of 9 on theHenneke scale, with an average of 2.9/9. The aver-age body condition varied slightly by community:Granada averaged Managua 3/9, La Paz Cen-tro 2.6/9, majority of horses (33/35 or 94%) were classi- ed as anemic with a PCV less than 32%, and theaverage PCV was 26.6%. The average value of to-tal plasma solids was 7.0 g/dL with a range of 6.4 to9.3 g/dL. No animals were found to be hypopro-teinemic. The subjective classication of mucousmembrane color as \"pink\" or \"pale\" was a weakpredictor of actual PCV. For the 20 horses classi-ed as \"pink\", the PCV value ranged from 20 to 37%with an average of 26.8%. For the 13 horses clas-sied as \"pale\", the PCV ranged from 15-30% withan average of 26.1%. BCS did not correlate to PCV(Fig. 1). However, the three horses with the high-est PCV (all /H1102230%) also had body condition scores of 4/9, which is higher than the average of 2.9/9. The AGID test for EIA was positive in four of 35 samples, for an overall prevalence rate of 11%.However, three of four positives were found inGranada (38% local prevalence rate) and no posi-tives were recorded in Managua or Ometepe. Theaverage PCV for the four positive horses was 22%,lower than the overall average of 26.6% and theaverage BCS was also lower than average at 2.4/9. Evaluation of the blood smears did not reveal any hemoparasites, but various indicators of anemiawere frequently observed, such as anisocytosis,marked rouleaux formation, and increased centralpallor of red blood cells. Almost all horses (34/35, or 97%) were positive on the cELISA screening test for one or both of theorganisms that cause equine piroplasmosis; co-infections were common. The predominant organ-ism varied by community, as shown in Fig. 2. InGranada, 63% were positive for B. caballi and 100% were positive for T. equi; in Managua, 60% were positive for B. caballi and 80% were positive for T. equi; in La Paz Centro, 83% were positive for B. caballi and 58% were positive for T. equi; and in Ometepe, 100% were positive for B. caballi and 20% were positive for T. equi. When the horses were grouped by cELISA status, there were modest dif-ferences in body condition and PCV value. The sixanimals that tested positive for only T. equi showed a lower-than-average PCV (24.5%) but a higher-than-average BCS (3.1/9); the only B. caballi had a higher-than-average PCV (28.5%) and an average BCS (2.8/9); the 15 animalspositive for both organisms were close to the generalaverages at 26.2% and 2.9/9, respectively. The onehorse that was negative for both T. equi and B. caballi was also negative for EIA, and yet was still moderately anemic with a PCV of 23% and a BCS of2.5/9. Due to nancial limitations, only a subset of pos- itive samples were selected for follow-up PCR toinvestigate what percentage of positive animals ei-ther had active piroplasmosis or were serving asreservoirs for the organism. For B. caballi, 13 sam- ples with positive cELISA were also submitted forfollow-up PCR, and only one tested positive (7.7%).ForT. equi, 12 samples with positive cELISA were submitted for follow-up PCR and seven were foundto be positive (58.3%). Of the seven animals withpositive cELISA and PCR results, the average BCSwas 2.6/9; the average BCS for the ve horses thatwere cELISA positive and PCR negative was 3.6/9. Fecal flotation revealed strongyle eggs in 24 of 29 samples (83%). Of the 24 samples with strongyles,ve samples had less than 500 eggs per gram (EPG)and were classied as low shedders; 14 samples hadfrom 500-1150 EPG and 338 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEQUITARIAN SESSIONshedders; the remaining ve samples had 1200 or greater EPG and were classied as high shedders.No additional testing was performed to distinguishlarge strongyles (S. vulgaris) from cyathostomes.One sample was positive strongyles andpinworms (Oxyuris equi). The distribution of par-asite burden is summarized in Fig. 3. 4. Discussion The purpose of this preliminary study was to inves-tigate which, if any, of several infectious and para-sitic conditions might correlate with low bodycondition score. Unfortunately, the ability to drawconclusions was limited by the small sample size, aswell as the uniformly low body condition scores,which made comparisons within the data set dif-cult. For example, comparisons between animalswith BCS /H110225o r/H110215 was not possible because no animals had a body condition score greater than 5/9.Similarly, animals that were seronegative and sero-positive for piroplasmosis could not be compared dueto the lack of seronegative animals. BCS also didnot clearly correlate with either the level of anemia,or the number of strongyle eggs shed by thesehorses. Due to the small sample size and the pre-liminary nature of the study, statistical analysiswas not performed on the data. In addition tosmall sample size, major weaknesses of this studyincluded potential variation in body condition scor-ing as performed by several different veterinariansas well as multiple confounding variables that werenot accounted for such as diet and workload. Two factors did suggest a possible correlation with low BCS: seropositivity for EIA and a positive PCRresult for T. equi. A larger number of horses would be needed to conrm these observations, which werebased on only four and seven animals, respectively.Although these results cannot be used to draw con-clusions, they do suggest future areas of investiga-tion. In the case of EIA, conrming this correlationTable 1.

In the case of T. equi, conrming this correlation could in turn gen-erate two different hypotheses: 1) that the activeform of the disease causes poor body condition,and/or 2) that the horse's ability to control T. equi parasitemia is dependent upon having adequateoverall body condition. The second hypothesis leads to the topic of nutri- tion, which was not addressed in this study. Com-mon sense suggests that malnutrition is likely to bethe single most signicant factor influencing bodycondition score in this population. Malnutritionmay also directly contribute to anemia. Barriers toimproving nutrition for these horses include lack ofresources, lack of owner knowledge, and the dry-tropical climate. Methods of feeding horses usinglocal, rather than imported feedstuffs, especiallyduring the dry season, is a topic that has greatpotential to improve the welfare of these animals; itis unfortunately beyond the scope of this paper.A high incidence of anemia (94%) was demon- strated in all four locations. EIA, whereas onlyfound in 11% of samples, is likely to have signicanteffect on infected horses, as suggested by the lower-than-average PCV and BCS of the four positivehorses. A larger sample size would be required toconrm this correlation. The local variation in EIAprevalence rates should encourage locally specic,evidence-based recommendations. In Granada,which had the highest incidence of EIA in this study,additional testing is essential. If Granada is con-rmed to have an EIA prevalence rate greater than30%, it provides solid evidence justifying the imple-mentation of control measures, which could rangefrom tabanid traps to an enhanced surveillance plansponsored by the local government. Ofcially, Ni-caraguan policy requires the humane destruction ofhorses conrmed to be infected, but in practice thereis no mandatory testing or enforcement of this rule.The AGID test is available only in Managua, and itis prohibitively expensive for owners of workinghorses, even if they were motivated to test their Fig. 1. Packed cell volume graphed according to body condition score. Fig. 2. Serological survey of EIA and piroplasmosis in working horses in Nicaragua, by community.340 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEQUITARIAN SESSIONanimals. Potential ways to address this problem could include local implementation of vector (ta-banid) control, or a program to promote and subsi-dize testing sponsored by the local government.Any successful program would need to include amechanism to facilitate the replacement or compen-sation for positive horses so that owners of positivehorses do not lose what is often their sole source ofincome. Equine piroplasmosis is endemic with 97% of horses testing positive on cELISA for one or bothcausative organisms. Blood smear evaluation wasconrmed to have a very low sensitivity for detectinginfection. Follow-up PCR testing conrmed that apositive titer to T. equi is more likely to represent active hemoparasitemia than a positive titer to B. caballi. This is consistent with previous ndingsfrom Brazil and Venezuela. 1,2In general, the clin- ical course of B. caballi is often less severe than that ofT. equi3although both infections can be fatal. The high prevalence of piroplasmosis found in thisstudy raises the issue of whether to treat the diseasewhen it is suspected. Ometepe, for example, had100% seroprevalence for B. caballi; veterinarians working in that area can condently recommendimproved tick control, and the select use of imido-carb dipropionate may be justied for horses show-ing acute clinical signs of anemia. The goal intreating these cases would not be to clear the organ-ism, but to improve clinical signs and prevent seri-ous complications, potentially enabling the horse tomount an improved immune response and controlthe parasitemia. It is the author's hope to encourage more equita- rians to perform PCV and blood smear evaluation inthe eld. Blood smear evaluation was conrmed tohave a very low sensitivity for detecting hemopara-sites, but it is simple and inexpensive to perform,and can potentially yield a denitive diagnosis ifhemoparasites are conrmed. An unexpected ob-servation in this study was the low correlation be-tween the subjective observation of mucousmembrane color and the objective measurement of PCV. This should encourage more Equitarians totest for PCV in the eld on suspect cases, even if themucous membranes look pink. Moderate to high strongyle burdens were found in 66% of horses, but fecal egg counts did not correlatewith BCS or PCV. Although this sample size isvery small (29 animals), the results are consistentwith a similar, larger study from Mexico, 3which also failed to correlate EPG to BCS or PCV. Thehigh prevalence of strongyles does provide some ev-idence to justify the administration of anthelminticdrugs to horses in the context of equitarian work,even when fecal results are not immediately avail-able. Given that anthelmintic medications arereadily available and widely used in Nicaragua; it islikely that anthelmintic resistance may already be commonplace. In the future it would be benecialto include follow-up fecal testing whenever possibleto monitor for anthelmintic resistance. Finally, other infectious diseases that are known or suspected to be present in this population ofhorses include anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, vesicularstomatitis, among others.Lack of resources and/or adequate diagnostic testingcapabilities prevented these diseases from being in-cluded in this study. Additional investigation iswarranted, especially considering the zoonotic po-tential of several of these diseases. 5. Summary Poor body condition is multifactorial. In the con-text of Equitarian work, it is almost impossible toseparate \"uncomplicated\" cases of malnutritionfrom other pathological problems. Although thisstudy failed to correlate body condition score toany single infectious disease, it did succeed inproviding a more complete picture of the overallhealth of this particular population of workinghorses. Epidemiological investigations can andshould be included more frequently in the contextof Equitarian work. Even simple investigationshave the potential to elevate the standard of vet-erinary care provided locally, and to better directresources and intervention efforts.

Introduction Funding is one of the biggest challenges that faces equitarian projects in improving working equidhealth. An important goal of the Equitarian Initia-tive is to form relationships and develop projectsthat are sustainable long term. This means fund-raising needs to be an ongoing activity. A fund-raiser that creates repetitive donations is ideal andis possible while practicing veterinary medicine andbalancing work and family. Veterinarians strive todevelop relationships in equitarian projects with lo-cal veterinarians, students, and owners. Sponsor-ship will help donors develop a similar relationshipbecause it is not practical or logistically feasible tohave all donors travel to project sites. Donors canbecome more engaged in the work through interac-tive fundraising events and ongoing education. The equitarian project in Haiti focuses on a group of working equids in Milot, which is also the Na-tional Historical site of the Citadel (built in 1804 toprotect Haiti from invasion). The Citadel is locatedat almost 3,000 feet above sea level and is accessibleonly on foot or horseback. In early 2014, before theproject began, the working animals in this area re-ceived limited veterinary care and no preventative care. Because the government is currently invest-ing in boosting tourism in Haiti, equine owners havebecome increasingly concerned that tourists will not want to ride their horses because the horses are thinand have poor saddles. The owners embraced theproject after seeing positive results. Results in-cluded improved body scores and diminished saddlesores. However, impressed with the initial results,we saw the need for ongoing support and educationto produce long-term transformation. After assess-ing the situation and brainstorming, we decided tocreate a sponsorship program for the working ani-mals. Sponsorship by a monthly donation for send-ing children to school and providing humanitarianneeds is a successful method of fundraising recog-nized worldwide. In Haiti, there are many well-established programs by large organizations such asCompassion International, local organizations, andchurches. This method of fundraising is somethingboth donors and recipients can identify with. 2. Materials and Methods In the equitarian project in Haiti, sponsorship is themethod used for creating a personal relationshipamong the donor, the working equid, and the owner ina remote location. The donors are mainly clients inour experience. The program has three increasingsponsorship levels: walk, trot, and gallop. Eachlevel represents a dollar amount that identies whatannual sponsorship will provide. For example, the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 343EQUITARIAN SESSION NOTESgallop level is $150 and contributes to veterinary care, veterinary agent training, supplemental feed, and sad-dlery improvements. Veterinary care includes an-nual vaccinations, four dewormings, wound care,castration if needed, and miscellaneous conditionsthat require treatment. The donor selects an individ-ual horse from photos of a tourist horse and its ownerwith names for those involved in this project. At eachof at least 2 yearly veterinary visits to Milot, Haiti,these specic horses will again be identied. Newphotos and updates of their lives and activities will beshared with their sponsors. Sponsors are aware that the funds are going to- ward the project \"One Horse at a Time\" and are usedby all of the 106 horses that live and work in thisarea. Sponsors, however, can track the progress of\"their\" horse and feel they are a part of its life andthe effort to improve its health care. To engage as many sponsors as possible, multiple events were used to promote the \"One Horse at aTime\" project and sponsorship opportunities. Many of these events were our clients' ideas. Several ofour clients, in fact, were already aware of the projectthrough the clinic's website, Facebook, newsletters,and educational seminars. Their creative ideas in-cluded a silent auction at the annual veterinarypractice's spring dinner/seminar, a regional horseassociation that donates the proceeds from one classper show, a local trainer that donates time to asummer event of horse handling demonstrations,wine and cheese tasting, and an obstacle trail class. 3. Results The results of these fundraising events have beenoverwhelmingly positive. The Citadel horse spon-sorship was launched in August 2014, and as ofJanuary 2015, 19 horses are fully sponsored at thegallop level and 40 at the walk and trot levels; so farthe sponsorship has raised more than $5,000. Newopportunities for increasing sponsorship such asthose that accompany speaking engagements willcontinue to emerge in the future. Each visit to the Citadel horses costs approxi- mately between $1,500 and in-clude medical veterinary agent training,permanent identication of the horses, and supple-mental feed. Medical supply costs are offset bygenerous contributions from pharmaceutical compa-nies and distributors. The changes seen in the rstyear of work with these horses were dramatic.As determined by the Henneke scoring system, theaverage body condition score in February 2014 was2/9. 1None was above a 5/9. In May 2014, the body condition score had increased by a score of 1 to2 on every horse. Seventy percent of the horses inFebruary had saddle sores graded as moderate tosevere. In May, only 20% had saddle sores andwere graded as mild to moderate. In early Febru-ary 2015, when the air is routinely dry and severelycold and there is considerably less vegetation grow-ing, the body conditions had decreased again. Theaverage body score had decreased from May by a score of 0.5 to 1. These scores were still above theoriginal 2/9 on average. The percentage of saddlesores remain unchanged from May in numbers andseverity. We saw all horses in October and notedhow their body conditions changed thereafter. Therelative recent weight loss is the reason the scoreshave not increased yet. 4. Discussion There are several benets to a sponsor-a-horse-typefundraiser apart from the obvious benet of raisingmoney. It is a practice builder in many ways. Cli-ents ask about and look forward to correspondenceabout the Haitian horses. Events that draw people inshowcase the clinic and its staff and services. Manyclients are proud of their association with a projectthey see as charitable and benevolent, especially aproject so genuinely committed to the welfare ofhorses. Many feel this is a way they can give back toan animal to which they are devoted. It is appealingfor people to know where their money is going and to see results. This type of charitable giving is interac-tive and will help prolong the project's longevity. For the veterinarians involved in equitarian work, the personal advantages are tremendous and createa new perspective from which we view practice.Many of the challenges of our profession such asburnout, managing work and family, and waninginterest in equine practice can be overcome. Veter-inarians who participate in this work regain a pas-sion for their profession and are inspired toproviding more community service and education.They also show a renewed interest in learning aboutnew techniques and diseases. Engaging people who are not involved in the horse industry can also be achieved with this method offundraising; seeing the tangible impact veterinarycare can have on an individual horse is incrediblyimportant. Through education and progress re-ports, one can learn how the owner and family de-pend on one animal as their sole source of income.This working equid, in many cases, has multiplejobs. Their use can include being a \"tourist horse\"used for transporting goods to market and childrento school. It becomes clear that equine health andfamily health are deeply intertwined. One of the unfortunate disadvantages of using a sponsor-a-horse fundraiser is the added time it takesto collect and disburse information and keep records.Although this team approach helps to spread out tasksto each individual at the worksite, it may be difcult toimplement in situations where the horse population isless controlled and where different horses may receiveveterinary care during each visit. Another reality that could be seen as a disadvantage is the shortened lifespan of these horses, especiallymares. Sponsors may \"lose\" their horses. Howeverpainful, this experience provides yet another educa-tional opportunity on the causes of early death and, 344 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEQUITARIAN SESSIONunfortunately, the resulting grief and anguish the horse's owner's family must face in its aftermath. In summary, the sponsor-a-horse method of fund- raising is well-suited and helpful for funding equitar-ian projects long term. Together with fundraisingevents centered around the veterinary practice, clientengagement is strengthened, which can have a posi-tive impact on practice growth.

Introduction Pelvic ultrasound has become more widely accepted since it was introduced in the 1990s to documentilial wing fractures in Thoroughbred racehorses. 1-2 Ultrasound has since been used to diagnose manytypes of pelvic fractures and coxofemoral injuries,including and yield a rapid diagnosis stall-side in theambulatory or hospital setting and is less expensivethan nuclear scintigraphy or radiography. Basedon strong agreement with the latter, ultrasound hasrecently been recommended as the initial imagingmodality in horses suspected of having a pelvicfracture. 8 Pelvic radiography under general anesthesia is generally considered the antemortem gold standard in diagnosing coxofemoral injuries, but it can subjecthorses to further fracture displacement during an-esthetic recovery. 13-17Radiographic techniques in the standing horse have been described but providelimited information in adult horses, especially in regard to the coxofemoral joint.18,19Standing views, specically ventrodorsal projections, may notbe possible with all radiography equipment, even inthe hospital setting. With appropriate training and experience, an ul- trasonographic examination of is relativelystraightforward. In evaluating the coxo-femoral joint is generally considered much morechallenging, and even intimidating, by equine prac-titioners. The coxofemoral joint is admittedly themost difcult pelvic structure to evaluate and re-quires the most skill for image acquisition and in-terpretation. Equipment availability is becomingless of a limitation. Driven by the desire to performabdominal ultrasounds and/or sacroiliac transducerthat is required joint. 346 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSNEW INNOVATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LAMENESS NOTESThe purpose of this article is to describe a unique instructional approach to facilitate ultrasonographic examinations of the coxofemoral joint and to de-scribe the ultrasonographic features of various cox-ofemoral injuries from a referral hospital with alarge imaging caseload. To facilitate and enhancethe viewer experience, 3D video simulations will bepaired with corresponding ultrasound videoclips orimages of the normal and abnormal coxofemoraljoint. 2. Ultrasonographic Technique Indications for ultrasound of the coxofemoral jointand pelvis include horses with severe acute lame-ness, especially with a known or suspected history oftrauma such as a fall, getting a limb caught in afence or gate, or hearing an audible pop. Perineu-ral anesthesia is often avoided in acute cases. Theabsence of distal limb swelling or synovial effusionmay help to localize the lameness to the upper limb.Palpable or audible crepitus may also direct theexam to the pelvic region; however, crepitus isknown to be absent in approximately two-thirds ofhorses with pelvic fractures. Pelvic asymmetry is aless common nding but is useful to direct the ex-aminer to the pelvis in some horses. Gluteal and quadriceps atrophy may be found but typically is lim-ited to horses with chronic coxofemoral injury. Rectalpalpation ndings of swelling or asymmetry may bepresent but are also inconsistent. In horses with lesssevere lameness, pelvic ultrasound is usually per-formed after distal limb perineural or intra-articularanesthesia fails to improve the lameness. Ultra-sound may also be requested based on positive nuclearscintigraphy ndings of increased radiopharmaceuti-cal uptake in horses with moderate to severelameness. Ultrasound of the pelvis and coxofemoral joint is possible with alcohol saturation in short-coated orthin horses; however, clipping the hair with #40blades is necessary in large, overweight, or thick-coated horses. A complete transcutaneous ultra-sound exam of the pelvis should include evaluationof the deep structures of the pelvis (ilial wing, ilialbody, and coxofemoral joint) high-fre-quency linear transducer (rectal or tendon probe).Transrectal ultrasound is recommended in all adulthorses, regardless of rectal palpation ndings. This should include evaluation of the ischium, pubis, surfaces of the acetabulum and ilial body. 4-6,10 Transcutaneous evaluation of the coxofemoral joint requires a scanning depth of 15 to 25 cm de-pending on the size of the horse. The coxofemoraljoint is located beyond the scanning depth of a ten-don, rectal, or microconvex transducer in adulthorses, although imaging is possible with thesetransducers in neonates. Tips to improve under-standing of coxofemoral ultrasound include recallingthat the coxofemoral joint is merely a simple balland socket joint. The use of bony specimens, whenavailable, will help to improve both client and prac-titioner understanding of ultrasound images. Ageneral description of the ultrasonographic ap-proach to the cranial, craniodorsal, and dorsal jointsurfaces will be described, after which the \"clock\"technique will be presented as a method of obtainingthese same views. Although the clock technique isadmittedly simplistic, it has been extremely effec-tive in teaching veterinary students and graduateveterinarians to reliably obtain diagnostic images ofthe coxofemoral joint. To locate the coxofemoral joint, the path along the ilial body to the joint is rst dened by palpating thetuber coxae and greater trochanter of the femur.The transducer is placed to obtain a longitudinalview of the ilial body along this path and slid cau-dally until the articulation of the acetabulum andfemoral head are seen. This will produce a trans-verse view of the cranial joint margins (Fig. 1).The transducer should not be moved more caudallyfrom this location because the greater trochanterwill obscure visualization of the joint. The crani-odorsal and dorsal surfaces are next evaluated bysliding the transducer slightly dorsally and caudallywhile simultaneously rotating the transducer in a Fig. 1.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 347NEW INNOVATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LAMENESSclockwise direction when scanning the right coxo- femoral joint and counterclockwise when scanningthe left coxofemoral is di-rected ventrally to visualize the craniodorsal anddorsal joint surfaces and avoid interference by thegreater trochanter of the femur. This imaging se-quence is best accomplished through the use of theclock technique. To employ the clock technique, it is benecial to actually draw a clock in the gel or on the hair withthe center of the clock at the greater trochanter.A nger is adequate to make tracks in the gel or hairrather than actually drawing with ink or anothermarking product. The clock should be approxi-mately 12 inches in diameter. Clock numbers willthen be used for transducer placement to visualizethe cranial, craniodorsal, and dorsal surfaces of To evaluate the right coxofemoral joint (Fig.2), the transducer is located at approximately 3:00 tovisualize the cranial joint margins. To evaluate thecraniodorsal joint margins, the transducer is placedat 2:00 and then at 1:00. To evaluate the dorsaljoint margins, the transducer is placed at 12:00 andat 11:00 in some horses. Beginners should lookback and forth between the ultrasound machine andthe horse to pick up and place the transducers dur-ing position changes. With experience, imagersshould eventually be able to make a continuoussweep to view all joint surfaces, but this should notbe attempted until images are reliably obtained withall transducer placements. For the left coxofemoraljoint, transducer positions are at 9 to 10:00 for thecranial margins, 10 to 11:00 for the craniodorsalmargins, and 11 to 12:00 (to 1:00 in some horses) forthe dorsal joint margins. In normal horses, the acetabular rim and femoral head should be tightly articulated with only a slightincongruity visible at the joint articulation. Begin-ners are often underwhelmed by the appearance ofthe joint. Joint effusion is typically not visible innormal horses. Bony surfaces should be smooth.Along the cranial margins, the acetabulum slopestoward the transducer slightly to produce a slightski-jump appearance. The acetabulum shows amore flattened appearance along its craniodorsaland dorsal margins. 3. Ultrasonographic Abnormalities Evidence of acetabular rim fractures is the mostcommon ultrasonographic nding in horses evalu-ated with pelvic ultrasonography at our hospital.Small fragments appear as hyperechoic structuresdisplaced slightly from the underlying parent bone,similar to fracture fragments in other joints. Stepdefects may also be seen at the joint margins (Fig.3). Joint effusion may be present, but massive ef-fusion is not expected. Rim fractures can be chal-lenging to detect radiographically as a result ofsummation\u2014even with ventrodorsal projections\u2014unless the fragment is located at the cranial jointmargin. Affected horses often show lameness atthe walk but are typically willing to move forwardonce past the initial injury phase. Horses with lonerim fractures have been known to progressively im-prove over time to become pasture-sound and evento be ridden at low levels. Coxofemoral subluxation and luxation resulting from complete or partial disruption of the roundligaments may also be diagnosed with ultrasound.Horses with subluxation can show a relatively nor-mal joint conguration when the affected limb isresting or partially weight-bearing; however, uponfull weight-bearing, the femoral head can be seen todisplace dorsally (Fig. 4). The femoral head willreturn to the acetabulum once the horse resumesresting the limb. In horses with complete luxation,the femoral head remains displaced regardless ofweight-bearing status. Acetabular rim fracturesand severe joint effusion typically accompany and luxation. In longstanding cases,severe effusion of the cranioventral recess of thejoint is often evident and should not be mistaken formuscle tearing. Affected horses are lame at thewalk but seem less lame than complete acetabularfractures and more lame than sole acetabular rimfractures. Gradual to acute deterioration in lame-ness can be expected; however, some horses haveshown an improved comfort level with therapeutic Fig. 2.

Horses with mild osteoarthritis may show slight irregularity of joint margins. Mild effusion mayalso be seen. Horses with moderate to severe os-teoarthrosis will show more prominently irregularjoint margins and can be difcult to differentiatefrom horses with acetabular rim fractures. Histor-ical features and clinical presentation are oftenhelpful in differentiating between acute and chronicinjury in such cases. Horses with chronic acetabu-lar rim fractures may progress to show evidence ofsevere osteoarthrosis with prominently irregularjoint margins throughout all imaging windows.In longstanding cases, it is often challenging to de-termine whether all ultrasonographic changes arecaused by osteoarthrosis or whether previous frac-tures precipitated the degenerative changes.Complete or comminuted acetabular fractures (Fig. 5) can also be identied but often require lon- gitudinal imaging of the acetabulum to evaluate fordiscontinuity of acetabular surfaces, including gapsor large step defects that may occur as a result ofoverriding fragments. Longitudinal views are gen-erally more challenging than transverse views of theacetabulum/joint and are best performed once trans-verse views are mastered. Although ultrasono-graphic evidence of fracture is typically apparent inhorses with complete or complex acetabular frac-tures, accurate conguration is nearly impossible toassess ultrasonographically. It should also be men-tioned that horses with signicantly displaced or overriding ilial body, pubic, and/or ischial frac-tures may create large step defects in the acetabular region that could be mistaken for acetabular fracture. Horses with complete or comminuted acetabular frac-tures are often severely painful and reluctant to move.Stall-side exams are often necessary. Prognosis ispoor to grave. Transrectal ultrasound of the axial surface of the acetabulum is useful in helping to identify completeacetabular fractures (acetabular rim fractures willnot be visible during transrectal ultrasound). Astandard rectal transducer is ideal for axial acetab-ular imaging, but a microconvex transducer can alsobe used because its small size allows for easy ma-nipulation. Immediately upon entry into the rec-tum, the ischium is visualized by directing thetransducer ventrally to show its smooth bony sur-face. The axial surface of the acetabulum is foundby following the lateral extent of the ischium crani-ally until the transducer is located at the level of thecoxofemoral joint (as estimated from external land-marks). Alternatively, the axial surface of the ac-etabulum can be found by sweeping the transducerlaterally from an image of the pubis. The pubis isrst identied by advancing the foramen the ischium until the convexbony surface of the pubis is seen at approximatelymid-forearm's length. Fractures are identied bythe presence of step defects with varying degrees of Fig. 3.

Fracture movement may be noticed with limb movement or shifting of the horse's weight.In questionable cases, comparison to the contralat-eral limb should be performed. Callus formationmay be also seen in horses with healing fractures.Callus will produce a tufted or somewhat prolifera-tive appearance to the bone. Hematoma formationmay be present but is a surprisingly uncommonnding in horses with coxofemoral fracture. Theabsence of visible or palpable hematomas should notdissuade the examiner from the possibility offracture. Proximal femoral fractures are relatively uncom- mon but can be identied during coxofemoral ultra-sound. Capital physeal fractures may be found infoals and are best seen on transverse views of thecoxofemoral joint (Fig. 6a). A gap between the fem-oral head and neck may be visible with varyingdegrees of displacement. Care should be taken notto overinterpret the appearance of cartilage andphyses in the immature horse (Fig. 6B). Compari-son to the contralateral limb should be performed todifferentiate between fracture and the normal phy-seal appearance.4. Results Sixty-eight horses with ultrasonographic evidence ofcoxofemoral injury were identied from January 1,2000 through December 31, 2014.

Multiple breeds and uses wererepresented. Many horses were presented with ahistory of trauma. All but 6 horses were lame atthe walk (Grade 4-5/5, AAEP Lameness Scale). Primary ultrasound diagnoses included acetabu- lar rim fractures (22), subluxation (15), complete/complex acetabular fracture lone osteoarthritis(7), lone effusion (4), luxation (4), femoral fracture(4), and evidence of joint widening or slight sublux-ation (2). Three horses had negative ultrasoundexams but underwent ultrasound-guided injectionsbased on other positive Ultrasonographic evidence of acetabular rim the most frequently identied abnormal-ity during coxofemoral ultrasound and was visible ina total of 38 horses. This included horses with pri-mary acetabular rim fractures and the majority ofhorses with evidence of subluxation and luxation.Complete or complex acetabular fractures generallyshowed multiple step defects throughout the jointupon transcutaneous exam. Transrectal ultra-sound was helpful to conrm complete fractures viadetection of fracture displacement along the axialsurface of the acetabulum (Fig. 7). Affected horseswere in severe pain, unstable, and reluctant tomove. Ultrasound exams were generally per-formed in the stall. Four horses were euthanizedsoon after diagnosis, necropsy conrmed ultra-sonographic ndings in horses. Onehorse recovered to pasture soundness. The out-come of the remaining two horses is unknown. Horses with subluxation and luxation generally presented with a chronic history of lameness of vary-ing degrees at the walk. Affected horses included 4foals/yearlings and 15 adults aged 6 to 29 years(median /H1100515 years). Gluteal and quadriceps atro- phy was a common feature in many of these horses(Fig. 8). Most showed evidence of severe osteoar-thritis, acetabular rim fractures, and severe effusionand synovitis, especially of the cranioventral recess.Two additional horses showed evidence of mild sub-luxation and joint widening. This was interpretedas joint laxity caused by severe atrophy of the af-fected limb in one undiagnosed horse that presentedfor severe leaning and, in another horse, to a largelumbar squamous cell carcinoma mass that inter-fered with femoral nerve function. Ultrasonographic evidence of osteoarthritis was identied in a total of 24 horses, including the 7horses with lone osteoarthritis. Osteoarthriticchanges were subjectively graded as mild in 6horses with focal osteophytes of the femoral heador acetabulum, moderate in 3 horses with multiplesmall ostephytes, and severe in 15 horses withdiffuse proliferative changes visible throughoutthe coxofemoral joint (Fig. 9). Horses with severeosteoarthritis included horses with subluxation(8), rim fractures (4), luxation (2), and primaryosteoarthritis (1). Effusion and/or synovitis (Fig. 10) was visible in 43 horses and subjectively graded as mild (15), mod-erate (14), or severe (14). Mild effusion was gener-ally only visible as a small anechoic accumulationalong dorsal joint margins. Moderate effusion ap-peared similarly but with larger amounts of fluidvisible dorsally and occasionally ventral to the cra-nial joint margins. Horses with severe effusion of- ten had large accumulations within the cranioventralrecess and showed varying degrees of synovial thick-ening. A total of 18 horses showed cranioventraleffusion. Nineteen horses underwent ultrasound-guided in- jections for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes.Most injections were performed using a dorsal ap-proach to the joint with a 16-gauge spinal needlewith a length of 6 to 8 inches (Fig. 11); however, acranioventral approach was used in the majority ofinjected horses with severe cranioventral effusion.A few underwent multiple therapeutic injections toimprove comfort level. Injections were generallynot anticipated to abate lameness. Fig. 7. Acetabular fragments (arrows) in 3 horses with coxofemoral lameness.

IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LAMENESS5. Discussion Coxofemoral injury can occur in a wide range of ages, breeds, and uses. Similar to previous reports,injuries were often the result of trauma, such as afall or becoming cast in a stall. 3,5-8We have found that in the acute injury phase, horses with coxofem-oral or other pelvic fractures are often severely lameregardless of the fracture site, and it is difcult topredict fracture location based on the degree oflameness. Many of our horses lacked pelvic asym-metry and/or crepitus, and many were negative on rectal palpation. In horses with positive ndingson rectal palpation, palpable changes were oftensubtle. The absence of these clinical signs shouldnot reduce the suspicion for fracture. It is important to consider that horses with sus- pect coxofemoral or pelvic injury and horses with sacroiliac disorders seldom present similarly in theclinical setting. Horses with coxofemoral or pelvicinjury typically present with acute-onset severe Fig. 8.

Evaluation of the sacroiliac regionhas received much attention in recent years andmay overshadow the consideration of pelvic disor-ders as a cause of lameness. In fact, some horsesreported herein presented to our clinic with a previ-ous diagnosis of sacroiliac injury. Over the past 15 years, ultrasound has become the primary imaging modality in horses suspected ofhaving a pelvic fracture or coxofemoral injury at our hospital. This is consistent with a recent report thatcompared ultrasound and radiography of the femoro-pelvic region. 8We previously relied heavily on nu- clear scintigraphy to identify areas of increasedradiopharmaceutical uptake within the pelvis, andsuch ndings would then be used to direct furtherimaging, either ultrasound or radiography. We nowbegin with ultrasound, and if the ultrasonographicndings do not support the clinical suspicion of pelvicor coxofemoral injury, scintigraphy is performed toevaluate for nondisplaced or stress fractures that areunlikely to be apparent ultrasonographically. Most horses with severe coxofemoral injury were treated with connement. Options include a tiestall, a tie line in a stall, or loose in a stall. Re-gardless of connement type, many horses mayeventually lay down and can become cast, espe-cially in a narrow tie stall. Such horses are atrisk for further injury and fracture displacementwhen struggling to rise. The use of a tie line canalso restrict a horse's ability to rise. Many horseswith coxofemoral injury at our clinic are thereforemanaged with stall connement alone, withoutadditional restriction. We have found that ultrasonographic reevalua- tion of the coxofemoral joint is generally unreward-ing because acetabular rim fractures usually remaindisplaced. In general, prognosis for fractures of thecoxofemoral joint is difcult to predict in the early Fig. 10. Mild, moderate, and severe coxofemoral effusion in 3 horses.

Many horses with severe lameness in theacute phase of injury will show gradual improve-ment in their degree of lameness. It can be tempt-ing to base the decision for euthanasia on the initialseverity of lameness. Euthanasia should be consid-ered if the degree of pain or lameness becomes un-manageable. In the authors' experience, this ismost often seen in horses with a complete fracturethrough the acetabulum but may also be seen inhorses with proximal femoral fractures. Sacralfracture should also be considered because it canproduce severe pain and neurologic signs. Several horses were managed with ultrasound- guided therapeutic injections. Some treated horseswith acetabular rim fractures were able to eventu-ally become sound enough to ride. Injections weretypically performed 6 to 12 months after diagnosis.Although horses seldom became completely soundafterward, some owners reported that they wereserviceably sound to be ridden at low levels after along convalescence. Multiple horses with sublux-ation were also managed with single or repeatedtherapeutic injections to improve their comfort levelwhile at pasture. Although these horses never be-came rideable, owners were often pleased with theresults, and some horses were maintained for 1 to 3years after diagnosis. Therapeutic effect was oftenreduced with each injection. In summary, ultrasound of the coxofemoral joint can be very rewarding given adequate training andexperience. Although it remains a challengingstructure to evaluate, the use of the clock techniqueshould help motivated practitioners improve theircomfort level in evaluating the coxofemoral joint.Ultrasound can diagnose many types of coxofemoralabnormalities, although accurate conguration offractures should not be expected in most cases.

Materials and Methods Nineteen horses with hindlimb PSD diagnosedbased on the response to local anaesthesia and ultra- sonography were humanely destroyed. The ultra-sonographic abnormalities were graded prospectivelyas mild, moderate, or severe based on predenedcriteria. Thirty-seven lame limbs were examinedgrossly and 36 suspensory ligaments were exam-ined histologically. Images were graded blindlybased (0-3 each tissue type;0/H11005normal, 3 /H11005severe abnormality). 3. Results Ultrasonographic lesions were adhesion formation between theproximal aspect of the SL and adjacent soft tissueswas predicted. Gross post-mortem examination re-vealed substantial adhesions between the proximalaspect of the SL and adjacent soft tissues in 10/37(27.0%) limbs; in 10/37 (27.0%) limbs there wereadhesions between the body of the SL and the midplantar aspect of the third metatarsal bone. His-tology revealed abnormalities (grades 1-3) of thecollagenous 25/36 23/36 (63.9%) limbs. In 1/36limbs no abnormality was detected. 4.

Introduction Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has grown more prevalent as a means to diagnose causes for lame-ness in the distal limb. 1Although many resources exist to try to understand the complex images gen-erated by this diagnostic modality, many practitio-ners rely on reports generated by board-certiedradiologists, surgeons, and other veterinarians ex-perienced in this modality for interpretation of theimages. These reports can often be complex anddifcult to understand for new graduates and prac-titioners who do not have a great deal of experiencewith this technology. The purpose of this paper isto clarify what a veterinarian can gain from themagnetic resonance (MR) report, to best correlatethat report with the clinical scenario. With agreater understanding of the information providedin the report, clinicians should gain a greater satis-faction with the information provided by the MRexamination and be encouraged to incorporate thismodality in their lameness diagnostic workup. 2. Materials and Methods The structure of the MR report varies greatly de-pending on the facility and the person creating thereport. However, all radiology reports should con-tain patient identier information, region imaged,technical information about the exam, a list of per-tinent ndings, and varying degrees of interpretivecomments. Patient Information The patient information section is self explanatory,and could be as simple as the patient and ownername, or may contain signalment or historical infor-mation. The completeness of this section is gener-ally reliant on the history provided by the owner orreferring veterinarian. It is important as a refer-ring veterinarian to provide as much information aspossible because this generally aids insuring thatthe correct regions are imaged, and what, to somedegree, can be expected to be seen. For example, ayoung, lightly worked Quarter Horse will have adifferent looking foot than an Upper Level Warm-blood Jumper of middle age, and what might bereasonable to see on the MR image in the seasonedcompetitor and not considered a cause for lamenesscould be signicant in the younger Quarter Horse. Study Description There is typically a section that includes the regionof interest or body part that was scanned and canalso include a list of obtained sequences (i.e., tech-nical information about the scan). It is important 360 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSNEW INNOVATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LAMENESS NOTESto be familiar with the MR system that the facility elected to perform the study will be using. Thestanding low-eld system ahas a smaller eld of view than the larger high-eld systems that requiregeneral anesthesia. Therefore, if the MR request isfor the \"left front foot\" for a standing imaging sys-tem, only the foot is will be imaged and the pasternand fetlock must be obtained as separate studies(Fig. 1). Each facility also varies in whether com-parison views of the contralateral limb will be ob-tained, so this should be claried prior to thepatient's arrival. Although usually brief, this section of the MR report can look rather complicated to the practitio-ner unfamiliar with MR language. First, theremay be an indication of the planes obtained in thestudy, such as sagittal, transverse, and frontal ordorsal planes (Fig. 2). Multiplanar imaging is im-portant to allow for a three-dimensional (3D) under-standing of lesion location. There may also be a listof the sequences obtained, which vary between mag-nets. For example, a low-eld magnet sequence listmight include ofsequences is determined by the radiologist or veter-inarian in charge of the MR program and what isimportant for the general practitioner to understandis that each sequence provides different anatomicand physiologic information. The names of the se-quences stem from the principles of MR physics andreferences exist that fully explain the generation ofthe scan titles. 1,3 In brief, MR images are acquired through the detection of proton resonance; that is, living tissuecontains protons (hydrogen nuclei) that oscillate atdifferent frequencies. When these protons are ex-posed to the magnetic eld of the magnet, they alignalong the axis of the eld. A radiofrequency coil isthen applied to the region of question, which emits apulse to change the orientation of the protons todifferent degrees. Following the pulse, the protonsrelease energy as they return to the axis generatedby the magnet. This energy is measured by the coiland transmitted to a software program that trans-lates this signal into an image. The most common sequences used in musculosk- eletal imaging are FSE and gradient echo (GE) se-quences, and these are weighted based on the lengthof the radiofrequency pulse and the time when theradiofrequency is released and detected. This Fig. 1. T1W sagittal (A) and frontal (B) images of the digit from a low-eld standing system. Note the eld of view is smaller than in the high-eld system foot image (E). In this case, the horse had signicant lameness which improved with abaxialsesamoid analgesia. C and D, As the MR images of the foot did not demonstrate signicant pathology, the margins of the studywere expanded to include the fetlock, where osseous cyst-like lesions in the proximal phalanx and injury to the third metatarsalbone were identied. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 361NEW INNOVATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LAMENESSweighting is referred to as T1 and T2 weighting. Depending on the particular tissue and the physio-logic state of the tissue (inflamed or scarred, forexample), the tissue will demonstrate high (white),intermediate (varying shades of gray), or low (black)signal on the MR image. The same tissue will havehigh or low signal depending on the particular se-quence being viewed. STIR or fat-suppressed im-aging inverts the high signal generated by fattytissue as is found in bone marrow, which allows forfluid to be detected in the bone as bone carries a highsignal in other sequences. MR Findings The MR ndings are usually reported in paragraphor list form. This is generally the section that is themost descriptive, referring to the particular struc-ture involved and how it is abnormal. For example,size, shape, and margins of a ligament may be de-ned as abnormal, or a joint space may be describedas having increased fluid content. Although somereports describe the nature of the pathology in termsof the degree of injury, this section can also containterminology characterizing the MR signal of a struc-ture. Bone inflammation accompanying a fractureline may be reported as a region of increased signalof the bone on STIR imaging, and decreased signalon T1 and T2* W GRE imaging (Fig. 3). Some reports do list the ndings in order of clin- ical relevance, and some also include reference im-ages or refer to specic image slices. This can behelpful in becoming more familiar with the variouspathologies, as well as understanding the 3D anat-omy of the structure. Conclusions Depending on the consulting radiologist or inter-preter, this section may be a summary list of all theMR ndings, or a short list of the clinically relevantndings that the interpreter believes to be relevantbased on the signalment and provided history. Interpretive Comments A radiology report does not necessarily include astatement indicating which pathologies listed on theMR report are clinically relevant. If a pathology isstriking enough, a statement is usually made indi-cating the most signicant nding on the study.If a thorough history has been provided, most radi-ologists do offer comments about what are likely themost signicant ndings on the MR study. Reportsgenerated by surgeons or veterinarians familiarwith their MR systems will typically include treat-ment recommendations, prognoses, and summariesof the case if the history has been provided. 3. Results The author has performed MR examinations on morethan 1700 patients from July 2005 to March 2015between two imaging facilities. Greater than 90 per-cent of these cases were interpreted by radiologistsand formal reports were obtained. In the earlieryears of MR reporting, the MR reports were primarilya list of ndings. This was regarded as somewhatunsatisfactory to some of the veterinarians in chargeof the patients because the cause of lameness was notalways clear from the reports. In most cases, the MRexaminations would be ordered by the referring veter-inarian, usually accompanied by specic questionsthat concerned the origin of lameness. When the re-ports were received by the veterinarians, dialogues Fig. 2. Sagittal (A), transverse (B), and frontal (C) views of aflexor surface erosion of the navicular bone in the standing low-eld system. 362 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSNEW INNOVATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LAMENESSbetween the radiologist, author, and referring veteri- narian would ensue as the question as to what theprimary cause of lameness was in a particular case,and in some instances, what the next steps should bein terms of treatment and management. Often, vet-erinarians would inquire as to how the lesions ap-peared on the MR examination as well. Therefore, a more comprehensive MR report was created to address the referring veterinarian's con-cerns, which included reference images and allowedthe information to be more readily correlated withthe clinical scenario (Appendix). As the under-standing of the signicance of MR ndings hasevolved, this MR report has been rened to offermore clinical information to the referring veterinar-ian; namely the most likely cause for lameness.With this information, the veterinarian could morereadily correlate the MR ndings with the clinicalhistory, and offer a more tailored approach to treat-ment and management of the patient. This hasresulted in a higher degree of satisfaction for thereferring veterinarian and horse owner. 4. Discussion The nal imaging report offers the referring veterinar-ian an exciting opportunity to broaden their knowl-edge of anatomy and musculoskeletal imaging. MRimaging, just like radiographs, or ultrasound, is highlydependent on understanding anatomy, especially inmore than one dimension. Therefore, if one can un-derstand a given pathology in three dimensions, onecan also further understand how to nd the injurywith other modalities in certain cases, which can bevery useful for monitoring. The author found it to bemost helpful to review the MRIs with a good anatomyreference at hand, 4and the radiology report. Identi- fying the various pathologies trains the interpreter tostart to see the signal patterns that help dene thephysiology of the structures, which can also help inremembering these pathologies when presented with asimilar case, as well as improving client communica-tion. For example, seeing a bone contusion, ratherthan just reading that a patient has suffered one, iseasier to explain to a client than reporting a bone hasincreased osseous fluid. Knowing exactly where thefluid is can also allow for radiographs to be obtainedwith attention to the affected area, so for this example,if a lameness becomes worse or fails to improve, onecan look for further degenerative bony changes overtime. It can be difcult in many cases to include a de- nitive statement for a cause for lameness unlessthe pathology is quite severe for several reasons.If the lameness is multifactorial in origin, or a thor-ough history was not provided with the imagingrequest, offering a statement that indicates whichnding is most signicant is not always appropriate.In cases of horses with longer performance careers,there can be many factors contributing to the lame-ness and sometimes it takes a conversation betweenthe attending clinician and MR interpreter to deter-mine what the next step for the patient should be.Establishing good communication with the inter-preter will also aid in understanding future reports,as once one becomes familiar with the language of areport, it becomes easier to rank the ndings. Perhaps the most important to the practitioner is to relate the MR report to the patient to determineprognosis and treatment plan, and be able to com-municate this information to the client. First, theowner typically asks, \"How did this happen?\" It isdifcult to present to such an owner or case of a Fig. 3. Sagittal views of a bone contusion of the second phalanxobtained with a standing low-eld system. The osseous fluid isseen as increased signal on a STIR sequence (A) and decreasedsignal on T2* and T1W sequences (B and C). AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 363NEW INNOVATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LAMENESSmiddle-aged horse that has been performing well with an acute onset of lameness with a list of nd-ings, many of which could be considered chronic, andnot necessarily the cause for lameness. In suchcases, it must be clear to the attending doctor pre-cisely what the current cause of lameness is, andhow to go about treating it to reach client under-standing and compliance. As the attending be-comes more familiar with MR diagnoses, and whatsort of abnormalities that can be intrinsic to a par-ticular breed or discipline on an MR study but arenot necessarily pathologic, it becomes easier to siftthrough the sometimes overwhelming amount of in-formation generated by an MR examination and fo-cus in on the lesions that are clinically signicant. From an interpretation standpoint, one must remember that the purpose of the MR report is toreport on the ndings. How those ndings corre-late with the clinical scenario is a collaborativeeffort between the referring veterinarian and theMR interpreter. Therefore, if the diagnoses onthe MR report do not t the clinical picture, orthere is question of what are the most relevantndings, following up with the MR interpreter isimperative and encouraged. MR cases can becomplicated; indeed, if they were straightforward,often the horses would not need to have had theMRI examination in the rst place. Therefore, aclinician should not feel discouraged if the MRstudy results seem confusing, or the answer is notentirely what was expected. Horses are sent forMR examination for many different reasons, but itis important to remember that the goal is deni-tive diagnosis to come up with an appropriatetreatment plan for the patient. Understanding the location and nature of the pa- thology noted on the MR examination can allow formonitoring of the pathology by more readily acces-sible means by the attending practitioner. For ex-ample, a patient may have a lesion localized to thefetlock region that is not readily apparent on routineultrasound and radiographic examination and is re-ferred for MR evaluation (Fig. 4). In this instance,the MR study demonstrates a lesion that is locatedat the level of the ergot, or a lesion that collapseswhen the horse is standing. Follow-up ultrasoundwith attention paid to the location of the lesion cannow be performed, and the injury can be monitoredby the referring veterinarian, allowing for a moretailored rest and rehabilitation program. Another example is acute bone contusion. In the acute phases of injury, there may be no obvious radio-graphic signs. Osseous fluid is readily identied onMR examination as increased signal on STIR or fat-suppressed imaging and if located across a joint space,raises concern that the cartilage could be affected (Fig.5). Monitoring the affected region with radiographsand ultrasound of the cartilage surface (if accessible)can be performed in the eld when the location of theregion is understood to monitor for degenerativechange of the joint. This also applies to occult ornondisplaced bone fractures, where knowing the pre-cise nature of the fracture line can allow for specialradiographic views to identify the injury and monitorthe patient for osseous union or periosteal changes. Lesions of the deep digital flexor tendon in the foot are one of the more frequent diagnoses found on MRexamination, and the prognosis and treatment op-tions can vary depending on the degree and size ofinjury of the lesion as well as the location. 5-7The MR report may indicate a mild degree of degenera-tive injury to the tendon, but this is not necessarilythe cause for lameness in the aged sporthorse (Fig.6). Lesion location and size also becomes signi- Fig. 4. A, PDW high-eld MRI of a horse with an injury to the deep digital flexor tendon at the level of the ergot.

Understanding the nature of thedeep digital flexor pathology is paramount in termsof case selection for this procedure given that certainlesions do not respond well to neurectomy, resultingin residual lameness or early recurrence of lamenesspost-operatively. 8A frustrating aspect of MR imaging is when there are no demonstrable abnormalities found on the ex-amination. This scenario can certainly result indissatisfaction and discouragement on the part ofthe referring clinician and owner. In these cases, itis imperative to re-examine the clinical history andlameness workup. With the current understanding Fig. 5. A horse was referred for standing MR examination following acute onset severe right fore lameness localized to the footfollowing a jumping competition. A, Sagittal STIR image of the right fore demonstrates contusion (increased signal) of the navicularbone and the second and third phalanx. B, The left fore foot of the same horse is shown for comparison, which demonstrates normalSTIR signal in healthy pedal bones (the bones are uniformly of decreased signal). C, A lateral radiograph taken at the time of injury,within normal limits. D and E, The horse remained lame, and radiographs were taken 6 months later. The radiographs demon-strated periarticular and articular degenerative bone disease and degenerative change of the navicular bone. These ndings wereconrmed on follow-up MR examination. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 365NEW INNOVATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LAMENESSof the migration of diagnostic analgesia, it is possi- ble that the region ordered for the MR evaluationdid not include potential other areas that could beaffected by perineural or intra-articular blocks. 9 In these cases, the margins of the studies must beexpanded during MR imaging. Subtle cartilage de-fects can also be overlooked in certain systems andshould be considered in cases where persistent sy-novitis is present and diagnostic analgesia has beenaccurately and repeatedly performed in a mannerthat localizes the lameness to the joint. 10Lame- ness without structural injury to the live tissues ofthe foot can result in a negative MR study (hoof wallor solar pain). 11In cases where the appropriateregion has been imaged, a negative report may bethe best result for the patient from a prognosticstandpoint, as no major structural lesions were iden-tied, and a relatively short course of rest may be allthat is required to return to work. A negative re-sult on MRI may also indicate that the pathologiccondition may need to be imaged with another mo-dality such as nuclear scintigraphy. 12Understand- ing these potential situations can help manageclient expectations before the MR examination isperformed so the client understands the value of theexamination, regardless of the results. The cornerstone of lameness evaluation is still the clinical examination; advanced diagnostic imaging Fig. 6. T1W 3D transverse images demonstrate mild dorsal margin fraying and degenerative change to the dorsal margin of the deep digital flexor tendon (A) and a parasagittal split of the deep digital flexor tendon (B). In both cases A and B these wereincidental ndings in the nonclinical limb, but are reported as mild degenerative injury with unknown clinical signicance.This is in contrast with the T1W 3D transverse image demonstrating extensive degenerative change with structural injury to thetendon (C), which was also seen on STIR and T2W FSE sequences. D-F, In another case, the deep digital flexor tendon lesionidentied as a core lesion extending to the insertion of the tendon on to the third phalanx was visible on all sequences. In thiscase, a palmar digital neurectomy would be contraindicated given the nature and extent of the injury. All images were obtainedin the standing low-eld system. 366 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSNEW INNOVATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LAMENESSserves to complement a complete history and thor- ough clinical evaluation. The MR examination isnot typically used for screening purposes: thestudy should be ordered when the lameness hasbeen well localized to a specic anatomic region.In other instances, such as pre-purchase examina-tion, the region to be imaged can be ordered with aspecic clinical question in mind. Communicationbetween the MR interpreter, referring veterinarian,and horse owner must be maximized to gain themost from the examination. The primary care cli-nician must therefore be well versed enough in thedistal limb anatomy and pathophysiology of lame-ness to convey the need for the MR examination, inthe same manner that radiographs or ultrasoundare offered. Upon receipt of the report, the refer-ring veterinarian must then decide whether theycan determine the most signicant pathology (or pathologies in multi-factorial lameness cases), and ifit agrees with the clinical presentation to reach anal diagnosis and treatment plan. With increas-ing familiarity of the language of the MR report, thisimaging modality becomes an exciting tool in theevaluation of lameness.

Imaging evaluation MRI, right front foot and pastern Multiplanar images using GE 3D T1, GE 3D T2*, STIR, and T2 FSE weighted sequences Radiologist NAME Impressions The cause for acute onset right fore lameness is related to extensive marked injury to the deep digital flexor tendon. There is associated navicular bursitis which may be contributing to thecurrent lameness presentation. The navicular bone abnormalities are not associated withsignicant fluid in the bone, and therefore may only be making a mild contribution to the currentclinical presentation. Recheck MR examination is recommended in approximately 4-6 months to monitor the deep digital flexor tendon, with the exact timeframe depending on the case progression and treatmentplan as prescribed by the RDVM. Ultrasound guided intra-lesional regenerative therapies could beconsidered in this case, with stall rest immediately following the procedure. Within a few weekspost-procedure, a controlled walking program should be prescribed to prevent further adhesionformation of the soft tissues of the navicular apparatus. Soundness re-evaluations should beperformed at 30 day intervals to insure the lameness has not become substantially worse, and iscontinuing on an appropriate course of improvement. This injury can take up to one year to heal and carries a guarded prognosis for long term soundness at high levels of jumping work. It is our experience that the majority of horses withthis sort of injury return to work for about a year before lameness returns if they continue tojump at moderate to signicant levels, with some horses performing longer, and some notreturning to a level of serviceable soundness for athletic work. MR ndings There is distal margin fragmentation of the navicular bone with defects in the distal medial and distal lateral margins (7-9 mm in width). There is injury to the medial lobe of the deep digitalflexor tendon beginning at the mid aspect of the proximal phalanx extending to the level of thenavicular bone. This injury is characterized by focal core lesion measuring between 3 and 5 mm indiameter that becomes a dorsal margin tear at the level the navicular bone. Distal to thenavicular bone, there is moderate degenerative injury in the deep digital flexor tendon. There ismoderate chronic navicular bursitis characterized primarily by synovial membrane thickening andsynovial proliferation. The synovial proliferation extends to the dorsal margin of the deep digitalflexor tendon and may represent adhesion formation. There are moderately enlarged synovialinvaginations in the distal aspect of the navicular bone. There is mild to moderate thickening andscarring of the collateral sesamoidean ligament. The appearance of the lateral collateral ligamentof the distal interphalangeal joint is most consistent with magic angle effect. However,degenerative injury cannot be ruled out for this appearance.

Due to superimposition and thejoint complexity, radiographs are thought to under-estimate these changes. MRI allows for more com-plete assessment of the joint and identication oflesions that may otherwise go undetected. 2. Materials and Methods High-eld MRIs of the distal tarsus and proximalmetatarsus of 57 limbs of 43 horses were retrospec-tively evaluated by two board-certied veterinaryradiologists. Pathologic changes were character-ized and graded by degree of severity. The pa-tients' breed, age, and results of diagnostic analgesiawere also recorded. 3. Results Osteoarthritic changes of the centrodistal and tar-sometarsal joints were the most common ndings.Other ndings included bone marrow lesions, degen-erative changes of the small cuboidal bones, sub-chondral cystic lesions, and intertarsal desmopathy.Limbs that responded analgesia of the proximalsuspensory ligament (35.7%) had more severechanges in the distal tarsus. 4. Discussion A range of pathologic changes can occur in the distaltarsus that result in lameness. The use of MRI hasrevealed types of lesions that can be difcult toimpossible to identify with radiographs. Under-standing the range of pathologic processes in thetarsus can help the practitioner identify when ad-vanced imaging may be warranted in cases refrac-tory to standard treatment protocols.

To date there are no reportsthat describe the use of adipose tissue-derived stro-mal vascular fraction and interleukin-1 receptor an-tagonist protein for equine stifle injuries. 2. Materials and Methods Medical records of 98 horses (189 stifle injuries)were evaluated. These horses were treated withregenerative medicine and regen- erative medicine (group 2, n/H11005 38 horses) or arthros- copy (group 3, n /H1100539 horses). All stifle injuries were diagnosed through lameness examination, di-agnostic anesthesia, and radiographs. All horsescompleted a standardized, 6-month rehabilitationprogram. Horses that returned to full work (RFW)for greater than 1 year without recurrent lamenesswere considered a success.3. Results and Discussion Horses in group 1, 2, and 3 RFW at prior or higherlevel of performance for /H110221 year at 66.7, 68.4, and 59%, respectively. Approximately 26 to 28% of horsesRFW at a lower level, and 5% of horses in groups 1 and2, and 13% of horses in group 3 were retired. Preop-erative use of corticosteroids and lameness score neg-atively affected return to prior level of performance.Lameness and chondromalacia reduced the chance ofhealing within 270 days.

Introduction Carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (CMA OA) was a term rst used to describe a specic clinical condi-tion in horses with osteoarthritis (OA) of the carpo-metacarpal joint (CMC jt), which was considered acondition exclusively of Arabian horses. 1However, a subsequent case series was published that alsoincluded Quarter Horses and Thoroughbreds. 2 In fact, CMC OA may indeed not be a new conditionas older textbooks describe horses with \"high medialsplints\" that develop lameness and have OA of the CMC jt. 3An additional case series identied CMA OA in several breeds, with the highest incidence inArabians and Quarter Horses. 4 CMA OA is a lameness that occurs predominately in older horses, and normally has a characteristicswelling on the medial aspect of the carpus (Fig. at the MC2/C2 articulation (Fig. 2A), nar- MC2/C2 lysis of MC2 and C2 (Fig. 2B). 1,2,4These horses normally are quite lame (grade 3-4), and theseverity is progressive and debilitating. 1,2,4Lame- ness can initially be insidious; however, rapid pro-gression to a crippling lameness has been seen. 4,5 Although the CMC jt is a low motion joint, sponta-neous fusion seems to be rare, 2,4,5and horses left untreated or treated with conservative methods had a poor prognosis and most were euthanized for hu-mane reasons within 4 years of diagnosis. 1,2,4 Because the CMC jt is a low motion joint, similar to the distal tarsal joints, bony fusion should bepossible without affecting a horse's normal gait.Bony fusion of the CMC jt has been reported after afacilitated ankylosis technique was used that in-cluded inserting a drill bit into the joint space, andfanning of the drill bit horizontally and vertically topromote cartilage and subchrondral bone damage in 372 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSNEW INNOVATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LAMENESS NOTESan attempt to stimulate bony fusion.5All horses had of lameness, 83% were consid- ered sound, 67% returned to their original activity,and all owners considered the treatment successful. 5 The technique was very successful; however, thecase numbers reported were low, and because theamount fanning with the drill bit could not be quan-titated and requires judgment by the surgeon, thistechnique might not be as consistently performedand successful for other surgeons. Also, fracture of C2 and middle carpal with the fanning technique inan ex-vivo study and their results suggested it maybe superior to the fanning technique. 7But the three-drill technique was subsequently shown to beless successful in producing ankylosis when used inresearch horses, with only 33% of horses developingankylosis and considered free of lameness. 8When the three-drill-tract technique was used to treat clin-ical cases of CMC OA it was less successful than thefanning technique because only 17% were consid-ered lameness free, and 50% of owners consideredthe treatment a failure. a Fortunately, CMA OA is relatively uncommon be- cause it is a crippling condition that requires jointfusion. Currently, a facilitated ankylosis using thefanning technique is the most successful reportedtreatment. The purpose of this paper is to famil-iarize practitioners with how to perform a facilitatedankylosis using the fanning technique. 2. Materials and Methods Case Selection Because of the severe progressive nature of CMA OA, the lack of spontaneous ankylosis, and the verypoor prognosis with no or conservative treatment,the authors recommend surgical treatment in mostcases. Horses with severe varus deformity, 1rare in some clinical case,4,5likely are poor candidates as are those with marked degenerative radiographicchanges of the middle carpal joint. Fig. 1.

B, Dorsomedial-palmarolateral Note the slight INNOVATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LAMENESSPreoperative Medication The authors administered preoperative antibiotics (22,000 U/kg sodium penicillinbintravenously) and phenylbutazonec(4.4 mg/kg intravenously). Restraint All horses are operated under a general anestheticfor accurate drill placement, and fanning withoutrisk of drill bit breakage. Equipment Needed A pneumatic drill and basic Association for theStudy of Internal Fixation (ASIF) equipment is re-quired. Because intraoperative imaging is re-quired for accurate drill alignment within the joint,and to determine the depth of drill insertion, eitherintraoperative radiographs or fluoroscopy arerequired. Positioning The horse is anesthetized, placed in lateral recum-bency with the medial aspect of the limb upper most,and the carpus clipped, prepped, and draped fororthopedic surgery. Sites of Drill Bit Insertion Usually the drill bit is inserted into the CMC jt atthree sites, but as many as ve sites have beendescribed. 5The three common sites are: 1) medial- lateral articulation, the andmarked modeling of the subchondral bone of C2 andMC2, this portion of the joint may fuse spontane-ously without drilling and may not be drilled at thesurgeon's discretion (Fig. 2B). The other two sitesare always drilled because radiographic evidence ofdegenerative changes here are minimal, and carti-lage and subchondral bone damage is required topromote ankylosis. Because the craniomedialswelling characteristic of CMC OA makes of the CMC jt by palpation difcult, the horseis positioned in lateral recumbency with the medialside upper most. Order of Drilling Sites The authors prefer to drill the MC2/C2 articulationrst because it is the hardest site to identify the jointspace, followed by the DM-PL site, and then theDL-PM site (Fig. 3A). To drill the DL-PM site, thesurgical table is elevated to get better access tothe lateral aspect of the carpus. Although drillingthis last site is a bit awkward with the horse inlateral recumbency we prefer it to dorsal recum-bency because we feel we are better oriented to theanatomic landmarks for all three drill sites. Drilling Technique/Identication of Joint Space At all three sites the technique followed is the same.Three needles (18 or 20 gauge) are used to identifythe joint space and proper angle for drill bit inser-tion. They are placed parallel to each other in avertical line, with the middle needle placed over theestimated joint space, and all needles perpendicularto CMC joint articulation. A fluoroscopic image ordigital radiograph is taken perpendicular to the nee-dles to check their placement and angulation to thejoint. Proper placement of the needles on the rstattempt is difcult medially because the soft tissueand bony swelling make palpation of normal bonylandmarks difcult (Fig. 4). Repositioning of theneedles or alterations of their angle relative to thejoint may be required and additional imaging viewstaken. When a needle identies the location of the Fig. 3.

Drilling Technique/Insertion of the Drill Bit A stab through the soft tissues down to the bone ismade with a #10 scalpel blade immediately adjacentto and at the same angle as the needle. The au-thors usually use a 5.5-mm drill bit. The drill bit,with its tissue protector, is inserted into the stabwound and inserted approximately 1 cm into thejoint space with a pneumatic drill. A radiograph orfluoroscopic image is taken to verify proper position-ing of the drill bit between and parallel to the artic-ular surfaces (Fig. 5). If adjustment of position orangle is not required, the drill is inserted to a depthof approximately 25-30 mm into the joint, the posi-tion and depth checked by imaging (Fig. 6). Drilling Technique/Fanning of the Drill Bit After determining that the drill bit is properlyplaced, it is fanned multiple times in a horizontalplane. At the MC2/C2 drill site, the bit is movedcranially and caudally to fan an area with an /H1101130\u00b0 arc, whereas it is fanned approximately 50\u00b0 at theother two sites (Fig. 3B). Then the drill bit isfanned vertically, but because of the subchondralbone the drill bit movement is much less, approxi-mately 5-10\u00b0. It is important not to press too hardon the drill as it could result in possible breakage of Fig. 5. Intra-operative fluoroscopic view taken to evaluate theposition of the drill bit in the CMC jt. It is positioned in the jointcorrectly and angled properly between the articular surfaces forfurther advancement. Fig. 4.

The swelling seen with CMC OA makes identicationof the CMC jt difcult at this site. Note the needles initiallywere not centered over the CMC jt; however, the proximal needlewas properly positioned. Also note the subchrondral bone lysisof MC2 and C2 that is quite common but not always seen withCMC OA. Fig. 6.

Closure/Bandaging After all sites are drilled, the stab incisions of theskin are sutured with nonabsorbable sutures in ei-ther a simple interrupted or cruciate pattern. Anonadhesive dressing is placed over the stab inci-sions and a light wrap applied over the carpus. Postoperative Radiographs The authors routinely take postoperative radio-graphs prior to discharge from the hospital to serveas a baseline in case we have a chance to get fol-lowup radiographs. Often the immediate postoper-ative views show little change, with only some drillholes or tracts being visible. Postoperative Care Crystalline sodium penicillinb(22,000 IU/kg) is con- tinued every 6 hours for 24 hours. Horses often arenot much lamer after surgery than before. Horseswith advanced CMC OA are usually quite sore priorto surgery and require oral phenylbutazone dpostop- eratively for an extended time period to make themcomfortable. It is administered intermittently(e.g., 4 days on, 4 days off) at a dosage adjusted tothe needs of the horse (2-4 mg/kg daily) to minimizethe risk of toxicity. Horses with early CMC OAthat have less severe clinical signs require littlepostoperative phenylbutazone initially, but some-times they become lamer after a couple months asthe OA gets worse as a result of the drilling, prior tobony fusion occurring. The surgical sites are keptcovered with a dressing for 14 days and then thesutures are removed. The horse's activity is mark-edly restricted for 2-3 months by either connementto a box stall or more commonly a very small corral.By 3 months there is usually signicant clinicalimprovement and connement is limited to a largercorral for another 3 months, at which time clinicalimprovement is usually marked and the horse caneither be left in the larger corral, turned out topasture, or returned to light work, depending on thedegree of improvement. 3. Results The authors have treated 20 horses (23 limbs) withthis fanning technique, which includes those previ-ously reported. 5Although follow-up clinical and radiographic evaluation would be ideal, this is oftennot possible due to problems of client noncompli-ance, expense, and distances required for the clientto travel. Our evaluations were predominantlybased on a telephone questionnaire of the client'sassessment of their horse. Although this is notideal clients can certainly tell a horse that is grade3-4 lame and unusable from one that has little or novisible lameness that can return to work. So webelieve our evaluations are valuable. Of the 20 horses treated, one was lost to followup, one developed a septic joint immediately postopera-tively and was euthanized, one was improved dra-matically but had only been operated 3 monthspreviously, and one only had a followup of 1 month.So long-term followup was available on 16 horses.Of these 16 horses, one horse (6.25%) was a failurebecause it fractured C2 and subluxated its middlecarpal joint and was euthanized. Of the remaining15 horses, the severity of their lameness was re-duced in all of them (93.75%), and 11 (68.75%) wereconsidered \"sound\" by the owners. Of the fourhorses that were improved but still lame two had alameness barely noticeable with hard work, and twohad a lameness easily noticeable to the owner re-gardless of gait, but less severe than prior to sur-gery. The surgery was deemed \"successful\" by 13 ofthe 16 owners (81.25%). 4. Discussion The goal of a facilitated ankylosis is to achieve bonefusion between the articular surfaces. With a dril-ling technique this is dependent on the destructionof some of the articular cartilage and subchondralbone and the production of bridging bone duringhealing. Bony fusion over the entire articular sur-face is not possible, and not required for success.However, the percentage of the joint surface thatmust be damaged to achieve fusion is unknown.Earlier papers regarding facilitated ankylosis of thedistal tarsal joints suggested that less than 60% 9 was needed; however, later work with a three-drilltract technique in distal tarsal joints reported goodsuccess with less than 60%. 10An in-vitro study evaluating the fanning technique and the three-drilltechnique in the CMC jt reported damage to onlyapproximately 25-33% of the total nd a signicant differ- ence between the fanning technique performed witha 4.5-mm drill bit and a three-drill tract techniqueperformed with a 5.5-mm drill bit. The fanningtechnique has been proven successful in treatingclinical cases of CMC OA, 5although the three-drill tact technique has not been as successful in use ineither research horses 8or for treatment of cases of CMC OA.aWith the fanning technique there is a tendency for the surgeon to press down on the drilldirecting the bit proximally, resulting in less dam-age to the distal articular surface. 7Given that damage to both surfaces are required to get bonyfusion, it is important to avoid this during surgery.The authors prefer a 5.5-mm drill because its greatwidth over a 4.5-mm drill bit produces greater sur-face damage, 7and we fan quite aggressively to max- imize damage to the articular surface. However,we try to avoid damage to the caudal aspect of thearticular surfaces and to the caudal soft tissues of 376 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSNEW INNOVATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LAMENESSthe joint by limiting the depth of drilling. We have previously reported fracture of C2 and subluxationof the middle carpal joint, which might be associatedwith inappropriate drilling. 6So the depth the drill bit is inserted into the joint is adjusted based on thesize of the horse's articular surface. Although we have successfully operated both limbs of a bilateral case at one time, we prefer tostage the procedures 3-6 months apart. Postoper-ative pain is variable, and although often notmarked, staging the procedures increases the likeli-hood that postoperative pain is easily managed.Some horses with early CMC OA and minimal lame-ness are initially comfortable postoperatively butbecome more uncomfortable before eventually thelameness resolves. We suspect the drilling causesgreater arthritic changes and pain before bony fu-sion can occur. Although the carpometacarpal andmiddle carpal joint normally communicate postoper-ative, OA of the middle carpal joint secondary to therelease of inflammatory mediators from the drillingof the CMC joint does not seem to be a problem. The authors' success with this procedure has been very comparable with that reported for facilitatedankylosis of other joints. To maximize success werecommend 1) staging surgical treatment of bilat-eral cases, 2) warning owners that horses with earlyCMC OA and mild lameness sometimes will getworse before getting better, 3) using a 5.5-mm drillbit, 4) making sure there is accurate placement ofthe drill bit within the joint space, 5) fanning ag-gressively in a horizontal direction, 6) not pushingdown excessively on the drill when fanning horizon-tally, 7) avoiding damage to the caudal joint surfaceand soft tissues, and 8) not operating on horses withmarked OA of the middle carpal joint. The success rate with the fanning technique has been shown to be reasonable, and we consider it thetreatment of choice for CMC OA.

Introduction Intra-articular diagnostic anesthesia and/or therapeu- tic injection are relied upon to help diagnose and treatosteoarthritis of the DIT and TMT joints. The objec-tive of this study was to determine the accuracy ofarthrocentesis of the TMT and DIT joints using a sam-ple population of equine surgeons and surgeryresidents. 2. Materials and Methods Six operators each injected two TMTs and two DITs.The joints were injected with a 4-mL solution of 50:50contrast medium. A minimum of two radiographs ofeach joint was obtained to evaluate the presence ofcontrast medium within the target joint. Clinical ex-perience of the operators was included in the statisti-cal evaluation. 3. Results The TMT and DIT joints were successfully injectedin 23/24 joints (96% accuracy) and 10/24 joints (42%accuracy), respectively. Communication betweenthe TMT and DIT joints was visible in only 26% ofsuccessful TMT injections. Experience did not sig-nicantly affect the accuracy of injection. 4. Discussion The TMT joint was injected successfully nearly100% of the time, whereas the DIT joint was fre-quently missed with contrast medium being placedextra-articularly. It is recommended that radio-graphs be used to ensure proper needle placementfor DIT arthrocentesis.

Introduction Running a business without a strategic direction that is well understood by everyone on your team islike commanding a ship with no navigational equip-ment and no knowledge of where you are going.You can still get up, put your oars in the water, andgo somewhere\u2014you just don't really know whereyou're headed and have no idea if you're even re-motely close to your destination. The same is truefor business. Even if you seem to be protable, youmust understand why, both in terms of the reasonsfor your success and what you intend to do with thefruits of your labor so that you are perpetuating apositive cycle. Strategy is essentially an organized approach to getting what you want. It is a plan. It is an un-derstanding of what it is that you do and what youwant to be and focuses on how you plan to get there. 1 In veterinary medicine, there are countless ways offocusing the efciencies of your practice and a myr-iad of approaches you can take to become the prac-tice you have envisioned. Dening success andbuilding a roadmap to get there, however, is oftenthe barrier to entry that prohibits many practicesfrom achieving the growth they could potentiallyhave realized. Equally as important in dening what you want is knowing what you don't want or,rather, what you don't intend on achieving so thatyou aren't sidetracked easily in your quest for yourgiven objective. Beyond identifying the goal, strat-egy is the act of knowing, as a business, how to askfor what you want from your team and from themarketplace at the appropriate time and in the ap-propriate manner. 2. Leadership Two of the most important attributes of effectiveleaders are the ability to predict and to delegate. 2 Mastering the art of strategy and designing andimplementing a strategic plan in your practice areessential in supporting these attributes. You planso that you can identify an objective and measureyour progress against that objective. Measure-ments are data, and data drive the power to predict. Consider the importance of prediction in your cur- rent environment. To manage cash, you need pre-dictions to set an annual budget. To set an annualbudget you need to be able to predict revenues.Predicting revenues requires an understanding ofcosts, caseload, and the amount of business youthink you can generate. To support that caseload AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 379THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESS NOTESyou have to plan on the appropriate level of service you can offer, the number of veterinarians you needto satisfy a flow of business, and the number oftechnicians they'll need to support the workload.Then there is the matter of space and inventory.In short, there is no end to the need of accuratelypredicting revenues, and your level of understand-ing of where you currently are and identifying anddescribing where you want to be are essential insupporting this capability. The second prong of leadership is delegation. This is essentially the art of describing your end goal tosomeone else and helping them to understand theirrole and level of accountability in reaching this nalgoal. Great delegation is creating enthusiasm for thetask and harnessing the synergy of your team and itscapacity to work as a group toward a common vision. 3. Knowing What You Want A mere 7% of employees today fully understandtheir company's business strategies and what's ex-pected of them to help achieve company goals. 3 In short, it is likely that your team has little knowl-edge of the ultimate goals for your practice, how theyt in to the picture, and how they can assist with theoverall effort. Even of greater concern is whetheryou as a practice owner can adequately describe thegoals to your team to get their buy-in, create enthu-siasm for the process, and engage them in movingthe practice forward in a focused direction. Easily one of the most challenging questions you will face in life and in business is identifying whatyou want. You know the answer of course: more.More clients, more caseload, more money, moretime, more support\u2014more. Right? Or is it less?Less accounts receivable, less stress, less turnover\u2014less. Or perhaps it is a mix of the two: less of thebad, more of the good, and always as soon as possi-ble. Whatever the case may be, it is the \"knowing\"that will likely present the greatest challenge, andthat is where strategy begins. If you interview each of your employees and ask them what they want it is likely that few will have adenitive answer. The reality is that when you failto identify what you want someone else will decidefor you. If you allow this to happen in your practiceyou give up the ability to manage your own destiny.As a business owner or manager, it is essential tounderstand what success means from the viewpointof all stakeholders in your organization. When thedenition of success is clearly understood, the planfor achieving the desired outcome can begin. Understanding what you want personally from your practice and what is desired by your team as awhole can be explored by conducting a SWOT anal-ysis. SWOT simply stands for strengths, weak-nesses, opportunities, and threats. Strengths andweaknesses are exercises in evaluating the internalorganization, and opportunities and threats are ex-ternal forces that exist regardless of the internalsituation.By conducting this exercise and evaluating these areas, you reveal truths about your organization interms of issues that need to be addressed and compet-itive advantages that need to be exploited. You'll alsounveil areas of business that deserve more focus andrepresent your greatest opportunities for success. 4. Understanding Your Competitive Advantage Your success as a business is inextricably linked toyour competitive advantage\u2014knowing what it isand honing in on your strengths to capture moremarket share and revenues. Conducting a SWOTanalysis will give you the foundation for under-standing your current situation and evidentiarysupport for why you should pursue a given set ofobjectives. As you consider your position relative toyour SWOT analysis, it is imperative that an under-standing of your competition and marketplace arethoroughly explored. Your ability to succeed depends largely on the arena in which you are prepared to compete and howwell you can establish your strengths within thatdened arena to give you a competitive advantage.In other words, what is it that sets you apart fromyour competition in the minds of your customersthat drives home the value of doing business withyour organization? To assist us in understanding the competitive arena, we utilize Michael E. Porter's Five Forces ofCompetitive Position model, which was described intheHarvard Business Review article \"How Compet- itive Forces Shape Strategy.\" Porter identied inthis article the following forces that govern industrycompetition: 4 1. Threat of new entrants:5Consider how easy it would be for a new practice to enter yourmarket. 2. Bargaining power of suppliers: 6How advan- tageous is the position of your suppliers? 3. Jockeying for position among current competi- tors:7How loyal are your current clients? Do you consistently make adjustments to try andwin them over from competing practices? Haveyou introduced new services or specialties? 4. Bargaining power of customers: 8Are your customers in a position to demand a lower priceor particular service? Are they dictating inany way the manner in which you do business? 5. Threat of substitute products or services: 9 Are there alternatives in the marketplace thatyour customers could pursue that would takethe place of the services you offer? Ultimately, these areas are designed to assist you intruly evaluating the competition in your market-place. Consider the amount of time you currentlythink about your customers. Do you ask them forfeedback? What are the outcomes of the servicesyou provide? Is the patient experience being as-sessed on any level? Are you evaluating the level of 380 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESSsatisfaction clients currently have when they do business with your practice? Slice up your market into manageable sections so that it makes more sense by demographics, disci-pline, services sought, etc. Only then can you honein on the specic areas where your strengths aremost valued and ultimately where you are mostlikely to succeed. Another area of importance in understanding your competitive advantage and recognizing poten-tial threats is the internal environment of your prac-tice. Are your employees happy? Is team moralepositive? Work- and lifestyle trends are likely toaffect the future of your practice. 10Consider this as you give particular attention to the impact of anew generation of veterinarians arriving in theworkplace and the effect they will have on how yourpractice is organized and how well positioned it is toserve your market. 5. Keeping it Simple Tools give people the ability to do a job. The sameis true for your strategy. Buckminster Fuller said,\"If you want to teach people a new way of thinking,don't bother trying to teach them. Instead, givethem a tool, the use of which will lead to new waysof thinking.\" 11Essentially, the tools for running a business are the fundamentals by which that busi-ness is operated. In Verne Harnish's book Master- ing the Rockefeller Habits, the fundamentals thatJohn D. Rockefeller followed in business are ex-plained and essentially boiled down to the following: 1. Have a handful of rules.2. Repeat yourself.3. Act consistently with the rules you have estab- lished (which is why you should only have afew). 12 Although these three fundamentals make running abusiness easier to understand, each stands for adeeper level of strategic thinking: Priorities: Does the organization have 5 key objectives dened as the goals for the year andthe top 5 goals for the quarter that feed into theyearly objectives? More importantly, of the top5 goals identied, is there one that stands outabove the rest as the most important? 13Con- sider this for your business. Are there goals atall? Does anyone know what they are? Havethey been discussed? Data: In support of the power to predict, does your organization have the necessary data on atimely basis to determine how well the organi-zation is running? 14Consider the services you offer and how well you can track protabil-ity in each area. How can you manage yourinventory in such a way that you are takingfull advantage of rebates and discounts, andhow does this factor into your annual bud-get? Are you tracking the productivity of each veterinarian, and can you consider shiftsin the marketplace and how well you can re-spond to these shifts? Rhythm: Does your organization have an effec- tive rhythm of meaningful daily, weekly, monthly,quarterly, and annual meetings? 15Consider the daily huddles and weekly meetings? Are they ef-fective? Are they with the appropriate personnel? Review the three fundamentals again. Have ahandful of rules. Rules are your priorities, and it isimportant that you limit them to only a handful,thereby committing yourself to what your objectivestruly are and\u2014just as important\u2014what they arenot. Second, repeat yourself. This is the rhythmof meaningful meetings and an opportunity to reas-sess your focus based on the timely data you receive.And third, acting consistently with the rules or, inother words, acting in concert with the priorities youhave set. To do this, you must master the essenceof leadership described previously and have a thor- ough understanding of the data you have collected tomake accurate predictions. You must also effec-tively delegate responsibilities to your team so thatthe greatest internal strength can be amassed tomatch the challenges that your priorities willpresent. In many practices I have consulted with, the two most difcult areas of strategic planning are found inthe implementation stage. Most have success in theplanning process and can identify goals that they be-lieve will drive the practice forward; however, a clearunderstanding of the goals is often an obstacle that isrevealed later in the process, as is developing the con-tinued rhythm and enthusiasm required to see theprocess through to fruition. Understanding the goalsis an area I emphasize when approaching strategy.Too often I see practices set goals with somewhat un-realistic expectations based on the rationale that sim-ply hiring an additional person or getting a new pieceof equipment will largely solve a current issue in thepractice and thus help it meet those expectations.The training time for new personnel to get up to speedor the prociency and the level of usage of a new pieceof equipment are frequently overlooked, however, andcan thus lead to frustrations later on in the process. In terms of rhythm, many practices experience an initial surge of enthusiasm that quickly wanes asthe process evolves. This typically results from un-realized expectations, which means in essence thatthe practice outlined the goals, pursued the goals,and when the goals evolved, no longer were neces-sary, or took longer than expected to achieve, thepractice perceived the endeavor as a failure, whenthe real failure was setting the expectation in therst place. In short, managing the team's expectation is key, both in terms of goal setting and in the ongoingimplementation process.

Conclusion When you consider the individuals that make up your practice, yourself, and your partners, associ-ates, and support staff, there are many lines ofthought as to what each of these people want out oftheir afliation with your business. Whether thegoals for your practice are to be more protable, tobe positioned to be bought or sold, or to grow in agiven service or particular geographic area, you must focus to achieve the desired outcome. By un-derstanding what strategy is and the tools that canhelp you dene it for your practice, you can makedecisions to better position you and your team todayfor greater success tomorrow.

Introduction The underlying purpose of strategic planning is to develop a focused effort toward achieving a givenlevel of success for your company and to describe itin enough detail that it becomes a reality that youand your team can work toward. Without specicgoals, you have no idea whether you ever achieveanything relevant, and if you do somehow reach adegree of success, you lack the understanding of howyou got there, which makes the likelihood of repeat-ing your success very slim. Many practice owners begin the process with good intentions and set out to write a mission statementfor their practice without understanding how it tsinto an actionable plan. A mission statement isreally an exercise in dening what you do and whyyou do it. However, the activity of crafting the com-pany mantra can be a black hole for hours spentwordsmithing a meaningless collection of words when not properly tied in to an actionable plan. A vision statement is a long-term idea, a con- ceptualized statement that spells out where youwant to go as an organization. In sum, the idea ofgoing through a strategic plan in your practice cansound overwhelming. The development of mis- sion statements, vision statements, and goals is acumbersome task and can be intimidating andfutile. Without substantive action items that de-scribe how you intend to live up to your mission,along with responsible parties, measurements,and reporting structures, all of your efforts canamount to little more than theory that has nopractical application in your business. However, with the right framework, the process of strategic planning can be approached and imple-mented by adhering to a system that everyone un-derstands. Missions and visions are really justfodder for getting the re started and helping tokeep it lit. But alone, they are not enough. Totruly harness the power of your team, you mustunderstand what success means to you and to eachof your employees and how everyone plays an activerole in writing the story that is the success of yourpractice. By following a seven-step process, you can imple- ment a strategic plan in your practice: 1. Understanding your purpose2. Dening your core values AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 383THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESS NOTES3. Selecting your business strategy 4. Understanding the market and your place within it 5. Bringing focus to your efforts6. Getting your team aligned7. Keeping the engine tuned Getting Started First, you need some background work to dene theissues you are currently facing. This requires somesurvey data from your internal team, your key staffmembers, your Board of Directors (if you have one)and it might even benet from some insight fromyour customer base. This is an opportunity foryour people to talk about their personal view of theissues facing the organization: that's the rewardthey get for participating and also a chance for youto uncover some key weaknesses that probably needto be addressed. Like it or not, whatever your staff,associates, and partners say, they're right. The next part of the data-gathering process is to give everyone the task of describing solutions to theissues and to think about the broad scope success ofthe organization. You will be surprised at the vi-sion that your own people have been harboring.This might be the most eye-opening piece of theexercise. But you have to be trustworthy enough tohandle the information. You need open, honestdata. People need to feel that there will be no back- lash for their honest opinions, which is why a neu-tral facilitator is often a good solution, but notabsolutely necessary. The data can literally be col-lected in a survey or questionnaire, or it can happenin a series of interviews with the key stakeholders inthe organization. The point is, you need input, andit needs to be honest and forthcoming. My sugges-tion for this phase, and really every phase, but es-pecially this one, set the expectation so that theteam understands what you need, and why. Bythat I mean you must let your people know theprocess you are going to go through as a group, andwhether their responses will be condential, sharedwith a group, etc. Tell them what you are after,why you need it, and how you intend to use it.And then keep your word. Second, spend some time with key members de- ning the reasons they came to the party in the rstplace. By this I am talking about partners, share-holders, and key members of your executive team.Remember, your employees, your partners, yourteam as a whole, they are all engaged in your busi-ness by choice; their choice. They can choose oth-erwise. Guard against taking their talent andcreative energy for granted. They are in your lifeand part of your business for a reason, and it is timeyou found out why. Focus on long-term objectivesso that you can appreciate why your people areinvolved in your business, and where they want tobe in the next year, 5 years, and even 10 years.2. Understanding Your Purpose You will need to spend some time looking at what your organization is really all about. What is yourpurpose and what are your strengths? By this, Imean, what is it that you really do? What are youreally good at? And what do your clients actuallyvalue you for? It sounds like a repeat question, butthese can be very different things and identifyingthe real purpose of your organization and your realstrengths is key in focusing those strengths wherethere is potential within your market. A great tool to get to the heart of the matter in terms of what your organization does, is to ask your-self the \"ve whys.\" 1Here you describe what your organization does. For example, you state that youmake a certain product or offer a certain service.Then ask, \"Why is that important?\" After a few whysyou'll begin to uncover the true purpose that yourorganization even exists. Again, do not just saywhat you do, but dene what your business isuniquely good at, what is different or better thanyour competition, what can be valued by your cus-tomers. Once you've got the answer, ask why.That's it. Just ask why. And then repeat thequestion ve times. By the time you've answered\"why\" ve times, you've likely drilled down to thecore of what you are really all about as a businessand why your customers need you. In sum, your core purpose is the fundamental reason that your organization exists. 2The realiza- tion of this purpose can be a springboard to making signicant changes within your organization andthe way that you have been approaching yourbusiness. 3. Dening Your Core Values Values get at the core essence of who you are as anindividual. Do you value hard work? Do youvalue your staff? Do you value protability, and ifso, at what cost? A good way to get down to what itis you really value is to pay attention to the themesand phrases that you like to say and to those thatare spoken by your partners, associates, and staff.Most people, and most businesses have a few com-mon \"phrases\" that are used periodically, and inev-itably become the culture of the person or thebusiness. For example, if someone is fond of saying\"no free rides,\" and they say it frequently, it is likelythat this person values commitment, hard work, andearning your way through life. That is a value.And values, when added up, dene an individual.The collective sum of your individual influences willdene your corporate culture. In essence, core values are the guiding principles that guide the course of your company. 3Being true to those values and how they relate to your purposewill create the framework for your organizationalfocus. 384 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESS4. Selecting Your Business Strategy Next, evaluate your business model in terms of the type of strategy you want to employ. There are fourbasic strategy types described in detail in the book,Strategy, published by the Harvard BusinessReview Press. The strategies are: low-cost lead-ership, product/service differentiation, customer and network effect. 4 Low-Cost Leadership.5This is the Wal-Mart model where you compete on price ... period. Areyou the most affordable option your customer basecan nd? Do you want to be? The Differentiation Model. 6This is the type of business model you often see in the automobile in-dustry. You put three full-size pickups side by side,representing different brands. Each will try andshow you the difference in their automobile: theengine, the towing capacity, the strength of thebody, the number of miles you should get, the inte-rior space and amenities, and so forth. Maybe theyare really quite different, maybe not, the point is,they focus on this as their business strategy andthey stick to it.The Customer Care Strategy. 7Here the focus is on taking care of the customer, building that rela-tionship and fostering the ongoing dialog betweenthe organization and its market. This is whereproduct differentiation is not such a big deal, price isnever a bargaining tool, but the experience is fore-front of everything the organization does.Network Effect. 8Lastly, in this model we seek as a business to leverage our relationships and create the one-stop shop experience so that our customerscan get all they need in one spot\u2014our spot. The point of the exercise is that you must decide who you are in terms of your business model strat-egy, and stick to that strategy. Although you willlikely end up covering ground in other areas, thefocus must only be on one. Wal-Mart happens to bepretty good at being the \"one-stop-shop,\" but that isnot their focus. Price is their focus and they puttheir strengths into winning that game. Trying tobe too many things to too many people will simplyleave your customer base confused and will createfragmentation in your operational approach. 9Re- gardless of the strategy type you select as the coredirection for your practice, always look for align-ment between the strategy and your client base. 10 5. The Market and Your Place Within it The next step is to understand and evaluate themarket that is your current customer/client base.Discuss who they are, their demographics, incomebrackets, locations, their interests outside of horses.Drill down here and really try and identify who yourcurrent customers are and what category they rep-resent in terms of the marketplace. Now the important part of the customer equation: are they really the customers that you want? Dothey use your practice for the strengths that youwant to build on? Do they refer additional busi-ness? Do they pay at time of service? Do theyrepresent your greatest opportunity for growth as acompany? Essentially, are you playing in the righteld of the market? And if so, are you winning?If not, you need to nd out why and make the nec-essary changes to bring realistic positive change toyour practice by going after the right group ofcustomers. Remember, many organizations feel that there is power in going after a broader market. They per-ceive that the greater the slice of the pie, the moreopportunity there is to be had. The opposite, how-ever, could create greater opportunity. By focusingon a smaller segment of the market, and essentiallya smaller piece of the pie, your competitive advan-tage increases, allowing you to succeed on a largerscale in that section of the marketplace. 6. Bringing Focus to Your Efforts With the above elements dened, you are now readyto go to work. Action brings a sense of tangibility tothe forefront and creates enthusiasm for the process.A body in motion stays in motion, and the same istrue for a business. The trick is to move in a com-mon direction. Now that you have given focus to your values, your purpose as an organization, the type of busi-ness strategy you would like to hone in on, andevaluated your market, you will undoubtedly startto see some trends. There will be overlappingthemes and reoccurring thought processes as theessence of your business, or what you wish it couldbe, will begin to take shape. Next, you take the sum of that data and compare it to your current issues and solutions to those issuesthat your team unveiled to you during the initialinterview stage at the beginning of the process.With this data in hand, you are ready to start settingsome goals. This is a particularly challenging piece of the pro- cess. It can be difcult to inhale all of the dataabove and then churn out one or two action itemsthat is going to solve your problems. Think of it intime increments and the process becomes moremanageable. A quick exercise I like to use is to think about a special holiday that is going to come along in approx-imately 1 year. If it is around the end or beginningof a new year, you can think about next Christmas.Picture yourself at the end of that special day, dur-ing a quiet evening, at home in front of the replacein a relaxed atmosphere. As you picture the mo-ment, you are reflecting on what a great year it hasbeen for you professionally. You are feeling greatabout it personally, it has been nancially reward-ing and you feel valued and prosperous. You feel asif you truly accomplished something this year andyou're looking forward to the next. Now, describein as much detail as you can, what it is that hashappened during this past year that has led to so AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 385THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESSmany good feelings. Do you feel valued? Describe the things that have happened that have led to youfeeling this way. Do you feel nancially rewarded?Describe what that looks like and why that moneycame through. Most importantly, describe whatthat money is for. Do you feel like you accom-plished something? Describe what it is that youwill have accomplished? And are you enthusiasticabout the coming year? Describe in great detailwhy you would be so fondly looking forward to thecoming year. Now write all of this down. It may be a para- graph. It may only be a sentence or two. It mayjust be a few words. Whatever it is to you, be veryhonest, and describe it. Weigh your vision against the initial data gath- ered in your planning process to make sure it is inalignment with what you have decided for your or-ganization. What you have just described is your1-year plan. It may be a very personal 1-year plan,but it ts into the overall workings of the organiza-tion. It has to, because that is where your profes-sional life exists. When everyone on the decision-making team has had a chance to describe that world, you have a better idea of what a year's success truly means toyour organization on an individual basis. Now youhave to make it work for the organization as a whole. From that simple exercise we can then project a few more years down the road. For example, let'ssay that your 1-year goal was to have less anxiety inyour workplace and you think that could come fromhaving a great front ofce team that is well educatedon your software, great with customer service, andreally efcient at scheduling and getting everyonewhat they need. If you look out a few years at whatthat will do, it essentially creates a better customerexperience for both your outside customers and yourinternal employee experience as well. The 1-yeargoal then is to improve front ofce operations. The3-5-year goal is to create a stress-free environmentto increase employee morale and enhance the clientexperience. Now jump backward in your planning and de- scribe what you can do about this 1-year objective inthe next 90 days. Could you hire someone? Couldyou get more training? Could you invest in a bettersoftware program, or get more training in the soft-ware that you have? What could you do in the next90 days to get you headed in that direction? Onceyou answer that, you have the makings of a realplan. You have your 3-5-year goals, you have the1-year measurable that tells you if you are gettingthere, and you have a 90-day plan to start moving inthat direction. Why 90 days? Because that isenough time to actually make some headway, yetnot so much time that you lose sight and enthusiasmof the effort. Plus it gives you the opportunity toreassess things in the next quarter, adjust your ob-jectives to better align with your long-term goalsand head out again with renewed vigor for your overall purpose. As you work through this exercise, you'll nd that several of the one year success stories have overlap-ping themes. They will likely be about operationalefciencies and day to day struggles. They mayaddress specics like space or personnel inadequa-cies, or they may be larger issues such as cash flow,or caseload numbers. Either way, the yearly objec-tives will likely feed into a larger, 3-5-year goal thatcan be identied from the yearly objective. On an individual basis, you will also have to chal- lenge yourself and your team to work daily towardtheir own personal 90-day (quarterly) objectives thatfeed into and support the quarterly objectives of theorganization. The team should ask themselves ev-ery day, \"what can I do today to move in the direc-tion of my quarterly objective?\" This dailychallenge and the resulting activity will add up toweekly progress and quarterly success, which turnsinto the realization of annual goals. Sounds sim-ple, but it works. 7. Getting Your Team Aligned Finally, you must make sure the quarterly objec-tives really make sense. A great tool for ensuringthe accuracy of your quarterly goal setting is toadhere to the practice of setting SMART goals.Developed through Peter Drucker's' Management by Objectives, this is an approach in which a balance issought between the objectives of employees and theobjectives of an organization. The essence of PeterDrucker's approach is to determine whether thegoals are aligned and to provide feedback onresults. 11 To make the concept simple and easy to under- stand, Drucker coined the mnemonic, SMART: S\u2014SpecicM\u2014MeasurableA\u2014AttainableR\u2014RelevantT\u2014Timely Each quarterly objective set by an employee, whichsubsequently feeds into the organizational quarterlyobjectives, should adhere to this concept to ensurethat the task is in concert with the annual organi-zational goals. Quite simply, the SMART inquiry isto determine whether the goals you have set reallymake sense for the employee and the organization.Do they add value? Can you actually accomplishthem in the time allotted? Is it necessary that youdo? Will you be able to tell if you were successful?If you can answer yes to the above, then it is likelythat you're on the right track. 8. Keeping the Engine Tuned Equally as important as developing the goal in therst place is the problem of actually tackling thegoal and taking strides to see its completion. 386 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESSAgain, managing the expectation is the key. Set goals that are realistic yet challenging enough to keep the team honest. Be fair in your assignmentsin terms of the weight of the task, even distributionof workload among employees, and the time allottedto bring the goal to fruition. A common mistake isfor too many objectives to be piled onto one person ordepartment, or to create too high of an expectationin terms of immediate results or the magnitude ofthe initial quarterly goals that are set. This is astrategic plan for a business and a business is madeup of everyone who works there. It is importantthat the strategy is well spread out among the teamand that the accountabilities are equally shared.It has taken time for your organization to arrivewhere it is currently and it will take time to get itback on track. 9. Conclusion Through careful analysis of the issues and potentialsolutions from the individuals that make up yourteam, you come to better understand what is impor-tant on individual levels and collectively as a group.This understanding, expanded upon with the influ-ence of your overriding core purpose and organiza-tional values will function as a guideline inassessing your market, your strategy type and ulti-mately developing yearly objectives. Once theseare dened, it is a matter of breaking them downinto manageable tasks, assigning them to account-able parties with realistic timelines, and maintain-ing a rhythm of reporting so that everyone stays ontask. Only through careful monitoring of the objectives themselves, the way they are measured and theinvolvement of the entire team will synergy truly becreated, a common vision be developed, and a collec-tive effort be employed to getting you and your em-ployees what you truly desire as an organization.

Strategy for a veterinary business is the guiding light that shows whether a business is going to havea sustainable competitive advantage in the market-place. By denition, a successful strategy is uniqueto a business because if it were the same as anotherbusiness, there would not be a compelling reason forconsumers to pick one business over another, soneither would have a competitive advantage. Oncea strategy is crafted, it is essential to create aware-ness of the value being offered to the end client.Promoting a strategy should consider 4 key compo-nents of a strategy: goals, value proposition, targetclient(s), and core business strengths. This presen-tation will guide the veterinary business in the bestway to use these strategic elements to increase theeffectiveness of business promotion using commonexamples in equine veterinary businesses. A business goal could be general or specic. For example, a veterinary practice could aim to have thebest reputation as a lameness referral center, or itcould want to increase radiology sales by 10% in thecoming year. Whereas the latter is specic, theformer is general because it is hard to preciselymeasure the outcome. Similar examples can beused over a variety of veterinary practice types, with the common difference being that one should pro-mote the overall business reputation while the othershould focus primarily on radiology services ratherthan the lameness skills of the veterinarians. Re-gardless of the goal, specic metrics must be estab- lished to help measure the success of promotionalefforts over regular intervals. Much like monitor-ing anesthesia to ensure proper anesthetic depth,regularly assessing a marketing campaign is essen-tial for properly responding to current efforts. A key component of a strategy is the value prop- osition, or the reason why a client picks one businessover another. It is a simple articulation of thevalue a business offers to its clients. Examples ofsuccessful value propositions would be Walmart's\"everyday low prices\" or BMW's \"ultimate drivingmachine.\" In a veterinary practice, a value propo-sition could illustrate how the practice is \"alwaysthere for emergencies\" or \"can handle every veteri-nary need\" in the case of a referral hospital to \"1-stop lameness diagnosis and treatments\" for asports medicine specialist. Dening a value propo-sition can be the hardest part of creating a strategyand marketing plan. It is easy for a veterinarybusiness to state that they care or are compassion-ate. Those statements are no different from anyother vet practice\u2014they are a given. Instead, pro-mote what sets you apart from the competition. Having a clear focus on your service offerings and ideal client is vital for effective promotion. Nord- strom has a different target client and quality offer-ing than does Walmart; veterinary businessesshould have a similarly clear idea of their target 388 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESS NOTESclients and offerings. If you are aiming to be a high-end English sport horse practice, you shouldn'tspend a lot of your time promoting your services tobackyard horse owners. If your service focus is onreproduction, then targeting horse shows in yourarea might be a wasted effort unless there is anemphasis on weanling or breed classes. If you are aspecialist, your target client might be referring vetsfrom within a wide area. They are going to need adifferent approach than horse owners. If your busi-ness deals with large barns or training centers, yourtarget client might be the barn owner or trainerbecause they control access to their clients. This isnot to suggest that the horse owners should be ig-nored; rather, focusing on creating awareness ofyour services to the trainer or barn manager mayyield a bigger and quicker return. Knowing thetype of target client helps keep the focus on theappropriate tools to use to reach them; rural clientsmight lack broadband Internet access, so print me-dia might be necessary, whereas urban-based dres-sage riders might be looking for information onsocial media. Finally, every business has core capabilities that are unique to them. It could be as obvious as theability to see horses on the farm by an ambulatoryvet when compared to a referral hospital. It couldalso reflect the ability of staff and vets to engage insocial media or client education seminars. If youare a single-vet ambulatory practice, you probablydon't have time to create and post social media con-tent, so you may focus on creating excellent clientimpressions that lead to strong word-of-mouth rec-ommendations. Any business should either focuson their existing promotional capabilities or createnew ones to t the current strategy. Ensuring that a business has a clear grasp of their goals, value proposition, target client, and core ca-pabilities before promoting a business strategy isessential for the ultimate success of the strategicplan. As veterinarians, we wouldn't attempt a cas-tration without the right tools, assistance, andknowledge, and we shouldn't tamper with our busi-ness reputation and ultimate success withoutcareful preparation. Too many small businessesattempt to promote their services by advertisingaimlessly without taking into consideration whatthey are promoting and what value they offer\u2014andto which clients. A differentiating strategy is sorare in business in general that a veterinary practicethat spends the time to craft a competitive edge andpromotes it well is positioned for success at theexpense of their competition.

Introduction Have you ever stepped outside to embark on your day, excited and maybe a bit hurried, when right asyou closed your door you realized your keys weresitting on the coffee table? The wave of dread rush-ing over you as you thought about the time andeffort it was going to take to extract those keys fromyour home to get on with your day? This is a rela-tively simple problem with a relatively simple solu-tion\u2014place a \"hide-a-key\" in your side yard so thatyou can easily unlock the door when needed andboom! Problem solved. But in business we don't have hide-a-keys; we must think strategically to set ourselves up for suc-cess. Strategic planning is the process of identify-ing organizational objectives and determining whatactions are required to reach those objectives. 1 It is far easier to stay out of trouble than to get out of trouble. So, in business, we must proverbiallycheck for our keys before walking out the door.All decision-making should support your goals, andyou should be proactive rather than reactive inachieving those goals. So what guides our strategic thinking? How do we determine what is best for the company when makingdecisions large and small? Well, we must begin with the end in mind. After all, we've got to know wherewe are going before we get there, don't we? Why are you here? The answer to this question will give you purpose and motivation to continue on.Who do you serve? The answer here will establisha basis for the type of services or products you pro-vide within your industry. What do you stand for?These guiding principles will keep you from veeringoff course. What are your goals? You must beginwith the end in mind to create clear, productiveaction steps. This is the rst set of strategic ques-tions you must ask yourself. Three to ve well-dened company goals and strong core values, along with a clear mission state-ment, should answer each of these questions. Yourgoals, core values, and mission statement lay the foundation for your company's culture, and with astrong culture you will have the ability to con-dently delegate decision-making to others. Moreon this later. It should be obvious that large, macro-level deci- sions (i.e., business locations, services/products pro-vided, etc.) should be made methodically. Thesetypes of decisions have the highest probability of 390 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESS NOTESresulting in overall success or failure. But what about the mundane? What about the decisions thatseem inconsequential and banal? In reality, everydecision that is made should support the strategicposition and vision of the company. Once you haveclearly dened and communicated your strategic po-sition to your associates, the decisions they makebecome easier for them and better for you. So the question then becomes how a company denes and communicates its strategic position toits associates. This presentation will cover the hu-man resources practices that have brought successto Nugget Markets, a small grocery chain with 15stores and 1,500 associates in Northern California.Since 1926, Nugget Markets has advocated for andimplemented the highest of workplace standards inthe grocery industry. Fortune has ranked Nugget Markets as high as fth in the nation on their list ofthe \"100 Best Companies to Work For,\" and we havemade the list 10 years running (2006-2015). 2. Dening Your Strategic Position There are no shortcuts to dening your strategicposition within an industry. It requires deliberatethought and reflection. There are no catch phrasesor key words that should be universally woven intoan organization's strategic visions. To be uniquelysuccessful, your denition of success and your visionmust be uniquely derived. Any attempts to imple-ment strategic thinking must be intrinsically andorganically motivated rather than \"cut and pasted.\" A traditional business approach to determining your strategic position is to conduct a strengths,weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT)analysis. 2When conducting a SWOT analysis, you are looking at your company's internal strengthsand weaknesses while assessing the external oppor-tunities and threats present in the environment.Some textbooks say to plot these 4 attributes on amatrix, but I nd that to be unnecessary in mostcases. On the other hand, collaboration is ex-tremely helpful when conducting a SWOT analysis,but only when trust among the team is high; brutalhonesty and robust conversation are critical to thisexercise. So what form does a SWOT analysis ac-tually take? Let's break it down into even simplerterms. Look Inward To begin dening your strategic position, you muststart by analyzing your own organization. Lookinward at your organization to determine yourstrengths and weaknesses. Look at everything.Where does your staff excel and where are theydecient? In turn, where do you excel, and whereare you decient? How is your website? Is yourfacility in the optimum location? What does thefront desk look like from your customer's perspec-tive? Every small detail adds up, and over time, itis these details that create great outcomes. 3Every- thing matters.I'm reminded of one of the most influential 30- minute meetings I had back when I was a kitchenmanager at one of our stores in Northern California.I had scheduled weekly meetings with one of ourvice presidents to look at what was working andwhat wasn't. Some of these meetings were morevaluable than others, but one in particular standsout above the rest. It was a rather peculiar meet-ing, I might add. As the meeting began, we ex-changed pleasantries and then headed straight ontothe sales floor. As we walked up to the rst area tobe inspected\u2014my \"grab 'n' go\" an-swered with a sort of absentminded \"sure,\" and thenwe moved on to the next display\u2014this time the sodafountain machine. Again, \"Are you proud of that?\"This time I responded with a less condent \"I guess.\"Then again at the entre \u00b4e case, and again at thehandwashing sink, and then again and againeach time in more rapid succession: Are you proudof that? Are you proud of that? Are you proud ofthat? For nearly 30 minutes the vice president con-tinued asking the same question. The messagewas loud and clear. Every single detail in yourbusiness matters. Every single decision you make,no matter how big or small, is important. Whenlooking inward to determine strengths and opportu-nities, look at everything and remember the impor-tant question: Are you proud of that? Look Outward After analyzing your company, it's important tolook at others in your industry to see where youstand against them. After all, this is what yourcustomers are doing. This is also what newcomersto the workforce are doing. With the availability ofinformation in this technology-driven age, everyonesurveys the eld before making their decisions.Shouldn't you? If you only look inward, your pic-ture is severely incomplete, and any assessment youmake will be critically uninformed. When looking outward, it is important to identify opportunities and threats. Opportunities are sec-tors of your industry that have been untapped.Are there any populations being underserved inyour area? Look at your competitors and seewhether they are missing the mark anywhere.Their missed marks are your opportunities. Arethere emerging technologies that can be adoptedearly so that you become the authority in that spe-cic area? Look at your industry to see where theoverall trends are headed. These new trends areyour opportunities. You must also assess your threats when looking outward. If your organization is decient in a spe-cic area, this can become a threat. If your compe-tition excels in a certain service or product, this toocan become a threat. The key here is that thesediscrepancies can only become threats when you tryto compete in these areas. That doesn't mean thatyou can't compete, but if you want to beat someone AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 391THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESSelse that is more talented in a specic area, you better have a really good plan for adapting andevolving. Maybe your plan involves hiring staffthat have more talent in that area. Maybe yourplan is to get more training in that area. These areboth ne plans that, if executed properly, can lead tofavorable results in defeating the threat, but there isanother option. Differentiate. What makes you uniquely suited to provide a service or product over the other guys?If you have analyzed your own organization, taken alook at what the competition does, and recognizedthe trends of the industry, then you can identify theareas where you naturally stand out. Focus on thepositives from your SWOT analysis (the strengthsand opportunities), and go in that direction. Once you have determined your strategic position, your company's true competitive advantage, it istime to dene this position in concrete terms so thatit can be understood and followed by everyone in theorganization. It is time to circle back to your corevalues, company goals, and mission statement.Are they still a good reflection of your company'strajectory? Do they still make sense with regard towhere you stand among the competition? Althoughthings like core values, company goals, and missionstatements should remain relatively static, it shouldbe understood that these items can, and probablyshould, change over time. If your organization hasvalues, goals, and mission or vision statements,when was the last time they were evaluated? Arethey leading you where you want to go? Remem-ber, everything matters. 3. Communicating Your Strategic Position Communicating your strategic position really comesdown to creating systems for disseminating yourmessage and holding people accountable to yourvision. Most of the time when discussing commu-nication, we focus on the free-flowing nature of face-to-face meetings or think about the advantages anddisadvantages of an e-mail versus a phone call.That is not the sort of communication we are focus-ing on here. I want to focus on systems. It startsinternally with your associates, and it starts right atthe moment a prospective employee reaches out toyour organization. Communicating Your Position When a job candidate initially makes contact withyour organization, what does it look like? Whatdoes it feel like for them? It is wise to create awarm, welcoming environment for prospective hiresbecause they are likely testing the market. Do youfeellike the best choice for them? Put together a system for responding to every application that isreceived. It can be something as simple as an au-tomated message that reads, \"Thank you for inquir-ing about employment within our organization.We carefully review every application received andwill contact you within 7 days if your applicationmeets the current criteria we are searching for.Thank you for your interest in our organization, andwe wish you the best of luck in your job hunt.\"A message like this will set a clear expectation foryour applicants with regard to timing, and it alsogives them the impression that you are really on topof things. During the interview process, consistency in your system is key. 4Whether you implement a quanti- tative, subjective, or other selection system, yourprocess and criteria for selection must be consistentto ensure that your results are valid. 5There are times when you can tell that a prospective associatewould be a bad t within the rst moments of aninterview, but it is important that you stick to yourprocess and see it through. This will not only fur-ther validate your decision but will also help todevelop a favorable reputation throughout yourbusiness community. People will appreciate theopportunity to practice interviewing, and even ifthey are not offered the job they will feel like theywere heard. Once an applicant is interviewed and hired, it is critical that systems are in place to communicateyour company's goals and expectations. Jobtasks and descriptions should be given here.What is expected from your new hires in the day-to-day operations of the business unit and specif-ically their role within that unit are critical.Do you have a written job description for everyposition within your organization? If you haven'tdone so, try writing down the actual expectationsof every position in your organization. Afterwriting them down, determine the best way toeffectively communicate these expectations toyour associates (simply handing out the writtenexpectations will likely be inadequate). Communicating to your newest associates goes far beyond positional responsibilities and expectations.You have to give them some context about the stra-tegic position of the company. Harken back to yourmission, goals, and values at this point. Thisdoesn't mean you have to conduct a 3-week orienta-tion or spend valuable resources on expensive videosand presentations (although those types of thingstend to help keep your message consistent, particu-larly in large organizations). What you do need,however, is a method for conveying the things thatare most important to your organization to yournewest associates, as well as a process for answeringall of their questions. Whether written, verbal, orby some other method, it is critical that you tell yourstory and that you also meet your new associates'needs and expectations. When it comes to communicating with your staff, and particularly your newest hires, always remem-ber that the best communication is going to be clear,comprehensive, and consistent. Clear communica-tors use the simplest language possible to conveytheir message. By cutting through excess verbiage,you can cut right to the core of the message you 392 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESSwould like to convey. Comprehensive communica- tors anticipate the questions that may arise beforethey are asked and make a concerted effort to an-swer those questions before they are asked. Con-sistent communicators ensure that the samemessage gets through to everyone. A written aid orguidebook can prove to be extremely valuable here. Accountability Disseminating your message is only the beginning ofthe communication process. Simply communicat-ing your message is not enough; good communica-tors ensure that their message gets through. WhenI visualize effective communication, I think of theloading symbol on my iPhone or web browser, con-stantly rotating and looping over onto itself until theapplication is loaded. This is how we should thinkof communication\u2014a loop of information that is con-stantly reinforcing itself until everyone is on thesame page. Once everyone is on the same page, we can begin to hold associates accountable, but not a momentsooner. So many workplace issues, from associatejob performance to driving business results, guestloyalty, and protability, could be easily resolved ifmore managers engaged in holding themselves andtheir teams accountable. Accountability is aboutsetting the expectation, clearly communicating it,and then holding yourself and everyone on yourteam responsible for consistently meeting the estab-lished goals. Holding associates accountable to theexpectations that have been set is a cyclical process.It is not about telling people quickly what you expectthem to do and then moving on to the next thing.It takes time, but stick to your guns. Regular performance reviews are important to this process. I'll never forget when a superior ofmine told me, \"You must inspect what you expect.\"Performance reviews allow for focused time to dis-cuss where associates are and where they need to go;keep in mind, however, that the best performancereviews should allow for communication to flow bothways. In many organizations, associates ll out aself-evaluation that is compared with the evaluationthat their manager has completed. 6When we take the time to truly evaluate ourselves, it opens upopportunities for growth. It amazes me how oftenthe reviewer and the reviewee have nearly identicalviews of a particular situation, but the exercise ofthe reviewee rst writing his or her own thoughtsdown allows for the discussion to be had in a non-confrontational, more constructive way. Communication is just as much about listening as it is about speaking. So we must listen to our as-sociates as well. Explore the idea of conductingreverse or 360-degree 7reviews where associates are given the opportunity to provide feedback to theirsuperiors and/or peers in an anonymous and con-dential platform (for instance, anonymous surveysand/or digital apps). In smaller organizations orbusiness units, anonymity can be a challenge, butthe process of receiving honest feedback from yourdirect reports and/or peers is invaluable. After all,the people who work for you are going to be the bestjudge of your ability to lead, how well you commu-nicate, and how committed you are to holding every-one accountable. They are the ones that deal withall of your strengths and deciencies every day. Performance reviews are only one important facet of holding your team accountable. Reviews providewritten documentation of our coaching sessions, buteveryday coaching is in many ways far more impor-tant. Consistent, frequent coaching of associatesallows for forward progress and movement. 8When coaching is infrequent, it necessarily forces the dy-namic of the conversation into the past. You will bereviewing what went wrong and what went right butleaving much less time to focus on the current situ-ation and plan of action moving forward. Frequentcoaching allows for more progressive, productive,and\u2014dare I say\u2014strategic thinking. Coach the expectation\u2014not the person. This phi- losophy says that we should place more focus on theaction and less focus on the individual. When youhave clearly dened and well-written expectations,they are easy to reference when holding associatesaccountable. Rather than solely focusing on thedeciencies of the individual, coaching the expecta-tion is about acknowledging those deciencies\u2014getting them out in the open\u2014and then moving for-ward to the solution (the expectation). This allowsus to continue moving forward as we endeavor tobetter our business. 4. In Closing When a company sets out to change their cultureand dene their competitive advantages, it can be adaunting task. It takes time. A lot of time. Butby following a clear plan with clear intent, it can bedone effectively. It starts by taking the time to reflect on what is important to you and your operation. Why are youhere? Who do you serve? What do you stand for?What are your goals? Then look inward at yourorganization to identify strengths and weaknessesand outward at your industry's landscape to identifyopportunities and threats. Dene your company'sgoals, core values, and mission and then communi-cate that strategic position to your associatesthrough whatever means it takes to make that mes-sage sink in. Finally, hold your associates account-able to meeting your expectations and monitor yourposition in relation to your goals. Make adjust-ments as needed. Before stepping outside to startour day, we must rst grab our keys.

Several broad themes emerged from theresults: the importance of practice culture, the importance of control and choice, and the degree ofstress in the profession. Strategies for mitigating challenges need to address these key compo-nents. Author's addresses: Amy L. Grice, VMD, MBA, LLC, 192, E. Crittenden Street,Virginia City, MT 59755 (Grice); Department (Zahradnik, Introduction The equine veterinary industry currently faces an unusual collision of forces that have made the envi-ronment challenging for future operation. A com-bination of the recession of 2008, changing demo-graphics, and emerging sociocultural factors havecaused the equine industry to contract. There arealmost 50% fewer horses in the US than there werejust 10 years ago. 1At the same time, increasing numbers of new US veterinary graduates are pro-jected over the next 20 years as a result of increasedenrollment at existing veterinary schools and theopening of 3 new institutions. It was estimated in2013 that of the approximately 3,775 new veterinar-ians likely to graduate in 2014, approximately 6%(226) would be focused on equines. 2This growingworkforce comes into a eld where research projects 23% national surplus of equine educational debt has in-creased concurrently, and a negative future value ofmore than $500,000 for equine practitioners com-pared with those with a bachelor's degree wascalculated by the American Veterinary Medical As- sociation (AVMA) economic team in 2014. 4These new environmental factors exacerbate the traditional challenges of veterinary practice (e.g., the physicaldangers inherent in the profession, the mundane hu-man resources issues faced by any small business,etc.). To explore the perceptions equine veterinarians have regarding their work environment, an online AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 395THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESS NOTESsurvey was conducted among practitioners to iden- tify the factors that have been driving a recent re-ported trend of increase in solo equine veterinarypractices, 5the most pressing concerns of practitio- ners with regard to their business and profes-sional life, and the business education needs ofveterinarians. 2. Materials and Methods An online survey of equine veterinarians was con-ducted in the fall of 2014. A link to the survey wasposted on the listservs of the AAEP and EquineClinicians Network (ECN). The initial survey waslimited to those practitioners whose practice is/H1102275% equine and was closed after a week of re-sponses. Upon reviewing the raw results, however,we discovered a problem in how the data were col-lected and discovered. Because of defects in thefunctionality of the survey, some respondents werenot offered the full complement of survey questions.Consequently, we posted a repaired version of thesurvey that included the missing questions to bothlistservs in late November 2014 with an explanationand invitation to the affected respondent segments.In addition, because of requests from listserv mem-bers, those providing /H1102175% equine services were invited to participate in the second survey. To havevalid data, previous (redundant) responses from du-plicate Internet protocol addresses were discarded.Responses from both surveys were then compiledadditively. The survey research design included the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data. The tar-get group for the survey initially was equine veter-inary practitioners with a /H1102275% equine case load and limited through the use of two qualifying ques-tions; however, because of listserv member feed-back, the target group was expanded in the secondsurvey to include all respondents who performequine services. 3. Results A total of 516 veterinarians responded to the survey.At the time there were 1,520 AAEP members onthe general listserv. It is likely\u2014although was a signicant overlap withmembers of the ECN. If considering only the mem-bership of the AAEP general listserv, this wouldequate to an andyield roughly a 95% (/H110064%) condence interval.When considering the results of the survey, it isimportant to remember that the population sur-veyed were those members that were active on thelistserv, which by necessity excluded the membersnot using this mode of communication. Importantdifferences may be present between the nonlistservpractitioners and those surveyed. Survey respondents differed in some demographic characteristics from the AAEP membership re-ported in the 2014 AAEP annual report. Respon-dents were made up of 38.4% solo practitioners(AAEP 39% response). Of prac-tices, 50.6% respondents worked in practices with 2to 6 veterinarians, and 11% worked in practices with7 or more veterinarians. There respondents graduated be-tween 2004 and 2014, and 55.1% graduated in orbefore 2003. The percentages of respondents byregion were as follows: 22% Northeast, 12% Mid-Atlantic, South Central, 12%Northwest, 21% Midwest, and 14% Southwest. Solo Practitioners Of the 185 solo practitioners who responded, 75.4%had previously worked in a group practice (exclud-ing internships); of these, 77.8% were past associ-ates, and 22.2% had been owners or partners ingroup practice. The survey asked these practitio-ners what their primary reasons were for now beingin solo practice. Dissatisfaction with practice cul-ture was the most chosen response among respon-dents that were formerly associates. Many of theprevious associate respondents chose \"other\" andgave written responses; these responses were fo-cused on dissatisfaction with compensation, timeconstraints, practice management, and lack of own-ership opportunity. Of the respondents previouslyemployed as partners or shareholders in a grouppractice, 26.7% cited partner/shareholder discord asthe primary reason for wanting to be in solo practice.Many also cited the dissolution of their group prac-tices, primarily because of economic factors. Solo practitioners were also asked how important certain factors were in their decision to open theirown equine veterinary practice or how importantcertain factors were in their decision to leave grouppractice and practice as a solo practitioner. Thetwo factors most cited as \"very important\" or \"im-portant\" in decisions to be in solo practice were thedesire to make their own decisions about how topractice medicine and the desire to have control overtheir work schedule and life balance. Of veterinar-ians that had always been solo practitioners, 77.1%cited the rst statement (making own decisions) asbeing most important and 68.6% the second (settingown work schedule), which corresponded similarlyto those who made a decision to leave group practiceto practice solo (83% and 76.6%, respectively; Figs. 1and 2). When asked whether there were any other factors in their decision to be a solo equine practitioner, 72veterinarians gave individual responses. Commonthemes emerged, including the lack of ownershipopportunities, lack of effective business manage-ment practices, and disagreements about ethics andphilosophy of practice. There were several aspects of practice that solo prac- titioners found stressful. Respondents were giventhe following choices \"not stressful,\" 396 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE fol-lowed by \"clients who disrespect personal boundaries\"(23), but neither of these stressors was the top con-tender when scores for all degrees of stressful re-sponses were considered additively (Fig. 3). Thosegraduating between 2004 and 2014 were twice aslikely to choose \"extremely stressful\" for these twoaspects as those graduating in or 2003. Pair-ing only \"extremely stressful\" and \"very stressful\" re-sponses yielded a high of veterinarians who cited AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 397THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESS\"negative client interactions,\" followed by 55 who cited \"emergency on-call duty\" and \"workload too much ornot enough.\" When adding all stressful scores,\"workload too much or not enough\" was the most fre-quent cause of stress (88%), followed on-call duty\" (82%). When considering the business aspects of running a solo practice, respondents felt the least stress withthe following aspects: and federal regulations.The most challenging 3 aspects of being a solo prac-titioner reported by respondents were, in order, \"feesetting,\" \"accounts receivable/collections,\" and \"cash flow\" (Fig. 4). It is important to note that the manyaspects of managing a small business are a signi-cant cause of stress for the solo practitioner; indeed,most respondents reported some level of stress(\"somewhat stressful\" re-sponses considered the exception of \"choosing professional advi-sors.\" About half of solo practitioners (47.2%) em-ploy staff, and according to the survey responses, themost difcult aspects of employing staff are recruit-ing, training, and affording appropriate compensa-tion for their employees. 398 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESSGroup Practices Survey responses were obtained from 297 equine veterinarians working in group practices. Of thisgroup, 82.2% practiced in groups with 2 to 6 veteri-narians (hereafter called the \"small group\"), and17.6% practiced in groups of 7 or more veterinarians(hereafter called the \"large group\"). Associates andpartners/shareholders made up 57.5% 41.4% ofthe respondents, respectively, with the remainderconsisting of interns/residents. Associates When asked about the importance of certain factors related to their satisfaction with their position in thegroup practice, practice culture and compensationwere the top factors among associates, with 90.1%responding that both of these were \"important\" or\"very important\" to their job satisfaction. \"Makingyour own decisions about how to practice medicine\"(86.6%), \"opportunity to learn new skills\" (84.8%),and \"challenge of caseload at group practice\" (83.3%)were the next in frequency of response. Least sig-nicant to job satisfaction of associates was the op-tion to work part-time hours, with only 21.3%considering this \"important\" or \"very important.\" Associates were asked what their satisfaction was with their current position based on the same fac-tors. Responses of both small- and large-group as-sociates were similar. Associates from both groupsstated that they were \"extremely satised\" or \"verysatised\" within their positions. The 2 aspects of their positions they liked most were, respectively, \"making [their] own decisions about how to practicemedicine\" (small group: large group: 70.8%)and group: 70.9%; large group:70.8%). When associates' responses on what factors were the most important to them for job satisfaction werecompared with their actual current level of satisfac-tion, dissonance emerged. Looking at the 3 aspectsreported as most important, \"compensation\" was\"very important\" or \"important\" im-portant\" to reported being \"extremely satised\" or \"verysatised.\" Areas with the least amount of congruitybetween what associates reported they wanted ver-sus what they experienced were \"compensation\"(90.2% vs. 31%) and \"life balance\" (77.7% ed\" to \"very dissatised\" with certain aspects oftheir commonly be-ing unhappy with THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESSquirements of position\" (26.3%), When segmented intosmall- and large-group practices, the large-practiceassociates' responses (of which there were 30) dif-fered; the most commonly reported dissatisfactionswere with \"life family responsi-bilities\" and veterinarianswithin the practice\" tied for fourth (20.8% each).Small-practice associates, perhaps because of theirhigher numbers (173), aligned with the groupndings. When considering responses from \"stressful\" to \"extremely stressful,\" the aspects of practicing as anassociate that were considered the most stressful orchallenging were \"negative client interactions\"(81.2%), \"negative \"extremely stressful\" re-sponses, \"governance practice (managementdecisions)\" was the aspect of practice most fre-quently cited as causing extreme stress, with 25% ofrespondents choosing this response (Fig. 6). Practice Owners (Partners/Shareholders) Practice owners were asked about their level of satis- faction with their position at their group practice.Factors that provided the highest level of satisfactionincluded \"making [their] (69.2%). with to \"time requirements ofposition\" (34.7%) (Fig. 7).Practice owners were also asked what aspects of practice were the most challenging or stressful to them. Aspects that were challenging (additive re-sponses of \"stressful,\" or em-bezzlement\" (25%) and \"controlled substance compli-ance\" (30.8%). All aspects of practice managementlisted were the source of some degree of stress in atleast 50% of respondents when those that responded \"somewhat stressful\" were added (Fig. 8). Manyaspects of managing employees were also found to bestressful by the respondents, led by \"recruiting/hir-ing\" (75%) and \"compensation costs\" (59.6%) (Fig. 9). Generational and Gender Differences Respondents were also asked about their educa-tional debt at the time of graduation. When com-paring those veterinarians who graduated between2004 and 2014 with those who graduated in or be-fore 2003, only 15.6% of the former graduated with$25,000 or less in debt, whereas 52.3% of the latterwere in this sector. Similarly, 27.1% of those whograduated between 2004 and 2014 had an educa-tional debt that exceeded $150,000 compared withonly 2.9% of those who graduated before 2004 (Fig.10). When comparing those veterinarians who gradu- ated between 2004 and 2014 with those who gradu-ated in or before 2003 or before regarding thequestion of why they began practicing solo, the re-sponses were quite similar. The largest discrep-ancy of named reasons was \"job loss,\" with a greaterpercentage of younger veterinarians (13.8%) having 400 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESSswitched to solo practice for this reason versus older veterinarians (5.9%) (Fig. 11). Some differences between generations emerged in responses to the relative importance of factors in thedecision to practice solo. Of those graduating be-tween 2004 and 2014, 53.3% responded that the\"desire to have flexibility for family responsibilities\"was \"very important\" or \"important\" in their deci-sion; in contrast, only 29.4% of those graduating inor before 2003 cited this type of flexibility as a factor.In addition, males (33.3%) were less likely than fe-males (48.4%) to attach importance to this factor. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 401THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESSBecause of demographic changes in the veterinary industry, this may be partly a result of generationaldifferences. Of those factors considered most important, there was little difference between the generations: the\"desire to make [their] own decisions about was considered \"important\" or\"very important\" to 80.4% of those graduating be-tween 2004 and 2014 and to 81.2% of those gradu-ating in or before 2003; the \"desire to have controlover work schedule and life balance\" was similar aswell (78.2% and 70.6%, respectively). For those associates in group practice, the factors affecting satisfaction that had the least congruitywere \"life balance\" and \"compensation\". Thosegraduating between 2004 and 2014 were less likelythan those graduating in or before 2003 to be satis-ed with life balance (25% vs. 46%), and femalerespondents were less likely to report being satisedthan males (28.6% vs. 45.3%). Interestingly, nogenerational differences were observed in satisfac-tion with compensation, and just 30% of both grad-uating groups reported satisfaction.

Currently, 50% of equine practitioners are over the age of 50.8Fewer young veterinarians can afford to purchase practicesfrom retiring practitioners because of rising studentdebt partnered with low salaries, forcing manyequine practitioners to continue working becausethey cannot sell the assets needed to fund theirretirement. In 2012, veterinary school graduates in equine practice had an average educational debtof $151,672 and average starting salaries of$37,143. 9Increasing numbers of veterinarians graduate each year, and the AVMA projects a 23%overcapacity of equine veterinarians from 2012 to2025. 3This perfect storm of recessionary pres- sures, slackened demand for veterinary services as aresult of decreased equine industry activity, an in-creased supply of practitioners with 402 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESSished capacity for practice purchase, and an aged cohort of equine veterinarians unable to harvest re-tirement assets from their practices currentlymakes equine veterinary medicine a difcultenvironment. One impetus for the creation of this survey was the suggestion from preliminary data of the 2012Merck-Henry Schein National Equine EconomicStudy that the percentage of solo equine veterinarypractices was increasing. 5Given the oversupply of equine veterinarians and the high debt load of newgraduates, one hypothesis was that new graduateswere unable to nd employment or could not affordto purchase an existing practice and were thereforeopening solo practices. Of the 2,995 solo practitio-ner members of the AAEP in 2014, 221 were only 5years or so removed from graduation b. Alterna- tively, it was hypothesized that associate veterinar-ians were dissatised with their employmentexperiences and thus sought self-employment. TheMillennial generation is more comfortable with self-employment than previous generations; in fact, 70%of this global demographic stated in a recent surveythat they wanted to launch their own companies. 10 Finally, the economic pressures from a recessionaryeconomy and shrinking horse industry were thoughtto possibly be driving this trend, with formerly 2 to3 veterinarian practices shrinking to solo practices.This survey aimed in part to determine which ofthese factors were signicant in the suggestedincrease. However, an examination of 6 AAEP annual re- ports revealed that the percentage of solo practiceshas stayed fairly constant over the last 7 years(37%-39%), reliably making up about 71% of allpractice owners. Thus, although solo practiceclearly makes up most private practices, the data donot indicate a change in prevalence (Fig. 12). 11 In view of the difcult environment, this survey also sought to identify the areas of practice thatcontributed most to the stress experienced by allequine veterinarians. By examining many differ-ent factors that are a part of life as an equine prac-titioner, strategies for mitigating stress couldpotentially be identied from the results of the sur-vey. Several broad themes emerged from the re-sults: the importance of practice culture, theimportance of control and choice, and the degree ofstress in the profession. Practice Culture Because there are clear advantages to group prac-tice such as economies of scale, shared responsibili-ties, and professional support, this survey sought tounderstand the reasons that so many equine veter-inarians choose to practice alone. Many veterinar-ians made that choice at the beginning of theircareers; 24.6% of survey respondents had neverworked in any practice other than their own, exceptfor an internship. According to survey results, theymade this choice to ensure they could be in control of AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 403THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESStheir work environment\u2014to be able to make their own clinical choices, manage their own work sched-ule, and essentially create their own culture. Theremaining solo practitioners who responded to thesurvey had left a group practice, and practice cul-ture was the primary reason given that drove thesedoctors to depart. Associate respondents employedat both small- and large-group practices valuedpractice culture as highly as compensation in deter-mining their satisfaction with their position. Un-fortunately, many of the practices where theyworked did not provide a culture that satised them.Practice owners may not have sufcient insight or\"very satised\" with the culture of their practices. Practice culture is extraordinarily important, an idea that is supported by the responses to this sur-vey. According to the HR Insights blog, \"Culture isthe character and personality of your organization.It's what makes your organization unique and is thesum of its values, traditions, beliefs, interactions,behaviors, and attitudes.\" 12Because equine veteri- narians spend so much more of their time workingthan they do with their families, they need that time to be meaningful, enjoyable, and productive. This is often more important than the money theyearn. \"Workplace culture drives employee loy-alty. It is easier to attract and retain the bestemployees when an organization has a dynamic,thriving culture where employees feel valued andenjoy their work. In addition, their perceptionsof the workplace may influence the public reputa-tion of the organization.\" 13 Leadership is the essential foundation of culture. Practice owners, for better or worse, are the leadersof the practice, and the behaviors they model becomethe practice culture. If owners communicate poorlyor avoid conflict, culture suffers. If long hours andrevenue production are the only traits valued highlybut have no connection to protability and clientsatisfaction, the culture will reflect this. \"Culturein the workplace involves a system of behaviors,beliefs, attitudes and values. It develops over timeand is passed on from one generation of workers tothe next. It is also a reflection of what organiza-tional leadership values.\" 13 When leaders cannot make decisions or are fre- quently absent, the culture is often driven by bu-reaucracy and detailed procedures or converselylurches reactively from crisis to crisis because em-ployees have little or no understanding of how theirwork ts into the overall goals of the organization.In practices like this, team members tend to work inisolated silos, and there is little collaboration orcooperation. When a practice's team understandsthe shared objectives, the leaders are decisive andinclusive, and employees understand their roles andare engaged in the work, the organization has astrong culture. These rms typically reach theirstrategic objectives, retain staff, and enjoy greater satisfaction in the work. Control and Choice It is no secret that many equine veterinarians areconsidered as being Type As, workaholics, and con-trol freaks. However, although many personalitytraits are innate, most researchers now believe thatType A personality characteristics are more of areaction to environmental factors and are influencedby culture and job structure. These include jobsthat put heavy demands on time and penalties onmistakes, create stress, or attract people with a nat-ural tendency toward being more intense andachievement-oriented. 14 Each different cohort in this survey favored re- sponses that maximized their control of their prac-tice experience. Having the ability to make theirown decisions about how to practice clinically wasvalued highly by solos, associates, and owners.Most respondents were satised by their actual ex-perience in this regard. It seems that most veteri-nary practices have wide leeway in allowing theirdoctors to practice as they see t. Although thisdrives satisfaction, it may detract from forming astrong practice brand equity if a wide diversity ofapproaches to clinical problems exists among staffdoctors. According to a study published in Psychological Science, 15both having power over others and having choices in your own life are about the basic need forcontrol. The study found that people are willing totrade one source of control for the other. For exam-ple, if people lack power, they clamor for choice, andif they have an abundance of choice they do notstrive as much for power. Equally, if people aredenied choice, they hunger more for power. In sum-mary, while people can accept their lot if they haveeither power or choice, they become discontent whenthey have neither. Management decisions were cited by associate survey respondents as the source of extreme stressmore than any other stressor. Allowing associatesas much choice as possible, and including them indecision making, can help them feel more positiveabout their job and responsibilities. Younger veterinarian respondents expressed a higher importance on the need for flexibility for fam-ily responsibilities in the survey than older-genera-tion veterinarians, possibly because of their lifestage. Although certainly more females graduatedthan males between 2004 and 2014, possibly skew-ing the results, when looking at the responses ofmales versus females across all graduation years,just a third of all men attached strong importance tofamily time compared with almost half of all women.This gender difference will increasingly affect theprofession. The top regret cited by veterinarians in a survey published by dvm360 magazine in May 2015 was not having enough time for personal life and family. 16 404 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESSHaving the control to make choices about how to spend their time is a key factor in the happiness ofmost people, and the responses to this survey indi-cated that many respondents felt dissatised in thisregard. These ndings are in alignment with otherbroader studies. For example, a global generationssurvey of nearly 10,000 workers worldwide con-ducted by Ernst & Young revealed that close to 80%of Millennial and 73% of Generation X workers sur-veyed were part of dual-income couples in whichboth work full-time. In contrast, just 47% of thebaby-boomer respondents have a full-time workingspouse. The study points out the following: More than a quarter of baby-boomer workers have a spouse at home, or one who works part time or with flexible hours and is responsible fortaking care of all home-front duties. Millennialworkers, the group that companies say they arescrambling to attract and retain, are the mostdissatised. Survey after survey, including theEY one, show that what millennials most wantis flexibility in where, when and how theywork. Millennials were most likely in the sur-vey to say that they would take a pay cut, forgo apromotion or be willing to move to manage work-life demands better. 17 The lives of equine veterinarians often lack bal- ance. AAEP listserv member survey respondents working in both small- and large-group practicescited life balance as the aspect of their position thatmade them the most dissatised. Small-practiceassociates next cited the time requirements of prac-tice, whereas large-practice associates next citedpractice culture. Difculty in achieving balance of-ten relates to the demands of equine practice withits seasonality, the need to provide emergency ser-vices, and the pervasive culture of not establishingboundaries on work hours or days. Horse ownersor others in the equine industry have responsibilityfor horses 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days ayear, and they expect no less of a commitment fromtheir healthcare providers. These factors can fuel asense that control is not attainable. According to G.Croston. . . A persistent lack of control in a person's life often leads to depression and anxiety. Anything that makes us feel helpless and lacking funda-mental control over our surroundings can have alasting impact. Gaining more control of our sur-roundings, on the other hand, makes us morecontent and less at risk. Our need for controlmay help us to protect ourselves, operating as asurvival mechanism. A great deal of our techno-logical progress might be thought of as an expres-sion of our need to gain more control over ourworld and our lives. 18 Veterinarians are often seriously affected by the lack of control in their lives. More than 10% ofpractitioners reported having serious psychological distress in a recent study, and 1 in 6 veterinarianshave considered suicide since graduating from vet-erinary school. 19,20The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Weekly Morbidity and MortalityReport caused a stir in February 2015 when it re-ported the following: Since graduating from veterinary school, 24.5% and 36.7% of male and female respondents re- ported experiencing depressive episodes, respec-tively, 14.4% and 19.1% suicidal ideation, and1.1% and 1.4% suicide attempts. In comparison,male and female U.S. adults had a lower lifetimeprevalence of depressive episodes (15.1% and22.9%, respectively) and suicidal ideation (5.1%and 7.1%) but a higher prevalence of suicide at-tempts (1.6% and 3%). 20 Mitigating the stress caused by the often- thwarted need for control lies in having choices. Leading by example, owners should engage in col-laborative decision making whenever possible,provide flexible scheduling, minimize competitionamong doctors, and foster a culture that embraces abalanced life. Stress There are many pressing concerns and sources ofstress for practitioners related to their business andprofessional lives. Of the multiple stressors listedin the survey questions, it is notable that only choos-ing professional advisors and professional interac-tions had less than 50% of respondents reportingassociated stress. Most of the other aspects of prac-ticing and operating a business were consideredstressful by robust majorities. Some of the factorsreported to be most stressful were those related tolack of control and choice or to practice culture.A strong linkage exists among these themes. With new graduates' substantial loans, nancial stress is inevitable. When asked about how satis-ed they were with their compensation, only 20.8%of female survey respondents were satised, com-pared with 33.3% of males. This is not unexpectedfor several reasons. The AVMA 2015 report on vet-erinary markets revealed that female graduateshave lower starting salaries and higher debt thanmale graduates. 21This may result from endemic pay disparities between males and females. The In-stitutes for Women's Policy Research reports thefollowing: Women are almost half of the work- force. They are the equal, if not main, breadwin- ner in four out of ten families. They receivemore college and graduate degrees thanmen. Yet, on average, women continue to earnconsiderably less than men. In 2013, femalefull-time workers made only 78 cents for everydollar earned by men, a gender wage gap of 22percent. Women, on average, earn less than AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 405THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY - THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESSmen in virtually every single occupation for which there is sufcient earnings data for bothmen and women to calculate an earnings ratio. 22 In equine veterinary medicine, data show that most women desire to work 10 fewer hours a week,whereas men are equally divided between wantingto work 10 fewer hours or 10 more, which may be afactor in salaries. 23 Most solo and group practice owners who re- sponded to the survey indicated they experiencedstress in most aspects of running their business,with nancial aspects concerning nearly all respon-dents. In addition, communication, negotiation,and conflict resolution were important sources ofongoing worry. Solo practitioners were more likelyto struggle with client communication, whereasgroup practice owners had more difculty with as-pects of managing staff. Learning more abouteffective business practices and developing newcommunication skills could mitigate some of thestress that practice owners experience. 5. Conclusion The information gained by this study is importantbecause all stakeholders in the equine veterinaryindustry are affected by the current environment.Sole proprietors may benet from collaborative ef-forts with other local solo practices to share emer-gency coverage as well as provide relief coverage forillness, family time, vacation, and maternity leave.Existing group practices will compete for market sharewith emerging solo practices and would be wise todetermine how to ll unmet needs of horse owners whoare outside of the offerings of solo practices (e.g., emer-gency services or services that require a signicantinvestment in technology). Aging practice ownersmay be unable to harvest value from their practices forretirement if they are unable to attract and retainassociates willing and able to purchase ownershipshares. To address the dissatisfaction with employ-ment experiences that emerged in the survey, practiceowners will need to alter their approach to managingassociate veterinarians to retain them. Industrypartners (providers of pharmaceuticals, medical sup-plies, and equipment) have a vested interest in thesustainability of healthy practices to retain customersto purchase their product lines; these companies areincreasingly investing in collaborative efforts withbusiness consultants to educate practice owners withthe goal of boosting protability (and long-term suc-cess) of practices. Because of the unique challenges facing the equine industry, emotions surrounding the issuescan be strong. New graduates with high educa-tional debt and limited employment opportunitiesexperience high stress, as do older practitioners whoare unable to sell their largest asset on which theyhad depended for retirement funds. Stress canspawn bitterness and strife among generations.It is in the best interest of all practitioners to worktogether toward the common goal of a strong equineveterinary profession. This survey has elucidatedcommon themes that, if addressed, can signicantlyimprove the experience of equine practice.

Introduction Abnormalities of the upper airway (UA) are fre- quently implicated as a cause of poor performance,exercise intolerance, or abnormal respiratory noisein the equine. 1-3Common abnormalities involving the dynamic larynx collapse associated withpoll flexion can affect multiple regions of the larynxand pharynx. Resting UA endoscopy is widely available and is often the rst diagnostic tool used in evaluation of UA abnormalities. In many cases, resting endos-copy is sufcient for diagnosis. However, dynamicevaluation, either using a treadmill or a portableover ground videoendoscopy system, is considered toprovide a more accurate diagnosis than does restingendoscopy. 4-6Unfortunately, dynamic UA exami- nation requires specialized equipment that may notbe available locally, may be cost prohibitive for someclients, and may not be appropriate for some horses.In addition, some UA abnormalities cannot be fullyassessed using UA endoscopy. Laryngeal ultrasonography, rst described by Chalmers et al, 7is a relatively new addition to the diagnostic repertoire for UA disorders. It hasproven to be useful clinically in the diagnosis of many conditions of the UA, especially for disor-ders resulting in abnormal can be especially helpful in cases where adynamic examination cannot be performed. An appreciation of the pathologic changes that occur in diseases of the UA is helpful in understand-ing the ultrasonographic changes that accompanyeach disease. Recurrent laryngeal sults in denervation atrophy subsequent loss of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles innervatedby the condition manifests itself as decreased or absent arytenoidabduction and affects the left arytenoid more com-monly than the right arytenoid. 4Denervated muscle has a characteristic ultrasonographic appear-ance; the muscle becomes hyperechoic to normal mus- cle and has a more homogeneous appearance with aloss of the normal striated pattern. 13-15These changes have been observed ultrasonographically in the CALM and CADM of horses with treadmill UAendoscopy-conrmed recurrent laryngealneuropathy. 8,10 precise etiology of arytenoid chondritis re- mains unclear, but likely results from local trauma to and subsequent bacterial infection of the arytenoid cartilage.16Some horses may have granulomas only on the axial surface of the arytenoid cartilage, whereasthe pathology may progress to involve the entire ary-tenoid cartilage in other horses. In more severecases, the arytenoid becomes thickened with irregularmargins and has impaired which may beappreciated endoscopically. 17The of aryte- noid cartilage thickening, echogenicity typical of this disease has beenimaged using ultrasonography. 7 A congenital defect known as laryngeal dysplasia (also known as fourth branchial arch defect) maycause abnormal arytenoid movement of either the leftor right arytenoid cartilage. 18,19Horses with this con- dition may also have constant or intermittent rostraldisplacement of the palatopharyngeal arch during UAendoscopy or dorsal displacement of the soft palate. 9,20 Horses with laryngeal dysplasia have characteristic anatomic abnormalities, including lack of a cricothy-roid articulation and extension of the thyroid laminadorsal to the muscular process of the arytenoid carti-lage and they may have pharyngeal muscle abnormal-ities as well. 19-21The ultrasonographic appearance of these anatomic features has been described.9 The pathophysiology of DDSP has not been fully elucidated, but may involve an inability to maintaina rostral position of the larynx. 22Interestingly, a change in the position of the basihyoid bone after surgical treatment (laryngeal tie-forward) is associ-ated with an increased likelihood of racing postopera-tively. 23This nding prompted initial investigation into an ultrasonographic marker for DDSP which hasshown that horses with DDSP had a smaller averagedistance between the skin and the basihyoid bone thandid horses without DDSP. 24However, the difference in this measurement between horses with and withoutDDSP was less than 2 mm, limiting its use in clinicalsituations. The etiology of other UA disorders, including pha- ryngeal collapse, billowing of the soft palate, epiglot-tic retroversion, laryngeal collapse associated withflexed head position, and folds, 16,25No char- acteristic ultrasonographic ndings of these disor-ders have been described. The purpose of this paper is to provide the prac- titioner with instruction on how to perform a laryn-geal ultrasonographic examination and incorporatethis tool it into his or her evaluation of the UA. 2. Materials and Methods Horses are prepared for the examination by sedationwith xylazine hydrochloride (0.4 mg/kg IV). Mosthorses do not need to have the laryngeal regionclipped prior to examination, but if the coat is coarseor thick, clipping will improve image quality. Thehead is held in an extended position by a handler ora stand to move the laryngeal region caudally inrelation to the mandible. A linear or curvilineartransducer can be used for the examination. A fre-quency of 8 to 10 MHz typically provides adequatepenetration while preserving resolution. Examination of the lateral portion of the larynx can be performed in the dorsal and transverse planes.In the dorsal plane, an initial image of the superciallypositioned thyroid cartilage, the cricoid cartilage cau-dal to the thyroid cartilage, and the arytenoid cartilagedeep to the thyroid cartilage can be obtained (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. A, Dorsal plane ultrasound image of the lateral aspect of a normal larynx. B, Transducer position. Note the position of theCALM and vocalis muscle (small arrowheads) between the thyroidcartilage (small arrows) and the arytenoid cartilage (large arrow-head). The cricoid cartilage (large arrow) is caudal to the thyroidcartilage. Rostral is to the left of the image and caudal is to theright of the image. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H114082015 FIELD IMAGINGThe CALM are between the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages and the cricothyroi-deus muscle is imaged between the thyroid and cricoidcartilages. By moving the transducer slightly dor-sally, one can image the cricothyroid articulation,formed by the caudal cornu of the thyroid cartilage andthe articular process of the cricoid cartilage (Fig. 2).Mineralization of the caudal cornu of the thyroid car-tilage is common, but this does not seem to be clinicallysignicant. From the cricothyroid articulation, thetransducer is moved dorsally and angled slightly ven-trally. In this location, one can image the cricoaryte-noid articulation between the muscular process of thearytenoid cartilage and the dorsal cricoid cartilage.The lateral portion of the CADM may be evaluated aswell (Fig. 3). The lateral aspect of the larynx is also evaluated in the transverse plane. The initial image obtainedis the supercially positioned thyroid lamina withthe arytenoid cartilage deep to the thyroid laminaand the CALM and vocalis muscle between the thy-roid and cricoid cartilages (Fig. 4). In some horses,the vocalis muscle is imaged distinctly from theCALM, but in others, the distinction between thetwo muscles cannot be dened. If the transducer the cartilage are imaged. The ventral portion of the larynx can be examined in transverse and median planes. In a transverseplane, the tracheal rings can serve as a referencepoint. From the tracheal rings, as the transducer ismoved rostrally, the ventral aspect of the cricoidcartilage is identied (Fig. 5), followed by the thy-roid cartilage. Deep to the thyroid cartilage, thevocal folds may be imaged and their movements canbe observed (Fig. 6). The mineralized rostral as-pect of the ventral thyroid cartilage is encounterednext. Between the thyroid cartilage and the basi-hyoid bone, the thyrohyoid bones may be imagedlaterally. The basihyoid bone appears as a horizon-tal line (Fig. 7), and if the transducer is angledrostrally from this position, the ceratohyoid bonesare imaged. moving the transducer rostrally,the lingual process the basihyoid bone is imaged.The depth of the basihyoid bone can be measuredat the junction between the lingual process and thebody of the basihyoid bone.

The ventral aspect of the cricoidand tracheal rings can also be imaged. In general, the overall symmetry of the laryngeal cartilages and associated musculature should beevaluated. smoothly mar-ginated echogenicity, althoughmineralization of the thyroid and arytenoid carti-lages is fairly common (Fig. 8), especially in olderhorses. The muscles normally have heterogeneousechogenicity and have a striated pattern in a longi-tudinal view. 3. Results Uses of have been recent veterinary literature. Comparison of the relative echogenicity of the left and right CALM, vocalis muscle, and CADM enablesthe practitioner to assess whether the musculaturehas the hyperechogenicity characteristic of denerva-tion atrophy of recurrent laryngeal neuropathy.Ultrasound machine settings should be kept con-stant between left and right sides of the larynx, andimages should be evaluated in dorsal and transverseplanes. Side-by-side comparison is often useful(Fig. 9). It should be borne in mind that manyfactors will contribute to the ultrasonographic ap-pearance of the muscles, so comparison within ahorse is preferable to comparison between horses.In one study comparing subjective laryngeal ultra-sonography to results of dynamic endoscopy, ultra-sound had a sensitivity of 90% and a specicity of98% for an overall accuracy of 96% at predictingwhich horses would have abnormal arytenoid carti-lage movement during exercise. 10Another study yielded similar results with a sensitivity and spec-icity of 95% for subjective comparison of muscu-lature echogenicity and additionally showed thatquantitative comparison of muscle echogenicitydiffered between different grades of arytenoidmovement. 26 Fig. 4.

The arytenoid cartilage has a trum-pet bell shape and the CALM and vocalis muscles have a striatedappearance with heterogeneous echogenicity.

The arytenoid cartilages should have a trumpet bell shape with smooth mar-gins. Horses with chondritis have irregularity ofthe axial and abaxial margins with thickening of thecartilage and abnormal echogenicity within the ar-ytenoid cartilage compared with normal arytenoidcartilages (Fig. 10). 27Horses may have only a granuloma or chondroma on the axial surface of thearytenoid cartilage diffuse arytenoid chon-dritis. Ultrasonographically, this manifests as fo-cal irregularity of the margin and a smoothabaxial margin and normal arytenoid cartilagewidth. The anatomic abnormalities characteristic of la- ryngeal dysplasia can also be observed. The exten-sion of the thyroid cartilage dorsal to the muscularprocess of the arytenoid cartilage can best be imagedin the transverse plane (Fig. 11), whereas the lack ofa cricothyroid articulation is best imaged in the dor- Fig. 6.

In these horses, the relation- ship between the thyroid cartilage, CALM, andarytenoid cartilage is abnormal; the CALM is oftenpositioned caudal to the thyroid cartilage in the gapbetween the thyroid cartilage and the cricoidcartilage. 9 Other more unusual anatomic malformations have been diagnosed in individual cases. One foalwith abnormal UA noise and exercise intolerancehad cyst-like structures in the thyroid, arytenoid,and cricoid cartilages as well as the rst trachealring. 28An adult horse with DDSP was found to vocalismuscle. 4. Discussion Ultrasonography of the laryngeal region can be per-formed easily in an ambulatory or hospital setting,is a noninvasive and safe procedure, and requires nospecialized equipment beyond an ultrasound ma-chine with a linear or curvilinear transducer. Clip-ping of the hair is not required and light sedation isgenerally sufcient to ensure patient compliance, soclient and patient acceptance of the procedure havebeen excellent. Currently, ultrasonography of the larynx is an excellent tool for investigation of the reason for ab-normal arytenoid movement, as the cause may bedifcult to determine with resting UA endoscopyalone. Evidence of hyperechogenicity of the leftCALM, vocalis muscle, and CADM would support adiagnosis of left recurrent laryngeal neuropathy as acause of poor performance or abnormal UA noise.In cases of arytenoid chondritis, ultrasonographypermits imaging of nearly the entire arytenoid car- Fig. 9.

This has allowed us to assess the extent of disease in the cartilage, diagnose any associatedabscesses or perilaryngeal inflammation, and moni-tor response to treatment. In some of the cases inthis report presented for evaluation of suspectedarytenoid chondritis, the ultrasonographic ndingsdid not support a diagnosis of arytenoid chondritis,leading to additional investigation and revision ofthe involvingthe laryngeal cartilages can be imaged of inferred from UA endoscopicabnormalities. In the author's practice, ultrasonography of the larynx has been incorporated as a routine procedurefor investigation of UA disorders, as it contributes toa more thorough evaluation of the UA. Endoscopyis an excellent tool for assessment of laryngeal func-tion and abnormalities visible at the luminal aspectof the larynx, but ultrasonography allows more com-plete examination andassociated musculature, structures which were pre-viously difcult to evaluate. In addition, ultra-sonography can be useful in evaluation of poorperformance or abnormal UA noise in cases where adynamic UA examination is not feasible (due toavailability, nancial or liability concerns, concur-rent lameness, or other factors). Hopefully, futurework will expand the uses of laryngeal ultrasonog-raphy for a variety of UA conditions.

Introduction The availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has increased greatly over the past 10 years.This has led to tremendous advances in our abilityto make more accurate and/or specic diagnoses in avariety of body regions. For the practitioner, it isimportant to understand different types of MRIscanners to appropriately refer cases. Multiple types of MRI scanners are currently on the market\u2014all with advantages and disadvan-tages. High-eld (1.5 T) scanners were the rst tocome into clinical use for horses. High-eld scan-ners require general anesthesia and specializednonferrous anesthetic equipment. However, theyallow for higher-resolution images, thinner slices, larger elds of view, and faster scan times. Low-eld (typically 0.3 T) scanners are available in bothrecumbent and standing designs. The recumbentdesign requires general anesthesia, whereas thestanding design can be used in a standing, sedatedhorse or can be rotated for use on an anesthetizedhorse. Low-eld scanners generally have lower-resolution images, thicker slices, smaller elds ofview, and longer scan times. The standing designis also prone to artifacts from motion that worsen asthe scan region moves proximally from the foot.It is important to keep all of these factors in mindwhen choosing where to refer a case, as some cases are better served with one design over another. Image quality is generally superior using high- eld MRI. Increased magnet strength permits theuse of thinner slices and higher resolution comparedwith low-eld MRI, which aids in identifying carti-lage pathology. 1Oftentimes, short tau inversion recovery sequences can be extremely useful in diag-nosing bony lesions, but these sequences are verysensitive to motion and may be nondiagnostic insome standing horses. Other work has shown thateven in cadaver limbs, high-eld images are supe-rior at detecting pathology compared with low-eldimages. 2 Because MRI scans of a unilateral region typically take approximately 45 to 60 minutes, it is very im-portant to attempt to localize the area of lamenessas specically as possible. This generally involvesperineural and intra-articular tunately, especially in the case perineural anes-thesia, we have learned that anesthetic agents canmigrate over a great distance, leading to a lack ofspecicity. For example, a palmar digital nerveblock can migrate as far proximally as the fetlockregion. 3For this reason, when MRI operators scan a horse that has blocked to a palmar digital nerveblock, they always include at least one sequence that 416 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD IMAGING NOTESincludes the pastern the fetlock to the level of the proximal sesamoid bones. In some cases, thefoot is relatively normal, but the primary lesion in-volves the pastern region. The eld of view and coildesign of a high-eld scanner permit imaging thepastern region without repositioning the horse orthe coil or performing additional localizer sequences,making inclusion of this region convenient for theoperator. Unfortunately, the standing MRI designrequires that the coil and magnet be repositionedwith new localizer sequences to obtain images of thepastern region, and these tasks can be time-consum-ing. The superior image quality of the high-eldimages also allows the interpreter of the images tobe more condent of what the primary source oflameness may be. It has been shown that signicant diffusion of contrast material occurs after instillation at thebase of the proximal sesamoid bones. 4In the au- thor's opinion, if a horse has blocked to an abaxialsesamoid nerve block without a peritoneal dialysisperformed previously, the lesion could be located inthe foot, pastern, fetlock, or distal metacarpal re-gion. This is a large area to image in a practicalsense, so in this case the author encourages reblock-ing the horse more specically. If repeating thelameness examination with different blocks is notpossible, high-eld scanners can accommodate im-aging the foot, pastern, and fetlock regions withmuch less difculty than in a standing design, wheremultiple repositionings of equipment are necessary.Additionally, in a standing design, horse compliancemay become an issue with a three-region scan, es-pecially if bilateral images are obtained. It has alsobeen shown that anesthesia of the proximal meta-carpal/tarsal region can anesthetize the distal car-pal and tarsal regions and vice versa. 5-7For that reason, when operators scan a carpus or tarsus, theyinclude the proximal metacarpal/metatarsal region;when scanning tarsometatarsal and distal intertarsaljoints. Proximal regions of the limb are very proneto motion in a standing design, and the eld of viewoften does not permit including both regions in thesame sequence without repositioning. We have found high-eld MRI to be extremely useful in cases of orthopedic sepsis that are notresponding to treatment as would be expected. 8 Areas of osteomyelitis, physitis, or bony necrosis are readily identied. In smaller foals, areas as proxi-mal as the pelvis and axial spine can be imagedusing recumbent designs, which is helpful becauseradiography and ultrasonography of these areas aremore challenging. Standing MRI is generally notfeasible in these cases, because it may be too painfulfor the horse to bear weight and remain motionlessfor the time required to obtain the images. Although high-eld MRI is not always an option or indicated for every case, there are many situa-tions in which it provides valuable or vital informa-tion beyond what can be obtained from standinglow-eld MRI.

Introduction The rst standing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unit was installed in 2002 at the Bell EquineVeterinary Clinic in Kent, England. Since thattime, some additional 70/H11001 units have been installed throughout the world, with 22 units currently oper-ational in the United States and Canada. 1MRI offers the unique benet of simultaneous imaging ofboth soft tissue and bony structures in a single com-prehensive evaluation. The usefulness of MRI inachieving a diagnosis in equine lameness cases iswell documented 2,3and has been presented at mul- tiple multinational professional veterinary confer-ences. 4,5Prior to being referred for a standing MRI evaluation, horses will usually have been thor-oughly worked up with multiple comprehensivelameness evaluations with peripheral nerve anesthesia and/or intra-articular anesthesiaand radiographs, ultrasounds, and/or nuclear scin-tigraphies. As a result of the information gatheredfrom these procedures, it is not uncommon for ahorse to be referred with a provisional diagnosis.In these situations, the provisional diagnosis has been relayed, and the intention of the standing MRIevaluation is to conrm this diagnosis and rule out other less obvious areas of potential injury. Thisarticle presents three cases in which standing MRIwas intended to conrm a working diagnosis butinstead gave altogether unexpected results. 2. Materials and Methods For all cases outlined in the following sections, MRIevaluation was performed using a 0.27 Tesla stand-ing unit a. Additional imaging, including radiogra- phy and ultrasonography, was completed usingvarious units by the referring veterinarians. Theisocenter of the magnet for imaging the equine footwas focused over the distal dorsal edge of the navic-ular bone (Fig. 1), and a standard \"foot protocol\" wasused that consisted of the following sequence typesand associated slice positioning: T1-weighted (W)3-dimensional (3D) gradient echo planes: frontal, sagittal, and transverseat an angle perpendicular par- allel to the ground, perpendicular to the DDFTproximal to the navicular bone, and FSEsequences (imaging planes: sagittal and trans-verse at angles parallel to the ground, perpendicularto the DDFT proximal to the navicular bone, dense-weighted(PDW) (SE) (imaging plane:transverse at an angle perpendicular to the DDFTproximal to the navicular bone; Fig. 2).The isocenter of the magnet for imaging all metacarpo/metatarsophalangeal joints was focusedover the middle of the metacarpo/metatarsophalan-geal joint (Fig. 4), and a standard \"fetlock protocol\"was used that consisted of the following sequencetypes and associated slice positioning: T1W GE se-quences (imaging planes: sagittal, frontal, andtransverse at angles parallel to to scan.

All horses were sedated using an initial loading dose of detomidine hydrochloride (HDL; 3-5 mg IV). Oncean adequate level of sedation had been achieved, aconsistent sedation level was maintained using asmaller dose of detomidine HCL (1-2 mg IV) every 10minutes all sequences Equine Diagnostic Im-aging, Gainesville, Florida. Case 1 A 2011 Thoroughbred gelding used as a flat race-horse presented with an acute right hind (RH) lame-ness (3.5/5 in accordance with guide-lines for grading lameness). At the time of initialevaluation, lameness was localized to the distallimb using abaxial sesamoid peripheral nerve anes-thesia. Radiographs of the RH foot were taken, andthere appeared to be a fracture of the lateral plantarprocess of the distal phalanx (Fig. 6). The horsewas seen 3 days later and was noted to be non-weight-bearing lame on the RH. Anesthesia of thelateral plantar digital nerve improved the lamenessto the extent that the horse would weight-bear onthe RH, but he was still noted to be 2/5 lame on theRH at the trot. The horse was referred for a stand-ing MRI of the RH to conrm the diagnosis of afracture of the lateral plantar process of the distalphalanx and to identify any associated soft tissueinjury.Per standard protocol, a complete MR evaluation of the RH was completed as previously described.In addition to the standard sequences and imagingplanes, the magnet was also lowered and moveddorsally so that the isocenter was positioned overthe distal aspect of the extensor process of the distalphalanx. The change in the magnet position wasdone to achieve appropriate fat suppression in thedistal phalanx in STIR sequences and therefore toidentify areas with potential abnormal fluid, aswould be expected with a fracture of the lateralplantar process of the distal phalanx. There wereno appreciable abnormalities identied in either thedistal phalanx or the associated soft tissue struc-tures. Given the initial blocking pattern and lackof any appreciable abnormalities in the distal andmiddle phalanges, the magnet was again reposi-tioned with the isocenter over the metatarsophalan-geal joint. An incomplete, midline sagittal fracturein the proximal phalanx was immediately identi-able (Figs. 7 and 8). 6After the MRI evaluation, radiographs were taken by the referring veterinar-ian, and the fracture was evident radiographically(Fig. 9). As a side note, there was no appreciablemetatarsophalangeal joint effusion appreciableupon physical examination before, during, or afterthe MRI evaluation. Case 2 A 2005 Connemara gelding used for dressage hadbeen lame in the left front for approximately 1 year.Over the course of that year the horse was seen bymultiple veterinarians and received a multitude oftreatments, including but not limited to intra-artic-ular therapy of the front distal interphalangeal,front proximal interphalangeal, and distal limbwith tiludronate disodium and corrective shoeing.These different therapies had varying degrees ofsuccess in resolving the left front lameness.

This horse wasnoted to be sound when trotted in hand but 1/5 lameon the left front under tack when trotted to the left.There was also some lameness noted in the rightfront when trotted under tack to the right, but thislameness improved readily. Anesthesia of the lat-eral and medial palmar digital nerves of the leftfront partially improved the lameness to the left andexacerbated the right front lameness on a circle tothe right. A mid-pastern ring block of the left frontabolished the left front lameness. No further block-ing was done of the right front limb to further char-acterize that lameness.Radiographs of the right front foot and pastern were unremarkable, and radiographs of the leftfront foot and pastern indicated mild remodeling ofthe dorsolateral aspect of the left front middle pha-lanx at the joint capsule insertion. Radiographs ofthe left metacarpophalangeal joint were unremark-able; those of the right indicated a small osteochon-dral fragment associated with the dorsomedialaspect of the proximal phalanx. An ultrasoundevaluation of the left front pastern indicated a subtleenlargement of the proximal and lateral aspects ofthe left front straight distal sesamoidean ligamentwith subtle ber disruption proximally (Fig. 10). 7 An MRI evaluation was requested to conrm desmi-tis of the left front straight distal sesamoidean lig- Fig. 7.

Per standard protocol, a complete MRI evaluation of the left front foot was completed as previouslydescribed. In addition, given the blocking patternand ultrasound ndings, the magnet was raised toposition the isocenter over the left metacarpopha-langeal joint. An MRI of the distal limb indicatedmultiple signicant ndings, including but not lim-ited to mild-to-moderate fluid in the navicular boneand asymmetry in the shape of the navicular boneflexor surface. The straight distal sesamoidean lig-ament was noted to appear mildly abnormal in thestudy, with no additional areas of abnormality de-tected outside of those already identied with ultra-sonography. However, this mild abnormality wasnot indicated as the most signicant nding the metacarpophalangeal joint. Instead,the level joint arthrosis character-ized by mild enthesiophyte formation associatedwith the joint capsule attachment (Fig. 11) and focalsclerosis of the distal medial third metacarpal boneand proximal phalanx (Fig. 12). 8As mentioned previously, radiographs of the left front metacarpo-phalangeal joint were unremarkable (Fig. 13). Case 3 A 2009 Hanoverian gelding was noted to be acutelyunsound (2/5 in accordance with the AAEP guide-lines for grading lameness) on the left front was localized to the distal limb usingabaxial sesamoid peripheral nerve anesthesia.Radiographs of the left front foot were judged to bewithin normal limits. At the time of the initialevaluation, the referring veterinarian discussedwith the owner the merits of returning for additionalperipheral nerve diagnostic anesthesia to furtherlocalize the lameness and that a standing MRI eval-uation may be necessary because a soft tissue injuryof the foot was likely given the negative radiographicndings. Believing that the lameness resultedfrom soft tissue injury, the owner declined any fur-ther workup and after some independent Internetresearch elected to place the horse on strict stall restwith minimal hand grazing. Approximately 6weeks later, the owner then elected to send thehorse in for a standing MRI evaluation of the leftfront foot without consulting the veterinarian thatinitially evaluated the horse. Because the ownerwas convinced the horse had sustained a soft tissueinjury in its foot, the MRI evaluation was requested Fig. 11. T1W GE frontal.

Lateral-to-medial digital radiograph of the left frontmetacarpophalangeal PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD IMAGINGto characterize this presumptive soft tissue injury and to determine whether the horse was ready tobegin a controlled return-to-work program. Per standard protocol, a complete MRI evaluation of the left front foot was completed as previouslydescribed. A complete short transverse fracture atthe junction between the ossied ungual (collateral)cartilage and the medial palmar process of the distalphalanx and extending into the palmar process wasidentied (Fig. 14). 9Ossication of the ungual car- tilages is not an uncommon nding in routine footradiographs; however, it is often impossible to dis-cern whether the mineralization is normal or abnor-mal. As has been discussed in the literature,ossication of the ungual cartilages can lead to afracture of the palmar process of the distal phalanx,as demonstrated in this case. 10Given the location of this fracture, it is in the author's opinion veryeasily missed in standard radiographic views of thedistal phalanx. A review of the radiographs takenby the veterinarian who initially evaluated thishorse did not give any indication of a fracture.Given the information from the MRI evaluation,adjusting the dorsal ventral 75\u00b0dorsal ventral was effective in highlighting the frac-ture (Fig. 15). 3. Discussion As previously stated, most equine lameness casesthat are referred for standing MR evaluation havebeen worked up extensively, and there is often apresumptive or working diagnosis at the time ofreferral. Case 1 is an example whereby the work-ing diagnosis was disproven and a different pathol-ogy was identied and shown to be the underlyingcause of the lameness. The blocking pattern andsuspicious radiographs led in this case to a workingdiagnosis of a fracture of the lateral plantar processof the distal phalanx when in fact there was anincomplete midsagittal fracture of the proximal pha-lanx. Additionally, this case demonstrates the po-tential for perineural anesthesia to eliminate painassociated with structures well proximal to the areaintended to be desensitized. 11,12 Case 2 is an example often experienced by many veterinarians when they refer cases for MRI evalu-ation. In this case, there were additional patholo-gies identied in the MRI study that were outside ofthe working diagnosis and that could have contrib-uted to the lameness. As such, these additionalpathologies will often require additional clinical cor-relation such as additional perineural or intra-artic-ular therapy and/or response to therapeuticintervention to determine their clinical relevance.In case 2, the working diagnosis was substantiatedin that mild abnormalities in the straight distalsesamoidean ligament initially identied with ultra-sonography were also identied with MR but addi-tional areas of pathology were also identied thatsuggested the need for further clinical correlation. In case 3, there was no working diagnosis to sub- stantiate or disprove because of the owner's noncom-pliance, which is not entirely uncommon in equinepractice because owners often insist on going outsideof their veterinarian's recommendations for addi-tional diagnostics or therapies. And although fur-ther workup may have provided additionalinformation at the time of referral, the use of MRI incase 3, as suggested at the time of initial evaluationby the attending veterinarian, was extremely impor-tant in reaching the ultimate diagnosis of a short,complete transverse fracture of the ossied ungual Fig. 14.

The arrow indicates a complete short trans-verse fracture at the junction between the ossied collateral car-tilage and the medial palmar process the palmar process of the distal phalanx. Although advanced diagnos-tic imaging is not always necessary in achieving anaccurate diagnosis, standing MRI evaluation shouldbe considered as an important additional diagnosticimaging modality in cases where a working diagno-sis has been established, as well as in cases wherethe working diagnosis is unclear and in cases suchas those presented herein where the lameness eval-uation and diagnostic anesthesia are either incon-clusive or inconsistent with the clinical picture.

Introduction Equine upper airway obstructions are a common cause of impaired performance in horses of allbreeds and disciplines. Dynamic obstructions ofthe upper respiratory tract typically occur duringhigh-speed or peak exercise and are often influencedby certain head positions (poll flexion). As a result,these transient events are likely underdiagnosed ormisdiagnosed resting endoscopic examinationalone. 1,2In the past, exercising endoscopic exami- nation of the upper respiratory tract in horses wasonly available via high-speed treadmill examina-tion. Dynamic respiratory endoscopy (DRE), oroverground endoscopy, is a recent technology thathas substantially improved our ability to accuratelydiagnose upper respiratory disorders in horses thatexercise under their normal environmental condi-tions. 3,4DRE is indicated in horses with known or suspected disorders of the upper airway, abnormalnoise production during exercise, exercise intoler-ance, and/or poor performance. 2. Materials and Methods Several exercising endoscopic systems are nowavailable on the equine veterinary market and varysomewhat in their components and attachments tothe horse. However, the basic components of eachsystem consist of an endoscope and light source, arecording/transmitting device, a receiver unit, andpower sources. The detailed description that fol-lows will refer to the dynamic respiratory endoscopicsystem the author has used. Equipment Endoscope The endoscopeaconsists of a 1-meter, 9-millimeter diameter, malleable tube with six light-emitting diodes at the tip. The endoscope possesses adown-tip deflection system (a manual dial thatpermits adjustments in the vertical positioning ofthe endoscope) to ensure appropriate positioningof the endoscope and optimal viewing of upperairway structures. The endoscope is secured tothe via a special-purpose noseband that tsover the horse's bridle (Fig. 1). Mounted Module The endoscope connects to a transmitter/recorder unit that contains a light source, an automatic washsystem for the lens, and a supporting battery powersource. The transmitter/recorder unit is secured tothe horse via one of the following means dependingon the discipline of the horse: (1) a specially designedsaddle pad (sport horses or Thoroughbred racehorses)(Fig. 2) or (2) a specially designed pack (Fig. 3) thatattaches to the shaft of a racing bike or sulky (Stan-dardbred racehorses or miniature horses). Newer AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 425HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD IMAGING NOTESversions of the system have replaced the sulky bag with a specially designed saddle pad for harnesshorses as well as a saddle pad designed for yearlings. The endoscopic video images are recorded contin- uously in a digital format onto a removable securedigital (SD) card and are transmitted in real time toa wireless monitor (Fig. 4). A remote control initi-ates the recording start and stop functions. Theautomatic wash system cleans the lens at regularintervals (every 30 seconds) with an adjustable vol-ume of water. The battery source provides suf-cient power for recording times of at least 45 to 90minutes, with newer systems capable of recordingfor more than 120 minutes. Receiver Unit The receiver unit consists of a handheld, wireless monitor that receives the video signal from thetransmitter unit and allows real-time viewing of thevideo images from up to 600 meters away (Fig. 4).The receiver unit also houses its own supportingbattery power source. Software System A video-processing and exam-reporting software bfa- cilitates review of the recorded examinations. The software allows one to view the recordings at regularspeed or in slow motion and to create still images orshortened video clips. The still pictures and videoclips can be archived into a medical record, incorpo-rated and printed in an exam report, or e-mailed toowners, trainers, and consulting and/or referringveterinarians. Instrumentation of the Horse Instrumentation of the horse with the aforementionedendoscopic system can be safely and efciently per-formed with two people (a horse handler and the vet-erinarian performing the DRE examination). Thehorse is rst equipped with its normal tack and equip-ment in a box stall or barn aisle. The special-purposenoseband is tted and fastened to the horse's head.For riding horses or Thoroughbred racehorses, thededicated saddle pad is positioned securely under thesaddle. For Standardbred or harness horses, thesulky or racing bike is fastened to the horse, and then Fig. 1. Endoscope positioned in left nasal passage and securedto the horse via a special-purpose noseband that ts over thehorse's bridle. Fig. 2. A specially designed saddle pad houses the mounted module for sport horses, riding horses, and/or Thoroughbred racehorses.426 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD IMAGINGthe dedicated pack is placed over the shaft of the sulky or bike and tightly secured to the surcingle. The viewing monitor and recording/transmitting units are turned on, and the recording is started bymeans of the handheld remote control. A nosetwitch is applied to the horse's nose and held inplace by the horse handler. The endoscope ispassed up either nostril of the horse by the DREveterinarian while the positioning of the endoscopein the upper respiratory tract is observed on themonitor. Proper positioning of the endoscope is im-perative for achieving a high-quality diagnostic ex-amination. The endoscope is secured to the horse'shead via the dedicated nose band using elastic bandsor cable ties. The up/down deflection of the endo-scope can be adjusted manually by the dial on theendoscope. Once proper positioning of the endo-scope rostral to the epiglottis is established, the nosetwitch is removed, and the rider/driver may com-mence the exercising portion of the examination. Exercising Examination The DRE exam is best performed under the exercis-ing conditions in which the horse typically exhibitsimpaired performance and/or abnormal noise pro-duction. Because of the variance in exercisingconditions for horses of differing disciplines, a stan-dardized exercise test for DRE exams for all horseshas not yet been established as it has for treadmillexaminations. For Standardbred racehorses, a2-minute mile (or faster) with the horse trotting orpacing by itself or in the company of others is per-formed. For Thoroughbred racehorses, the horse isbreezed at least 3/8 of a mile (or preferably 5/8 ormore) individually or in company to obtain a diag-nostic examination. For sport horses, exercise re-gimes are more variable but should be designed toreplicate the conditions under which the respiratoryabnormality is typically noted (head flexion, tack/equipment modications, rider influences). Forhorses that exhibit clinical signs prior to race train-ing, DRE examination can be performed at nonrac-ing speeds as long as the conditions under which theabnormality is typically noted are achieved. Completion of the Examination After the exercise test is completed, the recording is stopped, and the endoscope and equipment are re-moved from the horse. Review of the Examination The recorded examination is downloaded from the removable SD card to a computer. The software Fig. 3. A specially designed pack houses the mounted module and attaches to the shaft of a racing bike or sulky for driving horses. Fig. 4. The handheld, wireless monitor that receives the videosignal from the transmitter unit and allows real-time viewing ofthe endoscopic video images during the /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 427HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD IMAGINGsystemballows for a review of the DRE video from start to nish and gives one the ability to replay the video in slow motion. Creating still images andvideo clips that may be shared with all interestedparties (owners, trainers, referring veterinarians) isalso possible. 3. Results More than 250 DRE examinations were successfullyperformed in Thoroughbred and miniature drivinghorse (1). No DRE examinations were unsuccessfulbecause of horse compliance issues, and most horsesseemed to tolerate the DRE equipment well. Somehorses exhibited transient sneezing or snorting,however, upon initial placement of the endoscope inthe nasal passage, and some horses made occasionalattempts to rub the endoscope on their limbs. Nohorse, rider, or driver injuries were encountered,and the equipment did not impede the horse, rider,or driver's normal exercise routine. Mild mucosalirritation adjacent to the tip of the endoscope uponcompletion of examination and self-limiting epi-staxis during examinations performed in coldweather were noted infrequently. Nondiagnostic DRE examinations were encoun- tered during initial experiences with the equipmentand were the result of operator error (poor or im-proper positioning of the endoscope in the upperairway, improper shutdown, loss of video), techno-logical failures (water pump malfunction, worn orbroken video cables, corrupt video le), and riderinterference (power loss, displacement of endo-scope). Minor modications to the DRE system andimprovements in technique resolved these earlyissues. Denitive diagnoses were obtained using DRE in 94% of horses having a history of abnormal noiseproduction and poor performance. In horses hav-ing a history of poor performance without abnormalnoise production, denitive diagnoses were obtainedin only 44% of the horses. Concurrent (more than1) respiratory abnormalities were observed in 22% ofthe horses examined. The two most common upperairway abnormalities observed independently wereintermittent dorsal displacement of the soft palate(20%) and left arytenoid collapse with unilateral orbilateral vocal cord collapse (12%). Other disordersobserved independently or concurrently included ax-ial deviation of the aryepiglottic folds, intermittentepiglottic entrapment, palatal hemorrhage,excessive mucus, and proximal tracheal collapse. 4. Discussion Important factors to consider when choosing whichtype of exercising endoscopic exam to perform on ahorse with a suspected upper airway disorder in-clude the ability to replicate the conditions underwhich the horse typically exhibits the abnormalityto arrive at a denitive diagnosis, the safety of theprocedure and risk of injury to the horse, the nan-cial investment to the owner, the quality of the videoimages obtained, and the ability to perform theexam in a timely manner. DRE offers a convenient,safe, affordable alternative to high-speed treadmillendoscopy while also providing high-quality imagesthat accurately assess a horse's upper airway func-tion during its normal exercising conditions. Theequipment seems to be well-tolerated by horses, andthe impact of external influences (tack, head posi-tion, rider/driver interference, footing, weather con-ditions, other horses) can be evaluated during theexamination. The accuracy of diagnosing an upper airway ab- normality using DRE is greater for horses with ahistory of abnormal noise rather than poor perfor-mance alone. 3,5Therefore, in horses exhibiting poor performance alone or when a lower airway dis-order is suspected, high-speed treadmill endoscopymay offer a comprehensive advantage over DRE asboth cardiac and lower respiratory function can beevaluated during the examination. Standardized testing for DRE examinations has not yet been established for horses of variousbreeds and disciplines in the same way it has fortreadmill endoscopy. Discrepancies between thediagnostic accuracy of DRE versus high-speedtreadmill endoscopy have been documented previ-ously, but exercise regimes (distance, duration,speed, incline) were not directly comparable. 5,6 To obtain a denitive diagnosis with DRE, theimportance of replicating the conditions underwhich the horse typically exhibits its abnormalitycannot be emphasized enough. The diagnostic and imaging capabilities of the DRE system and the real-time viewing of the ex-amination on the monitor are selling features ofthe technology, as is the ability to share imagesfrom the examination with all interested partiesin a timely fashion. Owners and trainers com-monly respond that DRE allowed them to makesound scal decisions regarding their horse. Ad-ditionally, DRE offers a unique opportunity forperforming preoperative and postoperative evalu-ations of horses undergoing surgical procedures tocorrect identied upper airway disorders. DREcan provide objective documentation that the sur-gical procedure corrected or failed to correct thepreviously diagnosed airway disorder. The abil-ity to make these direct, horse-to-horse compari-sons offers a new means of assessing the outcomeof surgical treatments and should help redenethe true success or failure of a procedure aswell as the prognoses for various upper airwaydisorders. In summary, DRE offers a safe and convenient alternative to high-speed treadmill endoscopy for 428 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD IMAGINGhorses with suspected upper airway disorders, ab- normal noise production during exercise, and/orpoor performance. The likelihood of establishing adenitive diagnosis using DRE is greater for horsesthat exhibit abnormal noise production during exer-cise than poor performance alone. The lack of stan-dardized eld exercise tests for DRE and thevariation in exercise demands for horses of differingdisciplines highlight the importance of replicatingthe conditions under which the horse manifests theabnormality as closely as possible to establish adenitive diagnosis.

Pease, DVM, MS, DACVR Author's address: Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Michigan State University, College of VeterinaryMedicine, East Lansing, MI 48824; e-mail: tonyvet@me.com. \u00a9 2015 AAEP. 1. Introduction Diagnosing the cause of equine ataxia can be quite difcult for the practitioner. Often the patient ishard to assess and has vague clinical signs. One keycomponent in identifying the cause of the neurologicsigns is obtaining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thestandard method for obtaining the fluid is through alumbosacral centesis. 1,2However, obtaining CSF from the lumbosacral cistern can be difcult because itis approximately 10 cm under the skin, and the open-ing is approximately 1 cm in size. Ultrasound hasbeen used to help guide the procedure, but evenwith ultrasound guidance, the needle extends intothe vertebral canal and risks either penetrating anerve root, which is painful, or the vertebral ves-sels, which can lead to blood contamination. The cervical region also has windows that allow for CSF collection. The most frequently used window isthe cerebellomedullary cistern at the atlanto-occipitaljoint. 3This method is routinely used to acquire CSF from horses under general anesthesia and has recentlybeen reported in standing horses using ultrasoundguidance. 3The concern with this procedure is that if the horse's head moves, there is a risk that the needlecould penetrate the spinal cord.A second window is in the lateral aspect of the at- lantoaxial joint (C1-C2). Using ultrasound guidance, centesis can be performed using a lateral approach.This approach minimizes the risk of damage to thespinal cord and is dorsal enough to avoid the nerveroots and vertebral vessels. This method results inminimal blood contamination, can acquire large vol-umes of CSF if needed (/H11022 20 mL), and can be per- formed in approximately 2 minutes from when theneedle is rst introduced to when the fluid is removed. 2. Materials and Methods To perform centesis through the lateral aspect of theatlantoaxial joint, horses are placed in stocks, althoughthe procedure can be performed in the stall or with re-cumbent horses. The site for C1-C2 CSF collection isidentied using ultrasound. Although either side of theneck can be used, most horses are prepared on the leftside to allow for the needle to be held in the right hand.The centesis site is located just caudal to the caudalaspect of the transverse process of C1 and approximately3 placed on neck between C1 and C2.The spinal cord is identied to verify the dorsal region ofthe subarachnoid space where the needle is placed. 430 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FIELD IMAGING NOTESThe dura mater, spinal cord, central canal, and vertebrae are identied. An approximately 15 /H1100315-cm area is shaved and aseptically prepared. The horse is then se-dated using 0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg detomidine hydrochlorideintravenously; this is morphine sulfate intravenously.The morphine sulfate is usually dosed at 30 mg forhorses weighing more than 500 kg and 15 mg for thoseweighing less than 500 kg. Forty milligrams (2 mL) of2% mepivacine hydrochloride is administered subcuta-neously prior to the nal aseptic preparation of the skin.A nose twitch can be used prior to placing the needle butgenerally is not needed if sedation is adequate and some-one is holding the head. Using a sterile glove placedover the ultrasound probe, an 18- or 20-gauge, 8.4-cm(3.5-in) spinal needle with a stylet is introduced ventrallyto the ultrasound transducer and advanced medially tothe level of the dura mater (Fig. 1). The stylet is left inplace as the needle is advanced through the dura materand into the subarachnoid space. With ultrasoundguidance, the needle should always be seen as it goesthrough the neck muscles, through the dura mater, andinto the subarachnoid space. 4Upon removing the sty- let, CSF generally does not flow freely. Depending onhead position, it may be necessary to place a glovednger over the needle hub to prevent excessive air fromentering the subarachnoid space. A higher head posi-tion yields more air influx, and a lower head positiontypically produces CSF spontaneously though the nee-dle. Next, a 5-mL syringe is attached to the needle, andCSF is collected using gentle suction. After collectingapproximately 3 to 5 mL of CSF, the rst syringe isdiscarded, and a second 5-mL syringe is attached to ob-tain a sample for evaluation. The needle is then re-moved, and the horse is returned to its stall. The CSFobtained can be analyzed for red blood cell contamina-tion, microprotein content, nucleated cells, specic grav-ity, and well as serologic testingfor equine protozoal myeloencephalitis. 3. Results To date, approximately 50 horses have undergonethis procedure without adverse effects. One horsehad a small subarachnoid space from which only 3mL of CSF could be obtained. In 19 of the 50 cases,serology was obtained on the CSF (for the remainingcases, the CSF was simply submitted for analysis).Of those 19 cases, 2 (11%) had greater than 50 redblood cells per microliter (RBC/ /H9262L) in the /H9262L and 53 RBC/ /H9262L), 3 (16%) had acceptable levels of red blood cell contamination (47 RBC/ /H9262L, 38 RBC/ /H9262L, and 27 RBC/ /H9262L), and the remaining 14 horses (74%) had less than 10 RBC/ /H9262L. Of the 14 horses with less than 10 RBC/ /H9262L, 11 (58% of the total) had fewer than 4 RBC/ /H9262L. In 4 (21%) of the 19 horses, the initial and second samples were both submitted for cytology. Therst horse's initial sample contained 2 575 RBC/ /H9262L; there were only 38 RBC/ /H9262L in the second sample. The second horse had 245 RBC/ /H9262L in the initial sample and 27 RBC/ /H9262L in the second sample. The third horse had 37 RBC/ /H9262L in the rst sample and 12 RBC/ /H9262L in the second sample. The fourth horse had less than 2 RBC/ /H9262L in both samples. No horses had adverse reactions to the procedure (such as falling down or seizures). One horse wasreported to have slight neck pain for 5 days after theprocedure but responded well to phenylbutazone.One potential difculty with the procedures is that areverberation artifact can occur at the level of thedura mater if it is not penetrated; this can obscurethe image of the procedure. If this occurs, and animage of the spinal cord is not obtained, the proce-dure can be immediately performed on the oppositeside of the horse's neck. 4. Discussion Standing cervical centesis in horses from the lateralaspect of the atlantoaxial joint using ultrasound guid-ance is a rapid method for obtaining CSF. Comparedwith other methods of obtaining CSF, this method issafer for both the horse and the veterinarian. Mor-phine anesthetizes the dura mater so the horse doesnot react to needle puncture. The veterinarian is po-sitioned near the head rather than the hind end of thehorse, thus minimizing the risk of being kicked. Al-though other sedative-analgesic drugs have been used,The author has found that morphine allows for routineanesthesia of the horse's central nervous system andhelps keep the horse's stance solid. Morphine cannot be given to a horse as a stand- alone drug because it tends to cause excitability. 5 Thus, detomidine is initially administered to pro-vide sedation. The benet of this combination isthat it is relatively long-lasting; the duration of mor-phine's effect can last approximately 2 hours, and detomidine can provide sedation for 30 to 45 min-utes. This usually provides adequate time to per-form the procedure; however, if necessary,additional detomidine can be administered. Col-leagues have reported success using mixed opioidagonists/antagonists with a combination of xyla-zine hydrochloride for performing the procedure,but when rst attempting this technique, numer- Fig. 1.

With practice and coordination, cervical centesis from the lateral aspect of the atlantoaxial joint canbe performed in the eld and has been done in stallsas well as in 1 down, grade 4 ataxic horse. Theability to obtain CSF in the eld to help evaluate aneurologic disorder is extremely valuable, but careshould be taken to practice the procedure on eutha-nized horses prior to trying it on a standing one.

Introduction In the athletic horse, back pain is a common cause of poor performance.1Diagnosis is difcult because the signs are vague and horses that are sensitive topalpation or pressure over the back may not neces-sarily have pain in this area. This situation is com-plicated by the fact that many affected horsespresent for ill-dened gait or performance abnor-malities rather than overt thoracolumbar pain. Adding to the complexity of dening and diagnosingback pain is the paucity of large-scale scientic stud-ies in horses. Many lesions associated with back pain involve the structures along the thoracolumbar spine andradiographic evaluation is the most common imag-ing modality performed. High-output x-rayequipment and digital radiographic systems havefacilitated acquisition of diagnostic images.Post-processing algorithms further enhances thebony detail; however, good high-quality exposuresand accurate position remains essential. In most horses, the dorsal spinous processes (DSPs) of the thoracolumbar vertebral bodies arereadily visible on radiographic evaluation. Thebroad width of the back in some Warmbloods, Drafthorses, and obese horses can hinder adequate imag- ing, especially with lower-output portable x-rayequipment. Conversely, horses with a \"weak top-line\" are often easy to image due to decreased epax-ial muscle mass. Radiographic abnormalities may include imping- ing and overriding of the DSPs (aka, \"kissingspines\"), fractured DSPs, and/or enthesiophyte for-mation along the origin/insertion of the interspinous ligaments. A wide variety of abnormal radio-graphic ndings of the DSPs can be present in bothclinically normal horses and horses with back pain,and previous studies have shown that the severity ofradiographic changes do not always correlate withclinical signs. 1,2Therefore, the clinical signicance of overriding DSPs or other bony lesions in horseswith back pain cannot be made on radiographicsigns alone. Diagnostic analgesia of the back can be used to determine the clinical signicance of impingingand/or overriding DSPs. 1,3,4In horses with sus- pected back pain, local anesthetic solution can beinltrated in or near the interspinous spaces be-tween the DSPs. After injection, the gait of thehorse can be assessed. In a horse with authentic AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 433HOW-TO SESSION: FIELD IMAGING NOTESback pain, there will be marked improvement or resolution of abnormal clinical signs. The objective of this presentation is to familiarize practitioners with radiographic technique for imag-ing the back and how to obtain good image quality.How to anesthetize interspinous space(s) will also bepresented. Both of these techniques can enhancethe clinical examination of horses with poor perfor-mance and authenticate abnormal physical and/orradiographic abnormalities as a cause of back pain. 2. Methods Radiographic Evaluation of the DSPs Prior to radiographic evaluation, the horse's back should be brushed over to ensure there is no mud orother substances that might lead to radiographicartifacts. Sedation should mg/kg) intrave- dose is at the discretion of the attend-ing veterinarian and should be aimed at providingadequate sedation so the horse will not move or raiseits head during radiographic evaluation. Giventhat high doses of sedation can cause truncal sway-ing, it is preferred to use lower doses and resedate ifnecessary rather than giving high doses initially.The horse should stand squarely, taking the weightevenly on all four limbs. The head and neck posi-tion should be in alignment with or slightly ventralto the horse's topline. High head and neck positionshould be avoided because it decreases the interver-tebral distance between the DSPs. 5 Adequate imaging requires radiographic equip- ment capable of producing outputs of 75-120 kV and100-250 mAs. 6Ideally, the x-ray tube is mounted on an overhead gantry with a linked cassette holderto ensure horizontal alignment of the x-ray beamand the sensor panel (Fig. 1). The sensor panelshould be oriented perpendicular to the ground andthe x-ray beam should be aligned with the center ofthe sensor panel (Fig. 2). At the author's institu-tion, an 800-mAs x-ray tube and a 14 /H1100317-in. wire- less panel with a 10:1 grid is used. The distancebetween the x-ray generator and the sensor panel is40 in. Typically five to six overlapping lateral radio- graphic images (Fig. 3) are acquired. For therst radiographic image, the sensor panel is posi-tioned just above the highest point of the withersand placed as close to the horse as possible. Thesecond image is positioned just caudal to the rst,overlapping the DSPs in the withers. Movingcaudally, remaining images are obtained in thethoracic and lumbar regions. In the mid-thoracicregion, the x-ray beam is centered just above thevertebral bodies, 10-15 cm below the dorsum (Fig.2). To image the rst (T1) DSP, a lateral radio-graphic image at the base of the neck is obtained.Imaging of the DSP of T1 is not included in stan-dard back radiographs.Diagnostic radiographic images can also be ob- tained using a mobile unit but only the summits ofthe DSPs are consistently imaged. Collimationshould be used to reduce the amount of scatter ra-diation generated to improve image quality. Accu-rate imaging requires a horizontal x-ray beam inalignment with the sensor panel, which is difcult toachieve using portable equipment. When the x-ray Fig. 1.

Due to angulation of x-ray beamand scatter, distortion of DSPs is produced whenusing portable x-ray equipment (Figs. 5 and 6).Standing on a step ladder can improve the align-ment between portable x-ray generator and sensorpanel; however, obliquity and equipment limitationshinder proper image acquisition. A lead marker can be placed along the dorsal midline to serve at a point of reference (Figs. 2 and3C). This marker is positioned at the location ofback soreness or a radiographically abnormal DSP.If additional diagnostics or treatment of the back isforthcoming, the site of the lead marker is thenidentied on the dorsal skin with whiteout (Fig. 7) orby removing a small amount of hair. Minimal clip-ping should be performed to insure accurate loca-tion. For example, removing a very narrow band ofhair using a No. 40 clipper blade oriented perpen-dicular to midline can be used. Back Injections: Local Inltration of the Interspinous Space(s) of the DSPs The specic site for injection can be determined by palpation. Counting cranially from the eighteenthrib, the corresponding DSP is identied. Or, thesite of injection can be determined by previouslymarked location obtained during radiographic eval-uation. Once the site is identied, the horse shouldstand square and the area is aseptically prepared.Adequate restraint and application of a nose twitchshould be performed to prevent horse movementduring needle placement and injection. In the re-fractory horse, sedation is performed using 0.25-0.3mg/kg xylazine hydrochloride bintravenously. The injections are performed on into the interspinous ligamentous space.

The needle is then ad-vanced ventrally to an approximate depth of 5 to 7cm. When advancing, the angle of the needleshould mirror the angle of the DSPs at the site ofinjection. From T1-T14, the DSPs are inthe dorsocaudal direction, T15 (theanticlinal vertebra) and are angled dorsocranialfrom T17-L6 (Fig. 9).

In horses with overriding DSPs, placementof the spinal needle into the interspinous space us-ing a center midline approach is not possible. Forthese horses, injection is performed approximately 2cm to the right or left of midline, abaxial to theaffected DSPs. Once the needle is positioned, 2%mepivicaine hydrochloride cin a disposable slip tip syringe (8-10 mL) is injected. Anesthetic solution(3-5 mL) is injected at the ventral depth and theremainder of the anesthetic solution is injected asthe needle is withdrawn dorsally. Injection of solu-tion should not be performed within the supraspi-nous ligament, which is situated superciallybetween the skin and the dorsal rim of the dorsalspinous processes. If there is signicant resis-tance, the needle should be slightly redirected untilthere is less resistance. If more than one site is injected, a cranial or caudal interspinous space can be injected by palpat-ing the subcutaneous depression in front or behind,retrospectively, the rst clearly marked site. Alter-natively, multiple spinal needles are insertedthrough the skin and positioned prior to injection.After injection, the horse stands quietly until effec-tiveness of the block is evaluated.

Impingement and overriding DSPs is a fairly com- mon radiographic observation, even in clinicallysound horses. Cortical sclerosis and subcortial ra-diolucencies are frequently noted and often in horseswith \"kissing spines.\" Fractures of the DSPs usu-ally occur in Displacement and mal-formation of the DSPs are infrequently observed.Equally informative is the absence of bony abnor-malities in the horses that block to the back. Ad-ditional imaging such as ultrasound and/or nuclearscintigraphic evaluation can be useful in thesehorses. Local inltration of the interspinous space(s) of the DSPs is performed on an as-needed basis butmost typically performed in horses with gait and/orbehavioral abnormalities. The procedure is alsofrequently performed to discern the clinical signi-cance of radiographic abnormalities, usually \"kiss-ing spines,\" and/or increased radiopharmaceuticaluptake of the DSPs. In either situation, lamenessevaluation including exercise with a rider is thepreferred method of assessing the effect of the block.For safety reasons, application of a weighted surcin-gle during gait assessment can also be used. Pro-vided the horse exhibits performance problems withthe apparatus (some will only do so with a rider),exercise with the surcingle before and after blockingthe DSPs is another viable method of testing. Oneor two interspinous spaces are commonly anesthe-tized, most frequently in the caudal thoracic saddleregion (T14-T18). If the horse's gait is not altered,an additional site along the back is selected. Lesscommonly, selective inltration of interspinousspace(s) of the DSPs is performed to determine sur-gical site(s) prior to interspinous ligament desmot-omy. Complications are exceedingly rare andinclude transient swelling along the dorsal midline.Application of a clean, dry towel prior to post-blockridden evaluation may decrease the potential ofoccurrence. 4. Discussion The diagnosis of back pain in the horse is challeng-ing. High-quality radiographic evaluation of theDSPs is essential for identication of underlyingbony abnormalities that can cause thoracolumbarpain. However, radiographic abnormalities of theDSPs are common ndings in horses with and with-out back pain. Therefore, the diagnosis of backpain should not be made on radiographic evaluationalone. Local inltration of the interspinousspace(s) of the DSPs is an effective diagnostic tooland is used to authenticate the thoracolumbar re-gion at a bona de source of pain in horses withsuspected back problem. Both of these tools areextremely helpful in assisting the clinician with theaccurate diagnosis of back pain in horses.

Previous reportshave described the ultrasonographic anatomy andtechnique for evaluation of the AL-SDFT. 2,10,11 This paper expands on these studies with a thor-ough anatomic review. The proposed technique de-scribes the evaluation of each structure individuallyin transverse and longitudinal planes, in contrastwith the more historic zone approach. 11By im- proving ultrasonographic prociency and anatomiccompetency, the practitioner will be better equipped to diagnose various conditions of the equine carpalcanal. 2. Materials and Methods Anatomic Study Three forelimbs from horses euthanized for unre- lated reasons were obtained for the anatomic portionof this study. Ultrasound examination and mag-netic resonance images (MRI a) of the limbs from the level of mid radius to mid metacarpus were per-formed postmortem on two of the limbs. Protondensity (PD), proton dense fat-saturated, and T1-weighted gradient echo images were obtained in thetransverse and sagittal planes. One of these limbswas frozen, and transverse, 2-mm cut sections weremade to correspond with previously acquired ultra-sound and MRIs. Figure 1 is used as a reference forcorresponding anatomic locations of the transversesections used in the subsequent gures. In a thirdcadaver limb, used solely to demonstrate the mar-gins of the carpal canal, noniodinated contrast me-dium (30 mL iohexol b[350 mgI/mL], diluted to a total volume of 60 mL) was injected into the carpal AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 439HOW-TO lateral and dorsolateral to palmaromedial oblique radiographs were obtained (Fig. 2). Ultrasound Study The caudomedial aspect of the limb is clipped with aNo. 40 to No. 50 blade from 4 cm proximal to thechestnut to the mid metacarpus. The limb iswashed with warm water and soap, dried, and ul-trasound-coupling gel is applied. A high-frequency(8-18 mHz) linear transducer cis used. A total of 10 veterinary students and veterinari- ans were recruited to perform the technique as de-scribed on a standing horse. There were a total ofseven veterinary students with minimal ultrasoundexperience and three veterinarians with novice tomoderate ultrasound knowledge and skills and withminimal to no experience imaging the carpal canal.The written technique was provided to participantsand followed in a step-by-step manner. Carpal Sheath The carpal canal contains the supercial and digitalflexor tendons. Its proximomedial extent is bor-dered by the AL-SDFT or superior check ligament. 12 The distal margin is bordered by the accessory lig-ament of the deep digital flexor tendon (AL-DDFT).The borders sheath and the palmar carpal intrathecal contrast medium shows proximal extent (distal third of the ra-dius) and distal extent of the carpal sheath, whichextends to the mid-metacarpal region in mosthorses. The flexor retinaculum forms a band on thecaudal aspect of the carpus, and spans from theaccessory carpal bone to the medial collateral liga-ment and proximal aspect of the second metacarpalbone (Fig. 3). 13The tension of the flexor retinacu- lum results in restriction of the fluid within thecarpal sheath at this level, which can be seen in Fig.2 at the level of the accessory carpal bone. A largeraccumulation of contrast is visible proximal to theflexor retinaculum. Ultrasound examination of the metacarpal struc- tures can identify effusion contained within the car-pal canal, which is usually seen between the deepdigital flexor tendon (DDFT) and the AL-DDFT.With more severe effusion, is visible surrounding,or lateral and medial to the SDFT and DDFT.Proximal to the carpus, the largest accumulation offluid is visible laterally between the ulnaris lateralisand authors' experience, inadvertent introduction of gas can be present in the carpalcanal after a low 4-point diagnostic block is per-formed. Many veterinary students and practitio-ners may be surprised by the distal extent of thecarpal canal. Identifying Home Base The starting location is just distal to the chestnut onthe medial aspect of the radius.

Depth can be set between 4 and 5 cm, depending on the size of the horse, and focal zonesare positioned in the near eld at approximately 1 to2 cm deep. When the transducer is placed on thepalmar aspect of the limb, the marker is positionedlaterally, corresponding with the left side of thescreen. For imaging the structures as described,the transducer is held in the same orientation sothat when it is placed directly on the medial side ofthe radius, the marker will essentially be directedcaudally. (Note: Although this is not traditionalradiology protocol, as structures are followed dis-tally, the transducer indicator will end up in a nor-mal lateral location.) The AL-SDFT can be identiedat this level by placing the transducer in a trans-verse (short axis) plane, directly medial on the limb,just below the chestnut (Figs. 4 and 6).Accessory Ligament of the Supercial Digital Flexor Tendon The AL-SDFT will appear as the most echogenic structure adjacent to the caudal surface of the ra-dius and is surrounded by the caudal antebrachialstructures that are still predominantly muscle atthis level (and will be described individually later)(Fig. 5). The vessels overlying it, including the me-dian artery and cephalic vein (more supercial andcranial) are also used as landmarks. Cranial tothe AL-SDFT, partially visible in the supercial portion of the image, is the curvilinear echogeniccaudal surface of the radius. The flexor carpiradialis is visible directly supercial to the AL-SDFT. All descriptions will be given from thislocation at home base, with the probe in a trans-verse plane (Fig. 6). Once identied, the ligament can be followed to- ward the SDF muscle in the transverse plane.As the ligament courses from the origin on the cau-dal cortex of the radius toward its insertion on theSDF, it can be visualized passing deep to the medianartery. The curved walls of the median artery, aswell as the flexor carpi radialis, create linear, an-echoic edge artifacts in the deeper AL-SDFT. Asthe probe moves distally it must also be moved in aslightly caudal direction. The shape of the AL-SDFT changes from square proximally to oblong asit inserts into the SDF (Fig. 7). When the AL-SDFTinserts into the SDF near the level of the musculo-tendinous junction, the SDF may contain some mus-cle bers at this level. To evaluate the ber pattern of the AL-SDFT in long axis, the probe is placed in transverse, directlyunder the chestnut, and toelongate the bers. The marker of the transduceris oriented in a dorsal or proximal direction in longaxis. As the probe is rotated, it must be pivoted onthe central axis of the AL-SDFT; keeping the AL-SDFT in the center of the image will ensure that theprobe remains on the AL-SDFT.

Note: Evaluation of the entire AL-SDFT can be performed in the transverse plane from the origin onthe radius, but imaging in the proximal region ismade difcult due to poor contact by the chestnut.Due to the orientation of the AL-SDFT at its origin,obtaining a \"true\" longitudinal view of the origin hasbeen difcult experience and rela-tively unrewarding.

Delineating the exact borders of the SDF muscle from the deep digitalflexor (DDF) muscle is difcult at the level of the midto distal radius. Determining the borders of theSDF from the DDF muscles in the distal radius canbe performed with a retrograde approach. By iden-tifying the borders of the SDFT in the proximalmetacarpus and following it proximally through thecarpal canal, the dorsal border of the SDF and cau-dal border of the DDF are more apparent at the levelof the distal radius. Imaging of the SDF muscle and tendon in trans- verse is accomplished by sliding the transducerslightly caudally along the caudomedial aspect ofthe distal radius. As it courses distally, the mus-culotendinous junctions are visible as well-denedhypoechoic to anechoic areas surrounded by theechogenic tendon bers (Fig. 8). In long axis, thesemuscle units are visible as triangle-shaped hy-poechoic areas that blend into hyperechoic tendonbers (Fig. 9). Evaluation of the SDFT at the levelof the carpus is performed with the ultrasound beamdirected in a slight caudomedial to craniolateral di-rection. The lateral location of the accessory carpalbone prevents imaging the SDFT from a palmar/caudal approach through the carpal region, and thusthe transducer is maintained in a more medial po-sition. Distal to the accessory carpal bone, the re-mainder of the SDFT can be viewed from a palmarapproach. The musculotendinous junctions shouldnot be mistaken for tearing and/or lesions. If ahypoechoic area is found, it should be followed prox-imally to determine whether the hypoechoic areablends normally into muscle at the level of the distalradius. The contralateral limb should also be eval-uated for comparison. Deep Digital Flexor Tendon From home base, the DDF muscle is visible deep tothe AL-SDFT. Depth setting should be increasedup to 6 to 7 cm and the focal zones lowered to the fareld of the image to evaluate the entire DDF musclein the distal radius region.

Using a trapezoidal view op-tion helps include more structures at this level ofdepth when using a linear probe. The radial head of the DDF muscle is visible deep to the AL-SDFT and just caudal to the radius.It is more echogenic than the adjacent muscle and has a smooth echotexture (Fig. 10). The ulnar andhumeral muscle bellies of the DDF are caudal to theradial head, and are hypoechoic, with normal hyper-echoic muscle striations. To evaluate the entireDDF muscle, the probe must be moved caudally and laterally to image the more laterally located ulnarand humeral heads, which may be indistinct fromthe adjacent SDF muscle. A similar medial ap-proach for imaging the DDF can be applied as wasused to image the SDF through the carpal region,due to the accessory carpal bone. most supercial structure, adjacent or to the radius, and supercial to the previouslyidentied AL-SDFT. Imaging of the remainingstructures is performed at approximately 3 to 4 cmof depth, with the focal zones moved to the near eld(1 cm deep). The FCR is a relatively smaller struc-ture in relation to the other caudal antebrachialstructures. Proximal to the chestnut, it is predom-inantly muscle. As it courses distally along themedial aspect of the radius, the muscle bers con-dense into tendon bers, at the level of the chestnut,and can appear bi-layered, with a mix of hypoechoicmuscle and tendon bers 11).The FCR can be followed distally on the medialaspect of the carpus to its insertion on the proximalaspect of the second metacarpal bone (head of themedial splint bone). 15The FCR has a tendon sheath at the level of the carpus, which is containedwithin the flexor retinaculum. 12 To evaluate the tendon in a longitudinal imaging plane, the tendon can rst be identied in trans-verse and the counterclockwiseto elongate the The hyperechoic sur-face the radius is identied just cranial to the FCRand as the transducer is slid caudally, the rst vis-ible structure is the FCR.

The remainderof the muscle is visible by sliding the probe caudally.As the FCU courses distally, it can be imaged from amore caudal approach. Similar to the FCR, it has abi-layered appearance (Fig. 12). As the muscle con-denses into the tendon bers, it is located supercialand just caudal to the SDFT, and can be followed toits insertion on the palmar/caudomedial aspect ofthe accessory carpal bone. To evaluate the muscleand tendon in long axis, it can be identied in trans-verse and the transducer rotated counterclockwise.Alternatively, from the radius, it can be identied by Fig. 9. A.

Ulnaris Lateralis From home base, as the probe is moved from medialto lateral the muscles can be identied in order:FCR, FCU, ulnaris lateralis (UL). Depth is furtherdecreased to approximately 3 cm and focal zones aremaintained in the near eld. The UL is locatedlaterally on the antebrachium, caudal and lateral tothe FCU. It is a supercial and relatively slendermuscle belly, with a bi-layered appearance similarto previously described structures (Fig. 12). As itbecomes tendinous just proximal to the accessorycarpal bone, it is located more caudolaterally. Itbriefly forms a distinct tendon before splitting into acranial and caudal component. The caudal inserts proximolaterally ofthe accessory carpal bone. The cranial componentis less distinct and courses in an oblique, dorsodistaldirection to insert proximally on the fourth metacar-pal bone. As it courses over the carpus, maintain-ing contact with the protuberances of the carpalbones may be aided by the use of a standoff pad.To nd the muscle/tendon in long axis, the previ-ously described approach of either rotating thetransducer from transverse into longitudinal or slid-ing the probe around the limb, and following thestructures from medial to lateral (FCR, FCU, UL)can be used. 3.

Discussion There are a number of descriptions of injuries to theAL-SDFT throughout veterinary literature, with re-cent renewed focus on this topic. 8,9Injuries to the SDFT and AL-SDFT were the two most commoninjuries in a group of 121 horses with carpal sheatheffusion. 8Early reports described a carpal canal syndrome, occurring most commonly in flat or stee-plechase racehorses that was associated with frac-ture of the accessory carpal bone. 1This led to a syndrome of thickening of the tendons including theflexor retinaculum and secondary effusion of thecarpal sheath and was treated with transection/re-moval of a portion of the flexor retinaculum. Withimproved technology and the increased use of ultra-sound in veterinary medicine, knowledge of specicsoft tissue injuries in the carpal canal are now iden-tied. These injuries include injury to the AL-SDFT, characterized by thickening of the AL-SDFT,irregular ber pattern, and tearing into the SDF incombination with carpal sheath effusion. 3This in- jury is most commonly described in young horseswith high levels of activity. 3,4Other abnormalities in this region include distal radial osteochondromasof the caudal distal radius as a cause of carpalsheath synovitis and associated desmopathy of theDDFT. These were reported predominantly in flatThoroughbred racehorses (18/22), but a few horses(4/22) of other disciplines were also included. 16 Tearing of the radial head of the DDF muscle withassociated tenosynovitis of the carpal sheath hasalso been described, mostly in flat racehorses. Thisgroup had a slightly older population with a meanage of 4.5 years (range, 2-9 y). 6Most recently, ultrasound was valuable for diagnosis of intrathecaltears of AL-SDFT, with several tears causing intra-thecal hemorrhage in the carpal sheath. 9 As veterinary care improves, the geriatric or se- nior horse population has provided new focuses inveterinary medicine. Specically, rupture of theSDFT in the carpal canal region in a group of agedhorses was recently presented. 7An additional re- port describes similar ndings in a group of ninehorses ranging in age from 18-22 years. 17Inter- estingly, another study of horses with injury to theSDFT within the carpal sheath, specically at thelevel of the carpus, reported these horses to be older,with a mean age of 18 years and predominantlyQuarter Horses (9/12 cases). In contrast with theother 22 horses in the study, injuries distal to theaccessory carpal bone occurred in younger horses(mean age, 6.3 y), that were predominantly Thor-oughbreds used for flat racing. 5 Injuries in this region are most common in Thor- oughbred racehorses; however, additional indica-tions for scanning this region include ruling out septic carpal sheath tenosynovitis from wound com-munication or associated tendon or ligament inju-ries from direct lacerations to this region. The approach described allows for complete eval- uation of the structures of the carpal canal and thetechnique can be readily learned by a novice ultra-sonographer. A few things to keep in mind includewhen starting at home base, the approach is directlymedial on the limb and just distal to the chestnut(Fig. 2). A common error is to start from a morecaudal position on the limb. Also, using the funda-mental ultrasound principle of keeping the structureof interest in the center of the image, improves eval-uation of the structure along its length. Manystructures are oriented in an oblique manner withinthe limb; if the transducer is moved directly distalwhen following the AL-SDFT, the structure will be-gin to \"slide off\" the screen. Small corrections tocenter the structure before moving distally againwill improve exam quality and accuracy. Lastly,having knowledge of where tendons and ligamentsinsert is useful in case the ultrasonographer be-comes disoriented or if normal anatomy is distorteddue to pathologic changes. By identifying thestructure at its insertion, a retrograde approach canbe used to follow it proximally to the muscle belly inthe distal antebrachial region. One limitation of the study was that the cadaver limbs were imaged in nonweight-bearing positions,which created relaxation artifact in the AL-SDFT.Individual ultrasound skill and experience is also alimiting factor. With better ultrasound techniqueand hand-eye coordination, following smaller andobliquely oriented structures, such as the FCR orUL, was easier for more experienced ultrasonogra-phers, but proved to be more difcult for those withnovice skill level. Although this paper aids imag-ing of the normal carpal canal and caudal antebra-chial structures, it does require practice andexperience to identify pathologic changes, especially if subtle. Approaching imaging of the carpal canal and cau- dal antebrachium as a complete, systematic exami-nation, using a standardized approach will helpincrease familiarity with the anatomy over time.Identifying home base as a reference point helpsguide the ultrasonographer to nd the remainingstructures, which may be unfamiliar. This tech-nique expands on the previously described ap-proach, but incorporates using an individualstructure approach to evaluate the entire caudalantebrachium.

Introduction Femoral third trochanter injuries are an uncommon but important source of lameness. Diagnosis isconfounded by a lack of localizing signs and oftenrequires nuclear scintigraphy or ultrasonography. 2. Materials and Methods Retrospective analysis of medical records identied20 horses with ultrasonographic or nuclear scinti-graphic evidence of third trochanter abnormalitiesfrom 2004-2014. Results Ultrasound identied third trochanter fractures in14/20 horses. Lameness was acute, insidious, or un-known. All but one was lame (Grade 2-4/5) at pre-sentation. Ultrasound was the initial diagnosticmodality in 5/14 fractured horses, whereas scinti-graphic ndings of intense, moderate, and mild in-creased radiopharmaceutical uptake (IRU) promptedultrasound in 9/14 horses. Non-displaced fracturewas suspected in one horse with intense IRU andnegative ultrasound ndings. In the remaining vehorses, imaging ndings included only mild IRU andlameness was localized to other regions. Six of 12fractured horses with outcome data returned to func-tion after a prolonged rehabilitation of 8-18 months. 4. Discussion Scintigraphic ndings directed focused ultrasoundexams in the majority of fracture cases. Horseswith third trochanter fracture had similar clinicalcharacteristics to that reported for pelvic fractures.Ultrasonographic examination of both regions istherefore recommended, especially when scintigra-phy is unavailable. Prognosis for return to functionwas less favorable than previously reported.

Introduction Synovial sepsis, a life-threatening condition of horses, requires prompt diagnosis. SF cytology iscommonly utilized to diagnose septic synovitis; how-ever, not all cases are clearly discernible. Labora-tory analysis takes 1-3 days. A rapid, reliable,point-of-care test diagnosing synovial sepsis wouldexpedite early intervention. 2. Materials and Methods Each structure was diagnosed as IBNS or IS basedon SF cytology (nucleated cell count, percentageneutrophils, intracellular bacteria), culture, SF SAA levels weremeasured by point-of-care semi-quantitative immu-nochromatographic and ELISA tests, by a blindedoperator. Data were analyzed by means of receiveroperating characteristic curves and optimal cutoffsappointed for each test. 3. Results Seventy-two synovial structures (62 horses) weresampled (48 IBNS and 24 IS). An optimal SAAcutoff above which the test was considered positivefor sepsis, was moderate for point-of-care test and132 /H9262g/mL for the ELISA test. Sensitivity (0.75) and specicity (0.92) were the same for both tests.Sensitivity (0.84) and specicity (0.92) improved forboth tests when structures sampled within 6 hoursof onset of clinical signs were excluded.

Introduction One widely utilized commercial inertial sensor sys- tem has demonstrated accuracy in lameness detec-tion. However, the system's accuracy has not beendescribed when sensor locations are altered. Thegoal of this investigation was to determine the ac-curacy of the system when the position of right fore(RF) pastern and pelvic sensors were altered. Wehypothesized that moving the RF sensor would nothave a signicant effect but that altering the loca-tion of the pelvic sensor would signicantly influ-ence pelvic variable kinematics. 2. Materials and Methods Twelve horses were examined at the trot on a high-speed treadmill. The RF sensor was tested in threelocations in random order: dorsal midline, 2 cmmedially, and 2 cm laterally. During another ses-sion, the pelvic sensor was tested in ve locations inrandom order: midline, 2 cm to the right and left ofmidline, 2 cm cranial, and 2 cm caudal. MaxDiffand MinDiff of the head and pelvis were ranked andanalyzed using linear regression with signicanceset to P/H11021.05.3. Results Altering RF sensor location had no signicant effecton fore or hindlimb kinematics. Pelvic sensor effect on MinDiff pelvis (P /H11021 .0355). 4.

Agreement in change post-diagnostic anesthesia is poor between non-expertsand only moderate between experts. This has leadto evaluation of objective measures that will providestrong correlation to expert opinion. 2. Materials and Methods All horses in the study were examined for lamenessand improvement post-diagnostic anesthesia by theISS and an expert lameness clinician (blinded orunblinded to ISS). Percent agreement and 95%condence intervals between ISS and clinician wereestimated for limb of primary lameness. Correla-tion between ISS and clinician for estimated changepost-diagnostic anesthesia was calculated. 3. Results Thirty-six horses with 181 evaluations (5 /H110063 per horse) were enrolled. When blinded a 61% agree-ment and when unblinded an 81% agreement wasobserved between ISS and clinician for choosing theprimary lame limb. Correlations (r) between theISS and the blinded and unblinded clinician were0.80 and 0.74, respectively for estimated changepost-diagnostic anesthesia. 4. Discussion Agreement of the blinded clinician with the ISS wassimilar to reports of agreement between clinicians inthe presence of mild lameness. Clinician opinioncombined with ISS demonstrated an 80% agree-ment, potentially suggesting an improvement inchoosing a limb with primary lameness. Whenblinded the correlation between ISS and clinicianwas strong for estimated change in lameness post-diagnostic analgesia, suggesting this informationcould benet clinicians of all experience levels.

Introduction The widespread use of transrectal ultrasound and fetal monitoring technology has allowed horse own-ers to attain more information about the mare andfoal during gestation. Dependent on the report andpopulation of horses, equine abortions still accountfor 8 to 19% equine pregnancies. problem equinebreeders. Equine abortion is dened as a loss ofpregnancy prior to 300 days' gestation. 2Fetuses dying after 300 days are termed stillbirths giventhat foals born alive may be capable of survival. 2 Common causes of abortion include both infectiousand noninfectious conditions with noninfectious sur-passing the prevalence of those caused by infectiousagents. 4A group from the United Kingdom re- ported that noninfectious causes (umbilical cord dis-orders, twinning, and virus,(EHV)-1 -4 and placentitis which was only re-ported in 16.3% of cases. However, another reportfrom France found that over a 24-year period, infec-tious causes were more common than noninfectious(67.3% vs 27.2%, respectively). 5 When an equine abortion occurs, veterinary prac- titioners may be asked to evaluate the fetus andplacenta in the eld for a potential etiology. Per- forming a thorough and appropriate postmortem ex-amination of an aborted fetus is a valuable skill foran equine practitioner. If no overt lesions are pres-ent, a practitioner needs to understand options forwhole body submission compared with tissue sub-mission. Furthermore, selection of appropriatesamples to be collected will preserve tissues for eval-uation once it has reached the laboratory. The goalof this paper is to review basic techniques of placen-tal and fetal evaluation, determine what samples tocollect for submission to a referral laboratory, andpresent common ndings from review articles in thepast on the subject. 2. Materials and Methods Once a practitioner arrives to examine an abortedfetus, a decision must be made as to whether toexamine the fetus on the farm, examine the fetusfollowed by sample collection and submission, orwhole-body fetal and placenta submission to refer-ring laboratory. Diagnostic laboratories will usu-ally have a higher success rate if the examinationand tissue sampling is performed by a diagnosticlaboratory. However, there are advantages to per-forming the work yourself. Your direct involve- 460 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSCUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGY NOTESment will improve your clinical evaluation skills if an accurate diagnosis is determined, leading toquicker decision making for the remainder of thesusceptible mares. Furthermore, adding this pro-cedure as a clinical service and charging appropri-ately for your time could serve as a practice builder. Whole-body submissions are used for those small fetuses less than 10 inches in length. The fetus andplacenta should be placed in a clean garbage bag andsent or delivered in a Styrofoam cooler on ice packsat 35-40\u00b0F. Do not freeze the submission beforesending to the laboratory. It is not necessary toadd formalin to the shipment. Overnight transpor-tation to the referral laboratory is preferred. Location and supplies are important factors prior to starting a eld necropsy for an aborted fetus.The location should be well illuminated and containa large, flat surface, elevated if possible to ensurethe work is less stressful for the practitioner. Withthe prevalence of infectious causes of abortion, oneshould always be cognizant of biosecurity and pro-tective outerwear. If the mare has aborted in astall or small paddock, this is an ideal location fornecropsy. The area is already contaminated andwould require cleaning anyway. If your practiceconsists of a large number of broodmares or brood-mare farms, a necropsy kit would be a good idea tohave ready in your vehicle. However, if you are ageneral practitioner who may see a few abortioncases per breeding season, a laminated checklist ofsupplies, copies of submission paperwork, and whatsamples to be taken and method of shipment ishelpful (Table 1). The placenta is composed of three components: the chorioallantois, amnion, and umbilical cord.It is common for the placenta to be inverted with theallantoic surface exposed. If fresh, the chorionicside of the placenta should look burgundy to red incolor with a velvety texture. This differentiates itfrom the allantoic surface, which will be pink,smooth, and has visible blood vessels. A normalamnion should be thin and white to translucent incolor. Environmental contaminants should be re-moved by rinsing with cold water to allow for ade-quate visualization of the tissue. The placentashould be laid out in a 'Y' or 'F' shape (Fig. 1) andweighed if possible. The placenta should weigh ap-proximately 11% of the foals' body weight. 6 Begin by inspecting the placenta completely to make sure no tears or sections are missing. Horntips of the placenta can be torn and can cause com-plication in the mare if retained. Key features tonote are the cervical star, gravid and nongravidhorn, and body of the placenta. The gravid hornwill be larger and thicker when compared with thenongravid horn. Identication of the cervical starshould be completed next. It will be pale in colorand contain no microcotyledons. Areas of inflam-mation and necrosis of the chorioallantois appeargrossly as tan to brown, thickened regions may havenecrotic exudate on the surface. Cytology or fungal hyphae. 7As- cending placentitis is common, in which case lesionswill be present at the cervical star and may extend10 to 20 cm cranially. Nocardioform bacteria causelesions in a locally extensive pattern near the cra-nial ventral uterine body and base of the horns. 8 Leptospirosis and Candida infections cause diffuseplacentitis. Affected placentas may appear morered than normal and may have small irregular areasof pallor. 7Samples of the placenta should be col- lected for aerobic culture and histology. Smallsquares (3-4 cm) of the gravid horn, nongravidhorn, cervical star, body of the placenta, and amnionshould be placed in a container with 10% formalin. The umbilical cord can vary in length and will have a mild-to-moderate twisting. Although thelength can vary greatly, Whitwell 9states that 95% of Thoroughbred foals will have an umbilicus lessthan 84 cm. Torsion of the cord is pathologic andTable 1.

After thorough inspection of the placenta and um- bilical cord, examination of the fetus can begin.The fetus should be weighed and a crown-rumplength (Table 2) should be taken with the fetusslightly bent in the natural position. Note any ab-normalities before beginning the necropsy. Notethe hair growth and body condition. The vertebralspinous processes and femurs should not be promi-nent. The limbs should be evaluated for contrac-ture or other congenital anomalies. 7Place the fetus in right lateral recumbency and examine theexternal surface of the fetus. Sharp dissection ismade to reflect the right fore and hindlimb of thefetus dorsally (Fig. 2). Next a single incision ismade from the anus to the mandible along ventralmidline. The skin should be reflected back beforethe abdominal wall is removed. Begin the incisionat midline and make two cuts extending to the pubisand dorsal paralumbar fossa. Reflection of the ribcage can be completed by cutting along the costo-chondral junction. Reflect the abdominal wall andribcage to fully expose the thorax and abdomen (Fig.3). Once the thorax and abdomen are exposed, noteany abnormalities. Is there any abdominal effu-sion? Are there any white-gray spots on the sur-face of the liver? Any effusion in the thoraciccavity? Once a brief evaluation is complete, sample collec- tion can begin. State Diagnostic Laboratory mayoffer an abortion panel that typically includes aero-bic culture (fetal lung, stomach contents, liver, andplacenta) and histology (adrenal glands, brain [en-tire brain], heart, liver, lung, small intestine, spleen,placenta, and any other tissue that seems abnor-mal). Care should be taken to collect tissue forculture without contaminating specimens. Cleangloves and instruments can minimize chance of con-founding results. The fetal lung is sampled rstusing a sterile scalpel blade and forceps. The liveris sampled next using the same technique. Stom-ach contents are then collected using a syringe andlarge-bore needle (Fig. 4). Aerobic culture speci-mens are placed into a bag a(Fig. 5) and labeled with mare name, owner name, date, and sample identi-cation. Stomach contents are placed in a red toptube. Once aerobic samples are collected, a full set of tissues should be collected for histopathology. Forhistopathology, xation is important; a thin flatpiece of tissue (/H11021 1 cm in thickness) should be col- lected with care and placed in buffered formalinsolution. The total amount of formalin should beTable 2.

The tongue, trachea, and esopha-gus are dissected free as gentle traction is used to liftand pull the tissue caudally. The trachea andesophagus are opened longitudinally, starting fromthe pharyngeal end. Each lung lobe is examinedand sectioned. Does it sink in formalin? Is it ex-cessively wet and heavy? The pericardial sac isopened and examined for effusion or adhesions.The heart is examined by making two incisions inthe atria and ventricles. The right side of the heartis opened by incising the right atrium and ventricle,adjacent to the interventricular septum, to the apexof the right ventricle (Fig. 6). The right ventricularfree wall is removed from the septum by extendingthe cut from the apex of the right ventricle throughthe pulmonary valves and into the pulmonary trunk. The left side of the heart is examined by making an opening in the left atrium and then the left ven-tricle with a single incision through the left ventric-ular free wall to the apex. The blade or scissors arethen placed under the atrioventricular valve into theaortic valve and a cut is made dorsally to exposeboth lining of the base of the aorta and left atria.Removal of the brain is usually not essential forinfectious disease diagnosis but does allow for in-spection if you suspect a congenital anomaly. Thehead can be removed and shipped chilled if youwould prefer the pathologist to perform the removal.Alternatively, if you are removing the brain, startwith a T-shaped incision through the skin on thedorsum of the cranium starting between the eyes.Extend caudally along the dorsal midline to the backof the head.

Results Abortion can be a costly and devastating componentto equine reproductive medicine. There are manycauses of abortion and identifying them could aid infurther prevention of subsequent abortions. Twomain categories of abortion exist: infectious andnoninfectious causes. In four retrospective studies,including a total of 7799 cases of abortion, infectiousetiologies were determined to be the major cause ofthe abortions reported 4,5,11,12Noninfectious causes include twinning, placental insufciencies, problems, congenital abnormalities, fetalresorption, and body pregnancies. Unfortunately,not every cause is determined. Of the four retro-spective studies 1345 of the cases (17%) could not bedetermined via diagnostic testing or characteristiclesions on the fetus or placenta. Infectious Fetal Death Bacterial placentitis is by far the most commoncause of infectious abortions in horses. Of the 7799total abortions, 1661 cases (21.2%) were attributedto bacterial etiologies. Majority of bacterial agentsthat cause abortion are more opportunistic bacteriaand can be found normally in pregnant and nonpreg-nant mares. The main culprit in the four studiesmentioned above was Streptococcus zooepidemicus. A majority of bacterial abortions are considered as-cending placentitis (Fig. 8); however, some can beclassied as nonascending placentitis or a hematog-enous route. Placentitis can occur in two forms:acute diffuse placentitis or chronic focal placentitis.The acute form produces a much more diffuse pat-tern of neutrophil inltration and occurs generallyearlier in gestation than the chronic form. 7The chronic form produces a more focal pattern aroundthe cervical star and tends to cause abortion in thelater months of gestation. Typically bacterial in-fections are diagnosed via bacterial culture and canbe determined from the fetus and the placenta.On occasion, however, multiple organisms can befound in the fetal and placental tissues, which indi-cates a mixed infection. Laugier et al 5noted that mixed infections generally consisted of Streptococ- cus zooepidemicus and Klebsiela pneumonia or Streptococcus zooepidemicus andEscherichia coli. Viral causes of abortion are generally attributed to EHV-1, EHV-4, and equine viral arteritis (EVA) Fig. 5. Bagawith correct labeling for aerobic culture. Fig. 6. Incision of the right ventricle just lateral to the septumwill allow examination of the right side of the fetal heart. 464 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSCUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGYwith EHV-1 being the most common cause (4%) in the aforementioned reports with EHV-4 and EVAonly responsible for few cases. EHV-1 is diagnosedvia fetal necropsy with characteristic 1-mm white-yellow foci in the fetal liver as well as excessivepleural effusion in the fetal lungs. EHV-1 andEHV-4 abortions tend to occur between 7 and 10months of gestation; however, some can continueonto term. 13These infections generally do not in- hibit the mare's ability to conceive again. EHV in-fections can cause abortions with or without clinicalsigns in the mare prior to the abortion. 13EVA is an infrequent cause of abortion but if mares are ex-posed to the virus, anywhere from 10 to 70% of themwill abort. EVA infections generally cause abor-tions within a few days of the onset of clinical signs.EVA generally does not have any characteristic le-sions on the fetus or the placenta and is diagnosedby viral isolation of placenta and fetal tissues as wellas reverse transcription polymerase chain reactionassay. Fungal etiologies are generally a minor compo- nent of abortions. Giles et al 11found only 1% of the reported abortions were attributed to fungal infec-tions. Similarly, Laugier et al 5only found 1.8% of the abortions occurring due to a fungal infectionwith Aspergillus being the most common organism identied. As these infections tend to be very sim-ilar with regard to placental and fetal presentationas the bacterial placentitis, fungal culture is neededto identify organisms. Noninfectious Fetal Death Twinning can appear in a variety of ways: an ap-parently normal foal with a fetal remnant, prema-ture foal (most likely deceased) with a smallerreabsorbing fetus, or birth of both twins (Fig. 9).The placenta will have abnormalities due to lack ofchorionic villi in the areas where the two placentascome into contact with each other. Abortions causedby twinning generally have one fetus that is smallerthan the other and showing more signs of retardationcompared with the other twin. Also, the smaller twinusually shows signs of chronic placental insufciency.All four retrospective reports agreed that twinningwas the second most common cause (4.6%) of nonin-fectious abortions. 4,5,11,12However, the current use Fig. 7.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 465CUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGYof ultrasonography early in gestation (14-16 d) has decreased rate of twins. Placental insufciency is another major cause of noninfectious abortions. This component consistsof placental edema, premature separation of the pla-centa (red bag), and developmental defects of theplacenta. 11Abortions caused by placental insuf- ciency will show fetal retardation as well as physicalproblems in the placenta. Giles et al 11reported that 7.0% of abortions were attributed to placentalinsufciency whereas Laugier et al 5discovered a much lower incidence (1.7%) of both of these causesof abortion. Umbilical cord torsions were the major cause (60%) of noninfectious abortions according to a re-cent review in France while Hong et al 12in the United States showed that only 5% of noninfectiouscauses were due to umbilical cord pathology. 5The French study consisted of 49.6% Thoroughbreds while the American study was comprised of 75%Thoroughbreds. Whitwell 7has stressed that many fetal deaths of unknown cause in the last trimesterof gestation coincide with cords longer than 80 cm,which suggests that these abortions could be linkedto undiagnosed abnormalities of the umbilical cord.These include edema of the cord, sacculation of thecord, excessive torsion, and strangulation of thecord. All of which were noted to cause impairmentof the blood supply to the fetus, thus resulting inabortion. Characteristic signs of torsion includeexcessive torsion of the umbilicus, stricture, dila-tions umbilical vein, as well as hem-orrhagic edema throughout the cord (Fig. 10). Body pregnancies are generally not as common as other causes of abortion. Body pregnancies are de-ned as fetal development within the uterine bodyand can cause marked problems with the developingfetus. These pregnancies usually result in earlygestation abortion, premature foal, or a dysmaturefoal. The placenta will have a very enlarged por-tion where it was in contact with the body of theuterus and the horns will be underdeveloped and thesame size.4. Discussion There are many causes of equine abortion and identication could aid in further prevention of sub-sequent abortions. Performing a necropsy to diag-nose the cause is very important as well as arelatively simple and straightforward procedure.Using this technique will enable the practitioner toevaluate a majority of the fetus, placenta, and um-bilical cord during sample collection. Some diagno-ses (ascending bacterial placentitis, excessive cordtorsion, or EVH-1) may be evident during evaluationand tissue collection. This quick diagnosis willhelp the practitioner take appropriate preventativeactions on the farm to prevent further cases. Byperforming this service, your practice cannot onlyprot from the procedure but have the potential ofincreasing revenue from additional services (vacci-nations, ultrasound evaluations, medical therapeu-tics) for the remaining population of pregnantmares. Field necropsy of an aborted fetus can betime consuming during breeding season if the abovetechnique is followed; therefore, submission of anintact fetus may be necessary in the busy season. Proper tissue handling can decrease the amount of bacterial contamination and increase the numberof diagnostic samples. Having a well-lit and cleanenvironment to perform the procedure will improveyour quality of work and increase the chance ofgetting an accurate diagnosis. Evaluation and tis-sue collection of the placenta and umbilicus is per-formed prior to fetal examination. The fetus isexamined for congenital anomalies and tissue collec-tion is performed with clean instruments and gloves.Most state diagnostic laboratories offer an abortionpanel that will include testing for aerobic culture,virology, and histopathology. Aerobic culture sam-ples are taken prior to those for histopathology.Bags aand small containers with 10% formalin are used for culture and histopathology samples, respec-tively. Once the procedure is complete, propercleanup and body disposal is imperative to limitcontaminants to personnel and to the farm.

Large-scale studies de-scribing the presentation, treatment, and factors asso-ciated with prognosis of uterine tears are lacking. 2. Materials and Methods Medical records of 92 mares diagnosed with uterinetears by vaginal exam, exploratory surgery, or nec-ropsy were reviewed. 3. Results The most common reasons for mares presenting forevaluation were colic, fever, and tachycardia post-partum. Most mares that presented /H1135012 hours post-partum had clinical peritonitis characterizedby peritoneal fluid with /H1102210,000 WBC/dL. Short- term survival for mares that were treated surgicallywas 78% (69/88). Tears were more commonly lo-cated in the uterine horns as opposed to the body.Additional pathology besides a solitary uterine tearwas discovered within the abdomen in 23% (20/86) ofmares that were treated surgically. Of mares bredthe same year as a uterine tear 64% (18/28) carrieda foal to term and 77% (33/43) of mares bred the yearfollowing a uterine tear carried a foal to term. 4.

Uterine cyst laser photoabla-tion was performed previously in 39 barren mares;26 were reported to have conceived a foal after the procedure. The purpose of this study was to exam-ine the results of photoablation of uterine cysts inmares adversely affected by uterine cysts, particu-larly foaling rates. 2. Materials and Methods Medical records of 66 Thoroughbred broodmaresthat had uterine cyst photoablation were re-viewed. Age, breed, parity, pertinent history,number of cysts, and location of cysts wereanalyzed with postoperative foaling rates to iden-tify factors that influenced ability to carry a foal toterm.3. Results and Discussion A total of 45 uterine cyst laser ablation procedures was performed on 42 broodmares. In the rst yearafter uterine cyst laser all breedings combined was 66.7% (58/87).Younger mares (17 years or less) were more likely tocarry a foal to term after laser cyst ablation thanolder 17 years): 96% versus58%, respectively (P /H110050.0023).

Materials and Methods Young (n /H1100510), middle aged (n /H1100515), and old mares (n/H1100515) of mixed breeds were examined using trans- rectal ultrasonography to monitor follicular growthand determine antral follicle count throughout twoconsecutive estrous cycles. 3. Results and Discussion Older mares had a tendency to ovulate smaller fol-licles. Neither follicular growth rate nor the num-ber of ovulations or the length of luteal phase wasinfluenced by age. Interovulatory intervals and fol-licular phases were longer in aged mares while theday of deviation occurred later. As mare's age in-creased, mares with low antral follicle counts hadlonger interinterovulatory intervals and follicularphases than mares with medium or high antral fol-licle count (AFC).

Introduction Induced abortion is a common practice among Polo horse breeders. The reproductive events afterabortion are not clear. 2. Materials and Methods Recipient mares from an equine embryo transfercenter in Argentina were used. Mares werescanned to record ovarian structures and for fetalsexing. Mares carrying a male fetus (n /H1100532) were aborted by transcervical administration of clospros-tenol (PGF). Mares carrying a female fetus (n /H11005 25) were used as controls. Plasma samples wereassayed for equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG)and progesterone. 3. Results Most treated mares expelled the fetus within 48 hours of treatment (27/32). The others required retreatment (n /H110052) or had a dead fetus manually removed from the reproductive tract (n /H110053). The mean interval from abortion to rst ovulation was28.5 days, range 5 to 65 days. Twelve mares ovu- lated within 15 days after abortion without forminga luteinized unruptured follicle (LUF). Two maresentered anestrus without ovulation LUF forma-tion. Of the mares with anovulatory cycles, 11/18(61%) showed a well-dened estrus with edema with premature luteiniza-tion and hemorrhage of the dominant folliclewithout ovulation (LUF). The remainder (7/18; 39%), also had LUF cycles but without estrus signs. Aborted mares were reused and got pregnant againfollowing embryo transfer (18/20; 90%). 4.

The objective of thisstudy was to evaluate the pregnancy rates obtainedfrom vitried blastocysts that were previously ex-posed to low-temperature storage. 2. Materials and Methods Three cooling treatments were tested: no cooling,12-hour, and 24-hour cooling. A total of 19 blasto-cysts (376 to 1584 /H9262m) were used. The embryo distribution between treatments was: ve Day 8non-cooled, ve Day 8 cooled for 12 hours, four Day8 cooled for 24 hours, one Day 7 cooled for 12 hours,and four Day 7 cooled for 24 hours. Cooling treat-ments (7-10\u00b0C) were performed by the utilization ofa passive cooling device bfollowed by a standard vitrication protocol with modications.a 3.

Introduction Expulsion of the fetal membranes after delivery of a foal is generally an uncomplicated event. Normalfetal membrane expulsion occurs 1 to 2 hours afterdelivery of the foal. Fetal membranes are consid-ered retained in the mare if they are not expelled by3 hours after delivery. 1,2The incidence of retained fetal membranes is not high, with reports of mem-branes being retained in about 2-10.6% of post-partum mares. foaling (dystocia, prolonged gestation, placentitis, Caesarean section,or hydropic conditions) have been known to result inretained fetal membranes although no direct rela-tionship exists between foaling abnormalities andincidence of retained fetal membranes. Breed pre-dilection for retained fetal membranes has beenidentied. Friesian mares are reported to have ahigh incidence (/H1102250%) of retained fetal mem-branes. 3A similar rate of membrane retention (42% over 4 years) was recently reported in Stan-dardbred mares from New Zealand. 4 The pathophysiology of membrane retention in mares has not been elucidated; therefore, preventa-tive and/or treatment strategies are largely empiri- cal. It has been postulated that myometrialexhaustion 1,5after dystocia or prolonged delivery and/or inadequate oxytocin release contribute to re-tained fetal membranes in mares. Varying por-tions of the membranes may be retained with thenon-gravid horn or the allantochorion being themost common portion of the membranes to be re-tained. Complications of retained fetal membranescan range from none to toxic metritis, septicemia,and laminitis. 1,5Given the life-threatening nature of these conditions, retained fetal membranes areconsidered an emergent condition requiring imme-diate treatment. Treatment for retained fetal membranes centers on prompt removal of the membranes. The tra-ditional methods used to recover retained fetalmembranes include administration of 1,6 (repeated oxytocin injections [10-20 IU IM every1-2 1.5 IUoxytocin/minute [60-100 IU oxytocin in 1 litersaline of calciumborogluconate, 7repeated uterine lavage, the 478 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSCUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGY NOTESBurn's technique [for intact membranes],8and manual removal of membranes). Umbilical ar- tery infusion of bacterial collagenase has also beenused to treat retained fetal membranes in mares. 9 The method selected for removal of retained fetalmembranes is dependent on effectiveness, safety,cost, and convenience. Mares housed in hospitalconditions or on well-managed farms can be ad-ministered drugs frequently such as multipledoses of oxytocin. Further, mares housed underintensive management conditions can be moni-tored closely for secondary conditions to retainedfetal membranes such as toxemia, laminitis, anduterine prolapse. Mares housed in general eldconditions without ready access to veterinary caremay require more rapid, but safe, management ofretained fetal membranes. This paper describes a novel and practical ap- proach to removing retained fetal membranes usinga low-pressure infusion of water into the umbilicalvasculature. This procedure causes stretching ofthe umbilical vessels, interstitial swelling of themembranes, and subsequent detachment of the mi-crovilli, resulting in rapid and gentle separation ofthe fetal membranes from the endometrium. 2. Materials and Methods Between 2007 and 2015, 147 broodmares with re-tained fetal membranes longer than 3 hours weretreated by low-pressure infusion water into eitherthe umbilical artery or vein. The mares were alllocated in the Netherlands and consisted of 47 Frie-sian mares (32%), six Draft horse mares (4%), normal parturi-tion, dystocia, abortion, or stillbirth. Maresundergoing Cesarean section were not included inthis report. Initial treatment of mares consisted of a maxi- mum of three oxytocin a(10-20 IU, IM) injections every 1-2 hours. Mares that did not expel fetalmembranes after oxytocin administration under-went infusion of the umbilical vasculature. Mareswere restrained in stocks or in a box stall. Theperineal area of the mare was cleaned prior to theprocedure. Immediately before starting the proce-dure, mares were administered oxytocin a(10-20 IU IM). A foal nasogastric tube or stallion catheter(with a maximum external diameter of 9 mm) wasattached to a water hose using a hose connector withflow control valve (Figs. 1 and 2). An umbilicalvessel (vein or artery, both are equally effective) wasincised longitudinally using a standard scalpel blade(Fig. 3). The catheter, attached to the flow controltting on the garden hose, was slowly advanced upthe vessel under low water pressure until it couldnot be advanced further (Figs. 4 and 5). The veter-inarian manually held the tube in situ and adjustedthe water flow depending on the physical reactionsof the mare (Fig. 6). In mares showing mild dis-comfort (shifting weight, mild efforts to kick), fluidflow was discontinued for a short period to allow themare to relax and progress of placental release to beassessed. If the membranes remained rmly of intravascular fluid infusion,gentle traction was placed on the neck of the mem-branes at the mare's vulva. Traction was contin-ued until the membranes were released (Fig. 7), themare demonstrated discomfort, or tearing of themembranes was suspected. 3 Results In the majority of the cases (135/147; 91.8%), fullseparation and expulsion of the placenta occurredwithin umbilical vasculature infu-sion. In four mares (2.7%), incomplete separationand tearing of the membranes occurred. In all fourcases, the duration of the retained placenta was Fig. 1.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 479CUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGYunknown but likely exceeded 12-24 hours after foal- ing. It was suspected that prolonged retentionresulted in small, unrecognizable tears in the mem-branes causing subsequent tearing. In the cases ofincomplete membrane expulsion, mares underwentrepeated uterine lavage and oxytocin therapy over a3-4-day period. For eight mares (5.4%), the timefrom onset of vascular infusion to expulsion of themembranes was more than 15 minutes but less then30 minutes. Eight mares (5.4%) showed mild signsof discomfort, comparable with the discomfort expe-rienced by postpartum mares after oxytocin admin-istration or mild colic. By reducing the water flowinfusion rate, the mares experienced less pain.Two mares were treated with additional uterine la-vages for 3 days after placental removal by infusionbecause of intraluminal fluid retention in theuterus. Additional secondary side effects to theprocedure (i.e., inverted uterine horn, uterine pro-lapse, uterine artery hemorrhage, unresolvablecolic, metritis) were not noted after this procedure inany mare. Follow-up pregnancy rates were available for only a small percentage of treated mares. It was recom- Fig. 3. Incising an umbilical vessel of the placenta using a #10 scalpel blade. Fig. 4.

A total of 12 mares (all Friesian)were inseminated after the extraction of fetal mem-branes using this technique (three mares on pro-longed foal heat (ovulation by day 15-16), ve mareson the second estrus post-partum and four mares incycles 2 or 3 post-partum). All mares became preg-nant on the rst cycle of breeding.4. Discussion Regulations dictated by the Royal Netherlands Association of Veterinarians are published for thetreatment of retained fetal membranes in theNetherlands. 10Under these guidelines, manual removal of fetal membranes is mandated within 6hours postpartum if traditional methods for mem-brane removal (i.e., oxytocin administration, uter- Fig. 5. The foal nasogastric tube is advanced up the umbilical vessel, using slight water pressure, until the tube can no longer beadvanced. Fig. 6. The tube is held in place by the veterinarian while water is infused into the umbilical vessel for a period of 3-5 minutes. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 481CUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGYine lavage) fail. Because of the need to safely remove fetal membranes by 6 hours post-partum,removal using umbilical vasculature infusion wasinvestigated. Traditional manual removal of fe-tal membranes in mares (manual separation of thechorioallantois from the endometrium combinedwith twisting of the membranes) is controversialbecause of the risks of hemorrhage, impaired uter-ine involution, tearing the placenta, damage tothe endometrium, and prolapse. Similarcomplications were not noted in mares undergoingumbilical vasculature infusion. The degree withwhich the membranes were attached, as well asthe duration of membrane retention, can affect theoutcome of manual membrane removal using anyprocedure.In the described procedure the infusion of water into the allantochorion via the umbilical vasculatureappears to induce edema and swelling of the tissue(Figs. 7 and 8). It is postulated that the placentalmicrovilli stretch under pressure causing separationof the fetal membranes from the endometrium.The weight of the placenta concurrently increases(but is controlled by support from the veterinarian)and which may also enhance the separation. Fluidmay also \"leak\" into the space between the chorionand endometrium, thus facilitating further mem-brane separation. In 2014, four placentas were examined histologi- cally after performing this procedure. In addition,ve normal placentas were infused with water orsaline and samples for histology were collected be- Fig. 7. The intact (edematous) placenta is removed 10 minutes after water infusion of the umbilical vessel. Fig. 8. Severe edema in the submucosal layers and absence of erythrocytes in the vessel lumina after 5 minutes of water influx.482 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSCUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGYfore starting the infusion of water, 2 minutes later, and again 5 minutes later. Macroscopic swelling ofthe placenta was seen and the maximum increase inweight was 100%. Histology showed interstitialedema in all layers of the placenta and distinctwashing out of erythrocytes in the vessels in theplacentas treated with plain water and saline (Fig.8). In the water-treated group, additional hydropicdegeneration of the epithelial cells, consisting of cellswelling and karyopyknosis could be appreciatedwhen compared with the non-treated placenta, pos-sibly due to the osmotic swelling of these cells (Figs.8 and 9). Low water pressure seems to induce suf-cient edema and cellular degeneration to facilitatedetachment of the membranes. This osmotic swell-ing and cellular degeneration results in a more rapidseparation of the chorioallantois from the endome-trium (/H11021 10 min), than is reported after hydrolyzing the placental structures by umbilical artery injec-tion of bacterial collagenase (/H11021 6h ) 9and is also more rapid compared with the Burn's technique,8which is somewhat similar in its approach. Furthermore,infusion of the umbilical vasculature of retainedmembranes is not fully reliant on an intact placenta.In those cases that resulted in delayed release ofmembranes or incomplete expulsion, the inability toinduce the interstitial edema of the placental tissuesmay have occurred due to tissue autolysis (afterdelayed treatment) and leaking of the membranes.The water-induced degeneration of the epithelium,which probably enhanced the membrane separation,probably did not occur in these cases. It was clearfrom this group of mares that the umbilical vascularinfusion procedure for membrane removal was moresuccessful in mares having retained membranes lessthan 12 hours in duration. There are several advantages to using this method for gentle but manual removal of retainedfetal membranes in mares. A primary advantage issafety for both the mare and the veterinarian.Furthermore, the method is hygienic, noninvasive,rapid, and effective. It is very useful in small po-nies or Miniature horse mares where management through uterine lavage or manual removal oftenleads to discomfort and resistance of the mare.Few mares undergoing this procedure showed sig-nicant signs of discomfort. In mares that becameuncomfortable, reduction in water pressure quicklyresolved signs of discomfort. A second advantageto this procedure is rapid removal of membranes inmost cases. For veterinarians traveling long dis-tances to treat mares with retained fetal mem-branes, prompt resolution of the condition can beessential to the wellbeing of the mare given thatreturn trips can be challenging. In the reportedgroup of mares, little subsequent treatment was nec-essary once the membranes were removed. Ad-junct therapy oxytocin would be benecial in somecases. In summary, medical management of retained fe- tal membranes using oxytocin is the preferred rsttreatment method in most mares. However, theresults of this report suggest that the treatment ofretained placenta in 147 mares by infusion of waterinto the umbilical vessels is an effective and practi-cal tool for the equine veterinarian. Little equip-ment is required other than a stallion catheter (orfoal nasogastric tube), hose adapter, and gardenhose. The procedure is easy to perform and resultsin expulsion of membranes in less than 10 minutesin most cases. Mares tolerate the procedure well,making it safe for both the mare and the veterinar-ian. The procedure was atraumatic and effectivewhen performed in membranes retained for lessthan 12 hours in this group of mares.

Introduction Pregnancies insemination with cryopreserved epididymal stallion sperm wererst reported in 1957, 1and the technique is now used in the clinical setting as a means of preserving thegenetics of valuable stallions that have died unexpect-edly, require castration of one or both testicles, or areotherwise affected by a condition that renders semencollection difcult or impossible. Since 1957, rene-ment of the technique for harvesting epididymalsperm has resulted in a signicant increase in thenumber of sperm recovered from each epididymis, andconsequently an increase in the number of insemina-tion doses banked. 2This has made the process more cost effective for the stallion owner. In addition, ithas been shown that epididymal sperm can be stored within the epididymis for up to 24 hours at 5 oC before harvest and cryopreservation without a signicantloss in post-thaw motility, which makes it more con-venient for the practitioner. 2-5 Despite these advances in technique, however, difculties associated with shipment and the highprice tag that comes with the processing and cryo- preservation in the referral setting has restrictedits use for only the most valuable of proven breed-ing studs. What's more, this procedure has re-cently fallen under scrutiny from the standpoint offertility due to a wide range of published preg-nancy rates in mares bred with cryopreservedstallion epididymal sperm. 6-9 The ability for veterinarians to process and cryo- preserve epididymal sperm from stallions in housewould likely make this service available for a largerportion of the practice population. In practiceswhere ejaculated semen is already being collectedand cryopreserved, there is very little additionalequipment and subsequent monetary investmentnecessary for processing sperm from the epididymis.As such, successful cryopreservation of epididymalsperm is more directly related to the practitioner'sknowledge of the most current techniques and prin-ciples. One advantage that ambulatory equine vet-erinarians have over most referral practices is theeasy access to testicles from routine castrations.The ability to practice this technique on discarded AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 485CUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGY NOTEStesticles provides a gauge for individual results, and allows for a comfort level with the procedure beforeoffering it to client-owned animals. Once a practi-tioner becomes comfortable with the technique, it iseasy to see how bringing this procedure into theclinical setting reduces the cost not only from thestandpoint of shipping, but also by bringing the pric-ing scale down from the specialist level. The focus of this discussion is to outline the pro- cesses involved in obtainment and cryopreservationof epididymal sperm from the stallion. It will focuson methods for castration, storage of testicles priorto processing, techniques for processing of epididy-mides, sperm preparation, and sperm cryopreserva-tion. The ultimate goal is to provide practitionerswith the most current knowledge in this eld as arst step toward being able to offer this service totheir own clients in the clinical setting. 2. Materials and Methods Candidates for Epididymal Sperm Recovery In most cases, the obtainment of epididymal sperm for cryopreservation is considered for geneticallyvaluable stallions that are suffering from a terminalmedical condition. Regardless of the value of thestallion, it is important for veterinarians to considerthe effect of prior medical issues on the potentialquality of sperm that will be obtained from the epi-didymides. Stallions that have had prolonged pe-riods of elevated body temperature, have been downfor long periods of time, or are otherwise showingsigns of long-term systemic compromise are lesslikely to have good-quality sperm that will result ina high number of progressively motile cells in thepost-thaw sample. Additionally, there is a low like-lihood of acquiring good-quality epididymal spermfrom young stallions that are not sexually mature.Therefore, this procedure is best suited for sexuallymature stallions suffering from acute illness or in-jury of less than 1-2 days' duration. Castration Once the decision has been made to euthanize aterminally ill stallion and attempt to recover epidid-ymal sperm, the next step will be obtainment of thetesticles. This may be done by routine castrationtechniques; however, it is recommended that thestallion be castrated prior to administration of alethal dose of thiobarbituate. As such, a standardprotocol of diazepamand ketamine an acceptable protocol to facilitatecastration. The injection of lidocaine into the tes-ticle should be avoided to prevent laceration of theepididymal ducts or vas deferens within the sper-matic cords. If additional relaxation is necessary tocomplete the castration, this should be accomplishedby administration of additional anesthetic agents.Once anesthetized, an open castration should beperformed to allow for optimal visualization of thespermatic cords. Care should be taken to placeemasculators as high up on the cord as possible, asthis will yield the largest length of vas deferens to beremoved with the castrated testicle. Given that thevas deferens is likely to contain the most maturesperm leaving the epididymal tail, placement of aclamp across the cord just distal to the emasculatorbefore it is engaged will prevent leakage of this sperm once the testicle is removed. After re-moval of both testicles, the stallion can be eutha-nized by humane techniques prior to recoveryfrom anesthesia. Preparation of Castrated Testicles Once removed, the castrated testicles should be pre-pared immediately for processing. If castrationwas performed in the eld, the epididymides shouldbe prepared as soon as possible to prevent temper-ature fluctuations during transit. Once this tech-nique is learned, both epididymides can be removedfrom the testes immediately after castration in theeld, and placed in a single cooled semen transportdevice afor further processing in the laboratory. The testicle and associated structures should be laid out on a clean, flat surface, and the ductusdeferens must be identied within the spermaticcord where it was clamped and incised at its distalaspect. A circumferential ligature should be placedjust proximal to the clamp to prevent leakage ofsperm, after which the clamp can be removed.The ductus is then easily separated from the asso-ciated structures within the spermatic cord. Theparietal vaginal tunic may be excised where it at-taches at the ligament of the tail of the epididymisand discarded. Keep in mind that this tissue isdirectly attached to the epididymal tail; thus, greatcare must be taken not to cut into the epididymalducts when removing the parietal vaginal tunic.Next, the epididymal tail and body must be freedfrom the testicle by incision of the proper ligament ofthe testis along its length between the epididymisand testicle. At this point, a circumferential liga-ture can be placed around the body of the epididymisjust proximal to the epididymal tail to isolate thesperm between that ligature and the one at thedistal end of the ductus. The epididymis is thentransected through the body just proximal to theligature, and the epididymal tail with attached duc-tus is placed in a clean plastic bag containing 1 to 2mL of either sterile lactated Ringer's solution or askim milk and glucose-based semen extender to pre-vent desiccation. The procedure is repeatedfor the second testicle. Obtainment of Epididymal Sperm Once in the laboratory, the rst epididymis may belaid flat on a clean surface. The author prefers touse disposable bench paper to avoid potential con-tamination with spermicidal agents. The tissuesmay be kept moist by periodic irrigation with aroom-temperature, skim milk and glucose-based se- 486 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSCUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGYmen extender. The visceral vaginal tunic covering over the surface of the epididymal tail must be re-moved to allow for expansion of the ducts during theflushing process. If this tunic is not removed, it willrequire increased pressure to force extender throughthe epididymal duct, which is likely to rupture theduct prior to complete perfusion and result in lowernumbers of sperm recovered. The tunic may begrasped with Brown-Adson tissue forceps in an areaof webbing between the epididymal tail and ductusdeferens, and an initial nick is made using ne-pointed iris scissors. From this nick, the point ofthe iris scissors is inserted and the tunic is bluntlydissected away from the epididymis by spreadingthe scissors in the tissue plane parallel to the sur-face of the epididymal tail. This separation shouldbe extended from this site to include the entire epi-didymal tail until the tunic is completely dissectedaway. The same process can be repeated with thesecond epididymis. The tunic over the ductus de-ferens may be left in place, as this does not seem torestrict expansion in this region during perfusion. The distal end of the ductus deferens is then grasped between the thumb and forenger, and thecontents are squeezed proximally by 2 to 3 cm andheld in place by manually pinching off the lumen.The ligature can then be cut off of the distal endof the ductus, and a semi-rigid, 14-cm polypropyleneTom Cat catheter bcan be inserted into the lumen at the incised end. Once inserted, the pinch can bereleased, and the end of the ductus can be pushed upover the length of the catheter until it is cannulatedby 4 to 5 cm. A circumferential ligature shouldthen be placed around the catheter and ductus ap-proximately 1 to 2 cm from the catheter tip, and tiedsecurely to prevent the ductus from slipping off thecatheter during perfusion. A plastic syringe lledwith 40 mL of room-temperature skim milk andglucose-based semen extender is attached to the dis-tal end of the Tom Cat catheter. The proximal as-pect of the epididymal duct must then be incised toallow for outflow of sperm. This is accomplishedusing iris scissors and cutting away the portion ofepididymal body that was left attached to the tail.This cut should be made as close as possible to thejunction of epididymal body and tail. The epididy-mal tail is then suspended within a 50-mL polypro-pylene conical-bottomed centrifuge tube cand gradual pressure is applied to the syringe plunger tobegin retrograde displacement of sperm by semenextender. It may take 4 to 5 minutes of gradualpressure applied to the syringe plunger before thecaseous epididymal contents are seen coming fromthe proximal end of the epididymal tail, and another4 to 5 minutes to perfuse all 40 mL of semen ex-tender. Perfusion of the epididymal tail may beperformed with the entire 40 mL of extender, ordiscontinued when the efflux from the proximal endof the tail changes from caseous back to the normalcolor and viscosity of the semen extender. Once allof the extender has been flushed through the duct,the surface of the epididymis should be rinsed intothe tube with an additional 4 to 5 mL of semenextender. The same process can be repeated withthe second epididymis. If the epididymal duct ruptures during this pro- cess, this is likely the result of excessive forcesplaced on the syringe plunger in an attempt to ex-pedite the flushing process. This will appear as alarge bubble of semen extender in the supercialtissue plane of the epididymal tail or ductus. If thisis observed, the only option at this point is to placethe epididymis in a petri dish, cover it with skimmilk and glucose-based semen extender, then make20-30 cuts into the epididymis using a sharp scalpelblade. The minced epididymal tail and extendershould be left for 30-60 minutes to allow the spermto swim out of the ducts. After this time, the tissueis manually removed and rinsed back into the petridish, and the remainder of this procedure followed.This will likely result in smaller sperm numbersrecovered, as well as blood and tissue contaminationof the nal cryopreserved product. Processing of Epididymal Sperm Once the sperm has been flushed from the epididy-mal tail and resuspended in semen extender, do notbe alarmed if the sperm motility seems poor uponinitial microscopic evaluation. It is not uncommonfor epididymal sperm to dramatically increase inmotility after centrifugation, removal of the super-natant, and resuspension of the sperm pellet in cryo-preservation media. The tube(s) containing the epididymal sperm and extender is underlain with a total of 1 mL of room-temperature iodixanol-density-gradient medium d. This is accomplished by pulling the media up into a3-mL plastic syringe, attaching a 14-cm, polypropyl-ene Tom Cat catheter and advancing the tip of thecatheter to the bottom of the tube. The media isinjected slowly to form a layer below the sperm andextender, which will protect the cells from compres-sion during high-speed centrifugation. The tubeshould then be capped and centrifuged at 1000/H11003 g for 20 minutes at ambient temperature. Immedi-ately following centrifugation, the supernatantshould be aspirated off to within 2 to 3 mL of thesperm pellet. During aspiration of the superna-tant, care should be taken not to inadvertently dis-rupt the pellet because this will result in loss ofsperm into the supernatant, which will ultimatelybe discarded. Once the supernatant is removed,the polypropylene Tom Cat catheter is again in-serted, now through the sperm pellet to the bottomof the conical tube, and the iodixanol is aspiratedusing a 3-mL syringe to remove as much media aspossible without disrupting the sperm layer. At this point, the pellet can be partially resus- pended with the desired cryopreservation media.An evaluation of sperm morphology should then beperformed to determine whether there are an ac-ceptable number of normal cells to proceed with AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 487CUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGYcryopreservation. Keep in mind that many sperm in the epididymis will still have cytoplasmic drop-lets, and in the author's experience, pregnancieshave been obtained using frozen-thawed epididymalsperm with high numbers of both proximal and dis-tal cytoplasmic droplets. Once sperm morphologyis deemed acceptable, the sample can be partiallyextended with cryopreservation media. Given thatthe total number of sperm recovered is not known atthis point, only a small volume of media should beadded to avoid overextending the sperm to a lowerconcentration than desired. The tube should begently agitated until the fluid contents look uniform,and the sperm concentration should then be deter-mined. The additional volume of cryopreservationmedia can then be calculated to reach the desiredconcentration, after which the epididymal spermshould be evaluated for motility. A dramatic im-provement in sperm motility over that seen inthe precentrifugation sample is often realized at thispoint, and it is not uncommon to nd pre-freezeprogressive sperm motilities of greater than 70%.If sperm progressive motility is less than 30% at thistime, it is not likely that sperm motility in the post-thaw sample will meet industry standards set forthfor frozen ejaculated semen. The technique forloading and freezing straws is identical to that forcryopreservation of ejaculated semen; therefore,package directions for the specic cryopreservationmedia should be followed. 3. Results To date, the author has performed this procedureusing the aforementioned technique on seven stal-lions suffering from terminal illness, and on threestallions for which the owners wished to preserveepididymal sperm after castration to supplementthe bank of ejaculated sperm that had already beenfrozen. In addition, the author has processed epi-didymal sperm from 15 sets of stallion testicles aspart of a study to evaluate the fertility of cryopre-served epididymal sperm. For the stallions suffering from terminal illness, ve of the seven cases resulted in the obtainment ofcryopreserved epididymal sperm with a progressivemotility greater than the minimum industry stan-dard of 30%. The stallions in the remaining twocases were suffering from conditions that renderedthem unable to stand for more than 4 days prior toeuthanasia, and it was therefore not surprising thatthe epididymal sperm exhibited a progressive motil-ity of less than 30% in the pre-freeze sample and wasnot worth moving forward to the cryopreservationprocess. Of the 15 sets of stallion testicles processed as part of our study, 13 yielded cryopreserved epididy-mal sperm with acceptable post-thaw motility.The remaining two sets of testicles contained insuf-cient sperm numbers to provide the necessarynumber of breeding doses, and were therefore notprocessed further for freezing. Although these stal-lions t the study requirement for age, the lowsperm numbers were thought to be the result ofdelayed sexual maturity in theses animals. With regard to fertility of the epididymal sperm, breeding results from only one of the clinical caseshas been reported thus far, and a pregnancy wasachieved on the rst breeding attempt with thatsperm. Of the 13 sets of testicles processed as partof our study using standard techniques, seven of the13 mares achieved pregnancy. Although most ofthe stallion epididymal sperm that has been pro- cessed in our clinical labs does not have fertilitydata to date, the results achieved as part of ourproject make it very clear that successful preg-nancy can be achieved employing the techniquepreviously outlined. 4. Discussion Despite the ability to successfully cryopreserve stal-lion epididymal sperm, the assumption that it is lessfertile than ejaculated sperm has been a major im-pediment to its widespread use in clinical practice. Looking back in the literature, only four studieshave reported on pregnancy rates in mares bredwith cryopreserved stallion epididymal sperm.The rst two employed a variety of different sperm- processing methods, breeding dosages, and insemi-nation techniques, and these studies reportedpregnancy rates ranging from 7 to 30%. 6,7These pregnancy rates are considerably lower than thosetypically reported for cryopreserved ejaculatedsperm. 8,9The remaining two studies employed a recently developed stallion freezing extenderethat contains soy lecithin and dimethylformamide,among other proprietary ingredients, to process ep-ididymal sperm. 10,11These studies employed the same sperm processing and insemination tech-niques, and reported a substantial increase in post-thaw per-cycle pregnancy rates ranging from 61to 92%. 10,11These most recent pregnancy results equal or exceed those achieved with cryopreservedejaculated sperm, which will likely make cryopreser-vation of epididymal sperm a much more clinicallyappealing technique. Factors contributing to the higher pregnancy rates in these studies remain to be delineated, butcould be attributed to a variety of factors includingdifferences in study protocol, insemination dose, ex-tender type, and inherent fertility of the individualstallion. The author is currently attempting to fur-ther validate the results of the two high-pregnancy-rate studies using cryopreserved stallion epididymalsperm. Our study employed the same techniquesand commercially available freezing extender e, and our ndings seem to be in keeping with those stud-ies. Given that the freezing extender eused in this study has been shown to result in signicantimprovements in post-thaw epididymal sperm mea-sures when compared with other selected extend-ers, 10it is tempting to speculate that this extender may be responsible for the improved pregnancy 488 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSCUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGYrates, and therefore may offer advantages over other extenders for the cryopreservation of epididymalsperm. Although further research is necessary tovalidate this theory, as a practitioner offering thisservice, it is comforting to know that clients whoinvest the money to preserve their stallions' geneticsby cryopreservation of epididymal sperm may beable to expect higher pregnancy rates than previ-ously thought possible.

In addition, late-term pregnancyloss may cause emotional stress to the owner withhigh expectations for the foal from a particular mat- ing. Therefore, means to manage and to preventpregnancy loss are warranted. Placental pathology/insufciency was identied in a large retrospective study as being responsible forgreater than 60% of pregnancy losses due to abor-tion, stillbirth, and neonatal death (up to 24 h post-delivery) in central Kentucky. 3Two additional retrospective studies conducted several years apartby the same referral diagnostic laboratory supported the nding that placentitis is the most commoncause of late pregnancy loss in mares. 4,5Outside North America, placentitis has been identied as animportant cause of pregnancy loss in mares in Bra- zil, 6,7France,8and Australia.9However, in the United Kingdom umbilical cord pathology (e.g., tor-sion and entrapments) was the leading cause ofpregnancy loss in submissions received by onediagnostic laboratory. 10Differences between the United Kingdom and other parts of the world may beaccounted for by the methodology applied to diag-nose placentitis, type of placentas presenting lesionssubmitted for pathologic examination, and the pres-ence of certain microorganisms (e.g., nocardioformorganisms), as well as potential differences in trueincidence. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made regarding our understanding of equine 490 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSCUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGY NOTESplacentitis through controlled and eld studies car- ried out in different parts of the world. Reviewscovering equine placentitis have been published, 11,12 with one recent review emphasizing the immuno-logic aspects of the preterm delivery in mares. 13 The following review aims to present a comprehen-sive review of classical and recent ndings regardingequine placentitis. 2. Etiopathogenesis and Epidemiology Several infectious agents have been recovered fromplacentitis cases; bacteria are responsible for thelarge majority of cases and fungi for the minority(Table 1). Bacterial agents lusssp. and Candida albicans.4Mixed bacterial and fungal infections have been reported in ascend-ing, however, less commonly. Anecdotally, it seemsthat some cases start with bacterial placentitis andthen fungal secondary infections follow the primarybacterial infection. The incidence of leptospiral infections causing abortions is highly variable across the years in cen-tral Kentucky. 4,5,15In North America, the serovar Pomona type Kennewicki is the most important type associated with Leptospiral abortions in mares16; however, in other parts of the the serovarsBratislava, Grippotyphosa, Copenhageni, Autumna-lis, Hebdomadis, inmares. 17Environmental conditions such as precip- itation and flooding are alleged to be important in the dissemination of the bacteria from wildlife to horses,which are considered incidental hosts. Wild animalsincluding raccoons, white-tailed deer, striped skunks,opossums, and foxes are known to harbor the serovarPomona and are thought to serve as a source of infec-tion for pregnant mares. 5,18 Based upon morphologic lesions and suggested pathogenesis, there are four types of placentitis, the hemolytic streptococciand equi Streptomyces (Streptomyces atriruber placentitis cases.20 A multifocal distribution pattern is rare but is sporad-ically seen in isolated cases in association with fungi orbacteria. 4,5Diffuse placentitis is diagnosed in iso- lated cases in association with bacteria or fungi, orduring outbreaks in association with Leptospirosis(Fig. 1D). Nocardioform placentitis has periodically been the placentitis in centralKentucky 4,21with the 2010-2011 foal crop central Kentucky experiencing an exceptionallyhigh nocardioform cases (Fig. were for 85% of cases submitted duringthat period, 14with lesions compatible with nocardio- form placentitis present without an identied iso-late in the remainder of cases. Based on thesecases it seems that Crossiella equi infections may be more likely to result in abortion, whereas infectionswith other type actinomycetes tend to result in livebut premature foals. 19It is worth noting that, to date, nocardioform organisms have only been iso-lated from clinical placentitis cases and not from theenvironment. 19 Bacteria causing nocardioform placentitis and other actinomycetes that affect horses differ in theirpropensity to infect not only the fetal membranesbut also the offspring in utero. For instance, mares affected by Cellulosimicrobium cellulans in Ken- present the actinomycetes Cellulosimicrobium sp and Cellulomonas sp, along with other nonspecic bacterial species, have beenassociated with mucoid placentitis and fetal lesionsin equine amnionitis infect utero asreported in other types of mucoid placentitis; nocardioform placentitis is re-stricted to chorioallantois. 19 Infectious agents associated with ascending pla- centitis seems to enter the uterus via the vagina/cervix and then colonize the caudal pole of thechorioallantois (Fig. 4). 11Once infection is estab- lished, clinical signs such as premature udder devel-Table 1.

Prema-ture mammary gland development is not a patho-gnomonic sign of placentitis, but rather a nonspecicsign of pending late-term pregnancy loss, which canbe associated with a variety of other conditions in-cluding twin pregnancy, umbilical cord torsion, andidiopathic/unspecic imminent abortion. 12Prema- derived from the fetoplacentalunit). 23,24Enlargement of the mammary gland may be observed in mares suffering with hydrops,pre-pubic tendon rupture (in which mammaryglands may be lled with serosanguinous or bloodymaterial until the placental lesions arewell advanced (e.g., placental separation; Fig. 5).Vulvar discharge is highly variable as the dischargecan be smeared by and accumulate under the tailand easily be missed, without close and frequentmonitoring. If early treatment is not instituted thelesions will progress, and the infectious agent(s)may gain access to the fetus (Fig. 4). Anecdotally,it has long been suggested that infectious agentsgain access through the fetus by infecting the allan-toic and amniotic fluids. A large group of mareswith experimentally induced placentitis had nega-tive bacterial culture of the allantoic fluid despiteextensive inflammatory changes in the fetus andchorioallantois and positive bacterial culture, sug-gesting that contamination of the fetal fluids are nota primary route of fetal infection. 26 Infection of the chorioallantois is associated with inflammation, which results in increased prosta-glandin concentration in the fetal fluids and mem-branes with increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. 27Lesions in Fig. 1.

Foals born alive from mareswith placentitis may be septic and may demandintensive veterinary critical care. In addition, de-spite treatment pre-partum and post-delivery thereis no guarantee that the foal will be athleticallysound. A recent retrospective study conducted incentral Kentucky concluded that Thoroughbredhorses delivered from mares suspected of havingand treated for placentitis were not different fromtheir cohort related to athletic outcome measured asnumber of starts, wins, places, shows, and amountsearned as 2-year-olds. 28This study illustrates that mares suffering with placentitis may produce a suc-cessful athlete. Intuitively, early diagnosis and ap-propriate treatment are likely to improve the odds ofdelivering a live and useful foal. Placentitis accelerates the hypothalamic-pitu- itary-adrenal axis maturation, which is in contrastwith premature labor associated with othercauses. 12,13Mares with placentitis may deliver live and viable foals by 310 days of gestation,12,29 whereas dead or unviable foals are more com-monly delivered from pregnancies of comparablegestational age of mares without placentitis thatare interrupted early. The mechanisms associ-ated with survival of preterm foals from mareswith placentitis are unclear, but it has been sug-gested that it is related to a premature increase infetal adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) andcortisol. Different from other species, nal mat-uration of the equine fetal hypothalamic-pitu-itary-adrenal axis occurs in the few daysimmediately preceding normal parturition andcontinues during the rst several weeks after Fig. 2.

Nocardioform placentitis was rst recognized ap- proximately 20 years ago in central Kentucky 32; however, little is known regarding the pathogenesisof this disease. Lesions in this type of placentitisare located in the uterine body and base of the uter-ine horns with no association with the cervicalstar. 4,15As a consequence, vulvar discharge is not commonly observed in the mare with nocardioformplacentitis unless the mare is about to abort.Based upon submissions to a referral laboratory in central Kentucky, Crossiella equi seems to be more pathogenic than Amycolatopsis species, as more mares infected with Crossiella equi tend to abort, whereas more mares infected with Amycolatopsis ssp tend to deliver live, premature foals. Becausenocardioform infection is constrained to the chorio-allantois (i.e., amnion, umbilical cord and fetus arenot affected), 4,19chorionitis and induced placental insufciency (i.e., in-utero growth restriction) arethought to be responsible for the fetal maturation.At present, the lack of an experimental model toassess changes induced by nocardioform placentitispreclude any further conclusion. Unfortunately, ina recent study involving a large group of mares wewere unable to induce nocardioform placentitis inmares receiving the Crossiella intrauterine during oral, and intrapharyngeal administra-tion of Crossiella equi did not in pathological evidence of nocardio-form placentitis. These ndings demonstrate thatthis type of placentitis is not induced simply by thepresence of nocardioform microorganisms. 19 Little is known about the pathogenesis of diffuse or multifocal placentitis. It has been suggestedthat the microorganisms reach the uterus hematog-enously; however, there has been speculation thatmultifocal placentitis is the result of a dormant chronic infection of the uterus that became active laterin pregnancy. In multifocal placentitis, lesions can beconned to the chorion and may also be present on theallantoic surface. 5Leptospira, the most important cause of hematogenous (or diffuse) placentitis, is be-lieved to gain access to the uterus through the sys-temic circulation. Leptospiral lesions includeamnionitis, funisitis, and acute inflammatory changesin chorioallantois. 4,15Interestingly, leptospiral abortions are associated with high immunoglobulintiters in maternal and fetal plasma, different thanother types of placentitis. 17Leptospira is believed to cause abortion directly by infection of the fetoplacentalunit, but it seems that systemic inflammation in asso-ciation with hyperthermia and prostaglandin produc-tion may contribute to the pregnancy loss. 3. Experimental Model for Bacterial Placentitis in Mares Experimental models for abortigenic diseases in do-mestic animals vary according to the animal species,infectious agent, And natural route of infection, aswell as the ability of the organism to survive in theenvironment. Different routes of infection havebeen used to induce disease experimentally in vari-ous species of domestic animals; some models in-volve a vector that is important in the naturalinfection (e.g., Foot Hill Abortion in cattle), in othermodels, macerated tissues obtained from abortedmaterials are directly administered to susceptibleanimals. In the present review, only equine modelswill be briefly reviewed. To date there is only oneeffective model to experimentally induce bacterialplacentitis in mares. The model was initially de-scribed by Dr. Michelle LeBlanc's group at the Uni-versity of Florida. 33The model involves the inoculation of a pathogenic strain of Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (107to 109cfu) into the cervix of mares during the third trimester ofpregnancy. Since the original description of themodel, it has been used by other researchers withvery predictable outcomes. 34-38One of the limita- tions of this research model is that a large inoculumis administered to mares intracervically, with a re-sulting acute ascending placentitis and rapid abor-tion. This clinical presentation seems much morerapid than seen in spontaneous placentitis, whichtends to be insidious and chronic. Therefore, stud-ies to address diagnostic makers and treatmentstrategies should be interpreted with caution re-garding the differences in clinical presentation ofspontaneous and experimental placentitis. Re-cently, our group modied the original model to in-duce placentitis in a method that seems to be less Fig. 5. Transrectal ultrasonography of the caudal pole of thechorioallantois.

We also reduced the inoculating dose toa 5 million colony-forming unit. 38The use of a small volume reduces spilling in the vagina andprobable vaginitis. Mares in our study aborted onaverage approximately 10 days post-inoculation. 38 4. Diagnosis Diagnosis of placentitis is based on ultrasonographyand clinical signs (i.e., premature lactation and/orvulvar discharge). 9,11,12,39Transrectal ultrasonogra- phy of the commonly used todiagnose ascending placentitis 1(Fig. 5). While per- forming this technique, the operator should make aslight off midline alignment of the transducer withthe cervix and ventral aspect of the caudal pole toassure that a branch of uterine artery/cranial vagi-nal artery is imaged. Three measurements areusually taken of the combined thickness of uterusand placenta (CTUP) and the values can be com-pared with reported normal ranges. 36,40Increased CTUP associated with clinical signs and areas ofplacental separation are suggestive of ascendingplacentitis. 12Measures of CTUP outside the nor- mal published ranges does not necessarily indicateplacentitis, 2but rather normal variation, and attimes artefacts associated with improper use of thetechnique. Interestingly, there seems to be smallvariations in normal CTUP between studies andbreeds. 1,36,40-42In a Dutch study, parity was re- ported to have effects on values of CTUP, i.e., nul-liparous mares presented higher values comparedwith multiparous mares. 41Despite the widespread use of transrectal ultrasonography to diagnose as-cending placentitis, data on sensitivity and specic-ity are scant. Doppler ultrasonography has become a popular tool in equine practice; however, its use to diagnoseplacentitis in mares remains questionable. A re-cent work addressed the hypothesis of whether ar-terial blood flow changes before other clinical andultrasonographic changes associated with placenti-tis are noted; however, experimentally induced pla-centitis in pony mares did not change the arteryblood flow. 42A recent work carried out with Warm- blood mares in Germany suggested that the total artery blood flow was reduced preceding idiopathicabortion in four mares. 43These authors also suggested that three other mares suffering spon-taneous placentitis had changes in blood flow.However, it is unclear whether comparisons weremade across groups of healthy mares and maressuffering with placentitis. Results from this re-port are not unequivocal whether changes in bloodflow precede other ultrasonographic changes (e.g.,increased CTUP, placental separation) and clini-cal signs commonly seen in placentitis mares (e.g., Fig. 6. The photographs illustrate the common events associated with a research model for ascending placentitis in mares. A,Edema can be observed in the ventral aspect of the chorioallantois.

Transabdominal ultrasonographic examination of the fetus and placenta has been used as a tool toassess fetal and placental health. 44This approach is a particularly useful clinical tool in suspectednocardioform placentitis. 12,45However, given that a very limited area of the uterus is accurately visu-alized by transabdominal ultrasonographic exami-nation, the lack of apparent lesions in thechorioallantois does not exclude the possibility ofdisease. Areas of placental separation with hyper-echoic exudate 12,45Presumptive diagnosis nocardioform placentitis can be challenging, especially if only asmall area is affected. Fetal heart rate monitoring and ultrasonographic character of the fetal fluids can also be evaluatedby transrectal and transabdominal ultrasonogra-phy. 36,44Reduced or increased fetal heart rates (normal heart rate, /H1101180 beats/min during late preg- nancy) are associated with poor pregnancy out-come. 12,44Increased echogenicity of the fetal fluids are associated with imminent abortion.12It is worth noting that the echogenicity of the amnioticfluid increases with gestational age, 36probably re- lated to the vernix being released by the fetus.However, fetal stress (e.g., colic surgery, fetal hyp-oxia by different reasons) may result in fetal diar-rhea, and echogenicity of the amniotic fluid mayincrease remarkably as a consequence of solid par-ticles floating in the amniotic fluid. The normalamnion appears as a thin membrane surroundingthe fetus; amnionitis can be observed by ultrasonog-raphy as a thickened and irregular amnioticmembrane. 12 Cytology and culture swabs obtained from the ex- ternal cervical os in pregnant mares can be bene-cial in cases of ascending placentitis, when thecervix is open and discharge is present (Fig. 7). 11 Samples for culture and cytology can be collectedwith the use of a double-guarded cytobrush/swab viavaginoscopy or manually with a sterile sleeve. Thepresence of neutrophils, bacteria, and/or fungal hy-phae will aid the presumptive diagnosis and givesome clues regarding the type infection(i.e., Gram-positive/negative and shape, or pres-ence of hyphae) while waiting for further diagnostictests. The denitive diagnosis of placentitis is attained by pathologic and microbiologic examination of theplacenta. 3-5,14Ordinarily, the placenta should be laid out in an \"F\" (when the allantoic surface is beingexamined) or \"Y\" (when the chorionic surface is be-ing examined) shape, thereafter the chorionic sur-face of the chorioallantois is examined andsampled. 4,46Macroscopic examination of the pla- centa allows determination of the affected areas,classication of the lesions, and sampling for furtherexaminations (i.e., histopathology and microbiologicevaluations). The placenta should be inverted toexpose the allantoic surface of the chorioallantois;similarly, the placenta should be laid out in an \"F\"shape, the amnion and umbilical cord should bespread out, examined, and sampled for pathologicexamination. 4,46Affected areas, normal tissues, and areas of transition between the normal andaffected tissues should be sampled from the chorio-allantois, amnion, and umbilical cord. 4,46 As part of the diagnostic testing for abortion cases, swabs should be collected from affected placentaltissues and then used for bacterial culture and poly-merase chain reaction (PCR) testing for abortigenicinfectious agents equine arteritis virus). 5,17,47Fetal tis- sues (brain, liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and lungs)and fetal body fluids (heart blood, thoracic, and ab-dominal fluids) can be used for diagnostic test-ing. 5,17,47Fragments of placenta and fetal tissues can be collected, pooled, and used for culture andPCR testing. 5,14,17,47A combination of different di- agnostic methods will improve the diagnostic ac-curacy. However, despite extensive testing, inapproximately 20% of abortions submitted to areferral laboratory in central Kentucky, the causeof abortion could not be determined. 5 Lesions detected upon histopathologic examina- tion of the placenta vary with the infectious agentinvolved and chronicity of the infection. 4Acute bacterial placentitis is characterized by neutrophilicinltration of in cells in the in- tervillous spaces. 4,5,22Other lesions reported in association with chronic placentitis include cho-rioangiosis, hyperplasia with or without squamous metaplasia chorionic epithelium, and adeno- Fig. 7.

Anecdotally,treatment for bacterial placentitis may be associatedwith a secondary fungal infection; however, suchassociations have not been studied. Diagnostic Markers for Equine Placentitis Several molecules have been measured in blood frompregnant mares to evaluate fetoplacental wellbeing.During the last three decades, steroids produced bythe fetoplacental unit have received the most atten-tion. 11,31,51-53Other molecules including relaxin and \"equine feto-protein\" have also been investi-gated in mares with pregnancy loss. 54-55Recently, serum amyloid A (SAA) has been investigated as aprognostic marker 36and diagnostic marker for mares with experimentally induced ascending pla-centitis. 38Therefore, different diagnostic markers for placental health in mares will be discussedherein. Fetoplacental Steroids During pregnancy several steroids (i.e., estrogens,progestins, and androgens) are produced and metab-olized by the fetoplacental unit. 24,56-70These ste- roids achieve extremely high concentrations in thematernal and fetoplacental circulation. 51,60At the present, we have very limited understanding ofthe function of the different steroids during preg-nancy, particularly within the fetoplacental unit.Progestins are responsible for maintaining pregnan-cy; 61,62however, it is unclear what functions estro- gens and androgens have during pregnancy inmares. Removal of fetal gonads did not affect preg-nancy concentrations of13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2 /H9251(PGFM), a metabolite of was remarkably reduced, and as a conse- quence, the second stage of labor was delayed.58,63 Progestins be subclassied as and /H9252/H9251-diol predominate.60During the rst 100 days of pregnancy, progesterone is the main progestin, with5 /H9251DHP also being also present in high proportion starting from ovulation.62It is produced by the primary corpus luteum, and secondary and acces-sory corpora lutea. 61Starting by 70-100 days of gestation the main source of progestins is the equineplacenta. 65,66Removal of the maternal ovaries by 100 days of gestation did not affect pregnancy main-tenance 66; however, removal of maternal ovaries by 70 days of pregnancy was associated with pregnancyloss in 50% of the mares. 65It is worth noting that in addition to progesterone, 5 /H9251-DHP is also present inthe maternal circulation during early pregnancy andhas been recently conrmed as a potent, bioactive pro-gestin. 67Interestingly, from approximately 150 days of pregnancy on, progesterone is present in very lowconcentrations in the maternal plasma, 68and it seems that other progestins (e.g., 5 /H9251-DHP) are responsible for pregnancy maintenance.62Throughout preg- nancy, concentrations of progestins other than proges-terone, particularly 5 /H9251-DHP increase with the advance of gestation.62During the last 30 days of gestation, maternal concentrations of progestins in-crease until immediately prior to parturition. 67 Measurement of progestins has been used to monitor placental health in spontaneous and exper-imental cases of placentitis. 31,52,53,70Chronic pla- centitis (/H11022 7 d in mares was associated with increasedplasma progestin concentrations 68; however, in the same study, mares that developed acute placentitis(abortion /H110214 days post-inoculation) experienced a rapid decline in plasma progestin concentrations.Spontaneous cases of placentitis have been reportedto cause elevation in total progestin concentra-tions. 52,53,70This increase in concentration of pro- gestins is thought to be linked to the acceleratedadrenal gland maturation in the fetus of pregnantmares experiencing chronic placentitis. 13,71The adrenal gland is thought to produce pregnenolone,and this molecule is used as a precursor for proges-tin synthesis in the equine placenta. It is assumedthat placentitis increases the substrate (i.e., preg-nenolone), which leads to an increased peripheralprogestin concentration in mares with chronic pla-centitis. It has also been suggested that placentitisaffects the ability of the placenta to metabolize pro-gesterone into other progestins; thus, progesteronewill appear in higher concentration in plasma.Repeated measurements of plasma progestins inmares with placentitis have been proposed as a use-ful method to identify mares that may abort or de-liver prematurely. 52,53,70 During pregnancy, the equine fetal gonads of both male and female fetuses undergo marked hypertro-phy and secrete large quantities of androgens,particularly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and7-dehydro-DHEA. serves estrone, 17 /H9251-estradiol, and In addition to DHEA, circulating testosterone is el-evated in plasma of pregnant mares. 75-77To date, determination of fetoplacental androgens has notbeen critically assessed in mares experiencing preg-nancy losses. Because androgens serve as precur-sors of estrogens, it seemed logical that placentitisaffects androgen concentrations in the maternal cir-culation, but our recent study we showed that con- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 499CUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGYcentrations of DHEA-S and testosterone did not change in mares with experimentally induced pla-centitis. 77Likely, androgens are not useful diag- nostic The equine blastocyst begins estrogens approximately 10 days post-ovulation61,78,79; there- after, estrogens are produced by the corpora luteastarting by 40 days of pregnancy. 80This ovarian secretion of estrogen is believed to be mediated byequine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) and will lastuntil the demise of the corpora lutea around 150days of gestation. 60,61Concomitant with ovarian secretion of estrogens (i.e., by gestation d 40), thefetoplacental unit also starts to secrete estrogens.Concentrations of estrogens in maternal circulationwill increase remarkably throughout the second tri-mester of pregnancy, and maximal concentrationsare achieved by 210-240 days of gestation. Fromthe peak of estrogen concentrations in maternal cir-culation, there is a progressive reduction in estrogenconcentrations through the end of pregnancy withminimal estrogen concentrations at parturition,which is contrary to reports in domestic rumi-nants. 56,59-61The estrogen production parallels the enlargement of the fetal gonads.60Given that estrogens are a nal product of the fetoplacentalunit, determination of peripheral estrogen concen-trations in pregnant mares may provide utility inthe diagnosis of equine placentitis. Determination of estrone sulfate concentrations in maternal circulation has been suggested as auseful marker for fetal wellbeing during early preg-nancy; 67,81,82however, studies involving estrone sul- fate in advanced pregnancy are scant.82,83There are no controlled studies assessing estrone sulfate inmares experiencing placentitis, despite its high pop-ularity among practitioners which frequently useestrone sulfate as a test to assess fetal wellbeing andplacental health. Field observations carried out bya commercial laboratory reported that abortingmares present signicantly lower \"total estrogen\"(unreported crossreactivity) concentrations than pregnancy. stud- ies are warranted to conrm eld observations con-cerning the utility of conjugated and unconjugatedestrogen concentrations in pregnant mares as mark-ers for placentitis. Acute-Phase Proteins Acute-phase proteins (APPs) are elevated when in-flammation is present. 83,84This group of proteins is mainly produced by the liver in response to aninflammatory stimulus (i.e., cytokines). 85-88APPs are classied as minor, moderate, and major; minor and moderate (i.e., constantly present in the plasmaand concentration increases 1-5-fold and 5-10-foldupon inflammation, respectively) and major (i.e., lowor undetectable concentrations in the blood circulationand upon inflammatory stimulus increases /H1102210 and often 100-1000 times). 87-89The main APP in the horse is serum amyloid A, whereas the moderate APPsinclude haptoglobin (Hp) and and /H92511-acid glycopro- tein.87,90,91As a moderate APP, Hp is constantly present in plasma of healthy horses and concentra-tions are elevated upon inflammation. 87-89 In horses, Hp has recently been shown to be a useful marker for a variety of acute-chronic clinicalconditions (i.e., /H110224 d duration). 91Recently, in- creases in peripheral blood concentrations of SAAhave been reported in mares with experimentallyinduced bacterial endometritis 92and ascending pla- centitis.36,38In healthy pregnant mares, SAA con- centrations remained low throughout the last half ofgestation while showing a signicant increase begin-ning approximately 12 hours postpartum. Mater-nal SAA concentrations then return to baseline withinapproximately 60 hours postpartum. 36Interestingly, levels of SAA in peripheral blood have been reported toincrease in mares affected by placentitis and decreaseagain in response to treatment. 36 Fibrinogen, the most widely used APP in the horse, is commonly used in association with whiteblood cell counts (WBC) as a means to assess inflam-mation in the horse 89,90; however, anecdotally it has been suggested that neither WBC nor Fb change inmares with placentitis. In a recent study, we dem-onstrated that concentrations of SAA and Hp in-crease rapidly subsequent to experimental inductionof placentitis and remain elevated until abortion,whereas neither Fb nor WBC seemed to be useful markers for placentitis. 38In the same study, partu- rition did not trigger an increase in either SAA or Hpin normal foaling mares. In another study, we alsoshowed that measuring SAA with a lateral flow devicecan be used to detect inflammation in mares withexperimentally induced ascending placentitis. 93 Relaxin Relaxin, a superfamily.Equine relaxin, which is the smallest relaxin composed of two subunits (i.e., A, /H9251 20-residue; and B, /H925228-residue) which are con- nected by disulde bonds similar to insulin.61,94 It has been suggested that relaxin plays an impor-tant role during pregnancy, and the proposed func-tions include uterine growth, distensibility ofuterus, and relaxation of the cervix and pelvic liga-ments. 61To date the role of relaxin during equine pregnancy is not fully understood. Relaxin is produced by the equine placenta and can be detected in high concentrations in the periph- eral blood from day 80 of gestation until term.95,96 It has been reported that relaxin is a useful biomarkerto assess placental health, the authors 55reported that there was a positive relationship between circulatinglevels of relaxin and poor outcomes in high-risk preg-nancies. These investigators suggested that becausethe placenta is the sole source of relaxin, blood concen-trations could be used as a biomarker of placentalfunction. 55It is worth noting that relaxin concentra- 500 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSCUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGYtions vary greatly among breeds (e.g., Thoroughbred vs Standardbreds) and horse types (pony vs standard-size horse mares). 96In addition, the lack of a com- mercially available test at present precludes the use ofrelaxin clinically in mares. Alpha-Fetoprotein Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a major protein presentin the allantoic and amniotic fluids 97-100; AFP is a member of the albuminoid superfamily, the otherprotein members of this superfamily are vitamin Dbinding protein, alpha-albumin, and afamin. 101-102 In mammalian fetuses, among other functions, AFPis associated with estrogen binding (allowing devel-opment of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)surge center in females), antioxidative activities(through binding of heavy metals), and immuno-regulation. 102-105In horses, AFP is highly ex- pressed during early pregnancy by the conceptus.106 Our recent study demonstrated that AFP is presentin the fetal fluids of mares during the third trimes-ter of pregnancy and that mares with experimen-tally induced ascending placentitis have elevatedplasma concentrations of AFP. 26However, it re- mains to be determined whether this protein is auseful marker for spontaneous cases of equineplacentitis. Biomarkers for Chorioamnionitis in Humans noncod-ing RNAs (/H1101122 nucleotides) have ofhuman studies as potential biomarkers for diseases(e.g., cancer, inflammatory and cardiovascular pa-thologies). miRNAs are associated with a widerange of biological functions through regulation ofgene expression either by degrading or transcrip-tionally repressing mRNA. 107miRNAs are rela- tively stable in the circulation a source of cell-free nucleic acid. 108In plasma, miRNAs immune response mediated byT-cells. of studies have characterized pregnancy-associated miRNAs in women107-111and some studies have suggested that changes in expres-sion of miRNAs associated with abnormal or pre-term labor, therefore indicating their potentialdiagnostic application. 110-112To date, miRNAs have received limited attention during equine preg-nancy; a recent study demonstrated changes inmiRNAs in the dam's circulation during maternalrecognition of pregnancy. 112Given that miRNA (i.e., miR223 and miR338) change in the placenta ofpregnant women suffering with chorioamnionitis, 113 it is reasonable to hypothesize that these or othermiRNAs may change in mares with placentitis. Proteomics of the amniotic fluid and fetal circula- tion has been used in to identify biomarkersfor (intra-amniotic infection/in-flammation). 113-119Ruetschi et al119identiedseventeen proteins that in am-niotic fluid samples of women with chorioamnioni-tis. Among these proteins, three proteins werefurther identied as human neutrophil protein 1-3as well as calgranulin A and B. Another studyidentied 39 proteins that are differentially ex-pressed in amniotic fluid samples obtained from pa-tients with intra-amniotic infections. 120To date, proteomics of the equine fetal fluids have not beendescribed; thus, characterization of the protein com-position of fetal fluids would be useful to identifypotential new markers for equine placentitis. Re-cently, a study involving proteomics of human neo-nates demonstrated that Hp and Hp-related proteinimmunoreactivity are useful markers for neonatalsepsis. 119Proteomics of the fetal fluids and the newborn foal may aid in identifying new diagnosticmarkers for placentitis and neonatal sepsis. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor marker, is elevated in amniotic fluidin chorioamnionitis. 121Interestingly, during early pregnancy, noninfectious early pregnancy inwomen were associated with reduced serum levels ofMIF. 122Macrophage migration inhibitory factor is expressed in high levels by the embryo and endome-trium during early pregnancy in horses. 123Unfor- tunately, our preliminary results measuring MIF inplasma of mares with placentitis showed that MIF ishighly variable across days and mares, and therewere no associations between placentitis and con-centrations of MIF 124; therefore, measuring MIF does not seem useful as a diagnostic marker forplacentitis. In human medicine, CRP has been the most widely studied APP, as a nonspecic biomarker forplacental and fetal health. 125,126Changes in con- centrations of CRP in the systemic circulation ofwomen suffering with chorioamnionitis have beendemonstrated by several authors. 125-128In horses, CRP is a minor APP and has received limited atten-tion, 129,130likely due to the lack of remarkable changes in different diseases evaluated to date. In mammals, infection of the placenta triggers the local innate immune response through activation ofToll-like receptors (TRL), a group of receptors respon-sible for recognition of pathogen patterns and tissuedamage. 130,131Activation of TRL (e.g., TRL-2 and TRL-4) initiates a cascade of events of the innate im-mune response that results in migration of phagocyticcells to infected/damaged tissues and production ofinflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines, prostaglan-dins, and many others mediators). 130,131Cytokines are small molecules (peptides, proteins, glycoproteins)that modulate the immune system/response, either bypromoting or suppressing inflammation. 133,134Doz- ens of cytokines are known, and there are severalcell-types that produce (e.g., macrophages, monocytes,broblasts, dendritic cells, B lymphocytes, NK cells,and epithelial cells) and secrete these molecules. 133,134 Normal placental tissues of mammals including themare and express pro-inflamma- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 501CUTTING TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGYtory cytokines.27,135-137However, placental infection in women is associated with an increased production ofseveral pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-8,and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]- /H9251) not only in placen- tal tissues, but also in the fetal and maternal blood.Pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to beuseful markers for placental infection, and valuableprognostic indicators to determine whether a preg-nancy will be carried to term in humans. 138-142How- ever, there have been few studies evaluating pro- andanti-inflammatory cytokines in mares with experi-mentally induced ascending placentitis. 27It is un- likely that measuring cytokines in plasma will be awidely used tool in veterinary medicine due to thelimited clinical availability of assays for equinecytokines. 4. Treatment Bacterial infection of the equine pregnant uterus inthe middle of gestation can result in acute abortions with no lesions in the fetal membranes and minimal tono outward clinical signs (e.g., vulvar discharge, pre-mature mammary gland development). 4,5Therefore, treatment is often not an option to prevent this type ofabortion. In contrast, bacterial infections of theuterus late in pregnancy tend to be associated withchronic placentitis. 4These mares will usually show the clinical signs as described above, thus if a diagno-sis is made early enough, treatment can be appliedand pregnancies can be potentially rescued. 1 Primarily, treatment for placentitis should be aimed to prolong maintenance of a viable fetus inutero to allow time for fetal development and mat-uration. To achieve this goal, therapy should:1) control bacterial infection of placenta and fetus, 2)maintain the quiescence, and 11,12 The limited evidence-based treatment strategiescome from mares with experimentally induced pla-centitis. Unfortunately, as noted above, experi-mentally induced placentitis does not necessarilymirror spontaneous infections; thus, data generatedfrom experimentally induced placentitis should beinterpreted with caution. Treatment for placentitis is commonly based on a combination of antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, andprogestins 11,12,34(Table 2). The rationale to use anti-inflammatories is based on the nding thatmares with experimentally induced placentitis haveincreased uterine contractility 143as a consequence of the increased ex-pression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 27Simi- larly, block myometrial contractions. 34Evidence for the use anti-inflammatories and progestins isbased on studies with cloprostenol-induced abortionduring early pregnancy. In one study, mares re-ceiving cloprostenol (250 mcg/d for 5 d) but alsotreated with (44 mg/animal/d) main-tained the pregnancy (8/8); however, mares givencloprostenol and also treated with progesterone (300mg/animal day) resulted in ve of eight pregnanciesmaintained, as expected all mares receiving dailycloprostenol (n /H110055) but no other treatment aborted. 144An earlier study conducted by the same group did not observe any benecial on exogenousflunixin meglumine in control luteolysis in marestreated with induced endotox-emia. 145From these studies and probable extrap- olation from human literature, it has been assumedthat mares with placentitis during late pregnancywill behave in a similar manner although this hasnot been critically evaluated. Antibiotics are included as part of the therapy for the bacterial infection of the fetal membranes and totreat and/or prevent bacteria reaching the fetus. 11,12Table 2.

Controversy exists regarding the duration of an- timicrobial therapy once a diagnosis of placentitis ismade. Anecdotally, short antimicrobial treatment(i.e., 10-15 d) has been advocated to be an effectiveand thoughtful approach to treat placentitis as wellas an approach to avoid bacterial resistance associ- ated with prolonged antimicrobial therapy. 11How- ever, mares withexperimentally induced do not supportthe claim for effectiveness of short-term antimicro-bial therapy. In fact, mares with experimentallyinduced ascending placentitis did not carry foals toterm when treatment was discontinued after 2weeks; however, an apparent increase in survivalrates was observed when mares were kept on anti-microbials for a prolonged period of time. 34,146An- other interesting nding about antimicrobialtherapy from the same group demonstrated thatmares kept on a prolonged treatment with antibiot-ics, present positive endometrial bacterial culturewithin 6 hours post-abortion or delivery of a viablefoal. 69These ndings suggest that antimicrobials administered to mares with experimentally inducedplacentitis may suppress bacterial growth but do notachieve complete bacterial elimination. Empirically, estrogen supplementation has been advocated to treat mares with placentitis. 72As aforementioned, this author reported that mareswith placentitis that subsequently aborted had re-markably lower \"total estrogen\" concentrations thanmares of the same gestational age that maintainedpregnancy. As estrogens are produced in high con- centrations during the second and third trimesters ofpregnancy, it is unlikely that estrogen supplementa-tion will be able to restore normal estrogen concentra-tions. For example, it required continuousintravenous infusion of 126-231 mg of estrone sulfateper hour to achieve peripheral pregnancy levels ofestrone sulfate. 148Therefore, to date, estrogen ther- apy has not been critically assessed by controlled stud-ies or prospectively assigned eld studies.Other drugs that have been added to the treat- ment of equine placentitis include acetylsalicylic acid, pentoxifylline, and acid has been given to mareswith placentitis under the impression that this drugwould improve the blood flow to the mare's uterus;however, there is no evidence basis in the literatureto support this practice. In human medicine, lowdoses of acetylsalicylic acid has been shown to re-duce the risks of preeclampsia in women. 149Simi- larly, pentoxifylline has been included as part of thetreatment for mares with placentitis with the ideathat this drug possesses antinflammatory and rheo-lytic properties, 34which might improve the oxygen- ation of the pregnant uterus. Pentoxifylline wasfound to be present in the fetal fluids of pregnantmares treated with the standard dose 146and has been added to the treatment of mares with experi-mentally induced placentitis. 34However, it is un- clear whether this drug has any benecial effect onthe treatment of placentitis. In addition, uterineartery blood flow remained unchanged when pen-toxifylline was given to early pregnant mares duringa short treatment period. 150Dexamethasone has been suggested as useful for the treatment of pla-centitis 11; however, it is uncertain whether admin- istering this drug improves pregnancy outcome inmares with placentitis. At best, very limited to noevidence basis exists to support the practice to in-clude these drugs (i.e., acetylsalicylic acid, pentoxi-fylline, and dexamethasone) in the treatment ofplacentitis. Given that the pathogenesis of nocardioform pla- centitis is unknown, and there are no establishedexperimental models to study this type of placenti-tis, treatment for nocardioform placentitis has beenempirically applied and based on treatments usedfor other types of equine placentitis. To date thereare no evidence-based reports supporting the treat-ment of nocardioform placentitis in mares. A re-cent retrospective study sensitivity for Amycolatopsis ssp. and Crossiella equi 14(Table 3). However, it is unclear whether these antimicrobials are effective in vivo.It is also unclear whether addition of antinflamma-tories is effective or necessary for the treatment ofnocardioform placentitis. Tocolytic agents such as clenbuterol and isoxsu- prine have also been used in practice as part of thetreatment of mares with placentitis 11; however, there is no evidence basis to support such practice.In fact, in a study carried out with normal pre-foaling mares clenbuterol was not effective in delay-ing parturition, and treated mares foaled earlierthan control mares. of efcacy of clen- buterol to delay parturition should discourage thepractice to give this drug to mares with placentitis. Lately, a new practice of antimicrobial therapy has been introduced in which mares are adminis-tered antimicrobials for 10 days of the monththroughout pregnancy even in the absence of a clin- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 503CUTTING EDGE, NEW TOPICS, AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION IN THERIOGENOLOGYTable 3.

This practice not only should be discouragedto the lack of proven efcacy, but also because itfavors bacterial resistance. Thus, there is an enor-mous risk of creating super-resistant bacteria thatmay become a major threat not only to the horsesbut to public health. It has been long suggested that mares with poor vulvar conformation are prone to developing placen-titis. A eld study conducted with Thoroughbredmares in Southern Brazil did not observe any asso-ciation between vulvar conformation and occurrenceof placentitis in the last days pre-foaling. 2How- ever, it is worth-noting that 87.7% of the mares (i.e.,209/333) in that study already had Caslick's stichesin place by the time the authors carried out theevaluations. It is our interpretation that an asso-ciation between vulvar conformation and placentitiscould not be assessed in that study. It remains bestpractice state of the art to place Caslick's stiches inmares with poor conformation. 5. Conclusions Bacterial placentitis is an important cause of preg-nancy loss in mares. Bacterial infections areresponsible for a large portion of abortion cases.There are four different morphologic types of placen-titis: (nocardioform), dif-fuse (hematogenous), and multifocal, type of placentitis,whereby beta-hemolytic streptococci predominate.Pathogenesis of the different types of equine placen-titis are poorly known. Acute infections of thegravid equine uterus during mid-gestation are com-monly associated with fulminant bacterial infectionof the fetus with minimal or no lesions present in theplacenta. This type of infection is unnoticed andinvariably results in abortion. In contrast, chronicinfections of the placenta occurring from the mid tolate term are associated with acute-chronic lesionspresent in the placenta. Currently, the diagnosis of placentitis is based on ultrasonography and clinical signs. Often clinicalsigns and associated ultrasonographic changes areonly present in well-advanced stages of placentitis.Recently, several diagnostic markers have been re-ported to be useful in experimentally treating pla-centitis (e.g., serum amyloid A, haptoglobin,estrogen, and alpha-fetoprotein); however, it re-mains to be determined whether these markers canbe used to diagnose spontaneous cases. Treatment of placentitis should be aimed at pro- longing the presence of the foal in utero by control-ling placental and fetal infection, maintaining theuterus in a quiescent state, and by blocking theproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Few an-tibiotics (i.e., penicillin, gentamycin, and sulfa-trim-ethoprim) have been shown to cross the placentaand achieve satisfactory inhibitory concentrations.Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to the Kentucky Thorough-bred Association and Kentucky Thoroughbred Own-ers and Breeders for supporting several studies withequine placentitis while the rst author was work-ing at the University of Kentucky.

Introduction Equine coronavirus has recently been associated with emerging outbreaks of pyrogenic and enteric diseasein adult horses. Bovine coronavirus is closely relatedto ECoV and considered a pneumoenteric virus, caus-ing not only enteric disease but also mild upper respi-ratory signs. Due to the inconsistent development ofenteric signs in horses infected with ECoV, one canonly wonder whether this virus has a tropism to non-enteric epithelial cells, such as the respiratory epithe-lium. The objective of the present study was toinvestigate the presence of ECoV in nasal secretionsfrom horses with signs of fever and/or acute onset ofupper respiratory tract infection. 2. Materials and Methods Nasal secretions from 2,437 equids with acute onsetof fever and/or respiratory signs were tested forECoV and common respiratory pathogens by qPCR.Categorical analyses were performed using eitherthe Fisher's exact or the Kruskal-Wallis test to de-termine the association between observations (age,breed, sex, clinical signs, qPCR status for commonrespiratory pathogens) and ECoV. 3. Results and Discussion ECoV was detected by qPCR in 17/2,437 equi ss. equi. Nasal discharge, fever, depression, anorexia, andcoughing were the predominant clinical signs asso-ciated with ECoV qPCR-positive horses.

Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) is a common respira- tory virus of young horses associated with acute fever,depression, anorexia, mandibular lymphadenopathy,and profuse serous nasal discharge. In adult horses,the disease is generally mild or subclinical unless ma-jor complications arise such as abortion in pregnantmares or myeloencephalopathy. The objective of thisstudy was to provide new information regarding theprevalence and epidemiology of EHV-1 shed by horsespresented to veterinarians with clinical signs relatedto an upper respiratory tract infection from March2008 to December 2014. 2. Materials and Methods Nasal secretions from 4,210 equids with acute onset offever and/or respiratory signs were tested by quanti-tative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for EHV-1.Categorical analyses were performed to determine theassociation between observations and EHV-1. 3. Results and Discussion A total of 99/4,210 (2.4%) equids tested qPCR-positive for EHV-1, with most N 752. overrepresentedin racing horses. Depression,nasal discharge, and coughing were signicantlyless frequently reported in the EHV-1 qPCR-positiveequids compared with the EHV-1 qPCR-negativeindex cases.

This is the ideal method for collectingrespiratory secretions for culture in cases of sus-pected bacterial pneumonia. First described inhorses in the early 1970s, 1the TTW procedure re- quires few supplies and can be performed in thesedated or unsedated horse depending on tempera-ment. 2-6TTW avoids the need for an endoscope and reduces the chance of culturing upper respira-tory flora by directly sampling the lower respiratorytract. 7Despite the ease of TTWs, many practitio- ners are hesitant to perform these procedures.It is the authors' hope that practitioners will becomereacquainted with this underutilized skill. Respiratory secretions are brought up from the lungs via mucocilliary clearance; thus, samples ob-tained from the tracheal puddle represent secretionsfrom all areas of the lungs. 5A TTW is especially indicated in cases when localized lung pathology issuspected (e.g., an abscess or discrete pneumonia),because more directed respiratory sampling such as abronchoalveolar lavage may obtain a false-negativeculture result if a nonaffected portion of the lung isinadvertently sampled. 8It is highly recommended that TTWs be performed before commencing antibiotic therapy to increase the chance of identifying the causative bacterial pathogen.The TTW fluid may also be submitted for cytology, andreference ranges have been described. 9-11However, cells from the upper airway may be present in thetracheal puddle, and results may not be purely repre-sentative of the lower airway. 7,8 2. Materials and Methods Supplies (Fig. 1): Sedation Clippers Surgical scrub Alcohol or 5-mL syringe 25-gauge #15 scalpel blade Transtracheal wash aspiration kita /H18546If no kit 5c m for foals and 100 cm for adults 60-ml syringes (2) 20-gauge needles for drawing up saline and Sterile physiological saline Self-adhesive elastic bandaged Culture media swab or vial Red and purple top tubes 3. Preparation of the Patient\u2014Sedation Depending on the horse's temperament and severityof illness, sedation may or may not be required orrecommended to perform a TTW. If the horse isprone to moving around, light sedation or a twitchmay help reduce the chance of contamination duringthe procedure. Because you will be in a relativelydangerous spot while performing the procedure, per-sonal safety must always be a concern. Light seda-tion with xylazine and butorphanol is usuallysufcient for the procedure because the procedureitself is not lengthy. The addition of butorphanolwill also decrease the cough reflex. Coughing dur-ing the procedure will displace the tracheal puddle,making it more difcult to aspirate the fluid andpotentially increasing the risk of contaminationfrom the upper airways. 4. Preparation of the Site Palpate the ventral midline of muscles run cranially theymove abaxially and lie lateral to the easy palpation of the tracheal rings.The TTW site is approximately halfway between thelarynx and the point at which the rings can nolonger be palpated because of the overlying sterno-cephalicus muscles. This will likely be approxi-mately 1/3 to 1/2 the way down the neck. The areashould be clipped and aseptically prepared. The au-thors prefer a wide clip area so that the trachea canbe grasped and stabilized while maintaining steril-ity of the non-dominant hand. The horse's maneshould be braided or taped out of the way to ensureit will not contaminate your TTW site or handsduring the procedure. The lidocaine can be instilled into the TTW site at this point and followed by a second prep of the area.After donning sterile gloves, it could also be drawnup and inltrated into the site using aseptic tech-nique. When inltrating the site with lidocaine,rst create a bleb under the skin and then direct theneedle slightly deeper to inltrate the tissues adja-cent to the trachea. 5. Transtracheal Wash Procedure If possible, a small table or counter with the sterileeld should be available within arm's reach of thehorse. All of the supplies should be prepared andorganized before commencing the procedure. Ster-ile gloves should be donned at this point if they havenot been donned already. Using aseptic technique,20 to 30 mL of sterile saline is drawn up into each oftwo 60-mL syringes and placed onto the sterile eld.Palpate the trachea and relocate the TTW site.Palpate the space between the two tracheal ringsand make a small incision with the #15 scalpel.The incision is vertical\u2014approximately 1 to 2 cmlong or twice as long as the TTW introduction needle(or catheter)\u2014along the skin over the middle of thetrachea. If using an intravenous (introduction)catheter and polypropylene urinary (flushing) cath-eter instead of a TTW kit, this is a good time toensure that the flushing catheter ts in the lumen ofthe introduction catheter (it would be very frustrat-ing to nd this out after the introduction catheter ispositioned in the horse). Fig. 2. A transtracheal washing introduction catheter and flush-ing catheter can be made using a 12-gauge intravenous catheterand a #5 or #6 French polypropylene urinary catheter. Fig. 1. Supplies required for a transtracheal wash (photo doesnot include the tracheal wash kit). 516 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSRESPIRATORY/MEDICINEHold the trachea rmly between two ngers while pulling the skin out on the side to maintain tension across the incision site. You can hold the tracheafrom above or from below the incision site. Theintroduction needle (or catheter) is then insertedthrough the skin incision between two trachealrings. If there is a lot of resistance, it is because thecatheter is hitting a tracheal ring. If this happens,pull it out, palpate the tracheal rings again, andreinsert the catheter a little bit lower or higherdepending on palpation. When inserting the introduction needle/catheter, do not insert the introduction needle/catheter per-pendicular to the trachea. Keep the catheter par-allel to the ground instead. This gives a downwardangle to the catheter compared with the trachea(Fig. 3). In addition, hold the introduction needle/catheter with the bevel downward. This facilitatesthe insertion through the tracheal rings. Once the introduction needle/catheter is in the tracheal lumen, angle the tip toward the lungs andadvance to the hub. At this point the internal nee-dle, or stylet, is removed, leaving the introductioncatheter in place. Thread the flushing catheterthrough the introduction catheter toward the lungs.Ideally, the end of the flushing catheter will reachthe thoracic inlet and be positioned in the trachealpuddle. Some kits have the flushing catheterwithin a sleeve that prevents inadvertent contami-nation of the tubing during insertion. If you are notusing a TTW kit, it is very important to avoid con-tamination by touching the skin, hair, or any surfacethat is not sterile. The catheter is long and difcultto handle without contaminating it. It can be help-ful to loop the catheter around your hand (Fig. 4). When performing a TTW on a foal, many of the flushing catheters are too long and, if inserted fully,will pass the tracheal puddle. It is helpful to pre-measure (aseptically of course) the catheter from theincision site to the thoracic inlet so that you have anidea of how far to insert the catheter. Remove the flushing catheter stylet (if present) once the catheter is fully inserted. This stylet givesthe catheter rigidity, which reduces the chance of itbecoming kinked or turned cranially during thread-ing. Attach the rst 60-mL syringe (loaded with20-30 mL of sterile saline) onto the flushing cathe-ter. Inject the saline slowly and then start aspirat-ing slowly. If the saline is injected too fast, it may Fig. 3. When inserting the introduction catheter or needle, keepthe catheter parallel to the ground, and with your nondominanthand hold the trachea rmly between two ngers while pullingthe skin out on the side to maintain tension across the incisionsite.

If the catheter is placed correctly, there will be slight resistance during aspiration. The more vis-cous the tracheal secretions, the more resistance toaspiration you will feel. If there is only air comingback into the syringe while aspirating, it is becausethe tip of the tracheal catheter is not dipping intothe secretion/saline pool. This usually happensif the catheter is inserted too far into the trachea (orless likely not far enough). In addition, sometimesthe tip is bent upward instead of downward into thelumen of the trachea (resulting in a pharyngealwash). What to do in this case: Rotate the flushing catheter 180 degrees so that if the tip of the catheter was upward it isnow facing ventrally. Aspirate and check ifthere is resistance. Disconnect the syringe from the flushing cath-eter, empty the air, reconnect it, and slowlywithdraw the flushing catheter while aspirat-ing. If you feel resistance when aspirating,you are in the right spot. Stop withdrawingthe catheter and keep aspirating. If this doesn't work, disconnect the syringeagain to empty the air, reconnect it, and thenaspirate while slowly advancing or withdraw-ing the flushing catheter further. Another option is to lower the horse's head tomove the tracheal puddle more cranially upthe trachea. none of these tips are successful, then moresterile saline from the second syringe can beinstilled, and the aspiration procedure can beattempted a second time. Once secretions are collected, empty the air from thesyringe by keeping its tip up and prepare the samplefor laboratory submission (Fig. 5). When removing the TTW catheter, it is important to remove the flushing catheter rst and then theintroduction catheter. Because the contaminatedflushing catheter is protected within the introduc-tion catheter, this prevents it from contacting theskin and underlying tissue upon removal. An ex-ception to this is if the introduction needle has asharp end that may inadvertently cut the flushingcatheter during removal. In this case, remove theintroduction needle rst. After completing the TTW, a 4 /H110034 gauze is held in place over the incision with a self-adhesive elasticbandage dfor at least 30 minutes to 1 hour after the procedure. This will help to seal the incision siteand prevent air from tracking under the skin fromthe incised trachea. Some practitioners may applya small amount of antibiotic or other wound oint-ment to the incision, although this is optional.The incision site should be monitored by the ownersfor any evidence of inflammation or infection overthe next few days. 6. Sample Handling It is important to understand what you want fromthe laboratory. Make sure you ll out the labora-tory form appropriately and that you put the sam-ples in the right milieu and at the right temperaturefor shipping. Do you want a Gram staining? Do you want an anaerobic culture? Do you want a sensitivity panel? In optimal conditions, the answer is yes to each ofthese questions. The advantage of a quick Gram staining is to give you an idea of the type of bacteria present and thusthe type of antibiotics to use after the TTW proce-dure. However, the results will not be ready within24 to 48 hours unless the staining is done at theclinic. Although anaerobes are important in severe pneu- monia and pleuropneumonia cases, they may not beas important in less severe cases. Most laborato-ries will not be equipped to test the sensitivity ofanaerobic bacteria. Last, the most important information you need is the sensitivity of the aerobic bacteria to antibiotics. Fig. 5. Example of a mucopurulent sample in a red top tubeobtained by transtracheal wash in a horse with bacterial pneu-monia. The culture identied a heavy growth 518 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 are as follows: Culturette swab (aerobic or anaerobic/aerobic) Bacterial culture collection and transport systeme Blood culture vials Red top tube For cases in which you submit the sample for cytol-ogy, you should rst make and then air dry someslides (similar to making blood smears). In addi-tion, you should submit part of the sample in alavender top tube. 7. Results Summary of steps for the transtracheal wash: Sedate as required. Clip and aseptically prepare the site. Inltrate the site with 2 to 4 mL of 2% lido-caine using the 25-guage needle and 3-mLsyringe. Don sterile gloves. Draw up 20 to 30 mL of sterile saline into eachof the two 60-mL syringes. Open the scalpel blade onto the sterile eld. Move the sterile eld with all equipment towithin reach of the horse. Make a skin incision with the #15 scalpelblade. Locate the TTW site and stabilize the tracheawith your nondominant hand. Insert the introduction needle or catheter intothe trachea between two tracheal rings. /H18546Hold introduction needle parallel to theground with bevel down. Once inside the trachea, direct the introduc-tion needle towards the lungs. Remove introduction needle/catheter stylet ifpresent. Insert flushing catheter through the introduc-tion catheter and direct it into the trachealpuddle. Slowly inject sterile saline. Slowly aspirate tracheal secretions. Remove the flushing catheter. Remove the introduction needle/catheter. Place 4 /H110034 gauze and self-adhesive elastic bandage dover incision site for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 8. Discussion Transtracheal Wash Cautions Risks before the procedure if horses are in respira- tory distress: If the animal is in severe respiratory distressor is hypoxic (usually because of a pneumonia),the sedation and saline injection into the tra-chea may be fatal.If the horse has a profuse amount of secretionsin the lumen of the trachea, the diameter leftfor the air to flow through the trachea is tre-mendously reduced. Adding saline into sucha tracheal lumen will decrease the circumfer-ential area of the lumen further. This willincrease resistance to airflow and worsen therespiratory distress. Risks you have to keep in mind when performing theTTW procedure: Perforating the carotid artery or the jugularvein: /H18546Can when the horse is not handledor sedated properly. /H18546Can happen when the veterinarian doesnot hold the trachea and skin properlywhen passing the TTW introduction nee-dle/catheter. Damaging a tracheal ring: /H18546It is important to pass the catheter betweenthe two tracheal rings to avoid possible dam-age or laceration the cartilages. 2 Damaging the dorsal tracheal wall: /H18546When inserting the introduction needle/catheter, too much force may result in thesharp end perforating or lacerating the dor-sal trachea, which can result in emphy-sema, chronic abscessation, or infection. /H18546Care must be taken at this step to applyenough force to pop into the tracheal lumenbetween the cartilage rings, but control isrequired to stop the forward momentumonce the lumen is entered. Cutting/breaking the flushing catheter andlosing the catheter down the trachea: /H18546This can occur if the introduction needle/catheter has a sharp end (this is less likelywith new kits or when using an intrave-nous catheter). If your introduction nee-dle/catheter has a very sharp end, with-draw the introduction needle/catheter rstuntil the sharp end is completely out of theskin. Then withdraw the flushing cathe-ter. This will reduce the chance of shear-ing the flushing catheter on the end of theintroduction needle/catheter but does in-crease the chance of introducing infectioninto the tissue. /H18546When injecting saline into the flushingcatheter, the end of the syringe attachmentmay break off or become dislodged from themain catheter when bent or put under lat-eral forces (especially when using a dogurinary catheter). It is very important tohold the flushing catheter when injectingor withdrawing fluid using the syringe. /H18546If a flushing catheter is lost in the trachea,most horses will cough up the catheterwithin 30 minutes. 12If the catheter is not AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 519RESPIRATORY/MEDICINEcoughed up, endoscopy may be required to manually remove the catheter using biopsyforceps. Risks After the Procedure Infections: Infectious samples (usually associated withbacterial pneumonia) are aspirated from thelumen of the trachea during TTW. Problemsmay arise when bringing the catheter upthrough the skin, which can contaminate thesubcutaneous and tracheal ring area with bac-teria from the trachea. 1,2If the horse has been treated with antibiotics and did not re-spond to the therapy, the bacteria present inthe lumen of the trachea may be resistant tothe common antibiotics and may be difcult totreat. Risk of skin infection can also be reduced byuse of a blunt, smooth-ended introduction nee-dle/catheter so that the flushing catheter canbe withdrawn through the introduction cathe-ter without ever coming into contact with theskin or underlying tissue. This makes it important to make a skin inci-sion to allow some drainage at the site wherethe catheter was passed through the skin andto have the owner monitor the site for anabscessation. Emphysema A rare complication of the procedure is secondaryemphysema. This occurs when air escapes fromthe trachea through the incision site or from a dorsaltracheal perforation into the surrounding tissues.Air can then dissect through tissue planes, includingentering into the mediastinum. 1,2 Pressure applied to the incision site after com-pleting the procedure will reduce the risk ofemphysema. 2 Limiting traumatic damage to the incision sitethrough a single incision and needle punctureis also important.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Authors declare that they have adhered to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Bovine colostrum (BC) is used in humans as a nu- tritional supplement for immune support and hasbeen shown to reduce upper respiratory disease(URD). The aim of this prospective blinded ran-domized clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of aBC-based supplement on the proportion of the studyperiod affected, duration of each event, and inci-dence of URD that occurred in yearlings. 2. Materials and Methods A total of 109 yearlings on 2 farms were randomlyassigned to treatment or placebo groups. Treat-ment yearlings were supplemented once daily for 17to 25 weeks with 50 g of a commercial BC-basedsupplement applied as a \"top-dress\" to feed. Year-lings were observed weekly for signs of URD andweighed monthly. 3. Results All 109 yearlings completed the study.

James, MPH*; Woutrina A. Smith, DVM, of S. neurona upwards of 79% and 34% seroprevalence,respectively, in healthy horses. The distribution of these two protozoal parasites in healthy horses showsthat S. neurona is ubiquitous across the country (with slightly lower prevalence in the West), and N. hughesi is evenly spread across all four regions (no signicant difference between regions). These estimates are higher than previous studies suggest, and this high background seroprevalence should betaken into account when performing EPM diagnostic tests.

EPM is one of the most common infectious neurologi- cal diseases affecting horses in North America. Theobjective of this study was to describe the generalseroprevalence of S. neurona andN. hughesi infection among healthy horses using the indirect fluorescentantibody test, as well as prevalence of risk factors. 2. Materials and Methods Whole blood from 5250 horses was collected across 18states in October 2013. Indirect fluorescent antibodytest was used to determine antibody titers to the twoparasites, and mixed effects logistic regression models were created to determine prevalence odds ratios. 3. Results The percentage of S. neurona positive horses was 79%. N. hughesi had 34% positivity, the percentage of dual of S. neurona andN. hughesi was 31%, and thepercentage of was 18%. Risk fac- tors for seroprevalence included the geographic origin(South), Warmblood breed, and increasing age. 4.

Introduction The exact etiology and pathogenesis of skeletal le- sions in the cervical vertebrae of horses with CSM(Wobbler Syndrome) remains unclear. The studyobjective was to assess bone and cartilage lesions inarticular processes observed on magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) to achieve a better understanding oftheir distribution and type. 2. Materials and Methods Twenty Thoroughbred horses with CSM were com-pared with nine control Thoroughbred horses.Antemortem, subjects underwent a neurologic ex-amination and standing cervical radiographs.Cervical column MRI studies were performedpostmortem. Articular process lesions were iden-tied on MRI and classied based on frequency,location, and severity. A subset of lesions wasfurther characterized using microcomputed to-mography and histopathology. 3. Results and Discussion Lesions identied by MRI occurred with an in-creased frequency and severity in diseased horsesand were not limited to the specic sites of spinalcord compression. The most common histopatho-logic lesions included osteochondrosis, osseouscyst-like structures, brous tissue replacement oftrabecular bone, retained cartilage spicules, and os-teosclerosis. This is the rst report of osseous cyst-like structures in the articular processes of horseswith CSM. The observed pathologic lesions andtheir generalized distribution provide additionalsupport for a model of CSM pathogenesis in thecervical spine that involves primary developmentalabnormalities of the vertebrae with secondary bio-mechanical changes.

Introduction Comparative success rates for the treatment of IDDSP using a concurrent reference population using an es-tablished performance database have not been re-ported. The objectives were to compare theperformance of horses with IDDSP treated with astaphylectomy with those treated with a \"tie-forward\"procedure and control horses. Secondly to determinewhether there was a difference in postoperative per- formance between surgical techniques. 2. Materials and Methods Standardbreds with endoscopically conrmedIDDSP (n /H1100556) and 48 with endoscopically normal upper airways were compared with 90 age and sex-matched control horses. Racing data were re-trieved from online racing records (n /H110054304 races). Generalized estimating equations controlling forhorse were used to compare pre- and post-surgeryracing performance (speed, m/s). Similarly, the ef-fect of surgical procedure type on whether horses returned to racing, postsurgical speed, career racestarts, and earnings were evaluated. 3. Results Horses gained speed as a function of race number.There was no signicant difference in race speedbetween IDDSP and endoscope-negative controlhorses. The percentage of horses racing post oper-atively, number of career races and career earnings, did not differ signicantly between surgical methodsor between IDDSP and control horses. 4. Discussion There was no difference between the two surgicaltechniques used to treat IDDSP in this population ofhorses. Reported superiority of newer techniquesmay be biased by comparisons to historical reportsusing presumptive diagnoses. 526 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSRESPIRATORY/MEDICINE Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTESAcknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Authors declare that they have adhered to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of theAVMA.Conflict of Interest The Authors declare no conflicts of interest.

Williams, MS, DACVIM, DACAW The goal of euthanasia is to end the life of equids meeting criteria for euthanasia in a painless andminimally distressful way. Time and sequence of respiratory, cardiovascular, and brain death wasinvestigated. Intravenous overdose of barbiturates is an effective and fast method of euthanasia pro-ducing cortical electrical silence supportive of lack of conscious perception followed by lossof cardiac output, brainstem death, and lastly, loss of electrocardiogram activity. Authors'address: William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of California, Davis,CA 95616; e-mail: mraleman@ucdavis.edu. *Corresponding and presenting Introduction An overdose of pentobarbital sodium administered intravenously is the most commonly used method ofeuthanasia in veterinary medicine. Determiningdeath after the infusion relies on the observation ofphysical variables. However, the time and se-quence of events of respiratory, cardiovascular, andbrain function loss is unknown. 2. Materials and Methods This was a prospective observational study. Horseswith untreatable neurologic, orthopedic, response, and electrocardiogram.Physical and neurological (brainstem reflexes) vari-ables were monitored. The study was approved by aninstitutional animal care and use committee andowner consent was obtained. 3. Results Loss of cortical electrical activity occurred during orwithin 52 seconds after the infusion of euthanasiasolution. Cessation of brainstem function (loss ofbrainstem reflexes and brainstem auditory evoked re-sponse) happened within 4 minutes. Despite unde-tectable heart sounds, palpable arterial pulse, andmean arterial pressure, recordable electrocardiogramwas the last variable to be lost after the infusion(mean, 9.3 min; median, 8.35 min; range, 5.5-16 min). 4. Discussion Overdose of pentobarbital sodium solution adminis-tered intravenously is an effective and fast method ofeuthanasia. Brain death occurs within 73 to 261 sec-onds of the infusion. Although absence of electrocar-diogram activity takes longer to occur, brain death hasalready occurred.

Authors' address: Faculty of VeterinaryMedicine, University 1. Introduction NSAIDs have long been used for treatment of pain, fever, and inflammation. The identication of iso-forms of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes 25 yearsago has allowed for development of COX selectivedrugs and assessment of the risks and benets as-sociated with using COX-selective compounds.Despite the advent of other pain medications,NSAIDs remain a central component of pain man-agement in horses. NSAIDs are considered effec-tive, relatively inexpensive, and convenient toadminister. The purpose of this presentation is toreview current evidence regarding safety and ef-cacy of NSAIDs in common equine disorders. 2. Mechanism of Action NSAIDs work through inhibition of COX enzymes.Cyclooxygenase enzymes metabolize arachidonicacid into the common precursor prostaglandin (PG),prostaglandin H 2, which is then converted into a variety of eicosanoids depending on the enzymaticcomplement of the cell type. COX-1 is constitu-tively produced and is typically associated with thedownstream production of PGs responsible for ho-meostatic functions, including gastrointestinal mu-cosal integrity, renal blood flow, and coagulation. COX-2 is induced by injury and inflammation, typi-cally leading to the production of inflammatory andregulatory PGs. However, COX-2 is constitutivelyexpressed in some tissues, including the kidney. 1 NSAIDs that inhibit both COX enzymes at thera- peutic doses are termed nonselective, whereas those that inhibit primarily COX-2 enzymes are calledCOX-2 selective. Although there is no evidence foran overall class superiority when it comes to ef-cacy, there may be differences between patients orconditions. There is some evidence to suggestthat COX-1 inhibitors may be more effective formechanical pain, which is primarily centrally me-diated, 2,3whereas COX-2 selective drugs may be more useful for inflammatory pain, which is inpart peripherally-mediated. 4,5 COX selectivity is also important with respect to adverse effect prole. NSAIDs are associated with anumber of adverse effects, including renal medullarynecrosis, oral, gastric, intestinal, and colonic ulcer-ation, and coagulopathy primarily related to inhibitionof constitutively expressed COX enzymes. 6-8In horses, there is also a report of ulcerative cystitis compounds seem to be safer for the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but there is no evidencethat COX selectivity alters negative effects on renalfunction. 10,11 NSAIDs commonly used of mended indications and dose regimens for com-monly used NSAIDs is provided in Table 1. 3. Adult Horses Musculoskeletal Disorders Musculoskeletal disorders may result in inflamma- tory pain, mechanical pain, or a combination of both.Anecdotally, phenylbutazone is probably the mostcommonly used NSAID for treatment of orthopedicpain in horses and is commonly cited as being moreeffective than other NSAIDs, although there is notstrong evidence to support this. 17 Inflammatory Orthopedic Pain: Synovitis Efcacy of NSAIDs or Freund's In general,NSAIDs seem to relieve clinical signs and clinico-pathologic abnormalities associated with synovi-tis. 18,19However, few studies investigating the relative efcacy of NSAIDs in these models havebeen performed. One study suggested that pre- treatment with phenylbutazone was more effec-tive than ketoprofen in attenuating clinical signsof carregeenan-induced synovitis doses. 18 In contrast, phenylbutazone and flunixin meglu-mine had similar improvements in clinical signswhen administered following induction of synovi-tis using Freund's adjuvant. 20Although meloxicam and catab-olism, 19,21suggesting meloxicam may a reasonable rst choice for synovitis. Mechanical Orthopedic Pain: Heart Bar Model and Navicular Disease The heart bar model is a useful experimental model that is considered to produce mechanical pain.Only one study has directly compared NSAID ef-cacy in this model. There were no signicant dif-ferences in efcacy of label doses of flunixinmeglumine compared with phenylbutazone for 4hours after induction of lameness in the heart barmodel of lameness. 22When evaluating naturally occurring disease representative of mechanical pain,such as navicular disease, there was a signicantimprovement in clinical signs of lameness in horseswith navicular disease for up to 24 hours followingtreatment with meglumine or phenylbutazone arereasonable alternatives in treatment of mechanicalpain. Mechanical and Inflammatory Pain: Osteoarthritis Pain secondary to osteoarthritis may result fromboth inflammatory and mechanical pain. Unfortu-nately, studies comparing NSAID treatments in nat-urally occurring osteoarthritis are limited. In aprospective clinical trial evaluating NSAID efcacyin treatment of chronic osteoarthritis, overall clini-Table 1.

Topical diclofenacresulted in a similar improvement in lamenessscore, compared with systemic (2 g/d) phenylbuta-zone treatment in an osteochondral chip model ofosteaorthritis. 25In in an acute, irritant (amphotericin B)-induced model of osteoarthritis,treatment with topical diclofenac had no signi-cant effect on lameness scores. 26However, the severity of amphotericin-B-induced arthritis maybe more profound than naturally occurring arthri-tis. Due to the chronicity of naturally occurringosteoarthritis, COX-2 selective NSAIDs, such asrocoxib, are recommended for systemic use.Depending upon severity of pain, topical diclofe-nac may be used but may not provide sufcientpain control when used as a sole therapy in severecases. Mechanical and Inflammatory Pain: Laminitis Depending upon the acuity and pathogenesis (endo-crine vs inflammatory), laminitis may be character-ized by either inflammatory or mechanicalpain. Inflammation-induced laminitis is associatedwith changes in bloodflow. 27Aspirin is a COX-1-selective NSAID at low doses that inhibits thromboxane synthesis fromplatelets, white blood cells, and blood vessels. Be-cause aspirin irreversibly binds to the COX-1 en-zyme, it prevents COX activity for the life span ofthe platelet. A recent study demonstrated that pre-treatment with low-dose aspirin was effective inameliorating both the LPS-induced decrease in dig-ital blood flow and leukocytethromboxane A2 production. 27These ndings sug- gest that aspirin may be a useful therapy to considerin cases of endotoxemia to prevent the onset oflaminitis. In horses with chronic laminitis, neither phenyl- butazone (4.4 mg/kg, IV) nor ketoprofen (2.2 mg/kg,IV) changed lameness grade when compared withcontrol over the subsequent 24 hours, although bothketoprofen and phenylbutazone improved hoof with-drawal response 6 hours after administration. 28 This study only evaluated the effect of a single doseof an NSAID, and it may be that multiple doses arerequired before a treatment effect is observed.In chronic laminitis, centrally mediated or neuro-pathic pain has been theorized to play an importantrole in pain sensation. 29,30In other species, COX-1 has been shown to be an important component ofmechanical pain or neuropathic pain, 2,3which may be ameliorated by COX-1 inhibition.3Therefore, there as flunixin meglumine ini-tially in cases of chronic laminitis. However, overthe long term, transition to a COX-2 selective isrecommended to limit gastrointestinal (GI) adverseeffects. Gastrointestinal Disorders Colic is a common condition of horses that is oftentreated in part with NSAIDs. Although NSAIDsseem to be effective for managing GI-mediated pain,NSAIDs should be used judiciously due to their ad-verse GI effects. Both COX-1 and COX-2 are con-stitutively expressed in the jejunum 31-33However, COX-2 seems to play an im- portant role GI healing. COX-2 gene expressionis increased in ulcerated nonglandular gastric mu-cosa of horses 34and protein expression is increased in small intestinal mucosa subsequent to an isch-emic event. Following small intestinal ischemia,COX-2 expression has been shown to increase rap-idly (following2ho fischemia) while COX-1 expres-sion seems to be slower to increase. 35This increase in expression was associated with an increase intransepithelial resistance, suggesting an increase inmucosal healing. Following an ischemic small in-testinal event, NSAIDs rocoxib and meloxi-cam did not seem to have a marked effect on rate ofhealing. 35,36A clinical trial comparing meloxicam and flunixin meglumine for management of painfollowing colic surgery suggested that there were nodifferences in overall pain scores between the twotreatment groups, but more overt signs of pain inpostoperative colic patients treated with meloxicamcompared with flunixin meglumine. Importantly,meloxicam was administered at twice the label dose(0.6 mg/kg every 12 h). 37One study demonstrated that COX-2 selectivity ratio of meloxicam changedfrom to 3.8 (at IC 50) to 2.2 (at IC80) but the clinical signicance of this change is unknown.14 Although small intestinal mucosal response to ischemia and NSAIDs has been relatively well stud-ied, limited data exists with respect to colonic re-sponses. One study suggested that flunixinmeglumine did not alter colonic mucosal healingresponses. 32 When evaluating imental endotoxemia, as a tobe superior to phenylbutazone (2.2 mg/kg). 38,39 With respect to dose effect, low doses of flunixin(0.25 mg/kg) were shown to attenuate thromboxaneproduction and overt signs of abdominal pain asso-ciated with endotoxin, without affecting other im-portant surgical indicators. 40The lower dose may decrease the adverse effects associated with NSAIDadministration. Collectively, these ndings suggest that COX-2- selective drugs, such as meloxicam or rocoxib, maybe preferred in small intestinal colic if there are no 534 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSRESPIRATORY/MEDICINEsigns of NSAIDs equine endotoxemiahas not yet been adequately investigated. In theabsence of such data, low-dose flunixin may be use-ful in the early treatment of endotoxemia, butshould not be used in conjunction with anotherNSAID due to increased risk of toxicity when stack-ing NSAIDs. 41Additional study is required prior to determination of the preferred NSAID for largeintestinal colic. Ophthalmic Disorders Limited data exist with regard to relative efcacy ofNSAIDs for ocular pain and inflammation. Bothsystemic and topical anti-inflammatory drugs areused for management of pain and inflammation as-sociated corneal ulceration. When evaluatingsystemic NSAIDs, flunixin meglumine and rocoxibhave been demonstrated to penetrate aque-ous humor of healthy equine eyes. 42Anecdotally, flunixin meglumine seems to be more effective thanrocoxib in ocular pain such as corneal prepara-tions, ketorolac, diclofenac, flurbiprofen, supro-fen dogs, there was no differencein the NSAIDs ability to stabilize the blood-aqueousbarrier in an experimental model of uveitis using 1%ophthalmic solutions. 43There is not adequate evi- dence in horses to recommend one ophthalmic prep-aration over the other. However, in the authors'experience, topical NSAID therapy alone is usuallyinsufcient to control acute ocular pain and inflam-mation and systemic NSAIDs are required. 4. Foals NSAIDs should be used judiciously in foals, partic-ularly in sick or premature neonates who may havecompromised renal function. A recent study of theCOX-2-selective NSAID, meloxicam, suggests thatthis drug may be used in healthy foals /H110216 weeks of age (0.6 mg/kg every 12 h) with limited adverseeffects. 44Firocoxib at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg by mouth for 9 days did not produce any noticeable adverseeffects in neonates (age, 36 h); however, plasmaconcentrations were much lower than thoseachieved in adult horses and whether those concen-trations are therapeutic in foals remains to be de-termined. 45Regardless, research to date has been conned to a small number of healthy foals, and itremains a risk to use these drugs in hypovolemic,dehydrated, or premature neonates. It is the au-thors' preference to avoid NSAIDs altogether infoals less than 30 days of age and use alternativepain management strategies. 5. Summary Historically, flunixin meglumine has been theNSAID of choice for gastrointestinal pain, whereasphenylbutazone has been chosen for orthopedicpain. However, the advent of newer COX-2-selec-tive compounds has broadened the opportunities forselection based on the relative importance of COX-1or COX-2 in pathogenesis of and recovery from dis- ease. Furthermore, evaluation of the current lit-erature challenges the frequent selection ofphenylbutazone for all orthopedic conditions.Selection of NSAIDs in horses should be madekeeping in mind label indications, efcacy, andsafety. When efcacy data are unavailable, thepathogenesis and mechanism of pain (inflamma-tory vs mechanical) should be considered.

Colo \u00b4n, DVM, MBA Author's address: Jorge L. 1. Introduction The business-savvy veterinary practitioner recog- nizes that controlling costs associated with inven-tory is essential to the lean process managementtechniques necessary to improve gross prot mar-gins, which ultimately lead toward increased prac-tice protability and value creation. Holding costsassociated with holding too much inventory are adrain to cash resources due to tied-up capital andassociated opportunity costs, together with the un-avoidable factors of inventory shrinkage, expiration,and obsolescence. At the same time, shortage costsgenerated by the lack of adequate inventory re-quired for the provision of services affect the prot-ability of the practice through the loss of revenue. This can be manifested through the loss of serviceprovision, or even worse, the loss of a client's cus-tomer lifetime value to the practice. Inventory demand forecasting is the process of predicting demand for future service events and thecorresponding inventory required for the facilitationand provision of the predicted demand for services.By nature, forecasting is affected by the practice'sexternal environment and is critically influenced bythose factors that are out of the control of the prac-tice such as economic, political, and industry condi-tions. In addition, forecasting can be greatlyinfluenced by internal decisions associated with de- mand generation through the use of advertising forservices during slow time periods, creating nancialincentives for employees, or by temporary reductionin client pricing. Whereas predicting the future inventory demand created by the normal running course of the busi-ness presents a difcult task, controllable and uncontrollable influence factors will affect the pre-dictability of demand for future inventory even fur-ther. Business owners need the tools necessary tobetter predict the demand for future inventory thatwill ultimately decrease the associated costs ofgoods. 2. Forecasting Analysis The rst step in developing a system for demandforecasting is the analysis of previous forecastingperformance through the measurement of past fore-casting accuracy. Though actual methods of fore-casting accuracy such as error, mean error, andmean absolute error tell us by how many units theforecast has been wrong, these methods are notmeasured relative to the total volume of demand.Knowing the quantity of units the forecast is off byprovides little help when the information is ana-lyzed outside the context of total demand volume; a AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 537THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY IN ACTION NOTESpractitioner would be doing a great job being 10 units off in forecasting when the total volume is1000, but would be doing poorly if the total volumewas 25. In addition, unit error would fail to providea proper point of reference for comparing differentvolume-sized inventory items. Measurements of forecasting accuracy relative to a perfect forecast, on the other hand, describe thepercent by which the forecast is wrong and aretherefore best suited to the goals of the lean inven-tory management process. These methods arebased on the measurement of the percent by whichthe forecasting technique is off in each period (per-cent error; PE) and on the measurement of the fore-casting technique performance over multiple periods(mean absolute percent error; MAPE) (see Appen-dix). MAPE, specically, will tell us how well weare doing over time in terms of error. As seen inthe example presented in Table 1, the PE for eachperiod is the percentage by which the forecast wasover- or underestimated compared with actual salesor usage. The running MAPE is based on the sumof the absolute value of all the periods' PEs dividedby the number of periods. The example in Table 1shows that after four periods, the forecasting tech-nique has cumulatively been off by 21.03% (4.84 /H11001 2.04/H110015.17/H110018.97), which translates to a MAPE of 5.26% (21.03/4). What this means is that, on aver-age, the forecast is off by 5.26% each quarterthrough the total time period measured. A percent-based error measurement allows for performance comparison among different volume-sized inventory items. By better understandingthe effectiveness the forecasting technique has hadover time, the practitioner can better adjust andimprove the forecasting technique for future de-mand to achieve increased accuracy. An Excelspreadsheet calculator for PE and MAPE is providedfor download at https://db.tt/xzw2oxvT. 3. Forecasting Techniques There are qualitative forecasting techniques thatrely on intuition, experience and judgment, andquantitative forecasting techniques that rely onanalysis of historical sale patterns through time.Although the young practice will have to rely onqualitative techniques that, by denition, shouldincur a higher degree of forecasting error, theseasoned practice can incorporate quantitative tech-niques based on the practice's own historical data.The ability to adapt the forecast based on observedseasonal changes and trend in sales patterns willallow for an improved forecasting accuracy. Not-withstanding the importance of data, qualitativetechniques based on insights, experience, andknowledge of external factors should be factored intothe forecast to further improve the forecasting accu-racy. Qualitative techniques will not do a good jobon their own, but they will substantially improve theeffectiveness of the quantitative techniques which,by themselves, cannot foresee changes in the exter-nal environment. Simple Exponential Smoothing Exponential smoothing is a forecasting techniquethat places a percentage weight on the last period'ssales and the rest of the percentage weight on thelast period's forecast; a period being described as theunit of time being analyzed (e.g., if forecasting quar-terly demand, \"last period\" refers to the previousquarter; if forecasting monthly demand, \"last pe-riod\" refers to the previous month). Exponentialsmoothing is described by the formula F t/H11005[/H9251/H11003 Yt/H110021]/H11001[(1/H11002/H9251)/H11003Ft/H110021] (see Appendix) and indi- cates that this period's forecast (Ft) is dependent on the last period's actual sales (Yt/H110021) and forecast (Ft/H110021). This enables the forecast to account for all of the older data's forecasts that were developedfrom all of the older data's sales. In simple expo-nential smoothing, a value called alpha ( /H9251) sets the weight assigned to the last period's sales (Yt/H110021). The weight not applied to the last period's sales istherefore applied to the last period's forecast(through 1 /H11002 /H9251). The higher the alpha, the higher the weight of this period's forecast (Ft) that is placed on the last period's sales (Yt/H110021) and the lower the weight placed on the last period's forecast (Ft/H110021), which contains the historical data. The result of ahigh alpha is that a large weight is placed on the lastperiod's actual demand; therefore, the forecast ismore reactive to the latest changes in demand.As seen in Table 2, when alpha is 1, the forecast forthis period is identical to the sales in the last period(forecast for quarter 2 same as sales for quarter 1).The result of a high alpha is that the future forecastbecomes more responsive to the last period's salesand does not take into account the previous history.If the demand changes are trending, then a higheralpha will provide a better weighted average forforecasting because the forecast changes as it reactsTable 1. Example Calculation of PE and of Absolute PE, % % Quarter 1 650 620 30 4.84Quarter 2 720 735 550 580 /H1100230 425 2015 PRACTICE: STRATEGY IN ACTIONto the changes in trending sales. Table 2 shows that, when sales are trending, a higher alpha pro-vides a better forecast, as measured by the resultingMAPE than a lower alpha. A low alpha, in contrast, places more weight on the historical data and the forecast is less responsiveto recent changes in demand. As alpha reaches 0,the future forecast does not take into strong accountthe recent demand history; in fact, when alpha is0, the forecast is identical to the last period's fore-cast. As shown in Table 2, a small alpha fails toproperly respond in a timely fashion to trendchanges and therefore results in a higher MAPE. Table 3 shows that when sales are random, the reactivity of a high alpha will lead to a lower fore-casting accuracy created by the bouncing reaction tochanges in sales, whereas a lower alpha woulddampen the effect of randomness by not being reac-tive; therefore resulting in a lower MAPE. Exponential Smoothing for Seasonality Most veterinary practitioners are faced with a re-peating pattern of sales increases and decreases oc-curring within a 1-year period; a concept termedseasonality. In cases where there is seasonality inthe demand pattern, a quantitative analysis of his-torical sales patterns must be performed so that aseasonality adjustment can be made to the exponen-tial smoothing forecasting technique. After math-ematically de-seasonalizing the data, the smoothingforecasting technique can be applied to the newdata. Once a forecast is developed for a future pe-riod, the data can then be re-seasonalized.Exponential Smoothing for Seasonality and Trend The veterinary practice that is experiencing not onlyseasonality, but also a trending change, needs anexponential smoothing quantitative forecastingtechnique that incorporates adjustments for trendand seasonality through statistics to improve in-ventory demand forecasting accuracy. The explanation of the mathematical calculation of exponential smoothing for trend and seasonalitygoes beyond the scope of this article but the calcu-lation of such forecasts can be performed within thepreviously mentioned Excel spreadsheet that can bedownloaded at https://db.tt/xzw2oxvT. 4. The Need for Improved Forecasting Accuracy Excessive spending related to overestimation of de-mand or to loss of revenue through the shortagecosts related to underestimating demand result in anegative cash flow that reduces operational ef-ciency. By denition, an increase in inventory in-vestment is seen as an increase in working capitalrequirements that must be satised through tyingup of existing cash reserves or through increasedcapital investments from outside sources of cash.A concurrent increase in cost of goods, or potentialloss of revenues, leads to decreased margins thattranslate into decreased prots. The combinationof reduced prots and increased capital investmentsleads to a reduction in returns and a reduction inshareholder value. In contrast, an improved accuracy in demand fore- casting leads to an increase in prots through areduction in total annual inventory costs. BetterTable 2.

More importantly, the increase in gross protmargin and decrease in working capital require-ments lead to an increase in protability and share-holder value. 5. Translating Improved Forecasting Accuracy Into Cost Savings As previously described by the author,1the total actual inventory cost is comprised of the purchasecost, holding cost, and order cost. As dened by theformulas presented in the Appendix, the forecasteddemand is a key component of the calculations.The example that follows in Table 4 presents a real-life situation where minimization of PE and MAPEled to a better demand forecast and, in turn, a re-duced cost of inventory. In addition, the examplepresents how going one step further within the pro-cess of lean inventory management through the cal-culation of the economic order quantity furtherenhanced the cost savings that was originallystarted by the improved demand forecast. The example in Table 4 clearly indicates how im- proving the forecasting accuracy led to a savings of8.3% on just this one inventory item. The gener-ated savings go directly into increasing the bottomline by increasing gross prot margin and increasingprots net of taxes, a scenario that directly trans-lates into increased shareholder value. 6. Measuring the Efforts The efforts toward not having too much inventory onhand can easily be measured through the observedchange in inventory turnover (see Appendix); a re-duced amount of average inventory on hand (theformula's denominator), thanks to better forecast-ing, resulting in an increase in inventory turns.Attention should be paid, however, to the concurrentefforts at reducing cost of goods sold (COGS)(through the use of economic order quantity analysisor through better pricing attainment, for example)as the reduction in the formula's numerator (COGS)will articially reduce the calculated inventoryturns; to the point that an equal percentage reduc-tion in COGS and in average inventory on hand willresult in an unchanged calculation of inventoryturns. For this reason, measurement of inventoryturns should be made with knowledge of changes inCOGS given that the costs of the inventory willaffect not only the total cost of goods, but also thecost of the inventory on hand. A second method ofmeasuring inventory turns that is only based ondemand and order quantity takes away the effectscreated by unit cost on the previously describedturnover calculation and gives a more precise eval-uation of inventory usage. Re-arrangement of thisformula provides the useful measure of days of sup-ply, which will also allow the practitioner to monitorthe results of improved forecasting. Efforts toward avoiding shortage costs associated with too little inventory on hand cannot necessarilybe measured through total revenues other than hav-ing personal knowledge of having lost a client's busi-ness to a competitor. The effort to go lean throughcalculating the economic order quantity should beaccompanied by the calculation of a reorder point(see Appendix), which will trigger an order andtherefore avoid running out of inventory that allowsthe provision of service. Although measuringshortage costs cannot be done other than throughgut feeling, implementation of a reorder point willprevent the shortage costs because the inventorywill be reordered before running out. 7. Conclusion To properly analyze forecasting accuracy, the veteri-nary practitioner must use simple statistics measure-ments that compare with a perfect forecast. PE andMAPE represent a percentage-based analysis of howfar off the forecast was from the actual demand, andprovide a continuous measurement to evaluate accu-racy of estimation over time. Changes in the fore-casting technique to reduce PE and MAPE will lead toTable 4.

Improved demand management will allow the vet- erinarian to better manage cash flow associatedwith invested capital, to take more precise advan-tage of distributor's specials and promotions, and toimprove operational efciency through implementa-tion of lean processes. Improvement of inventorydemand forecasting will also have a signicant pos-itive effect on the ability to increase prots whiledecreasing working capital investments to the ex-tent that a return on investment into inventory costsaving is usually worthwhile based on the resultingimprovement to shareholder value. In all, the ef-fect of improving the accuracy of the inventorydemand forecasting process will translate into in-creased gross prot margins, which directly increaseprots net of taxes, and thereby create an increasein the value of the practice.

Introduction A key component of lean processes in inventory management entails an accurate forecast of the de-mand for future inventory. Lean inventory man-agement systems have been previously described 1,2 and concentrate in the reduction of total annualinventory costs by reducing ordering costs and hold-ing costs, both of which rely on demand quantity fortheir calculation. Whereas all practitioners have toutilize experience and knowledge of external factorsto help forecast demand, qualitative techniques donot, by themselves, provide a signicant level ofaccuracy. The established practitioner, however,can improve the forecasting accuracy by utilizingknown data on previous demand. The use of aquantitative forecasting technique, together withqualitative techniques, will improve the accuracy ofdemand forecasting and help the practitioner im-prove the practice's lean inventory management system. 2. Using the Data Holt-Winters Seasonal Method (Triple Exponential Smoothing) For the most part, the veterinary practitioner is faced with a demand that has both a trend and aseasonality component. Holt (1957) and Winters(1960) extended on Holt's original linear trendmethod of demand forecasting to capture seasonal- ity by creating a forecasting equation that includesthree smoothing equations: level, trend, and sea-sonality; /H9251,/H9252and/H9253, respectively.3Utilizing his- torical data, the Holts-Winters seasonal forecastingmethod produces a demand forecast that takes intoconsideration the expected trend and seasonality offuture demand. This paper utilizes a multiplica-tive Holt-Winters seasonal method due to the expec-tation that seasonal variations will change inproportion to the level of the data series. A triple exponential smoothing forecasting calcu- lator has been created and the Excel spreadsheetcan be downloaded at https://db.tt/xzw2oxvT. Besure to enable macros in your program. Historical Data For each inventory item to be analyzed, the practi- tioner should have on hand the historical sales datafor the previous 4 years in order for the spreadsheetto dene the trend and seasonality of demand.There are four columns and the quarterly data mustbe entered with the oldest year to the left and thenewest year to the right. As newer yearly databecomes available, all previous years' data getsshifted one column to the left and the previouslyoldest data gets removed from the chart. Some ofthe calculations cannot handle a zero value for any 542 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY IN ACTION NOTESsales data and therefore a number 1 should be en- tered for any quarter in which the sales data waszero. The spreadsheet will calculate the seasonalindex for each quarter of data and will generate thecorresponding level, trend and seasonal componentsbased on the Holt-Winters Seasonal formula. Eachsmoothing equation will utilize pre-populated for its respective smoothing param-eter /H9251,/H9252, and /H9253, which will be corrected during a process of optimization to follow. The resultingforecast for each of the 16 quarters of data will becompared with the actual sales data to determinethe mean squared error of the difference betweenthe forecast and the actual sale. Optimizing the Formulas The mean squared error (MSE) is a statistics for-mula that measures the average of the squares ofthe errors in the data and, in this case, presents thedifference between the forecast and the actual salesdata. The smaller the MSE, the more accurate thecalculated forecast for the actual historical demand.Microsoft Excel has a data analysis tool calledSolver that can minimize the value of an objectivecell by changing the values of variable cells, whichare subject to a constraint. The objective cell forour model is the calculated value of the MSE pro-vided by the analysis. The variable cells are thevalues of /H9251,/H9252, and /H9253that the smoothing equations use in the calculations. The value of these smooth-ing parameters are constrained to individual valuesbetween 0 and 1. Optimization of the smoothingparameters will provide the smallest possible MSEand therefore help improve the accuracy of theforecast. The process of optimization has been enabled in a macro embedded within the spreadsheet (after en-tering the sales data click the Optimize button) butthe process is as follows: in your Excel program,install the Solver analysis tool under File-Options-Add ins and make Solver Add-in an active applica-tion. Find Solver under Data menu. SetObjective as the cell containing the mean squarederror value. Set TO to minimize (you want to re-duce the value of the objective cell). Set the vari-able cells, separated by a comma, as the cells containing the values for /H9251,/H9252, and /H9253. Add two constraints to each variable cell, one as \"cell\" /H113500, and another as \"cell\" /H113491 (sets each to be constrained at (0 /H11349value lect the Solving Method as \"GRG Nonlinear.\" Options and then on the GRG Nonlinear Tab andcheck the Use Multistart box, click OK. Once re-turned to the Solver Parameters window click Solve.Once the optimization is calculated, select KeepSolver Solution in the Solver Results window, andclick OK. 3. Results The values for /H9251,/H9252, and /H9253tell each smoothing equa- tion how much weight to place on the different com-ponents of each equation for the process ofexponential smoothing. Given that the forecast isbased on the level, trend, and seasonality, optimiza-tion of the smoothing parameters leads to a more accurate forecast as Solver nds the values for /H9251,/H9252, and /H9253that lead to minimization of the calculated MSE. The end result being a projected forecast forthe next four quarters that has been optimized foraccuracy through exponential smoothing that tookinto account the level, trend and seasonality of thepreviously observed data. Although MSE provides the statistics analysis to help us improve accuracy in the forecast, the statis-tics of mean absolute percent error (MAPE) can beused as a more easily understandable measure ofhow well we are doing over time in our forecasting.A statistics measurement that compares the fore-cast to a perfect forecast, MAPE expresses accuracyin terms of percentage so that we can see, on aver-age, how far off the forecast has been. By enteringinto the spreadsheet the actual sales data for eachquarter related to the forecasted period, the calcu-lator will compute the MAPE over time to give anindication of the level of accuracy achieved. Thiswill allow the practitioner to evaluate the forecast inlight of the qualitative aspects of the forecastingthat statistics cannot foresee and therefore cannotcompute.Table 1.

Translating the Calculated Demand Forecast Into Cost Savings Table 1 presents a real scenario encountered by the author during the 2015 breeding season. Histori-cal data over the last four years showed that, onaverage, 42 cases of an inventory item were usedover the rst 6 months of the year. Normal routinewould have been to place a single order during theAmerican Association of Equine Practitioners con-vention for the expected 2015 breeding season aver-age-based demand. Holt-Winters Seasonal Methodanalysis of the same 4-year historical data, however,suggested that the demand for the period would be36 cases. In addition, economic order quantityanalysis based on this calculated demand suggestedthat eight cases per order would minimize the actualinventory cost for this size of the demand. Actualsales during the 2015 breeding season were 34cases. With a state sales tax of 6%, per order cost of$10, and using a holding rate of 35%, the calculateddemand forecast translated into a 22.55% savingsover what would have normally been incurred hadthe calculations not been performed. 5. Conclusion Lean inventory management relies on cost reductionthrough the reduction of purchase cost and ordercost. Both cost formulas rely on the forecasted de-mand. The third inventory cost component, hold-ing cost, depends on the order quantity which, inturn, also relies on the forecasted demand. Assuch, improvement in the accuracy of inventory de-mand forecasting will serve as a major component ofenacting and improving lean processes. The exam-ple presented clearly shows an opportunity to im-prove cash flows, to reduce invested capital, and toimprove operational efciency; all of which translateinto improved margins, improved prots, and in-creased practice value. The demand forecasting spreadsheet calculator should serve as a guidance tool to help accomplishthe quantitative analysis of historical data. Thegoal is to help reduce the MSE of the calculationsand therefore improve the accuracy of future fore-casts. The data that a quantitative statistics anal-ysis might provide, however, will be of minimalvalue if the qualitative components of demand fore-casting are not taken into account. More accuratenumbers will help improve forecasting accuracy onlyif the numbers are looked at through the eyes ofexperience that take into account all of the practice'sexternal factors.

Let's explore how we can strategically use thisgoldmine of information. Author's address: Box 31, 4168 Elk Creek Ta BC V0B2H0, Canada; e-mail: greg.andrews@inovapartners.com \u00a9 2015 AAEP. 1. Introduction strategy? The Oxford Dictionary denes it as \"a plan of action designed to achieve a long-termor overall aim, under conditions of uncertainty.\" a The word originates from the Greek word for the artof a troop leader or the art of ghting. It is alsofront and center in Sun Tzu's Art of War, 1a classic book often used in business and marketing discus-sions. Two of Sun Tzu's most relevant quotes areas follows: \"Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.\"\"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. Ifyou know yourself but not the enemy, for everyvictory gained you will also suffer a defeat. Ifyou know neither the enemy nor yourself, youwill succumb in every battle.\" What I will try to demonstrate is how you can utilize what is in your medical records to allow youto develop a strategy to thrive and prosper. No, Idon't want you to go to war with other practitio-ners\u2014just to present yourself well to the right mar- ket and with the right tactics. I will make the assumption that you practice ethical, high-qualityveterinary medicine; you have to start with that or,in Sun Tzu's thoughts, \"the expert in battle moves the enemy.\" The mindset of \"I just want to do good work and let it show for itself\" does not work in the world of socialmedia and the Internet. There is always someonewith the magic elixir who is deemed to be betterthan you. 2. What Is the Link Between Medical Records and Strategy? If you can't measure it you can't manage it. If you don't know what you are making or not makingmoney at all, how do you determine what to empha-size in marketing, continuing education courses, andhiring and ring? If you are spending most of yourtime and efforts on surgery, for example, but arelosing money on it while still making a good marginon repro, then you can start to formulate a strategygoing forward that focuses on where resources and AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 545THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY IN ACTION NOTESmarketing will be targeted. The pertinent areas to consider for this strategy to work are as follows: Compensation and hiring: How do you com-pensate better for doing good work? In myopinion, a veterinarian who bills out more pureprofessional services and a higher percentageof lameness exams and blocks versus medica-tions bor joint injections is practicing better medicine that will endure the test of time andexternal scrutiny. Set up you records to allowthese things to be separated and then monitorthem. By using specic codes, any appli-cable software will show how much wasearned. Put these data in an Excel spread-sheet and compare them among veterinarians.Over time patterns will evolve. These pat-terns will allow you to potentially reward yourveterinarians for a higher standard of careand certainly a more protable standard ofcare. Everyone wins\u2014the horse, the client,the veterinarian, and the clinic. Setting upyour codes properly, however, is imperativeand will take some work. Quality control: Are standard operating pro-cedures being carried out in your practice tothe level that you expect? This can be fol-lowed and may affect compensation; it will al-low for the issue to be corrected. Discounting: Discounting by veterinarians isboth legendary and saddening. Simply track-ing the percentage of discounts by veterinari-ans and factoring this into compensation hasshown to decrease this habit. Marketing strategy: Medical records arenot only just your notes on the diagnosis ortreatment; they also need to involve manyother things about the horse, client, and sta-bling. These data can be used for marketingof all types\u2014whether through social media orotherwise. Where, when, and to whom youspend not only your marketing dollars butyour time and focus, which are both valuableand limited, will go a long way in determiningthe success of your strategy. Retrospective studies: There is a wealth ofinformation contained in your medical re-cords regarding diagnosis, treatments, andoutcomes. Setting up consistent nomencla-ture is critical for pulling specic scien-tic information from your data. There aremany things you can do with this informa-tion other than publish it. You can make itwork for you in managing your practice. Soundness management programs: Some vet-erinarians are developing comprehensive lame-ness wellness programs for their elite equineathletes. Actually what you are doing is creat-ing a good medical record with everything thathas been done and those yet to be docu-mented. By setting up these type of programsyou are creating a great medical record both withprocedures that have been done and those sched-uled. Your clients will pay for these good medicalrecords. Another example is veterinarians car-ing for elite athletes who do many proactive ex-aminations and provide their clients with a planfor managing each patient. This \"performanceor life story\" can be used in many different areasof practice. These are a few of the ways to utilize the records that we, by law, have to produce. There is a wholenew science called informatics\u2014the science of com-puter information systems. People dedicate theirwhole careers to this science, and one of the thingsthey often lack are good data. When you have data,use it. You cannot afford not to.

Buchanan, DVM, DACVIM, DACVECC If one understands the cost of a procedure, one can make educated decisions about how to set aprice. Calculating a rough cost of a procedure requires only an accurate income statement anda stopwatch. Introduction All businesses must earn a prot to exist, expand, and grow. However, as a stereotype, veterinariansare compassionate individuals and not the mostaggressive professionals at making large prots.Failure to truly understand the economics of busi- ness also affects protability. No matter whether your practice is a high-volume/low-margin practiceor a low-volume/high-margin practice, understand-ing your costs associated with a procedure areimportant to setting your price. Failure to under-stand a method to best set prices contributes to somepractices with great customer service and client loy-alty never reaching their full potential. In theseproceedings some common methods of setting priceswill be reviewed and an alternative pricing methodbased on looking at the true cost of producing aservice will be proposed. 2. Price-Setting Methods Call the Competition This method involves discretely and anonymously calling competing practices and asking what theycharge for a service. In many cases the caller thensets their fee just below in hopes of competing onprice. Although this is an effective way to maintaincompetitive prices it has several drawbacks.1. It may or may not be protable. In an effort to offer more services, one may be losingmoney with each service. 2. It creates a downward pressure on prices in the area and can lead to price wars with thelocal practices. 3. The services being compared is frequently not something that is being price shopped byclients. In some procedures or for a startup practice, this method can be benecial to determine the local mar-ket. However, one should evaluate the cost of aprocedure and determine whether they are willingto sacrice prot for \"shopped\" services or poten-tially even lose money. National Benchmarking (Services and Products) Many consultants assist practices around the coun-try. They often have a good feel for what is a prof-itable price for a service. They can also be veryhelpful in establishing a model for setting prices.However, not all equine practices are the same.Many are primarily ambulatory based and compar-ing prices to a large referral center in another stateis not always helpful. Despite the differences, it isfrequently enlightening to see what other practicescharge and can help to adjust fees. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 547THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY IN ACTION NOTESCost-Based Pricing (Products) This is a traditional-based method of developing pricing where the cost of a pharmaceutical ismarked up 90 to 250%. In many cases, an admin-istration or dispense fee is also added. Pharmaceu-tical products that have a lower turnover must bemarked up higher. However, applying a flatmarkup to all pharmaceutical items means someexpensive items can be priced above the market.The markup on the pharmaceutical is intended topay for the drug, shrinkage, technician time for or-dering and managing inventory, veterinarian timein choosing which products to stock, overhead, andto make a prot. Charge by the Hour (Services) Other service-based professionals charge a flat feeper hour. As a professional, veterinarians could dothe same on a per-hour basis. Empirically, onecould decide they are worth $X per hour and chargethat amount in 1-minute to 60-minute segments.A charge per time makes nancial sense as long asthe charge is greater than the overhead. As phar-maceuticals continue to be lost to catalog and onlinesales, leveraging time and education as a service is apricing strategy that will become more popular. Charge by Overhead Cost Per Minute Knowing the costs of running a business will allowan individual to set prices that cover the cost ofbusiness and generate a fair prot. This can bedone on many levels; however, it does require anaccurate measurement of how long a proceduretakes. This can be measured with a stopwatch andshould be done for procedures ranging from givingan injection to injecting a set of hocks, to inseminat-ing a mare, to doing arthroscopic surgery. Thetime should include preperation, procedure, andcleanup. In addition, time for client communica-tion can be included in some procedures. Essen-tially, this is a simplied version of activity-basedcosting, in which the cost of a procedure is deter-mined by the resources actually used for thatprocedure. 3. Global Price Per Doctor Hour Any overhead-based pricing requires a relatively ac-curate income statement (prot/loss statement).If there are personal costs (of owners, partners orothers), the strategy should be adjusted to removethem from the calculation. The goal is to take thetotal cost of doing business and remove the drugcosts and doctor compensation. This is the cost ofoverhead that can be used to create a price per hourto determine the cost of a procedure. For this dis-cussion, a theoretical two-doctor practice will beused. 1. Start with expenses from the income statement ($1,040,000).a. Remove doctor compensation (/H11002$260,000)b. Remove billable consumable supplies (/H11002$260,000) i. Drugs, bandages, other inventory, sup- plies ii. How much detail is up to the individual. iii. Supply items removed should be billed to the client in addition to the procedurecharge as either a separate line item orbundled into one price on the invoice 2. The remainder is the amount of money spent to operate the business in the last year minusdoctor compensation and drugs ($520,000). Thisis the cost of overhead. In this theoretical two-doctor practice each doctor averages 50 hours per week including time off forcontinuing education and vacation. Some weeksare greater than 50 hours and some weeks are lessthan 50 hours. However, the total time spentworking on the practice by the two doctors is 5,200hours. If the cost of overhead ($520,000) is divided by the number of doctor hours (5,200) a cost of $100 perdoctor hour for the overhead is calculated. Divid-ing that number by 60 equals a cost of $1.67 perminute. This is the minimum cost for a procedureto a client for a service. This number contains nosupplies, doctor compensation, or prot. If a proce-dure is being charged at less than this number, thepractice loses money every time it does thatprocedure. To calculate a price per hour that includes com- pensation and prot, several things should be con-sidered. How much prot? What is the expectedcommission or production bonus? Are any servicestraded out or discounted for marketing purposes?Are all charges collected? Are collections a problemand should accounts receivable be included? per hour /H11005cost of overhead/(1 /H11002prot% /H11002 commission% /H11002loss%). Any additional markup should be included. If a target prot of 10%, a commission of 25% and adiscount/marketing of 10% are used, one ends upwith a price per hour of $181 ($100/(1 /H110020.1/H110020.25/H11002 .01). This is the minimum price that should becharged to cover the cost of overhead and to generatethe commission and prot desired. Many procedures include consumables. These were also removed from the cost of overhead andmust be added back. However, that time associ-ated with the inventory is included in the cost ofoverhead and the inventory does not need a largemarkup. In a perfect system, the inventory couldbe charged at cost. However, not everything has aturnover of less than 30 days, some inventory ex-pires, breaks, is lost, or is stolen. In addition, noteverything in the drugs and supplies category on theincome statement is sold back to the client. Forthese reasons inventory is still marked up. Whenadministered, the inventory items are paired with a5-minute administration fee. The administration 548 2015 /H11408Vol. 61 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY IN ACTIONfee will change as the cost of overhead and price per hour change. If a particular inventory suffers largeloss/shrink one may must mark this up higher.Although, it is possible to separate out the inventoryand the service on the invoice, the author's experi-ence has shown clients in our area prefer to seethese bundled into a single price. 4. Prot-Center Specic Hospitalization The global approach to pricing does not work for some areas. One example is hospitalization. Ifone was to charge for 24-hour time at $181 per hour,it is likely a horse would never be hospitalized.To develop a more appropriate price for hospitaliza-tion one can again look at the income statement foritems specic to the hospital and add that to a per-centage of the cost of overhead. What this percent-age should be can be examined in different ways:time spent on hospitalized patients, percent of in-come, or square footage. Again in the theoreticaltwo-doctor practice: 1. Hospitalization specic (Total /H11005$69,000) a. Feed, shavings (/H11002$13,000)b. Barn crew (/H11002$40,000) c. Barn supplies (/H11002$10,000) d. Animal disposal (/H11002$6,000) 2. Non-hospital specic Rent (/H11002$70,000)b. Insurance (/H11002$10,000) c. Repairs/maintenance (/H11002$9,000) 3. Hospital as percentage of revenue /H1100525% 4. Hospital as percentage of usable square foot- age/H1100533% 5. Number of hospital days billed in last 12 monthsa. This is the total number of hospital days charged. Average no. horses per day inhospital /H11003No. of days /H110052,700 If the total for hospital specic expenses and 33% of the shared expenses is used, a total expense of$98,370 is calculated ($69,000 /H11001[89,000 /H110030.33]). If this is divided by the total days of hospitalization,a cost per day of hospitalization of $36.43 is calcu-lated ($98.370/2700). The practice is currentlycharging $38.50 for a daily board and examination.Reproduction boarding and rehabilitation/layupboarding are being billed at $28 per day (less thancost). It should be clear that the practice should re- evaluate how it is billing for hospitalization and thedifferent levels of care. The author is currentlycharging a base price for hospitalization and then anadditional bundled cost for higher levels of care, (i.e.,cases requiring more treatments such as ICU cases,neonatal cases, eye cases, etc.) Considering thathospitalization is 25% of the practices revenue,other areas of the practice must be very efcient forthe practice to generate the desired prot. Thissuggests that costs are being shifted to other areasto support hospitalization (overcharging in anotherarea) or hospitalization is a lost leader. For pa-tients requiring more than a daily examination andstall, the price for the hospitalization and level ofcare should reflect the increased cost. Other Prot Centers This same prot center approach could be applied toother areas of the practice. However, trying to sep-arate out ambulatory from outpatient from surgeryfrom medicine from laboratory can become very te-dious and lead to different prices for the same pro-cedure. One would have to take into account thenumber of staff dedicated to each service and assignsome percent of the shared overhead. An alterna-tive approach is to use a global price per hour andadd extra cost and for services where additional staffare required. In many cases these are the specialtyservices for which there is not signicant competi-tion from other practices and a higher markup couldbe used. 5. Equipment Procedures that use equipment may need to add anadditional cost for using the equipment. If the costof the equipment is expensed and included in theincome statement, then the cost of the equipment isalready considered as part of the global cost of over-head. However, if the equipment is nanced andlisted only on the balance sheet, an additional cost ofthe equipment should be considered similar to theuse of inventory. Factors to consider include thecost of the equipment per year, the number of proce-dures, the life span of the equipment, replacementcosts, maintenance costs, and any archiving/storagecosts. Consider the number of times in a year thatpiece of equipment is used and a cost per use can bedetermined. Alternatively, the capital costs of equip-ment could be added into the cost of overheadcalculation. An example in the theoretical two-doctor practice would be the new digital radiograph machine. Purchase price/replacement cost ($57,000)Service fee ($5,000 per year)Life span (3 year)The is $57,000/3 /H11001 $5,000 /H11005$24,000. Number total radiographs taken per year /H110051,000 If the practice takes 1,000 radiographs a year with this unit the cost per radiograph is $24. Adding ina $1 per image archiving fee and the cost per radio-graph is $25. The average time required to set up,collect images, archive images, and evaluate imagesis 10 minutes per radiograph session. At $181 perhour, that is $30.16 per image. This cost for thetime plus the cost per radiograph indicates that anappropriate price per radiograph would be PROCEEDINGS /H114082015 549THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY IN ACTIONper image. The practice is currently charging $40 per radiograph. 6. Price Shopping Certain procedures will always face downward pres-sure from lower-budget clients who price shop.Although it is not necessarily a bad thing to adjustprices down to accommodate for a higher volume,evaluating the true cost of a procedure can help tomake informed decisions. Maybe one is willing tomake less prot on vaccines. Maybe one is willingto take a loss on castrations. Whatever the deci-sion, it should be made with a full understanding ofwhat a procedure costs; this can help decide whereto set prices, and how much one might be willing todiscount for employees, other professionals, andyouths. In addition, as one elects to reduce prot on some procedures, they can elect to increase the prot onothers. As referenced above, some procedures haveless competition or a higher perceived value to theclient and can sustain a higher markup. Exampleswould be gastroscopy, arthroscopy, regenerativemedicine, abdominal ultrasound, or alternativetherapies. 7. Prot Analysis Understanding what the cost of overhead is andwhere a business's prot comes from can allow forsurprising decisions. In addition to adjustingprices, one may elect to focus the practice in a dif-ferent direction or area. As practice managementsoftware continues to evolve, veterinarians will ul-timately be able to set a price and cost for proce-dures allowing the software to calculate prot.Once that process is understood and transparent, itmay lead to the next shift in compensation/commis-sion strategies: paying doctors based on a percent-age of the net prot from a procedure instead ofpercent of gross revenue production. 8. Changing Prices Although not a focus of this exercise, it is worthnoting that changing prices or culture can be dif-cult. The hardest sell is often internally. Butwith a clear strategy and the transparency thatcomes with using numbers from the income state-ment, it becomes easier for the staff to see howprices are created and why prices are set at thespecic level. It is important to remember thatmany people do not understand the concept of prot,so providing staff education can be critical to a suc-cessful effort. 9. Conclusion When considering pricing, a practice should considerits target audience. The price to the client will bedifferent between a practice philosophy that is highvolume but low margin compared with a practicethat is high margin with lower volume. Regardlessof the philosophy, no practice can survive if the priceto the client is less than the cost of the service. Moving to a cost-based pricing brings the focus of the practice onto services. Inventory becomes lessimportant and less of a prot center. As inventorycontinues to get more competitive, it is important tond areas of prot in the practice. Although calcu-lating out all the details of every procedure (gauzesponges, tech time, iodine, alcohol, facilities, doctortime, computer, equipment, etc.) can be daunting,the method proposed here is less complicated andwill give practitioners a tool to use to get to therough cost of a procedure. Knowledge is power andthe tools to evaluate what makes a practice selfsustaining, protable, and healthy is already avail-able to practitioners.

Introduction The facilities where one practices has an effect on the quality and type of the veterinary services that can beoffered. This applies to individual vets or largegroups, established rms or startups, general practi-tioners or specialists. To enhance your practice'sability to serve and attract clients, improve the qualityof your services, and increase your business, there maycome a time when the question arises about expandingor building a new facility. This presentation offers,through a case study, the considerations and stepsneeded to plan and build a new equine hospital. 2. Goals for the Session By reviewing the activities that a small but growingequine veterinary practice (Carolina Equine Hospitallocated in Browns Summit, NC) followed as they builta new equine hospital facility, the important aspects ofthe planning and construction process can be learnedand used by other practitioners as a strategy for theirown building and facility expansion plans. Determining Why You Need to Build Dr. Stinson (the veterinarian) will lead the discus-sion on this topic: The practice's internal discussions and deci-sion makingIssues prompting decision to build Strategy for managing the entire process, etc. Selecting and Teaming With the Right Professionals Dr. Stinson and Mr. Martinolich (the architect) willshare the lead on this topic: Recognizing you can't do this alone Researching architects Researching builders Being Realistic in your Expectations, Scheduling, and Budget Dr. Stinson and Mr. Martinolich will share lead on this topic: Expected costs and schedule Prioritizing wants vs needs Researching other facilities Recognizing that the Planning Process Is an Investment Toward the Success of the Project Mr. Martinolich will lead the discussion on this topic: Design process overview Communication during the process Effort and commitment during the process AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 61 /H114082015 551THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRATEGY IN ACTION NOTESStaying on Course, Even When it Gets Bumpy Mr. Martinolich will initiate discussion on this topic: Unexpected delays Financing Local planning approvals Weather Subcontractor issues, etc.3.

Examples of some of these visual aids are shown in Figures 1-5. The presenters will take listeners chronologically through the planning and building process, high-lighting the key decisions and issues that were en-countered. This rsthand accounting, presented bythe veterinarian and architect who were directlyinvolved throughout the process, will add credibilityand personal insight, from both the owner's anddesigner's point of view, for each of the key pointsbeing discussed. It is said that hindsight is 20-20, so the presen- tation will include a post-evaluation to reflect uponthe process as well as the project, including what Fig 3. Site masterplan\u2014planning stage.

Since its' completion in the winter of 2013,the new hospital has proven to be profoundly bene-cial to the practice and its clientele. Dr. Stinsonwill conclude with a summary of the nancial andpractical impact it has had since opening. An overriding theme to the session and each key talking point is that of collaboration and strategicplanning. From the group of owners' initial deci-sion to move forward with the project through thedesign and planning stages with the architect andinto the actual construction work with the builder,regular communication, consensus building, mutualrespect, and trust were key to the ultimate successof the project. Dr. Stinson and Mr. Martinolich, asco-presenters of this discussion, and involved in dif-fering roles of the overall project team, will permitattendees at the conference to ask questions directlyto either presenter for their objective and uniqueperspective.
