Western medicine offers more advances and cures than ever before, but trying to access that care can feel like you're stuck in an impossible game. Doctors are rushed for time by the insurance system, patients \u2014 especially women and patients of color \u2014 often feel gaslighted by medical professionals who don't take their concerns seriously, and Western medicine isn't set up to view your health holistically. On the flip side of the problem, we are also living through a time of abundance. Today, patients have access to many different traditions of medicine beyond just that of the Western medical system and an integrative approach can blend these practices to address issues with more resources than ever before. Understanding what these approaches are and the philosophies behind them can empower you to make informed decisions when it comes to [optimizing your health](https://veracityselfcare.com/knowledge/body/stress-hormonal-balance-health-chaotic-times). Allopathic (or Western) Medicine: This is the approach to health that you're probably the most familiar with. Allopathic medicine \u2014 or at least its official name \u2014 dates back to the 1800s. It was coined to describe the treatments that more cutting-edge doctors were beginning to use, things like drawing blood and inventing drugs to cure disease. While not all of these early treatments were the best idea, this type of care would become the foundation of modern Western medicine. Today, allopathic medicine is one of the most common approaches to medicine around the world. It relies on the scientific method and focuses on diagnosing and treating symptoms using pharmaceutical interventions and surgical procedures. Its approach is symptom-centered which means it can treat specific diseases, but it's not always good at taking a broader approach to your health. For example, if you have a sore throat or cancer, western medicine can diagnose and treat you. But it's less adept at identifying how a problem with mental health or skin might actually be originating in [your gut](https://veracityselfcare.com/knowledge/body/gut-liver-health). When to use: It's a great choice if you have specific symptoms or a well-known illness, but it may not be the best approach for preventative health or overall wellness. Functional Medicine: Functional medicine takes a holistic approach to health that sees the body as one connected whole rather than a collection of isolated systems and symptoms. Starting in the 1950s, a group of doctors began looking for alternative approaches to medicine outside of the allopathic tradition. In the early 1990s, functional medicine was established as its own type of medicine. Functional medicine's overarching purpose is to get to the root cause of disease by partnering with the patient to examine every aspect of their health. If you see a functional medicine doctor, your first visit will probably be a long one as your doctor grills you about your history with various illnesses, treatments, exposures, and lifestyle decisions starting in childhood. The goal is to consider the connections between every system in your body and every unique aspect of your health history to figure out the best approach to restoring balance and functionality. Functional medicine doctors may order tests that are similar or different to those of your allopathic doctor, and they may recommend treatments ranging from lifestyle modifications and nutrition changes to supplements and targeted therapies. When to use: This is the best approach if you are trying to optimize your overall wellness or if you have health issues that Western medicine has failed to resolve. "}
