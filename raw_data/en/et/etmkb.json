One reason for this is the difficult choice of target antigen, though there is also a need for potent adjuvants/delivery systems capable of inducing both antibody and T cell responses. Current licensed adjuvants, for example Alum, mainly elicit strong antibody responses, therefore, novel vaccine delivery systems need to be developed. One such system is by utilising nanoparticles to increase the vaccine induced immune response. Inorganic carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles in the viral size range (40-50nm) are non-inflammatory, stable in solution, and target dendritic cells. Importantly, these nanoparticles elicit potent antibody, CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses to a range of antigens in murine studies, including to malaria and cancer peptides. Using fluorescent nanoparticles allows us to assess the interaction of these nanoparticles with specific cell subsets, such as antigen presenting cells, by flow cytometry. Furthermore, we can analyse the biodistribution of the nanoparticles using small animal imaging via the IVIS. Ideally, for maximum translation capacity into human vaccines these nanoformulations would be biodegradable. In addition to our model polystyrene nanovaccines we have been investigating biodegradable nanoparticles made from other materials, i.e. iron oxide. Comparable to polystyrene nanoparticles, biodegradable nanovaccines are also endocytosed by dendritic cells and are capable of inducing antibodies and cytokine secretion from both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells.
