For years, the medical establishment has called these chronic or life- threatening diseases \"incurable.\" But now, The Gerson Therapy offers hope for those seeking relief from hundreds of different diseases. Juice your way to wellness. One of the first alternative cancer therapies, The Gerson Therapy has successfully treated thousands of patients for over 60 years. Now, in this authoritative revised and updated edition, alternative medicine therapist Charlotte Gerson and medical journalist Morton Walker reveal even more on the powerful healing effects of organic fruits and vegetables. Not only can juicing reverse the effects of many degenerative illnesses-it can save lives. The Gerson Therapy shows you: This unique resource will help and inspire anyone who has ever said, \"I want to get well. Just show me how.\" The Gerson Therapy offers a powerful, time-tested healing option that has worked for others - and can work for you! The Gerson therapy is said to be effective and its basic premise makes sense: detoxify the body and provide it with nutrients. The former with coffee enemas, the latter with \"voluminous amounts\" of fresh juices. But it costs more than $5,000 per week, and insurance might not cover it. Of course, some of these things you can do for yourself, at home, once you understand the program. But the full program involves a lot of work, which conflicts with the patient's need for rest. Does healing really need to be this rigorous? \"Saturating\" the body with nutrients might be counterproductive. Nutrient intake needs to be adjusted to the digestive capacities of the patient. Some of its dietary recommendations are questionable: a diet \"overcooked by most standards.\" While forbidding nuts, sprouts, and avocados, the program allows oatmeal and baked potatoes, despite cancer-causing acrylimides in cooked starches. It recommends Lugol's solution, which contains potassium iodide; the Natural Hygiene school considers this form of iodine to be toxic. The Gerson therapy is 100% salt-free, to its credit, but this means that iodine deficiency can be an issue. In my opinion, it is safer to get your iodine from a natural source such as seaweed than from Lugol's solution. Is cancer a disease of excess or of deficiency? Is it caused by too much of something or too little of something? The Gerson program assumes both to be true. It aims to detoxify and replenish at the same time. But can this be done? Can the body effectively detoxify itself while it is being \"saturated\" with nutrients? Fasting is nature's way to detox, very different from the Gerson way. A clean-up mode is called for in the beginning, not \"voluminous\" intake of anything. The nutrient therapy can come later, during the rebuilding phase, after the body has been prepared and thoroughly detoxified. The Gerson program makes more sense than most, but is inaccessible to most people. There are other programs that are more accessible, such as Herbert M. Shelton's Natural Hygiene protocol, which is 100% non-toxic. Shelton's program begins with a fast. I wish every one I love would read this GREAT book ! Its the best -most complete - most widely used and successful natural cure for cancer therapy book and everyone is bound to get some thing good from it that will save them from trouble down the line A wonderful delightful stand up and cheer book for me as a nutritionist.The many case histories of patients declared incurable and sent home to die who then undertook Gerson's therapy and are alive and well decades later are so good ! The details of all aspects of teh program are explained in detail . This book is highly entertaining and gives you everything you need to DIY. It was wonderfully thrilling to read case after case of people diagnosed to be incurable dying of cancer told by by their oncologist that they had less than six months to live and to go hoe and get their affairs in order who then undertook the gerson therapy and not only got rid of their cancer but also their arthritis , diabetes etc and returned to a state of perfect health and felt strong and full of energy . VERY IMPORTANT!!!! NEVER ALLOW YOUR DENTIST TO : 1) DO ROOT CANALS 2) Put mercury fillings in your teeth WHY ARE ROOT CANALS SO BAD ? root canal's create a hollow space in the root of your tooth where disease causing bacteria can thrive and multiply and your white blood cells can not reach them because the hollowed out tooth root is dead and has no blood supply. This pathogenic bacteria can leak into your mouth to be swallowed and can also find it way directly into your blood stream . It is a constant drain on your immune system and leaves it too exhausted to fight cancer . WHY IS MERCURY BAD ? Mercury is avery deadly poisen and casues many deadly nerve ( MS , parkinson's and alzheimer's) and cardiovascular and liver diseases including cancer Here is video on to show to your dentist before having him remove mercuty filling from you n mouth https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_co... is Air and water Mercury levels have risen 30X in the last 40 years and 70% of it is from coal fired power plants. thei mercury goes into teh clouds and winds up in the oceans DO NOT EAT SEA or RIVER FISH (Tuna and sushi they are especially high in mercury probably so is kelp come to think of it so get you iodine from Lugol's iodine solution NOT KELP -I guess ) Dr Mark Hyman tell us in this video about not eating sea fish and other ways to avoid getting mercury into our bodies and how to get it out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOhcU... So this book a great help in improving your chances of overcoming cancer and all health problems and maintaining practically perfect vibrant health into your 90s (what's that worth ? ) I know I hope to be living and learning and contributing into my 90s and NOT ever be an unhealthy burden on society !!!! I would do a few things differently like having sprouted oats and rye instead of oatmeal and rye bread Also she keeps making the statement that if your norwalk filter press clothes pores clog up you should throw them away ands get new ones . Does she not know that to reopen the pores all you have to do is clean the cloth , wet it with water , put it in a plastic bag and freeze it ( the expanding water opens the pores and it works like new ) I always store my cloth in the freezer (as above ) anyway since it keep bacteria from growing on it. Those cloths are expensive and if stored in the freezer will last forever ) without the hassle of sterilizing them. I thaw them under hot tap water and use them . I would not prescribe or take glandular supplements of animal origin ( pig thyroid or pancreas ) because I am vegetarian . I also don't agree that a norwalk does a better job of extracting juice from Kale than a green power juicer . The green power is unsurpassed for juicing greens . or that wheat grass is too \"harsh on a most patient's stomach\" . 2 things a noirwalk can not juice are green leafies and wheat grass . I own all 3 and if I got cancer Id use all 3 (and NOT rely on animal gland supplements) The reason people cant tolerate wheat grass juice on a Gerson's diet is because they allow a BIG BOWL OF OAT MEAL and the overcooked veggies -these things clog you up . Wheat grass is very rich in chlorophyll which coagulates like blood . It must be takes on an empty stomach and followed by by a tart juicy apple which will clan it off the walls of the stomach and help it get into your blood. Also I would not juice apples I would eat them whole because teh pectin in the pulp is needed to carry heavy metals out of the body My morning would be : a norwalked lemon ( no yellow peel just the white part ) > 30 minutes later wheat grass grown with kelp fertilizer ( made in ann wigmore juicer ) > 15-30 minutes later eat an apple or two (if teh apple where acidic Like a granny smith Id liquify it in the norwalk and use a straw to save my my teeth) then make norwalk carrot juice finally Id have sprouted oats with sprouted buckwheat or sprouted mung beans . The rest of the day Id have the fresh carrot juice and salads ( maybe allowing some steamed red potato salad ) but preferring raw properly ripened butternut squash in place of cooked potato ( Geron's does not even warn that russet potato starch is gritty and makes it into you blood damaging you heart valves --I'd stick strictly to red potatoes ) I'd also lean more toward turnip root. ( mostly raw) When raw butternut squash was fully ripened on the vine it tastes and textures like a baked russet potato. Above all id eat muscadine grape juice ( as per Johanna Brandt : the grape cure ) Id drink the Black muscadine juice straight out of the The norwalk tube with a #2 grid with no pressing . All this would make up for not taking teh animals origin glandular supplements... In fact ...other than the wheat grass juice and kale juice ...that is how I eat now .... and I feel good Still it was thrilling to read this book and find that the way I've been living my whole life can cure the very worst cases of cancer and leave even 75 year old men who were dying and barely alive fully cured and filled with perfect health and energy and who went on to live for many more years living fully and doing good works ! I was very interested to read about how root canals cause cancer and will take care of my teeth and also about how taking supplemental potassium while eliminating all sodium is THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF GERSON'S Also about how eating flax seed was not good do to unhealthy antinutrients in the grist and how its better to take the cold pressed oil --not surprisingly --I had already figured out that a fat free diet except for flax was essential . People like Max Gerson . Norman Walker, Ann Wigmore , Johanna Brandt and me get our info from the same source : God . So Its not surprising that our diets are so similar and we recognize each other --and that is what reading this book was like for me --it was like coming home to God's way of healing . The american cancer society does not like Gerson's method for 2 reasons : 1 ) Its up to the patient to follow this demanding and restrictive diet and only a person with a relationship with God to lean on can do it . I know I could never live as Ido without Gods support . 2) It does something they can't do and can't make any money from none the less many many thousands all over the who HAVE FOLLOWED EXACTLY the diets of world Dr Max Gerson ,Dr Ann wigmore , Johanna Brandt and Dr walker have in every case been cured of their cancer and those who deivated died if cancer . SO id just say that if you get cancer and want to cure it without kemo UNDERSTAND the therapy THOROUGHLY and follow it completely praying strength and guidance from God . Alternative Treatment works! Cancer is curable now! Don't be fooled by the medical association/s go organic and all natural,eliminate sugar,commit to healthy living,cleanse and detoxify your Budwig Cream Diet. visit/google utopiaawaits(dot)com and oasisofhope(dot)com After being exposed to the ugly truth of out food industry it was only natural I was led to the ugly truth of the pharmeceutical industry. This informative study and therapy just pulled back the curtain. There is a lot of nastiness going on under all those happy people on the anti-deppressant ads. The way we are being \"cured\" by our doctors is strictly business and not in the best interest of our health; it is just to make money. Charlotte Gerson took over the Gerson therapy movement after her father who developed it was poisoned shortly before releasing all the studies and information he had found against modern medicine. His files were stolen and the genious doctor was dead but that did not stop the word from being spread. I did not mean for that to rhyme, but it did. I should put it in a rap song. Anywho, Gerson explains that our diet causes our cancer and therefore can reverse it by going on an all raw/juiced diet. It has been proven and has cured cancer more successfully and much less harmful than radiation/ chemo. I gave the book a good rating because of all the revolutionary information I learned from it, but it was a bit of a hard one to get through as you could imagine.If you have a loved one with cancer I recommend looking into the Gerson therapy. This book is nonsense. It gives patients a false hope, and all of the Gerson Therapy \"clinics\" take ridiculous amounts of money from desperate people, promising a cure and in reality hurting people. There were PROPER scientific trials and what did they show? Just see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20... \"Despite proponents' claims of recovery rates as high as 70% to 90%, case reviews by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the New York County Medical Society found no evidence of usefulness for the Gerson diet. An NCI-sponsored study of Gonzalez therapy, which is similar to the Gerson diet, showed that patients with inoperable pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent standard chemotherapy with gemcitabine (Gemzar) survived three times longer and had better quality of life than those who chose enzyme treatment, which included pancreatic enzymes, nutritional supplements, detoxification, and an organic diet.\" Yeah, pouring coffee into your anus surely doesn't improve the quality of life. This is a good book for anyone looking for a guide to nutrition when dealing with a serious or even terminal illness. It's heavy on examples and medical language, so it's not a light read. However, it's a great starting point for folks who need to overhaul their eating habits. I know this therapy is controversial, but I picked this book up after hearing from people who've had success with this program. I am embracing Anti-Cancer as a recreational regime to give my life structure and purpose. AKA curing my future self via prophylactic time travel. Reject the known, embrace the unknown - put tubes up your butt. I wish every one I love would read this GREAT book ! Its the best -most complete - most widely used and successful natural cure for cancer therapy book and everyone is bound to get some thing good from it that will save them from trouble down the line A wonderful delightful stand up and cheer book for me as a nutritionist.The many case histories of patients declared incurable and sent home to die who then undertook Gerson's therapy and are alive and well decades later are so good !

Self empowering though a bit overwhelming, an option for taking your own treatment for cancer, and many other dis-eases into your own hands through nutrition. So much makes sense it would be impossible to deny that following the Gerson protocol would be health and life changing, but it might also mean hiring a full time juicer, given the amount of glasses of juice you are expected to consume in a single day. I am using this book as reference and have not read it from cover to cover, because of the overwhelming thing it brought on for me! So it's a bit of take what I like, and leave the rest, for now - but maybe one day I'll be able to dive in fully and take it on. IN the mean time, I recommend a couple of dvd's that cover some of the material quite well, and give a good intro to the theories Dying to Have Known http://www.amazon.com/Dying-Have-Know... and The Gerson Miracle http://www.amazon.com/Gerson-Miracle-... Very interesting. I followed it pretty closely for a little over a month. I'm no cancer patient, but I am a type 1 diabetic. Although my insulin levels were reduced, there was no cure obviously. But I mainly attribute the lower levels to the low fat, high fiber aspect of this diet. After I started to re-implement weights into my health routine I quickly became very fatigued despite upping my caloric intake. I needed to reintroduce meat. I now eat clean chicken or fish on days when I lift weights, but I still do the carrot/apple juice as well as mass amounts of vegetables and bananas. Overall led me to a healthier lifestyle. I think some people might just need meat, whereas some people don't. Basing that off of the \"Eat Right for Your Blood Type\" which I find very helpful. The Gerson Therapy is an excellent resource for anyone interested in alternative treatments for cancer. Charlotte Gerson explains how our modern world has become increasingly toxic, why treatments such as chemotherapy fail, and why diet is so important in the healing process. The book contains everything you need to know in order to administer Gerson therapy at home for yourself or a loved one. Even if you don't know anyone with cancer, the information here is crucial for anyone interested in maintaining health and preventing degenerative disease. Very interesting. I know it works, but it's really really hard core if you do the entire nutritional and detox protocols. It consists of juicing every hour all day. It's good if you want to try a coffee enema-tells you how to prepare it, etc..but not good on the specifics. If I wanted to try healing this way, I would check myself into a Gerson Center instead of going it alone! The Gerson Therapy claims to use an alternative natural way to cure cancer. Which involves coffee enemas, eating organic foods and drinking organic vegetable juice. Would I choose this over poisoning the cells in my body with chemotherapy and radiation? Yes. The human body has a remarkable ability to regenerate and heal itself when it is given nutrient dense foods. Very incredibly stringent, but made for those who are sick. I think it would be good to do a lesser degree for those who are relatively healthy but want to be healthier. I may not agree with some of what is touted to be good, but overall an incredible program. The Gerson Therapy is extremely enlightening and encouraging proving once again that we are what we consume and our general health is in our own hands to a large degree. It's a tough read at times but thoroughly worth it Se solo avessimo saputo ... odierna in Ungheria si sui (per malato l'accompagnatore, le spese il tentativo di curarla. I am a 79 year old woman. I was diagnosed with stage IV prostate cancer almost eight years ago. I was told from day one, 'no chance of cure,' and they will only try to give me as much more time as possible. . I thought I will die with it as I had lost faith in the entire medical profession. I was convinced they didn't care and do not want cancer cured. 2 years ago our family doctor introduced and started me on Healthherbsclinic Cancer Herbal Tincture, 6 months into treatment I improved dramatically. At the end of the full treatment course, the disease is totally under control. No case of Cancer, difficulty with urination, and other I'm strong again and able to go about daily activities. Visit Health Herbs Clinic website www. healthherbsclinic .com just wanted to share with anyone looking for alternative treatment for Cancer, I'm forever thankful to nature Notes to self: I don't disagree with most of what is presented here but there are some clear problems that come with a protocol based in a certain time and place. In order to feel comfortable with some of these ideas I need to fact check the salt stuff and the anti-fat claims. If this actually works I feel that it is just a reflection of the fact that the protocol's implementation is fairly low calorie but extremely nutritious and full so phytonutrients from a large variety of fruits and vegetables. I would suggest more updated books that have similar but less dated recommendations like Anti-Cancer or especially if you're a Christian then Chris Beat Cancer. Some truth but a lot of self-aggrandizement that to me takes away from the value of the book and makes me extra skeptical. Excellent book to claw yourself way back to health! Juice and coffee enemas will do it. I followed as much of this protocol as I could while working 12 hr shifts at the hospital on my off days. While I wouldn't recommend that since it won't work as well as if I could of just focused on my health and it took twice as long. With help from my husband I can say now two years later I am finally starting to feel better. Juicing and coffee enemas are no joke and WILL heal you. Would love to read an updated version, one that takes into consideration healing herbs - the likes of dandelion or nettle as a means of cleaning out the liver and bloods also the many other nutrients in other foods and also the likes of Coeliac disease and therefore the need to remove foods like glutens, even dairies for people who cannot tolerate dairy. Otherwise, love the idea of the Therapy to heal our bodies without chemicals/Western Medicine. The Bible for healing cancer without drugs or chemo. My sister healed stage 4 uterine cancer 7 years ago, and I am completely free now of triple negative breast cancer. My doctors wanted me to take 8 rounds of chemo and 20 rounds of radiation, which I refused. Three years later now, and there are no signs of cancer in any of my tests. You CAN heal disease with nutrition! \"\" . , . 3 . I accidentally ordered this book a few years ago. It was well-written with many inspiring stories of how this therapy worked for Dr. Gerson's patients. If you are looking for a natural way to fight cancer, please give this a chance. This is a foundational book of healing and is eye-opening in its content. Charlotte Gerson is the daughter of the holistic pioneer Max Gerson. The stories of success are amazing. Most cancer chemo strategies have a dismal stat cure rate. The Gerson diet, though intensive has a 50 percent recovery rate. This material was gathered about 50 years ago from Max Gerson and is still cutting edge. Some themes like salt and \"hot\" herbs like cayenne pepper and turmeric are reflective of a later age. But I have heard of people recovering from such a vegetable-based diet and juicing system. For those who want hope, I encourage you to read this book. Charlotte Gerson has been curing people through the years, carrying on her father's work, and was 96 when she passed. Even in her 90's she was sharp and exuded life. Living nutrients carry alive enzymes and antioxidants that attack tumors and cancer cells. This book details this through the testimonials and recorded data within its pages. The Hallelujah Diet is built on a simpler premise though not as intensive. This organization has an interesting testimonial page on their website, detailing people who have submitted being cured...ranging from issues of brain fog to sexual dysfunction to arthritis. I encourage those who read my review to watch Charlotte Gerson's documentary videos on Youtube or on other free site sources. This further shocks me...to see the suppression and aggressive undermining corporate groups have played in undermining this work in the US. Cancer is very near to my heart. I believe this book has weight. In matters of a diet based largely on plants, positive results have been shown to take place. I would also suggest two other books I have read that I have found extremely helpful. Book one: \"Chris Beat Cancer\" written by Chris Wack \"Sodium Bicarbonate: Unique First Aid Remedy\" written by Dr. Mark Sircus. I was first turned onto Sodium Bicarbonate, also known as Baking Soda when I was helping a friend from a church move. One of the people there was an older man who said he was cured of 3rd stage prostate cancer through doing this treatment. He heard about such treatments from Vernon Johnston, who cured his bone cancer with this substance. He has a video on YouTube that details this. Google \"baking soda molasses cancer.\" At his video site, people have written of success in using this treatment. I regress...but baking soda is the highest form of body alkalization I know of. Cancer can't grow or live in a high alkalized environment. The trinity of these 3 books can prove highly useful and uplifting to add to one's knowledge bank. "}
