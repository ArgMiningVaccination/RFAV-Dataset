A growing number of people are drinking herbal tea to support their health and wellbeing. But while it may seem like a new trend in Europe and the US, tea's use as medicine can be traced [back](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2019/9458676/) as far as the Shang dynasty in China, some 4000 years ago. One legend has it that the [first ever cup](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/discussion/just-your-cup-of-tea-the-history-and-health-claims-of-the-nations-favourite-brew) of tea was drunk by the Chinese emperor Shennong (who is generally believed to be the founder of Chinese medicine) in 2737BC. While he was sitting in the shade beneath a Camellia Sinensis tree, boiling water to drink, a few leaves floated down into the water. The leaves changed the colour of the water and led Shennong to discover that the infusion had restorative properties. While the UK's favourite cuppa has only been around for about 350 years, the relationship between tea and health has a rich history around the world. In China and elsewhere in Asia, tea-making has long been considered an important skill, or even an art form. The [Ch'a Ching](https://www.ibiblio.org/chineseculture/contents/food/p-food-c03s05.html), translated as The Classic of Tea by Chinese writer Lu Yu, is the earliest known written guide to tea. It has extensive (and we mean really extensive) instructions on the process and etiquette of making tea. There's some uncertainty about whether [Portuguese or Dutch](https://www.lib.umn.edu/bell/tradeproducts/tea#:~:text=The%20first%20ship%20known%20to,from%20Japan%20(Britannica%20738).) merchants were the first to bring tea to Europe. But whoever it was, they brought with them more than just a tasty drink \u2014 they introduced a new way for Europeans to benefit from the nutritional and medicinal power of plants. What Are the Medicinal Uses of Tea? This is a huge question, with so many possible answers that we'd need to write a book (or five) to fill you in. If you do want to go deeper, we recommend [20,000 Secrets of Tea](https://www.amazon.co.uk/20-000-Secrets-Tea-Effective/dp/0440235294) by Victoria Zak as a great place to start. Zak credits tea as the most effective way to benefit from the healing properties of herbs. That's because tea is easy to make and allows the body to absorb plant compounds quickly. An [ambitious report](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334061714_Herbal_Teas_and_their_Health_Benefits_A_Scoping_Review) on the clinical benefits of herbal tea was published in the journal Plant Foods for Human Nutrition in 2019. It looked at 21 different clinical studies, and found that teas made from numerous different ingredients did have significant positive effects on health. Turmeric tea, for example, holds up as an effective treatment for arthritis, and herbs including Water Hyssop and Bacopa Monnieri improve the cognition and speed of attention of people who take them in tea form. Ginger tea, or blends containing some ginger, have been clearly found to enrich drinkers' sensory experience. According to researchers, this could make ginger an important medicinal tea in certain areas, particularly social enrichment and improving nutritional care for the elderly. Other evidence \u2014 both clinical and anecdotal \u2014 tells us that herbal tea can support us with a vast array of health concerns and conditions, including: - Preventing and recovering from colds and flu - Lowering cholesterol - Easing the symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders - Boosting energy and managing fatigue - Offsetting cognitive issues, including memory loss - Weight loss And as well as helping you heal when you're not well, drinking herbal tea on a regular basis can help to support overall good health and immunity and prevent illness.
