The intranasal Covid vaccine was approved by DCGI (Drug Controller General of India) in September 2022 and then by CDSCO in November 2022 for restricted use under emergency situations for people 18 years and above. iNCOVACC- the intranasal covid vaccine will now be available under the Covid vaccination program in India. This needle-free Covid vaccine, which is easy to administer, can also be used as a booster for people who have received previous doses of any approved Covid vaccines(heterologous booster). Table of Contents iNCOVACC intranasal vaccine is a type of recombinant vaccine, meaning that it is created with an adenovirus vector. This kind of vaccine is made after extracting only a tiny piece of the DNA from the concerned bacterium or virus for which immunity is to be built and is inserted into the cells while manufacturing them. It is made with a pre-fusion spike protein that is stabilised. The vaccine has been formulated so that intranasal delivery is possible through nasal drops. The nasal delivery system has been developed cost-effectively, keeping in mind middle-income and low-income countries. iNCOVACC is a nasal vaccine to be administered twice at intervals of four weeks (28 days). Four drops will be administered into each nostril, thus totalling eight drops (0.5 mL dose in total). To be eligible for this vaccine, candidates must be 18 years and above.

Vials must not be frozen. The iNCOVACC vaccine has been designed to provide immunity against COVID-19, a viral disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 of the coronavirus family. The COVID-19 infection has caused massive damage to people's health, economy and social-political standing since it spread globally in the earlier part of 2020. The virus spread as a result of people-to-people contact and respiratory droplets. The iNCOVACC vaccine has been designed to provide immunity against COVID-19, a viral disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 infection has caused massive damage to people's health, economy and social-political standing since it spread globally in 2020. With the increase in Covid cases in China, the US, Brazil and other parts of the world, we must amp up our guards and reduce the risk of exposure to Covid infection in all possible ways. Approval of nasal covid vaccine can help speed up the vaccination drive of precaution doses in India. By following proper safety measures and other standard COVID-19 protocols, we can fight the novel coronavirus disease.
