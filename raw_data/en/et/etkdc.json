FACTI'M WORRIED... my child will have side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine.The health risks if children are infected with COVID-19 are much higher than the risk of vaccine side effects. Like other vaccines, the most common side effects are a sore arm, tiredness, headache, and muscl e pain. These symptoms are usua lly mild. Side effects were generally mild to moderate in severi ty and occurred within two days after vaccination, and most went away within one to two days. FACT I'M WORRIED...
