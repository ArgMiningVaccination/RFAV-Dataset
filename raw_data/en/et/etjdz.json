A: Yes. We are in-network most BCBS plans, Molina Applecare and Molina Marketplace. We will access your child's WA State Immunization records (WAIIS). If you have additional vaccine records or vaccine cards, please bring them. Q: Can I get a Novavax vaccination as my booster? A: Yes, for your 1st or 2nd booster. Q: Are all boosters bivalent and what does this mean? A: Both Moderna and Pfizer have bivalent boosters available. All 5y+ (Pfizer) and 6y+ (Moderna) are eligible for a bivalent booster as long as you have completed a primary series (dose 1/2) and are at least 2 months past your last Covid vaccine. You can mix and match vaccine manufacturers. Bivalent means that the vaccine was re-formulated to include activity against the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants. These will be switched over to the EBB variant mid-September 2023. Q: When will children under 5 be eligible for Covid vaccinations? A: We anticipate starting vaccination for the under 5 year olds Wednesday 6/23. There are limited clinics and facilities available to vaccinate this population, so we appreciate your patience as we do our best to accommodate as many appointments as we can in our small clinic. To help our staff and providers, please do not call or email to inquire about appointments. All new appointments will be posted through our website as we are able to accommodate. Q: Which vaccines are available for 6 month to 5 year olds? A: Both Pfizer and Moderna were FDA authorized for administration in our youngest pediatric population. We will carry both preparations. Pfizer is a 3-dose series of 3mcg (1/10 of adult dose) at 3 weeks apart and then 3rd dose 2 months later. Moderna is a 2-dose series of 25mcg (1/4 of adult dose) at 4 weeks apart. Both are anticipated to need booster doses. Q: Did the under 5 Covid vaccines have safety concerns or higher rates of myocarditis or pericarditis? A: No, there were not safety concerns or any incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis in this age group in the study trials. Q: Why is Pfizer 3-dose for the Covid under 5 year olds? A: The initial study with the 2-dose at 3mcg did not induce neutralizing Covid antibodies in 2 year old to 4 year olds. With the 3rd dose there was a reported 80% efficacy of preventing symptomatic Covid. These numbers are hard to fully intepret as the variants have been changing and the sample size of the trial that received a 3rd dose was small. Q: Tell me more about the 2-dose Moderna in under 5 year olds? A: The Moderna is a higher dose and did show a high production of neutralizing antibodies against Covid after 2 doses. There was an increase in fever and fatigue post vaccination in this group in rates similar to other childhood vaccinations. A 3rd booster dose is currently being studied as well as studying in 3month - 6 month olds. We fully anticipate that a booster will be offered. Q: What vaccinations are 5-11 years old eligible for? A: Kids 5-11 years of age are eligible for 2 doses and 1 booster of Pfizer Covid vaccination. This pediatric preparation is 10mcg with the 2nd dose given 3 weeks after the first (21-45 day window). The booster is given 5 months after the 2nd dose. Q: When will Novavax get reviewed as an alternative Covid vaccination to mRNA Covid vaccinations? A: Novavax is a protein subunit vaccination, using similar technology to some current approved childhood vaccinations. The FDA authorized Novavax for initial vaccination against Covid (2 doses) in June 2022. Final approval is pending an additional review of updated manufacturing processes. Q: I've previously had Covid. Do I have natural immunity? Should I still get vaccinated? A: Unfortunately, long-term immunity is not acquired with natural Covid infection. Current findings is that there is some short-term immunity, however the science around this is still emerging. The current recommendation is to get Covid vaccinated after Covid infection as soon as able. Q: I received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma with recent Covid infection. How long do I need to wait to get vaccinated? A: It is recommended to wait 90 days before getting your 1st Covid vaccination after receiving these treatments. Q: Should I take Ivermectin? A: No. Research does not support the use of Ivermectin for prevention or treatment of Covid. This medication could cause harm to your liver and is not effective at treating Covid disease. Q: What is myocarditis? A: Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle. It is a condition that can be caused by various factors, more commonly viral infection. The symptoms of myocarditis include: chest pain, shortness of breath, and/or an abnormal heartbeat. Q: What is the association between myocarditis and Covid-19 vaccinations? A: There have been some very rare reports of individuals developing myocarditis following vaccination. It has occurred most often in males ages 12-29, most often after the second dose, and usually within a few days of vaccination. Of the cases that have occurred, the majority have been mild, treated with minimal intervention and rest. Q: How should I balance the risk of myocarditis with vaccination? A: Millions of doses of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have been given out, and of those, very few cases of myocarditis have developed. There were no cases of myocarditis in the 3,082 trial participants ages 5-11, though a higher number of participants will be needed to truly assess the rate. In contrast, COVID-19 infection can affect the heart, not only as part of MIS-C or potentially post-COVID sequalae, but also from having the infection itself. Physicians are more worried about the risk of heart damage from the infection than vaccination. Vaccination is effective at preventing serious illness, infection, and reinfection from the virus that causes COVID-19. "}
