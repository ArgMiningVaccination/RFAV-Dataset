In places where HPAI remains endemic, vaccine has been used to reduce the quantities of vi- rus shed into the environment, which, in turn, reduces human exposure and the likelihood of zoonotic and pandemic influenza, as well as the risk of severe disease in poultry. In other countries (China, Hong Kong SAR and Mexico), vaccination has been used successfully to as-sist in the elimination of virus. Despite these positive experiences, considerable resistance to use of vaccine exists because of perceived and actual adverse consequences associated with vaccination as well as concerns about availability of sufficient resources to conduct vaccination programmes. The adverse effects can be overcome or managed, and benefits of vaccination maximized if vaccine is used ra- tionally. Rational use involves five core prin- ciples and requires: i) clear objectives and regular reviews of progress towards these objectives; ii) design of the programme so as to achieve high-level immunity in vaccinated populations through use of appropriate, lo- cally-registered vaccines and implementation of post-vaccination monitoring; iii) passive surveillance systems able to identify flocks in which virus might be circulating so that these can be reported and investigated; iv) applica- tion of other appropriate management prac- tices and biosecurity measures at farms and markets aimed at reducing the risk of infection with HPAI: and v) an appropriate cost-sharing mechanism with the private sector. \u0098 Why opt for vaccination? Since it emerged in 1996, HPAI caused by Goose/Guangdong-lineage H5 viruses (H5 HPAI) has become a major risk and constraint to poultry production on four continents and a cause of sporadic severe zoonotic disease in humans. It also remains as a potential hu- man pandemic influenza threat. In most plac- es, control of avian influenza can be achieved primarily by stamping out. However, the ef- fectiveness of this strategy depends on early detection of all infected poultry and swift ac-Rational use of vaccination for prevention and control of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenzaContributors: Les Simsa, Astrid Tripodib, Sophie von Dobschuetzb, Emma Gardnerb, Ryan Aguannob a, b (See back cover)2 VOL 10 | MAY 2016tion to prevent these birds from spreading the virus. The costs of stamping out are high, not only in terms of the intervention itself but be- cause of the compensation provided to affect- ed owners, which is necessary to encourage reporting and to help defray losses to people's livelihoods. Evidence suggests that virus elimination in poultry is unlikely in a number of countries where the virus remains endemic (FAO, 2012). In these places, all available tools for preven- tion and control of the disease should be con- sidered, including vaccination using appropri- ate and quality biologicals. Table 1 provides possible scenarios for the use of vaccination. Control and elimination of H5N1 is achieved by reducing the number of infected and sus- ceptible poultry, thereby also reducing the amount of circulating virus able to establish onward transmission. Vaccination can help achieve these objec- tives by increasing resistance to infection, de- creasing the likelihood of disease and reduc-ing shedding of the virus in those birds that do become infected. Unvaccinated infected chickens shed much higher concentrations of virus than their vaccinated, infected coun- terparts (Swayne, 2006). Once vaccinated, marked reduction of onward transmission of virus can occur within seven days post-vac- cination (van der Goot et al. , 2005). In one ex- ample in China, Hong Kong SAR, in which vac- cination was used in the face of an outbreak, transmission ceased within 18 days (Ellis et al., 2006). Despite the potential benefits of vaccina- tion, many countries continue to restrict their control options to stamping out even after it is evident that this method is not working as in- tended. This creates a major burden for poul- try producers and does not halt the spread of disease as farmers will often sell flocks of poultry when they first notice increases in mortality, which, in turn, exacerbates the out- break and increases the public health risk in the case of zoonotic influenza viruses.

Two main types of poultry vaccine are availa- ble for avian influenza at present: killed anti- gen in an oil-based adjuvant and vaccines that rely on a viral vector to deliver the antigen. Killed antigen vaccines have been used for decades in the prevention and control of avian influenza and work effectively. They require in- dividual injection of birds and usually multiple doses are needed starting at about two weeks of age. In some countries, a withdrawal peri- od applies before birds can be sent to slaugh- ter for consumption, as specified by the man- ufacturer and/or veterinary authorities. This can limit the value of vaccination in short- lived meat birds. (However, no known public health risk is associated with consumption of a vaccinated chicken; the withdrawal period is related to the additives mixed in the vaccine to improve its stimulatory properties or preserv- atives). Maternal antibodies (conferred via egg yolk in the embryo) can interfere with the immune response generated by these vac- cines (Maas et al. , 2011) and generally vanish by two to three weeks of age after hatching. When these are expected to be present (if parent stock has been well vaccinated or ex-Box 1 Real-life examples: Success of vaccination against avian influenza - China, Hong Kong SAR, Italy, Mexico, United States of America, Viet Nam Vaccines were first used successfully against low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses and these experiences demonstrated the potential for use against highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. Poultry in turkey farms in the United States of America were among the first to be vaccinated successfully against a range of LPAI viruses (Halvorson, 2009). Vaccination since has been used effectively in a number of places including northern Italy (LPAI), Mexico (H5 and H7 HPAI) and China, Hong Kong SAR (H5 HPAI) to prevent infection and to control and eliminate virus. In these places, vaccination was coupled with other measures such as raised biosecurity standards, active surveillance and stamping out. Other countries where avian influenza virus was endemic and where stamping out had not achieved the desired goal have used vaccination to reduce viral loads. The experiences with HPAI in Viet Nam during 2003-2004 warrant consideration given that some 45 million head of poultry had been lost, most through culling. This loss represented 17 percent of the total standing poultry population. It is likely that depopulation did reduce viral loads, but by 2005, Viet Nam was experiencing more human cases of Influenza A(H5N1) disease than any other country, demonstrating that any positive effects from the stamping out were short-lived. Poultry vaccination, along with a number of other measures, was implemented to reduce human health risk resulting in a marked reduction in human cases. Viet Nam continues to use vaccination and conducts regular review of the need for vaccination, the scope of the programme and the vaccines to be used.Box 2 Real-life example: Selling of sick birds - a report from the 2006-2008 Nigerian outbreak In an assessment of market chains in Nigeria conducted in 2008, it was found that when birds get sick, 41 percent of respondents organize salvage slaughter, 31 percent isolate the sick birds for treatment and 27 percent sell the sick birds at low prices (FAO, 2008). This demonstrated that disease reporting was not occurring, which can reduce the effectiveness of stamping out. This assessment was done shortly after payment of compensation had been discontinued. positive. To overcome these concerns, vac- cination programmes should be designed to maximize benefits and minimize unwanted consequences. Appropriate timing: The option to vaccinate should be assessed early in the face of dis- ease and should not be considered as a last resort. Regular review points that consider the possibility of vaccination should be in- cluded in HPAI contingency plans. Apart from the benefit of controlling disease, the use of vaccination can help to: \u0083reduce the cost of control when effective vaccine delivery can be ensured; \u0083decrease disruptions to the poultry sector; \u0083secure public health; \u0083protect high value stock - Note: in those endemic countries where vaccination is prohibited, smuggling and use of vaccine of unknown origin and potency by the private sector is to be expected and has occurred (Sims, 2013); \u0083control the virus when it has become en-demic despite implementation of other measures; \u0083maintain consumer confidence and miti-gate potential market shocks.posed to the virus), delivery of killed antigen vaccine in the progeny should be delayed for approximately one week (to three weeks of age). The efficacy of killed antigen vaccines is determined by the antigenic relationship between the vaccine and field strain, the im-munogenicity of the antigen and the quantity of antigen in each dose. Effectiveness in the field is influenced by: the manner of vaccine storage prior to administration (the vaccines require maintenance at 4-8\u00b0C as they are not heat-stable); concurrent immunosuppressive diseases in vaccinated birds; and species of bird and the vaccination schedule, including age of first administration. As these vaccines contain whole (inactivat- ed) virus, antibody is generated to the hae- magglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins of the antigen. The antibody to the HA is most important for protection from dis- ease and for reducing viral shedding. A number of different viral vectors have been used for delivering HA antigens includ-ing fowl pox virus, Newcastle disease virus, alphavirus replicons and herpes virus of tur- keys. Several experimental vectors are also being assessed including duck enteritis virus. Some of these vaccines appear to be effec- tive in the presence of maternal antibodies and can be administered in ovo or at hatch- ing (Rauw et al. , 2012). Vectored vaccines may afford broader protection against viruses of different strains and clades, perhaps, in part, 4 VOL 10 | MAY 2016because they also stimulate cell-mediated immune responses. Nevertheless, it is pref- erable for the HA insert in the vector to be a reasonable match to the circulating strains of virus. Most vectored vaccines are used to prime the immune system and are followed several weeks later by a dose of killed vac- cine. Vaccine research development is ongo- ing and constantly evolving (see, for example, Kapczynski et al. , 2016, Rahn et al. , 2015). Apart from efficacy in the target popula- tion, the choice of vaccine will depend on other factors, including price and availability. These factors can change over time, providing additional reasons for regular review of vac- cination strategies and management of the programme. \u0098 Principles of rational vaccine use 1The vaccination programme must have clear objectives, established by govern- ment in consultation with the private sector, that relate to the overall prevention and con- trol plan (such as mitigating production loss- es and reducing human exposure to virus). It must be assessed regularly (at least annually) in order to review progress towards the objec- tives and update or modify the objectives as necessary. The objectives must justify the ac- tivities carried out. For example, large-scale vaccination of smallholder and household poultry flocks, with birds of different ages and rapid turnover, can usually only be justi- fied on public health grounds and then only if resources are available to ensure that appro- priate levels of flock immunity are maintained in these birds (especially during periods of high risk of transmission). Past experience suggests that this is difficult to maintain over large areas but can be successful at the local level. The programme should include clear goals and criteria for ending vaccination. 1 Vaccina- tion should be used for as long as is neces- sary to control and prevent infection and may be required for an extended period in places where the virus is entrenched and prospects of virus elimination are poor. Vaccination can be stopped when the disease is controlled or eliminated, when the risk of re-incursion is low, and when new outbreaks can be de- tected and managed rapidly. It is possible to use emergency vaccination even after routine use of vaccination ceases. Unrealistic time lines on the expected duration of vaccination programmes should be avoided especially in places where infection is already widespread. 2Only high quality vaccines that are a good antigenic match to circulating strains and at an appropriate dose should be used. They should be produced in accordance with good management practices using international standards.2 They should also be good immu- nogens, i.e. able to induce a good immune re- sponse in vaccinated birds. Before implementing a large-scale vacci- nation programme the effectiveness of the vaccine(s) chosen should be assessed un- der laboratory and field conditions against circulating viruses. The levels of antibody in vaccinated chickens to field virus generally correlate with levels of protection; (high an- tibody titres against the field strain provide better protection than low titres and can pre- vent virus shedding and disease) (Swayne, et al., 2015). Regulation of licensed vaccines is necessary to avoid the use of inefficient/inef-fective vaccines. A properly managed govern- ment vaccine registration/licensing process is, therefore, needed. It may be necessary to de-register vaccines if significant antigen- ic drift 3 occurs or new strains of virus are detected through monitoring programmes against which existing vaccines provide little or no protection. Governments can enter into contracts with private/academic institutions to carry out this function. A coding system for the different vaccines to be tested should be used to rule out subjectivity (such as manu- facturer preference). Facilities producing vac- cines should be separate from agencies that verify the vaccine's quality and efficiency. 3Agreements should be in place to ensure that farmers immediately alert veteri- nary authorities in case of mortality of vac-cinated poultry above agreed baseline levels. This will facilitate early detection of vaccine failures or antigenic variant viruses that may arise during the course of a vaccination pro- gramme. If increased mortality due to avian influenza occurs in a vaccinated flock, the government should provide appropriate and timely compensation 4 for the flock owner if the flock is destroyed. 4Wherever possible, vaccination should be accompanied by other measures to re- duce the likelihood of exposure to and trans-mission of the virus. These should include enhanced farm and market biosecurity measures such as all-in-all-out flock man-agement, banning overnight stay of birds in markets, etc. (FAO, 2015a; FAO, 2015b; FAO, 2015c). For some production systems, such as free-grazing ducks, the only biosecurity measures available are reducing direct and indirect contact between domestic ducks and other types of poultry, and tight movement management. The potential for spread of vi- rus by vaccinators moving between premises must be recognized and appropriate hygiene measures put in place, including cleaning and 1 This is often termed 'exit strategy'. 2 For procedures see the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, at http:// www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.04_AI.pdf.3 Antigenic drift: small changes in the genome of influenza viruses that happen continually over time during virus replication, eventually changing the anti-genic properties of the virus. 4 For more information on compensation please see http://www.fao.org/avianflu/en/compensation.htmlFive core principles of rational vaccine use 1. Set clear objectives and regularly review strategies for vaccination, consistent with the overall prevention and control plan. 2. Use high-quality vaccines, registered by national authorities, shown to be a good antigenic match to the circulating field strain(s). 3. Strengthen the passive surveillance system and farmer compensation scheme especially if virus elimination remains the immediate goal. 4. Strengthen concurrent biosecurity measures and good farm management practices. 5. Agree on a cost-sharing scheme between public and private sectors, based on vaccination objectives.5 VOL 10 | MAY 2016disinfection of boots or change of boot covers and coveralls between farms, and disinfection or change of vaccination equipment. 5Cost-sharing of vaccination (and post-vac- cination monitoring) should be applied be- tween the government and the private sector. If industry will derive significant production and marketing advantages from vaccination, they should pay most of the costs. A case for subsidized vaccination can be made if the main purpose is to protect public health. \u0098 Key questions in designing a vaccination strategy for disease prevention and control In deciding whether or not to use vaccination, the key question to ask is: Can vaccination assist in prevention and con- trol of avian influenza and reduce the risk of human cases and, if so, how? In answering this question, the effectiveness of existing control and preventive measures must be assessed, as well as their costs (eco- nomic and social) compared to those of vacci- nation. Synergy between methods may mean that some costs associated with stamping out can be reduced if vaccination is used. Another important issue that needs to be considered is the efficiency of case detec- tion. If a high proportion of cases are unde- tected and action is not taken early enough to prevent virus transmission, the likelihood of disease elimination using stamping out is of-ten poor in areas with a high density of poul-try farms. This is the situation in the places where H5N1 HPAI viruses remain endemic (FAO, 2011). Guidance for the decision-making pro- cess has been developed (Castellan et al. , 2014, OFFLU, 2014). Key questions for deci- sion-making on vaccination are: Is a suitable vaccine available? Could one be made available? And how is it to be admin- istered? Decision-making requires assessment of the antigenic characteristics of existing viruses in the field and comparison with available vaccines and vaccine antigens. It also re- quires ongoing monitoring for changes from antigenic drift in existing viruses or the in- troduction of a new strain (e.g. in Indonesia where introduction of a well-matched vaccine was followed by improved control of clade 2.1 viruses and the introduction of clade 2.3.2.1 H5N1 virus in 2012 was followed by introduc-tion of vaccination against this strain). It is preferable to assess vaccines against a number of local viruses as there can be sub- tle differences. This assessment is important in places where the virus has been present for some time and has evolved into differ- ent sublineages (Spackman et al. , 2014). It is also necessary to perform in vitro testing (i.e. cross HI tests using sera from vaccinated poultry versus the vaccine antigen and field antigens), which can also be used for antigen mapping, an aid in antigen selection for inclu- sion in the vaccine (Swayne et al. , 2015). Mul-tivalent vaccines containing different antigens can be used provided appropriate quantities of each antigen are incorporated (that is, at levels equivalent to monovalent vaccines for each antigen). Ultimately, the best test for a killed anti- gen vaccine is a laboratory challenge study under a high biosafety and biosecurity en- vironment using birds vaccinated at three weeks of age and challenged three weeks later. Challenge studies with the circulating field strain(s) should be conducted in places where appropriate facilities are available. It may be possible to obtain relevant informa- tion from other countries that have tested vaccines against similar viruses. If a suitable vaccine is not available it may be necessary to have one manufactured from a local strain of virus (or closely related strain) in facilities using good management practices. In most cases, it is better to have this done by com- panies that specialize in this area; (if several vaccines are to be tested, a system of 'coding' is urged). Use of an unmodified HPAI virus as a seed strain is not generally recommended due to the potential risks from insufficient antigen production or, if zoonotic, to possible occupational hazards. Most vaccine antigens are natural LPAI strains or are HPAI strains genetically modified to become LPAI viruses. The OIE/FAO Network of Expertise on Animal Influenzas (OFFLU) can advise on this pro- cess. 5 Is a vaccine antigen which is a good antigenic match also a good immunogen? Not necessarily. Not all virus strains are equal as immunogens as some appear to stimulate a stronger level of immunity than others. This may be due, in part, to the glycosylation pat- terns of the HA protein. Immunogenic perfor- mance of vaccine antigens is best evaluated in challenge experiments (Zhang et al. , 2015). What types of poultry should be prioritized for vaccination? This is a crucial question. If the main target population is chicken lay- ers or parent flocks then it is possible to de- velop high-level immunity in these birds prior to the point of lay (usually using a three-dose course of vaccine). Poultry vaccination against H5 avian influenza, along with a number of other measures, was implemented in Viet Nam in 2003-2004 to reduce human health risk.\u00a9FAO/C.Y. Gopinath 5 Please contact secretariat@offlu.net6 VOL 10 | MAY 2016Meat birds that live for less than 50 days are not good candidates for use of killed antigen vaccines, as it is not usually possible to obtain high-level immunity with only a single dose of the currently available commercial killed vaccines. However, it may be possible to use hatchery vaccination (i.e. vaccination of day- old chicks) with an appropriate vector vaccine followed by one or more booster doses of killed antigen vaccine, with the first booster usually given two to three weeks later. If a vectored vaccine is used on day-old chicks, it must be able to work in the presence of ma- ternally derived antibodies to the vector and the avian influenza virus. When meat chickens are kept for more than 50 days it is possible to obtain protection by vaccination at around two weeks of age and boost after four weeks. Examples include Chinese-style yellow-feathered birds that are usually reared for at least 70 days before en- tering the consumer market. Vaccination of birds reared by small-scale producers is not normally recommended since maintaining adequate levels of im- munity and instituting significant changes in hygiene practices proves very difficult in settings with a high turnover of poultry given the associated costs of the programme. The exception is in areas where large numbers of human cases are occurring. However, the logistical difficulties of implementing large-scale vaccination across thousands of house- hold flocks must be recognized. In some countries, there are large popula- tions of ducks. Effective vaccines and vaccina- tion schemes for ducks have been more diffi- cult to achieve than for chickens. Vaccination of ducks can reduce viral shedding if there is a very good antigenic match between the vaccine strain and the field strain, and suffi- cient doses of vaccine are administered. Sin- gle dose vaccination does not usually provide appropriate protection from viral shedding. Limited information is available on the effects of vaccines in other poultry species, although some studies have been performed on zoo- logical collections (Koch et al. , 2009).How can existing vaccination programmes be leveraged for vaccination against AI? Most industrially-reared poultry are being vaccinated against other diseases such as Newcastle disease, infectious bursal disease or duck viral enteritis. In these situations, if appropriate systems are in place to ensure these products are delivered to birds and the vaccines are correctly stored along the entire chain, then similar systems can be implement- ed for AI vaccines. Another issue to consider for large poultry flocks is that killed antigen vaccines require injection of individual birds. Can high-level immunity be generated in the target population? One objective of all vaccination programmes is to achieve high-level immunity in vacci- nated flocks. It is usually possible to do so in relatively long-lived poultry, especially when birds are reared on an \"all-in/all-out\" basis. Layers may not generate sufficient levels of immunity during the end stages of their life, which can be further complicated by the hes- itance of farmers to vaccinate birds in lay due to perceived egg production losses. Poor nutrition or the presence of other infectious agents on a farm may influence the immune response generated by vaccines (e.g. concur- rent infection with infectious bursal disease virus can compromise the immune response to avian influenza vaccination). Post-vacci- nation monitoring (PVM) of antibody levels 6 in selected vaccinated flocks should be used to assess the response to vaccination and to make changes to the vaccination programme based on field investigations if levels of immu- nity are lower than expected or required. The number and type of flocks and the number of birds per flock to test will vary from place to place and need to be designed for each pro- gramme by an experienced epidemiologist. The monitoring programme represents only a small part of the overall cost of a vaccination campaign. As a rule, a single dose of a killed antigen vaccine is not sufficient to produce a strong and long-lasting immunity and should only be used for emergency vaccination. 6 Cut-off titres need to be established. As a general rule a titre of 1:32 in chickens against the field strain will prevent mortality and a titre of 1:128 will normally prevent shedding of virus if the birds are subsequently exposed to the virus (Swayne et al. , 2015). A hatchery employee examines recently hatched ducklings.\u00a9FAO/E. Amalore Rwanda - A poultry farmer feeding the chickens on his farm.\u00a9FAO/Isaac Kasamani7 VOL 10 | MAY 2016Issues arise with household-level flocks where there is a high turnover of poultry, which results in a rapid reduction of flock im- munity. This challenge can be overcome with strong local coordination and responsive vet- erinary services so that new poultry are vac- cinated as they reach the appropriate age, as specified in the manufacturer's guidance, and as previously discussed. What percentage of poultry needs to be vac- cinated or immune? Much of the research in this area is theoret- ical and has assumed that the objective of vaccination is virus elimination. In practice, percentage of poultry to be vaccinated de- pends on a number of factors including the current objectives of the control programme, the stage of the vaccination programme and the types of housing and poultry. Vaccine use should induce a sufficiently high level of immunity in the majority of the vaccinated poultry. In general, vaccination should aim to have 70 to 80 percent of birds with acceptable, protective antibody titres. In most cases this will require a minimum of two doses of vaccine (and additional doses in long-lived poultry). \u0098 Potential drawbacks of vaccine use Concerns about silent infection When a vaccinated bird is exposed to a HPAI virus there are three potential results: i) no clinical disease and little to zero quantities of virus are shed; ii) sufficient antibodies to prevent clinical disease but some viral shedding; and iii) full clinical disease (Ku- mar et al. , 2007). When a flock is vaccinated, a range of antibody titres will be developed. If a HPAI virus enters a vaccinated chicken flock, those birds with low or no antibody ti- tres will die if infected, indicating infection in the entire flock. With only a few deaths in this case, infection is more subtle to detect than in non-immune flocks where mortality will be much higher. Many of the so-called silent infections actually occur as unreported mor- talities in these situations. The virus can be detected in infected flocks through dead bird testing on vaccinated farms or, alternatively, through discriminatory sero-logical tests that distinguish antibodies gen-erated via infection in vaccinated birds (DIVA strategy; i.e. detecting infection in vaccinated animals). The former provides more imme- diate information on the infection status of a flock when managed appropriately. Suitable criteria need to be set for alerting veterinary services (e.g. doubling of daily mortality or a >30 percent fall in egg production). These trigger-points are only of use in places where farmers keep flock records - a good practice which is highly recommended. If widespread silent infection is occurring, the vaccine antigen should be examined to assess whether it is still working against cir- culating strains of virus and, if not, a new an- tigen should be developed and used. Concerns regarding vaccination leading to a false sense of security A reduction in farmer notification of out- breaks to veterinary services following intro- duction of vaccination, as was occurring in Egypt (Vergne et al. , 2012), indicates the im- portance of avoiding a false sense of security amongst vaccinated farms. It is important for all involved to recognize that vaccination is not a 'magical solution' and will not solve all problems. Expectations need to be tempered. Appropriate risk communication strategies which highlight that vaccination alone will not prevent all signs of avian influenza infection can help ensure biosecurity measures are continued. At the same time, these commu-nication strategies should promote passive surveillance. In parallel with vaccination, bi- osecurity improvement programmes such as FAO models in Viet Nam and Indonesia (FAO, 2015a; FAO 2015b) can and should be imple- mented. Farmer notification of infected vacci- nated flocks can be encouraged by ensuring appropriate compensation is available if a re- port of disease results in the destruction of a flock, and by setting lower trigger-points that generate an investigation. This requires good cooperation between industry and govern- ment veterinary services. It is highly encouraged to have the veter- inary public sector meet with industry and other poultry producers on a regular basis. Similarly, the veterinary public sector should engage the private professionals to share in-formation and provide guidance. Concerns about impact on trade The effect of vaccination on trade is a genuine concern that needs to be addressed between trading partners, preferably during periods when the disease is not occurring. It has been one of the main factors inhibiting uptake of vaccination, even in emergency situations, (e.g. Thailand and the United States of Ameri- ca), but one that can be overcome with appro- priate surveillance and monitoring systems in place. In countries with minimal export trade (e.g. Indonesia, Viet Nam) the concern remains limited. A backyard chicken flock belonging to a household in the Ukraine. \u00a9FAO/Alexey Filippov8 VOL 10 | MAY 2016Concerns about the development of antigenic variant strains of virus The possibility that antigenic variants could emerge in places where vaccine is being used has been recognized since vaccination was first introduced for Goose/Guangdong-line- age (Gs/GD-lineage) H5N1 HPAI. Circulation of antigenically variant strains may result in insufficient protection of vaccinated flocks and can lead to outbreaks in vaccinated popu- lations. Monitoring of circulating field viruses and vaccine matching is therefore critical. With the exception of China and Indone- sia, which have systems in place for regular updating of vaccine antigens, most develop- ing countries that vaccinate are still building systems for vaccine updates. Progress has been made in identifying antigenic variant viruses in most countries, but the next step of updating vaccine antigens is less well ad-vanced. Both China and Indonesia often have a 12 to 24-month period between emergence of a new strain and production/uptake of a vaccine incorporating the new antigen (as was the case with clade 2.3.4.4 viruses that emerged as an important cause of losses to poultry producers in China from 2013). Genetic changes can potentially enhance human infectivity or virulence and novel anti- genic variant strains need to be identified for pandemic preparedness. Therefore, informa- tion on genetic and antigenic characteristics needs to be shared by national governments with the World Health Organization (WHO) in a timely and regular manner (i.e. at least twice a year) so that they can prepare human vaccine antigens for pandemic preparedness (WHO, 2015). This valuable information can only be obtained if there are appropriate monitoring systems in place to detect virus in poultry in places where vaccine is used. \u0098 Does use of vaccination lead to endemic infection? Perhaps the main concern raised by coun- tries and their agriculture or public health authorities is that use of vaccination may allow viruses to remain endemic or fa- cilitate development of endemic infection because immunity is not sterilizing. 7 Despite being a legitimate concern, it is also impor- tant to recognize that in certain places where vaccination is being applied, the virus would remain endemic even if vaccination was not being used (as was or is the case in China, Egypt, Indonesia and Viet Nam). Vaccination in these places was introduced as a response to endemic or widespread infection. Vaccination can contribute to an endemic situation if the following occur: \u0083Vaccination is not markedly reducing the levels of shedding of virus in vaccinated birds that are exposed to virus (owing to, for example, insufficient vaccine coverage in the target population or area, poor anti- genic match, poor quality vaccine or insuf- ficient doses of vaccine). \u0083Vaccinated flocks are not sufficiently mon-itored. \u0083Farmers do not see any need to report in-creased mortality in vaccinated flocks. \u0083Farmers vaccinate poultry at inappropriate ages. \u0083Farmers mix vaccinated with unvaccinated poultry. \u0083Farmers see vaccination as the answer to all their problems. \u0083Vaccination assists in driving antigenic change, thereby reducing the value of ex- isting vaccines (unless vaccine antigens are regularly updated as needed). \u0083These issues need to be considered and ad-dressed in the design stage of a vaccination strategy. \u0098 Conclusion If used rationally, vaccination can help to control and even eliminate HPAI. Vaccina- tion is not a 'magic solution' that will solve all problems and should be used in conjunction with other control and preventive measures. Unless managed appropriately, it can cause some unintended consequences. Vaccina- tion should be considered by all countries struggling to control HPAI using stamping out alone because it can help to contain the disease and reduce risk of human infection. This document provides an outline of the main issues that need to be considered when contemplating use of vaccination. Additional advice can be obtained directly from FAO or OFFLU. \u0098 7 This means that some vaccinated birds that are subsequently exposed to the virus will still become infected and shed virus.
