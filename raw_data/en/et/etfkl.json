It was dark liquid and i literally use to feel the taste in warm water or in milk and now recently i have ordered for new stock and what i receive is pure disappointment. It is some semi liquid solid form, it has no taste in it. I can feel it has no response in my body. Kindly look into your quality before we shift to some other brand. Womens can use this Is it approved by ayush Very nice product. "}
