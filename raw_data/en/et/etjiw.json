Industry news: FDA Approves Merck's KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab) for Adult and Pediatric with Unresectable or Metastatic, Microsatellite Instability -High (MSI -H) or Mismatch Repair Deficient (dMMR) Solid Tumors Latest News blog article: Unprecedented Drug Approval Can Benefit Pancreatic Cancer Patients Latest News blog article: The Road to Effective Immunotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer Patients Company : Merck, Kenilworth, NJ Major finding : Merck announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab), the company's anti -PD-1 (programmed death receptor -1) therapy, for a first -of-its-kind indication: the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with u nresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability -high or mismatch repair deficient, solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options or colorectal cancer that has progressed followi ng treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan . Immunotherapy Trial Started in Patients with Inoperable Pancreatic Cancer Company : Immunitor Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia Major finding : At least 30 patients with inoperable and chemotherapy -failed pancreatic cancer are expected to be recruited for a 3 -month trial (NCT03165591) of an oral tableted therapeutic 14 vaccine, V3 -P. The main inclusio n criteria are higher than normal baseline levels of CA 19.9 tumor antigen. Based on preliminary evidence the immunotherapy -induced decrease of this surrogate marker is correlated with tumor shrinkage and prolonged survival. CANCER CONTROL, SURVIVORSHIP, AND OUTCOMES RESEARCH A Tale of Two Cancers: Traveling to Treat Pancreatic and Thyroid Cancer Latest News blog article: New Study Reinforces Recommendations that Pancreatic Cancer Patients Travel to Academic Centers for Surgery Journal : Journal of the American College of Surgeons Institution(s) : Endocrine Surgery Research Group, Chicago, IL, and others Corresponding author(s) : Raymon Grogan Major finding : There are improvements in both quality and survival for those traveling to academic centers for their cancer care. In the case o f papillary thyroid carcinoma, this difference in quality did not affect overall survival. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, however, differences in quality translated to a survival advantage.
