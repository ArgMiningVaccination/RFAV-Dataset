Vaccination with PEDIARIX or INFANRIX should be based on consideration of the individual infant's medical status and the potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination - In clinical trials of PEDIARIX and INFANRIX, common adverse reactions were injection-site reactions (pain, redness, and swelling), fever, drowsiness, irritability/fussiness, and loss of appetite. In clinical trials of KINRIX, common adverse reactions were injection-site reactions (pain, redness, increase in arm circumference, and swelling), drowsiness, fever, and loss of appetite - Vaccination with PEDIARIX, INFANRIX, or KINRIX may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR HIBERIX - Contraindications for HIBERIX: severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any H. influenzae type b or tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine or any component of the vaccine is a contraindication to administration of HIBERIX - If Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the decision to give any tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, including HIBERIX, should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks - Syncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, including HIBERIX.
