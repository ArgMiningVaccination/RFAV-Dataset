Naturopathy is a form of healthcare that combines modern treatment with traditional methods with a focus on supporting the body's capacity to heal itself. It is a uniquely natural approach to health and wellness that recognises the holistic integrity of the person, rather than just a small part of them. Unlike many internationally renowned chemical skincare products that require specific formulations for differing skin types and conditions, naturopathic skincare & hair care solutions do not differentiate between skin types or ethnicity. The reason being that our active ingredients are readily recognized by the body and therefore immediately work to supplement each individuals existing needs and deficiencies and as such are effective for every skin type, even the most sensitive. It is the body that determines absorption, not the person that forces it on the body as is the case with almost all chemical beauty products. The result is skin that is fast to improve and with superior ability to maintain itself and exist in a state of heightened natural condition. That \"condition\" is skin at it's most healthy & at its most youthful and beautiful. | |[Shop Now](https://natnatlife.myshopify.com/products/hi-shine-naturopathy-super-shine-mask) PRINCIPLES OF NATUROPATHY The body has an inherent ability to establish, maintain, and restore health. The healing process is ordered and intelligent; nature heals through the response of each individual's vital force to combat physical setbacks and diseases. Naturopathic medicine's role is to facilitate and augment this process, to help remove obstacles to health and recovery, and by supplementing the body with more of what it needs, to support the creation of a healthy internal and external environment. Illness or specific wellness problems do not occur without cause. Underlying causes of disease must be discovered and removed or treated before a person can hope to fully recover. Symptoms are expressions of the body's attempt to heal, but are not the cause of the disease. Symptoms therefore should not be suppressed by treatment. Causes may occur on many levels including, physical, mental or emotional. Naturopathic treatments direct solutions at root causes rather than symptomatic expression. Illness is a purposeful process of our body. The process of healing includes the generation of symptoms which are an expression of each individual's life force attempting to heal itself. Therapeutic actions should be complimentary to, and synergistic with, this healing process. The physician's actions can support or antagonize the activity of this vital force. Therefore, methods designed to suppress symptoms without removing underlying causes as is the case with many chemically bound programmes are considered harmful and are either wholly avoided or severely minimised. Health and disease are conditions of the whole organism, involving a complex interaction of physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social and other factors. Naturopathic medicine believes that the 'whole' person must be treated by taking all these factors into account. The harmonious functioning of all aspects of the individual is essential to \"recovery from\" and \"prevention of\" disease, and requires a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment. | |[Shop Now](https://natnatlife.myshopify.com/products/mayaltha-better-legs-firming-detoxifying-serum) No better commentary exists on the fallacy espoused so widely and so convincingly by all of the large cosmetic houses, than that of famed American writer and beauty commentator Paula Begoun in her book:-The Beauty Bible. She writes: \"Do not buy skin care products based on your skin type. I know that statement sounds strange, but there are several reasons for this rule. It is not necessarily because your skin type is not what you think it is. It's even possible that your skin type has been created by the very products you are already using. For instance soap can severely dry the skin, overly emollient moisturizers can clog pores and cause blemishes, and alcohol based toners can severely irritate the skin and cause dryness while doing nothing to change oil production (that can create classic 'combination skin'). Treat the skin you have today, not the skin you had last month or last week or yesterday! Skin type can and will fluctuate. Skin-care routines based on a specific skin type don't take into consideration the fact that your skin changes according to the season, your emotions, the climate (humidity, dryness, cold, heat - all affect your skin), and of course your menstrual cycle. Pay attention to what your skin tells you it needs at any given time. This month you may need extra-moisturising sunscreen during the day and more emollient night time moisturizer. Next month you may only need a lightweight sunscreen with no moisturiser at night. Does that mean you have two skins...of course not! The same is true for oily skins - it just means adapting your routine flexibly according to your skin's current needs. Indeed many skin-care problems are caused by the very skin-care products sold to prevent them. Overly emollient products sold for dry skins can clog pores, products designed to control oily skins often actually contain ingredients that can in the long term make skin oilier and many skin-care products contain chemical irritants that can end up causing a whole range of problems. In conclusion, do not hold fast to the idea that your skin fits squarely into and remains only one type - it changes constantly!\" Our naturopathy skin care products add to your skin exactly what it needs and furthermore already recognizes, and allows it to absorb just the right quantity of product to help balance the inefficiency that your skin is experiencing at that particular moment in time - bringing alive into practical reality all four of the core principles of naturopathy that we so espouse.
