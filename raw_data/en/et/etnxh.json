Naturopathy is a distinct primary health care system that blends modern scientific knowledge with traditional and natural forms of medicine. It is based on the healing power of nature and it supports and stimulates the body's ability to heal itself. Naturopathy is the art and science of disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention using natural therapies including: dietetics, botanical medicine, clinical nutrition, hydrotherapy, homeopathy, fasting, naturopathic manipulation, traditional Chinese medicine/acupuncture, exercise, lifestyle counselling, detoxification and chelation, environmental assessment and adjustment, spiritual healing, health promotion and disease prevention. What do Naturopaths do? Naturopaths help you get to the root underlying causes of your health issues and guide you on the changes you need to make in order to get well. They may offer advice on dietary changes, lifestyle changes, and guidance on emotional wellbeing. They may be able to give you treatment such as osteopathy, naturopathic manipulation, acupuncture or massage if they are suitably trained. They may also prescribe natural remedies such as herbs, homeopathy or nutritional supplements. Why choose a GCRN Registered Naturopath?

Naturopathy helps people with all forms of health concerns \u2014 from pediatric to geriatric, from acute (recent sudden onset) to chronic (long standing) illness and from the physical to the psychological. Naturopathy is beneficial for the following types of patients: - People who are looking for disease prevention and health promotion strategies - People who have a range of symptoms that they have been unable to address on their own or with the help of other medical practitioners - People who have been diagnosed with an illness, often serious or chronic and are looking for supportive treatment options. Naturopathy is very effective for improving quality of life for those with serious and life threatening illnesses - People who are looking to combine conventional and naturopathic treatments with the aim of minimizing side effects of drugs, surgery or medical treatments. How does Naturopathy differ from conventional medicine? The primary differences between naturopathic and conventional medicine are the philosophical approach and the therapies used. Naturopaths (NDs) help people by treating them as individuals and by addressing the physical, environmental, lifestyle, attitudinal, and emotional aspects of health. This allows naturopaths to find and treat the cause of the disease using a variety of therapies. Conventional doctors generally address and treat the symptoms of disease and use pharmaceutical therapies or surgery. How Does Naturopathy compare with Functional Medicine? Functional Medicine is the modern equivalent in many ways to Naturopathy. Many Naturopaths practice as functional medicine practitioners. Functional Medicine is a term which became popular in America for those combining modern science with Naturopathic principles. The UK based Naturopath tends to have a broader perspective than a pure Functional Medicine practitioner in that they are likely to also take into account the emotional health and the posture of the person. Working with other medical professionals Naturopaths are very willing to work alongside other health professionals such as your GP. "}
