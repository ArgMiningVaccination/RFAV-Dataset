A campaign based on pseudo-science and misinformation has brought the return of the measles to the US and Europe and prevented many children from receiving HPV vaccines for cervical cancer. In addition, the convergence of wars, political conflicts and climate change are causing a rise in preventable illnesses in developing countries. To understand the anti-vax movement and debunk the myths tied to this potential public health crisis, hear from Dr. Peter Hotez, Professor of Pediatrics and Molecular Virology and Microbiology at Texas Children's Hospital. Dr. Hotez will virtually share his concept of a new \"vaccine diplomacy\" and his own personal story of raising a child with autism. Dr. Hotez is an elected member of both the National Academy of Medicine and American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and the author of 500 scientific papers. Link This is a free virtual event.
