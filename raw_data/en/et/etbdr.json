However, while human acupuncture point locations have remained largely consistent over time, the veterinary versions remain imprecise and variable. Establishing anatomical criteria for veterinary acupuncture atlases in keeping with the human template will create congruence across species, benefiting both research and practice. Anatomic criteria for points based on objectively verifiable structures will facilitate translational research. Functionally comparative innervation, in particular, should be similar between species, as the nerves initiate and mediate physiologic changes that result from point stimulation. If researchers choose points that activate different nerves in one species than in another, unpredictable outcomes may occur. Variability in point placement will impede progress and hamper the ability of researchers and clinicians to make meaningful comparisons across species. This paper reveals incongruities that remain between human and veterinary acupuncture points, illustrating the need to analyze anatomical characteristics of each point to assure accuracy in selecting transpositional acupuncture locations.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2012-08-29", "cleaned_text": "One Medicine, One Acupuncture [https://doi.org/10.3390/ani2030395](https://doi.org/10.3390/ani2030395) [Combination of Western and Chinese Medicine in Veterinary Science]( /journal/animals/special_issues/west_chin_med )) Abstract: Simple Summary Abstract 1. Communication Channels [4](#B4-animals-02-00395), [5](#B5-animals-02-00395), [6](#B6-animals-02-00395)]. The \"One Medicine\" ideal would eliminate the fragmentation that separates private practitioners from academicians in their \"silos of specialists\". It also lessens the gap that artificially divides physicians and veterinarians. Similarly, the nascent \"One Acupuncture\" paradigm invites contributions from researchers, clinicians, and practicing acupuncturists who share a common language of science and a unified vision to improve healthcare for all, whether their species focus is human or nonhuman. Like One Medicine, One Acupuncture supports efforts to better understand the pros and cons of various interventions across species, promoting advancements through critical assessment of translational techniques. For example, while human acupuncture research on spinal cord injury is somewhat lacking, several studies have examined the value of acupuncture for dogs with similar conditions [ [7](#B7-animals-02-00395), [8](#B8-animals-02-00395), [9](#B9-animals-02-00395)]. Thus, information derived from one species receiving acupuncture for the treatment of naturally occurring disease may provide insights for applications to other species, facilitating recovery, reducing costs of medical care, and leading to a better quality of life. 3. Promoting Safety with a \"One Acupuncture\" Framework [10](#B10-animals-02-00395)]. Modeled after Japanese needle embedding, those who practice gold bead implantation permanently embed tens, hundreds, or thousands of metal fragments into tissue and around joints [ [11](#B11-animals-02-00395), [12](#B12-animals-02-00395)]. The original technique involved severing acupuncture needles at the skin level to provide \"permanent acupuncture\". In the mid-1970s, veterinary acupuncturists in North America decided to modify the technique and place small bits of gold wire deep into tissue through a long spinal needle. They renamed the procedure \"gold bead therapy\". Veterinarians now may more commonly implant sterile or nonsterile stainless steel \"beads\" and gold-plated magnets [ [13](#B13-animals-02-00395)]. [14](#B14-animals-02-00395)].\" Even as far back as 1976, the Japanese Acupuncture and Moxibustion Association (JAMA) tried to prohibit the practice. For those who did not cease needle implantation, JAMA commented, \"Some practitioners do not abide by the recommendation and are ignorant of the results of malpractice.\" Authors from a 2007 report in Chest stated, \"Migration of embedded acupuncture needles is associated with life-threatening consequences. The practice of embedding acupuncture needles is now considered malpractice and is discouraged by professional acupuncture associations [ [15](#B15-animals-02-00395)].\" Another author claimed that many more injuries appear in the Japanese literature but the language barrier has prevented this information from becoming more readily known [ [16](#B16-animals-02-00395)]. [Figure 1](#animals-02-00395-f001)(a,b). Clinically, because only a thin layer of muscle covers the human rim, an acupuncturist expects to encounter hard resistance when the needle meets bone beneath Triple Heater 23 (TH 23, Si Zhu Kong, \"Silken Bamboo Hollow\"). For example, see the cross section of the human skull at the level of TH 23 in [Figure 2](#animals-02-00395-f002)). If an acupuncturist expected to reach bone at this site in a dog when needling TH 23, s/he may insert the needle too deeply and penetrate the globe. [17](#B17-animals-02-00395)]); (b) This overlay image of the dog reveals the relationship of the skull to a dog's external features. Note the hiatus of the orbit between GB 1 and the site just ventral to TH 23. (Image courtesy of Narda G. Robinson, DO, DVM, MS and Colorado State University). [17](#B17-animals-02-00395)]). 4. Science as the Foundation for One Acupuncture [18](#B18-animals-02-00395), [19](#B19-animals-02-00395), [20](#B20-animals-02-00395), [21](#B21-animals-02-00395)]. Reliable neuromodulation across species requires similar nerve activation which, in turn, results from consistency in acupuncture point location parameters. 5. How Does Needling Influence Nerves? [22](#B22-animals-02-00395)]. Densely concentrated cutaneous receptors live adjacent to the bases of fingernails on fingers and toes where \"ting\" or \"jing-well\" points reside. Another highly sensitive location rich with autonomic fibers is Governor Vessel 26 (GV 26, Shui Gou or \"Water Trough\") in the philtrum below the nose. 6. Acupuncture Effects and the Central Nervous System [23](#B23-animals-02-00395), [24](#B24-animals-02-00395)]. The signal ascends to the brain and activates or deactivates key centers such as the limbic system, cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem [ [25](#B25-animals-02-00395), [26](#B26-animals-02-00395)]. Shifts in autonomic tone affect output to the digestive and cardiopulmonary systems. Researchers have traced long-loop pathways from points such as Pericardium 6 (PC 6, Nei Guan or \"Inner Pass\"), over the median nerve, to the rostral ventrolateral the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, the gray area the midbrain, and the medullary raphe [ [27](#B27-animals-02-00395), [28](#B28-animals-02-00395)]. In order to compare outcomes of PC 6 stimulation in various species, one should first ensure accurate location of the median nerve and similar relationships with surrounding antebrachial anatomy. The same approach should be followed for every nerve-point dyad of the other 360+ points extrapolated from human to non-human anatomy over the past several decades. Traditional Chinese veterinary medical (TCVM) points, discussed more fully below, would not qualify for a cross-species comparative anatomy investigation because ancient veterinary points shifted considerably in location and number as time progressed while the human system remained relatively consistent [ [1](#B1-animals-02-00395)]. For example, as late as 1604, equine charts listed a mere one dozen points [ [29](#B29-animals-02-00395)], whereas the human set of points exceeds 360. 7. Sources of Confusion in Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medical (TCVM) Point Locations [Figure 3](#animals-02-00395-f003).) On the other hand, TCVM practitioners may variably place GV 20 at the lumbosacral space and refer to the site as either GV 20b or Bai Hui [ [30](#B30-animals-02-00395), [31](#B31-animals-02-00395), [32](#B32-animals-02-00395), [33](#B33-animals-02-00395)]. Studies where researchers included Bai Hui for analgesia may only refer to the name but not provide the anatomical location, specifying either a cranial or lumbosacral site [ [34](#B34-animals-02-00395)]. Making matters worse, some have equated Bai Hui with Governor Vessel 5 (GV 5, Xuan Shu or \"Suspended Pivot\"), located between the first and second lumbar vertebrae [ [35](#B35-animals-02-00395)]. Obviously, it becomes difficult to \"make heads or tails\" out of veterinary acupuncture anatomy when a point such as Bai Hui could be placed on the head, nearer to the tail, or somewhere in between. [Figure 4](#animals-02-00395-f004)shows the myriad placements of Bai Hui in the nonhuman animal. [17](#B17-animals-02-00395)]). [36](#B36-animals-02-00395)]. As Panzer noted, \"Although [TCVM and transpositional] practitioners generally agree that most of the zangfu association points can be designated to the urinary bladder channel where it courses along the back, they widely disagree as to the specific placement of the points along this channel [ [1](#B1-animals-02-00395)].\" For example, association points for the equine large intestine have been located at the 17th intercostal space in the TCVM system but at the L4 level in certain transpositional atlases, more in keeping with the human location. The TCVM association point for kidney is placed at L5 in comparison to the transpositional L3 location for horses and L2 for humans. TCVM atlases may omit an association point for the heart entirely or instead locate it over the ascending pectoral muscles. Panzer continues, \"The numerous differences among modern [TCVM] charts probably arose through the many centuries of Chinese history, as different charts developed in isolated geographical areas. The discrepancies among [TCVM] charts involve different names given for a specific location, varying locations described for a given point name, and descriptions of points that are particular to some charts and absent from others [ [1](#B1-animals-02-00395)].\" [1](#B1-animals-02-00395), [37](#B37-animals-02-00395)]. However, humans have one point linked to one organ; currently, veterinarians might learn two or more, depending on whether they follow the transpositional, TCVM, or other acupuncture atlases. 8. Additional Veterinary Acupuncture Points in Question 8.1. Head 8.1.1. Maxilla [38](#B38-animals-02-00395)], instead of \"Sibai\" (Four Whites). Needling Sanjiang instead of Sibai will derive different effects, as one penetrates a large vein and the other accesses a notable sensory nerve. Should one attempt to replicate a human or rodent study [ [39](#B39-animals-02-00395)] that examined the effects of needling ST 2, an equine veterinarian selecting the TCVM-style ST 2 would miss the mark by several centimeters. This may confound the outcomes and lead to mistaken interpretations. 8.1.2. Temporal Fossa [Figure 5](#animals-02-00395-f005)illustrates the relationship of these points to the temporalis muscle. [17](#B17-animals-02-00395)]). 8.1.3. Ear [40](#B40-animals-02-00395)]. More recently, researchers have asserted that auricular acupuncture works through cranial and upper cervical nerve stimulation, as the pinna carries a rich sensory nerve supply. Perhaps most importantly, the auricular branch of the vagus nerve supplies the auricular concha and the external auditory meatus as well as tissue linking the internal and external parts of the ear. Stimulation of regions supplied by this branch influence parasympathetic tone; functionally, this territory overlaps with the organs contained within the imaginary inverted fetus adopted by auriculotherapists [ [41](#B41-animals-02-00395), [42](#B42-animals-02-00395)]. [43](#B43-animals-02-00395), [44](#B44-animals-02-00395)]. 8.2. Axial and Pelvic Limbs [46](#B46-animals-02-00395)]. However, most end-points of the channels that have typically been placed on the acral equine digit neither structurally nor functionally correspond to those found in the human [ [47](#B47-animals-02-00395)]. [Figure 6](#animals-02-00395-f006)offers an example of the number of points from two digits, the thumb and forefinger, that lack a rational reason to exist in the horse due to comparative anatomy characteristics. [17](#B17-animals-02-00395)]). 8.4. Myofascial Trigger Points [48](#B48-animals-02-00395)]. Myofascial trigger points affect nearly everyone at some point during their lives, causing poorly localized, regional, aching pain in the muscles and joints [ [49](#B49-animals-02-00395)]. Simons et al., define a myofascial trigger point as: \"a hyperirritable spot in skeletal muscle that is associated with a hypersensitive palpable nodule in a taut band\" [ [49](#B49-animals-02-00395)]. Concomitant dysfunctions include weakness, stiffness, restricted range of motion, and sometimes proprioceptive disturbances, sleep disorders, and autonomic dysfunction. [49](#B49-animals-02-00395)]. Veterinary patients may develop trigger points after trauma, disc injury, surgery, and when over-exercising during rehabilitation. Dogs who run for long distances on hard surfaces or who must exercise beyond their capacity are prone to trigger point development and irritation. Individuals who lack daily moderate exercise and then are exposed to highly strenuous bouts are more prone to develop trigger points than those who exercise on a regular basis [ [50](#B50-animals-02-00395)]. Precipitating factors in horses include improper foot care, poor saddle fit, repetitive strain movements, excessive activity, and sustained confinement. Myofascial trigger points in the equine patient can cause recurring lameness, a sore back, and loss of flexibility [ [51](#B51-animals-02-00395), [52](#B52-animals-02-00395)]. [53](#B53-animals-02-00395), [54](#B54-animals-02-00395)], the close correspondence between acupuncture point locations and trigger point locations bespeaks an acknowledgement by ancient acupuncturists of the latter's existence. According to some, a majority of trigger points coincide with acupuncture points, although this is controversial [ [55](#B55-animals-02-00395)]. [56](#B56-animals-02-00395)]. The presence and distribution of trigger points across species relates to not only weight-bearing characteristics but also to the unique activities and environmental pressures to which members of that species are exposed. [51](#B51-animals-02-00395)] (although horses lack the gallbladder organ, they still have been endowed with a Gallbladder channel trajectory. This shows the limitations of the current alphanumeric naming system of channels. The original nomenclature referred to the body surface channels traversed and not an organ. Thus, the original name for the Gallbladder channel of \"Shao Yang of the Leg\" referred to a channel that traveled along the lateral aspect of the body, running from head to pelvic limb. It is unclear when or why the channels were paired with organs, but the result has led to misunderstandings and misplaced trust in the ability of all or most points along the channel to benefit the organ affiliate. For example, only one (GB 24) of the forty-four GB points clearly relates to the actual gallbladder or, in the case of the horse, perhaps instead hepatobiliary activities. However, most of the myofascial features, nerves, and vessels associated with the GB line in the human appear in nonhumans, including horses. GB points play prominently in equine pain treatments but their names introduce confusion. A better approach may be reverting to the body surface names for the channels instead of organ associations). [51](#B51-animals-02-00395)]. 9. Conclusions [17](#B17-animals-02-00395)] in terms of where, if at all, corresponding sites exist in the nonhuman. The next step will involve performing translational research that examines the physiologic outcomes that arise from stimulating similar points in more than one species.
