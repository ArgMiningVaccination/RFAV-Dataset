Sample Schedule Day 1 (Saturday): Day 2 (Sunday): - Settling in. Morning meeting for introductions, supplement distribution and schedule review. Cleanse begins at 6PM Day 3 - 6 (Monday - Friday): - Specially Prepared Cleansing Juices - Health and Healing Curriculum Presentations - Daily Group Meetings and Discussion Special Activities: - Private Tour of the Farm - Private Yoga and Meditation - Evening Art Programs FAQ The Cleansing Retreat prepares you for your arrival at The Ranch and will teach you to modify your lifestyle for sustainability after your stay. Therefore, before, during and after your stay, you will receive the ultimate care and support. The primary benefit of this program is the metabolic and cellular resetting that occurs. The cells and organs of the body will also have the chance to release stored toxins and to restore their ability to absorb vital nutrients with greater efficiency. People who give themselves the time for such a program will immediately feel better, more energetic and clearer of mind. They will also experience immense release psycho-emotionally, and feel an uplifted mood. ART is a gentle technique that employs the principles of quantum physics to identify sources of disharmony that are at the root of health issues and then find remedies to restore one's state of health. It resembles the technique of applied kinesiology (familiar to many as muscle testing), but is more reliable and reproducible in its design as it uses a second practitioner to remove bias. In one session, approximately 1 hour, underlying conditions and their sources are identified and specific food and natural supplements are testing that allow the body to heal. Any previous participant in a RLP Cleanse Program or partner accompanying a \"veteran\" who understand the metabolic rigors and demands of a juice fast Any adult who has done a 3-day green juice fast within the past 3 years Any adult (over 18 and under 65 years) who has no significant medical history and is not on any medications that would be affected by fasting. Those on medications or important underlying medical conditions can apply, but they will need to be fully screened by Dr. Finkelstein before registration is finalized. All would be prepped for the program itself by Dr. Michael Finkelstein once registered. We will supply you everything you need to support the cleansing process - skin and tongue brush, enzymes, probiotics and mineral support, as well as water bottles and a journal. Therefore, comfortable clothes, chemical and fragrance-free sundry items for personal use are all that is required. The juices are primarily made of cucumber, kale, fennel, celery, parsley, cilantro and dandelion greens. Lemon juice and natural salt are added for balance. Other herbs, such as ginger, turmeric, and cayenne can be added to taste. Each guest will receive 64 oz. of freshly prepared organic juice daily. The majority of the ingredients are sourced from The Ranch's six-acre organic farm, Tres Estrellas. You will be served 4 green juices a day. Most people are strong enough to complete the program successfully. In fact, for many who have a chronic medical condition, this can be quite valuable. That said, if you have an acute medical condition (active infection, unstable blood pressure or blood sugar, medications in the process of being titrated, aggressive cancer or other serious debilitating syndromes), this may not be for you. Please read our Health Disclaimer, which is more descriptive and specific. If you have any questions, we will put you in touch with Dr. Michael Finkelstein. Still, everyone is advised to speak to their primary physician, and have a waiver signed to make sure that there is nothing underneath the surface that will complicate and interfere with your experience. There are many common medications that can be continued safely during a fast, such as thyroid medications. And, there are others that can be discontinued for the week or two around a fast program, such as mild pain medications. However, medications that work by maintaining stricter blood levels are not easy to regulate during a fast. Examples of such medications include: anti-coagulants, anti-seizure, blood pressure, blood sugar, and psychotropic medication. If you are on any of these a fast program without access to your regular doctor may not be advisable. Should you have any questions please converse with both your doctor and Dr. Michael Finkelstein. Most people feel quite well during the majority of the program period. The initial \"transition days\" and the days following the fast period itself are filled with excitement and great energy. There may be periods during fasting where people exhibit symptoms such as \"slowness\" and low energy, along with some achiness. These are usually transient. Most feel uplifted and have a surprising amount of energy during the fast. We will be guiding people individually to prevent as many symptoms of \"detox\" as possible, as well as to instruct individuals carefully about how much energy to expend, i.e. activities that require a certain amount of endurance, how to stay properly hydrated, etc. Overall, the program is designed to support the body's natural cleansing mechanisms. The juice ingredients, as an example, promote the clearance of toxins from the various organs. Enemas, colonics, skin brushing, far-infrared saunas, breathing exercises, body-mind and energy treatments, will be programmed into the process. The support of the group itself, and the leadership of a highly-qualified team will round out the process. While you will be eager to eat after the fast, be aware that your body will take some time to become efficient at this. For the two or three days immediately following the fast, you should graduate to more complex food groups and quantities. The first meal we will share might be an \"apple\". This is the perfect way to increase your awareness about food and its value. Eat mindfully and pledge to be mindful about what you consume. Eat slowly, enjoy your food and choose peace during your meals.The second and third meals should be a simple salad (raw vegetables only), in small quantity, e.g. one bowl. It is not unusual to feel a little tired and \"slow\" for up to two weeks. We recommend that you continue to drink a lot of water. It is reasonable, as well, to continue to make juice regularly, e.g. daily in the morning or in place of dinner. We encourage patience and mindfulness \u2014 enjoying how mellow you are and how your body feels. You can gradually increase your activity toward normal as you are able. For planning purposes, it is reasonable to anticipate the need for some modifications about two weeks after the program. While people use the word fast to refer to the process of cleansing and detoxification, the actual experience is slow. Taking this time for yourself is a gift beyond measure as it allows for a complete recovery to the state of balance that is essential for your health. It is our intention to provide the most intelligent and supportive environment for you to receive these benefits and propel you forward in your own evolution on every level \u2014 mental, emotional and spiritual, as well as the physical. The program includes follow up with Dr. Finkelstein personally to guide each participant home and beyond. Healing Process The Ranch philosophy of health and well-being supports our natural healing process, one that assists the body in healing itself-a process that is eminently built in and natural. All forms of holistic health care follow innate principles for self-healing and restoring balance to the whole being. Much as the cycles of nature govern how the earth renews itself, the human body also needs to cleanse and relax before renewing and reactivating once again. Our treatment programs align with these natural cycles. To make the most out of your visit, we encourage you to schedule cleansing treatments at the beginning of the week, continue mid-week with treatments that relax and restore, and opt for ones that energize during the last day or two before you depart.

For most with stable medical conditions, the Rancho La Puerta Fasting and Detoxification program will not only be possible, but may be extremely useful in reducing symptoms and increasing vitality and overall health.
